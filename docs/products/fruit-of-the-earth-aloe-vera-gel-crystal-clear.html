            <li>I burned the top of my hand, a friend mention putting Aloe Vera on the burn would be the best for the burn.</li>
            <li>Loving it!</li>
            <li>Excellent product for so many things.  </li>

            <li>This brand is easily the best.</li>
            <li>This stuff is so good .....</li>
            <li>really good deal.</li>
            <li>This is also good for any cuts, burns, and sunburns.</li>
            <li>Fruit of the Earth ruined a perfectly good product,it is not 100% aloe vera gel.</li>
            <li>This item is as good as the aloe gel I used to buy, but still it&#x27;s inexpensive and can moisturize my skin on legs and arms.</li>
            <li>Really good - it also helps with irritation of the skin and psoriasis.</li>
            <li>I often hear aloe is a good home rash treatment.</li>
            <li>It has no alcohol which is good because I&#x27;ve tried the trader joes aloe and that brand contains alcohol which ended up burning my rash and proabably made things worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The 24 oz bottle is a good size for the money.</li>
            <li>Yet good stuff works for all my needs.</li>
            <li>Good value and good quality.</li>
            <li>Good for applying to the skin as a lotion good also as a shaving gel.</li>
            <li>I have used this for years, loved it</li>
            <li>so I think if you want a product that you do not want to refrigerate, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>I use it as a moisturizer and it works fairly well for that.</li>
            <li>A good product at a good price,</li>
            <li>Really good for skin after a day in the sun.</li>
            <li>Good Product.</li>
            <li>Good price and delivery.</li>
            <li>On the good side, you get a lot for your money and the bottle is a sturdy well-made pump style that I can reuse.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, just came with a cracked lid.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also good for treating sunburn.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because I had heard about it as a good styling agent/hair product.</li>
            <li>The quality is always good.</li>
            <li>Good aloe.  </li>
            <li>good price.</li>
            <li>: AVG is almost as good as coconut oil at adding moisture and shine to my hair.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t tried aloe, this is a good item to try.  </li>
            <li>fair price for good product</li>
            <li>We loved it.</li>
            <li>Feels good and smells good</li>

            <li>It is good on a rash.</li>
            <li>One good thing about it</li>
            <li>Works good on the face,skin and hair.</li>
            <li>Good price for 100% Aloe Vera Gel</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe ANYBODY would leave a good review.</li>
            <li>Bought this item because I heard it was good for razor burn.  </li>
            <li>Quality was good.  </li>
            <li>This is  good product and I will buy it again</li>
            <li>Good product,</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get it why put this toxin in something that is supposed to be good for us and misdirect labeling?</li>
            <li>Good for me</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is the best aloe vera gel i&#x27;ve had, but it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>This product smells great and is good for many uses including hair.</li>
            <li>This gel is very good, light an not at all sticky like some I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>more concern is the addition of the perservatives/antimicrobials DMDM Hydantoin and Diazolidinyl Urea; these chemicals work by releasing Formaldehyde into the product, which kills any microbes and is great for the product but not so great for you, because Formaldehyde is a potent carcinogen as well as an irritant that can cause allergic reactions.</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful cooling sensation, is not sticky,hydrates the skin beautifully and reduces redness, scars, and works near miracles on cuts and scrapes.  </li>
            <li>Very glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the product and would tell everyone who is receiving radiation treatments to use this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for use on skin and hair for healing of damaged hair, scars on the skin, for maintaining healthy skin and hair.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also no reaction with my scalp and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of this and it has great health benefits too.</li>
            <li>MY hair is growing and I&#x27;m very satisfied because the rogaine didn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li>I use this as hair gel it works great to keep my scalp healthy.</li>
            <li>A great product with many usages.</li>
            <li>love the pump, great size and works well.</li>

            <li>I am very pleased to see it&#x27;s available on amazon and will be ordering some soon!!</li>
            <li>This product is the best thing on a man&#x27;s face after a shave, and works great as a natural hair gel.</li>
            <li>So many uses for good aloe at a good price.</li>

            <li>You&#x27;ll probably wonder, as I did, if this stuff will CAUSE more problems than it CURES!</li>
            <li>it has many function, i use it every day!</li>
            <li>I have acne - still!- and this is probably the gentlest, most effective thing I have ever used on my skin!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love me some aloe!</li>
            <li>Great price and easy service...just don&#x27;t ever discontinue this needy item.</li>
            <li>This is the best buy I have ever found for pure aloe vera gel.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my daughter&#x27;s hair neat and amazing.  </li>
            <li>Makes a great chemical free hair gel</li>
            <li>Aloe Vera is amazing and this brand delivers in term of price and performance</li>
            <li>It was absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li>This product is good for everything love this product</li>
            <li>this is nice.</li>
            <li>Also saying its 100% gell is kind of a misnomer as it contains preservatives and some Aloe Vera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll say when I mix this with shea butter, my hair develops a nice curl pattern with an overnight twist out.  </li>
            <li>The hand pump is nice too</li>
            <li>Excellent for scars - it really does heal the skin leaving the scar almost non-existent.</li>
            <li>The excellent qualities of this product are very well known.</li>
            <li>A good buy for sure.</li>
            <li>I will be looking for another product that does not contain chemicals or growing my own Aloe Vera plant.</li>
            <li>Nice packaging too, like the pump.</li>
            <li>handy, nice after sun lotion..</li>
            <li>This stuff is nice, I use it in homemade hair gel.</li>
            <li>Nice pump bottle.</li>
            <li>So I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.   </li>
            <li>A necessity making your own lotion and etc.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thirdly, Face / Pimples: I make my own face mask, but I was still breaking out a bit.</li>
            <li>I bought this item to make my own alcohol-free hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend and I are making our own hand sanitizer with this aloe</li>
            <li>oh so nice.</li>
            <li>Nice to find aloe that has not been dyed</li>
            <li>which is nice.  </li>
            <li>It goes on kind of sticky, but as it dries, the stickiness goes away.</li>
            <li>the price is wonderful for how much you get.</li>
            <li>good product, I love that it&#x27;s made in the U.S.A.</li>
            <li>Feels nice and cooling on the skin.</li>
            <li>, I leave it on the bathroom counter, and the pump is handy.</li>
            <li>This particular bottle size (24oz) is an excellent value.</li>
            <li>However, I am so excited to be able to use my nuface again!!</li>
            <li>It applies easily and makes my skin feel good without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s something in the gel that is very strong.</li>
            <li>holds just fine, but if you run your hands through it will soften up immediately like a mousse...and good for you&#x27;re hair and scalp to boot.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to the folks at Fruit of the Earth for a very good product (in my opinion).</li>
            <li>i use it for my skin and it also works as a wonderful conditioner for my dreadlocks as it is completely natural.</li>
            <li>Best of all, once the gel has rubbed-out, her hair is still soft.  </li>
            <li>Aloe vera is the best, some people might say you can get it from natural aloe vera plant, but i can use this as body lotion too.</li>
            <li>I grow my own Aloe Vera but needed a more convenient application manner.  </li>
            <li>I use it for my hands and it&#x27;s a really good light hair Gel.</li>
            <li>More than that, I use it on my face every day instead of any kind of moisture cream.</li>
            <li>Excellent, natural way to get immediate relief from irritated skin, rash or sunburn.  </li>
            <li>Nice product, you must give a shot :)...</li>
            <li>I liked this product, but not some of the ingredients, and I know you can do better.</li>
            <li>I have had great success using this stuff as an aftershave, in hair masks, body moisturizer, hair gel, eyebrow gel, and of course for rashes and wounds.</li>
            <li>By far the best aloe vera gel I have found for my needs.</li>
            <li>The girlfriend said the clear stuff is the best, I have to agree.</li>
            <li>Great for making my products and at the right price</li>
            <li>now with a pump top even better... love it!</li>
            <li>I use the aloe gel for everything from sunburn to hair gel to aftershave protection, so finding a large bottle like this, especially at a great price, is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>NIce big botte of wonderful aloe vera.  </li>
            <li>Its light, not sticky, great for sensitive or irritated skin and smells great.</li>
            <li>- I settle for the cheap stuff too and this really deserves a good review because it&#x27;s a GREAT product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since made another batch of body cream using Fruit of the Earth Aloe Gel, and as with my first batch, it turned out great.</li>
            <li>Keeps everything nice and clean and smelling nice without chemicals - very important to me.  </li>
            <li>Also, although the label boldly proclaims \\&quot;NO ALCOHOL\\&quot;, you will find that one of the ingredients is INDEED a \\&quot;tri-alcohol\\&quot;!!</li>
            <li>With this use, I can say that my face looks like that of a 410 something and very smooth.</li>
            <li>Not icky, not sticky, just nice and a great price too.  </li>
            <li>I grow my own aloe, easy.</li>
            <li>It is also good for sunburn and seems to help bruises heal more quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a fine product in my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li>this is amazing for a quick overnight pimple treatment!</li>
            <li>Fantastic product for your skin and perfect for natural lubrication!</li>
            <li>This product works great on my hair and I like the large bottle.</li>
            <li>A great product of pure aloe with no additives, cooling and efficacious.</li>
            <li>Just pure aloe, is great.</li>
            <li>wonderful price, great value and 100% pure aloe is the only type I buy.</li>
            <li>Also, the bottle is huge!</li>
            <li>Its more like hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many brands of aloe vera over the decades.</li>
            <li>Either way, I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>

            <li>and I got through my treatments with nothing more than a rozy glow from the radiation.</li>
            <li>Love this, and will buy this again and again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;IT DOES.... make sure it&#x27;s 100% Aloe Vera with no added colors as this can damage some machines....</li>
            <li>:)    </li>
            <li>This stuff has so many purposes.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this aloe vera gel.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I will come across more</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>However this aloe seems to have a better consistency and smell then the dollar store kinds.</li>
            <li>Awesome product at a tiny cost.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love using Aloe Vera.  </li>
            <li>I have found that radical changes to my diet have had the most beneficial and long-term results on my health.</li>

            <li>I use this for many years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to most everything but also.</li>
            <li>I would say that is a ok product coz it does make your skin more softer&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>IT HAS MANY ADDITIVES.  </li>
            <li>Pleased the way it is working now.</li>
            <li>and I use it in many ways.</li>
            <li>I love using it on my eyebrows</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and cannot find it in Walgreen&#x27;s.  </li>

            <li>And it also cheap!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a decade and still love it.  </li>
            <li>I bought Fruit of the Earth Aloe Gel many years ago.  </li>
            <li>and I had to find a spare top to use instead</li>
            <li>I love the product but the pump doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Aloe vera gel is excellent for burns and for the topical use on sking.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a bit more of a pain.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the next best thing to growing an Aloe Vera plant.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>

            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Has more than 1 purpose in our household.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I decided to give this a try as many naturals mention it on their blogs and vlogs.</li>
            <li>This product is ok, but I&#x27;m hesitant to use it and go out in the sun.</li>
            <li>better than Olay</li>
            <li>So glad i was able to get this in a pump.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I was able to contact the manufacturer with a question</li>

            <li>i love using this in my hair as well.</li>
            <li>100% gel and no claim that more than a drop of Aloe is in it</li>
            <li>the greatest sunburn relief next the having an aloe Vera plant!</li>
            <li>Better than most Aloe gels out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera for my horses for MANY years.</li>
            <li>I love this for sunburns because it doesn&#x27;t have fragrance or color added.  </li>
            <li>It worked better than tea tree oil, than honey washing, rhassoul clay, etc.</li>
            <li>more words are required so I am done.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>:) You can get it from Walmart for $4</li>
            <li>Glad I found it (and love what I made - stronger scents</li>
            <li>Glad I took the chance.</li>
            <li>I love Aloe and use it for many things.  </li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t have alcohol in it too.</li>
            <li>This is soooo much better than making it myself.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels better by anticipation just by picking up the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Be safe.</li>
            <li>Love this for my shower.  </li>
            <li>I am glad that Fruit of the Earth is providing it through Amazon and that there were no surprise ingredients.</li>
            <li>I use it on my skin, but mostly as a setting gel for my hair.  </li>
            <li>It is ok, but no feeling....</li>
            <li>We have used this brand of Aloe Lotion for many years.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s brightened my face and my skin looks so healthy.</li>
            <li>So glad I found it here as could not find it in the retail stores</li>
            <li>I do love the product, I am going to re-order</li>
            <li>, I use it daily, it works wonderfully well.</li>

            <li>I have psoriasis and this stuff has helped in the relief, but it takes many applications to truly be affective.</li>
            <li>The more we neglect it the healthier</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>So much better than hair gels.</li>
            <li>More like, &#x27;they don&#x27;t provide health insurance.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>But I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t  may be the aloe vera gel from the leaf is better.</li>
            <li>and it felt better.  </li>
            <li>there are many websites that tell you all the uses of 100% aloe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was pleased by the deliberate shipping speed</li>
            <li>The price was better than any I have ever paid at a store.</li>
            <li>I was pleased all around.</li>

            <li>Love it works great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>No it&#x27;s not 100% pure aloe vera, however it&#x27;s quite effective in the year I&#x27;ve used it.  </li>
            <li>I also use a little bit to rub on my head after washing my hair, and then comb it through  as a conditioner and it works great!</li>
            <li>While a little grease-ie for my likes, does an excellent job</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling clean, cool, and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I am a huge Aloe fan.  </li>
            <li>I use this on both of our hair to smooth it out and help it keep twist-outs.</li>
            <li>Great for  facial skin conditioning.</li>
            <li>This one really is smooth like a gel.</li>
            <li>It will heal and restore rather than just smooth away the dryness.    </li>
            <li>Fantastic as an aftersun lotion.</li>
            <li>To top it off it does not leave that greasy feeling - well absorbed.</li>
            <li>We have used this on sunburns and household light burns.</li>
            <li>This gel is light and can be used on the body as well as my hair.  </li>
            <li>Aloe is a great lubricating lotion to put some moisture back and protect the skin.</li>
            <li>It brings fantastic definition to otherwise undefined curls (I&#x27;m African-American with 4a hair).</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on it as a sunburn reliever because I&#x27;ve never had sunburn in my life, but as a hair product it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is fragrance and color free, which is important when using it as a burn relief.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hands feel smooth and softer than any lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>It works well and keeps the skin smooth inspite of radiation effeects.</li>
            <li>The bottle that I received was slightly different than the one pictured, but in a great way.</li>
            <li>this is a great product for facial moisturizer and sunburns, but every time I order it online and get it there is always spillage perhaps from the changes in elevation during shipping, just seems to be wasteful.</li>
            <li>All I can say is this stuff is FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>great for skin care, especially razor nicks/burns.</li>
            <li>Fit for purpose - Not in my case.</li>
            <li>I might have smooth skin, WHAT?&lt;br /&gt;Finally, SKIN:</li>
            <li>all about it on the great unbiased EWG website (EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep Cosmetics Database &#x3D; [...] ).</li>
            <li>If you can get over that issue, then it is  surely well worth a try.</li>
            <li>though is that it is fragrance free</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s quite light on my hair and doesn&#x27;t leave residue....</li>
            <li>Some of the preservatives and chemicals in this Aloe Gel are worrisome, but overall it works great.</li>
            <li>I use it as a hair gel and to mix oils when i need a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li>thanks for encouraging me to grow my own aloe plants.  </li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S NOT ALCOHOL FREE</li>
            <li>Great for the occasional mosquito bite or skin irritation.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s clear and good for my skin</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with the overall benefits of this product and would gladly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I am not a fan of this aloe gel, I purchased this to use on my face because I have really oily skin that breaks out very easily when I use lotion.  </li>
            <li>My new favorite!</li>
            <li>this is pure  and the true way to use aloe.  !!</li>
            <li>Loved it helped my hair become super soft and shiny it also helps with bruises I just ran out of it</li>
            <li>I have used this exact product for many years.</li>
            <li>My most recent order had a pump top, which is a huge plus!</li>
            <li>I rub my feet with aloe every morning to keep them cool, clean and bacteria free (that is why my feet don&#x27;t smell)</li>
            <li>Good for minor burns and is chemical and perfume free, which is good for people with allergies or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Great stuff for dry skin</li>
            <li>this stuff is the best i&#x27;ve tried so far, and i&#x27;ve tried alot of different kinds.     </li>
            <li>It helps with my dry skin and great for me DIY hair moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Great product for dry skin relief without any chemical additives.</li>
            <li>This product goes on cleanly and has no added scents.  </li>
            <li>Also works great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>Great for hands to, or just dry winter skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this company hires chemist who could think of more natural ingredients to use.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product to use as a hair gel and it has had some pleasant side-effects such as minimizing any sun exposure or sun burn on my head and face</li>
            <li>My husband and I love this Aloe Vera gel because it is 100% pure and is not dyed ....</li>
            <li>BUT I am looking for a more pure product with no GMO&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Great for very dry and itchy skin.</li>
            <li>Purchased this to use with a microcurrent device ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CE6CFLU/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 ) works great and doesn&#x27;t dry out to quickly.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not quite as good as right off the leaf, but it&#x27;s sooooo much better than using lotions, which (even the good ones, many times) have far more dangerous chemicals (and in greater quantity) than this product.  </li>
            <li>Amazing natural healing balm.  </li>
            <li>i love this stuff, it has no artificial coloring, no weird odor, and doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol (doesn&#x27;t separate when you put it on).</li>
            <li>Instead of cool, burns.</li>
            <li>You can also buy drinkable Aloe which is extremely good for your esophagus and stomach, especially if you have GERD.</li>
            <li>This is supposedly non-toxic but like many chemicals used in cosmetics, it&#x27;s not clinically tested and who really knows.  </li>
            <li>its not %100 percent aloe vera gel and now im growing a real aloe vera leaf plant and that leaf heals skin problems better than fruit of the earth products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle and it lasts for a good while.</li>
            <li>Yes, that is true.  </li>
            <li>We always have a bottle of aloe gel in the fridge to help cool and heal the burns.</li>
            <li>and I really believe it does something to make you look better.  </li>
            <li>Since, I&#x27;ve stopped using my rhassoul clay mask so much and mostly wash with grape seed oil, then apply aloevera.</li>
            <li>My skin has been overly bumpy all my life, but I didn&#x27;t really notice because I was always scratching it instead of touching it.</li>
            <li>It will prevent peeling and help cool the burn.</li>
            <li>Check out my full thoughts on why you should use aloe too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li>At night, I wash my face with neem soap bar and extensively apply a good layer of this gel and leave it overnight.</li>
            <li>Good product, big bottle.</li>
            <li>This is the straight stuff and easier to get than managing a plant and whacking off the leaves. :-)</li>
            <li>Product is FULL of JUNK &amp; BURNS my Eyes!!!&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>The Fruit of the Earth Aloe Very Gel helped heal up his sores and many of the scars are fading.  </li>
            <li>IT WILL COOL YOUR SUN BURN.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sticky - true aloe vera isn&#x27;t sticky.  </li>
            <li>This was recommended to me by another cancer patient who is also receiving radiation and it helps with the burns and blistering.&lt;br /&gt;Helps it after treatment, feels cool and reduces some of the pain.</li>
            <li>Good enough for me.</li>
            <li>It still is not perfect ingredient wise, but it keeps my son&#x27;s hair out of his eyes and does not leave his beautiful blond hair crunchy or greasy.</li>
            <li>not a bad thing to say about this product</li>
            <li>The main caution is to make sure that the injury is clean before treatment to avoid infection.</li>
            <li>Have been VERY satisfied, and left feeling clean and mosturized, and not slimy.</li>
            <li>No doubt it would be great for sunburn too, although I don&#x27;t get that anymore as I cover up due to a bought with skin cancer.</li>
            <li>this product, Tetrasodium EDTA is used to keep it nice and smooth and help its not-so-water-soluble components (such as preservatives) dissolve in the gel.</li>
            <li>I tried this gel and have seen tremendous results on my skin.</li>
            <li>but it contains many of the ingredients that are in the many commercial products I am trying to avoid.</li>
            <li>I have a network of artistic cuts on my arms now.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t happen to have a real medical Aloe Vera plant around that you can break a piece off to sooth a burn or cut or scrape, this is the next best thing.  </li>
            <li>I use it for my &amp;#34;sandal feet&amp;#34; in the summer to moisturize them and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a mild acid</li>
            <li>Later I mixed it with Shea butter (and some water &amp; oils) and it is still awesome.</li>
            <li>The pump is super convenient.</li>
            <li>quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Quick Delivery</li>
            <li>and super curly hair too</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and has virtually no smell.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;ve faded tremendously</li>
            <li>Quick shipping,and wrapped in bags which was lucky because one of the handles broke a bit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep it, may be good for something, but it doesn&#x27;t work on dry skin like my true 100% aloe vera did.</li>
            <li>pure clean light and does not feel sticky after use</li>
            <li>This aloe gel is pretty much the same consistency as the conductive gel from nuface and works beautifully</li>
            <li>Not as good as pure aloe, of course, but better than some of the other products out there.</li>
            <li>I forget: this is a great product for treating dry skin, and has a nice cooling effect on minor sunburns.</li>
            <li>This is a new favorite.</li>
            <li>We live in Hawaii and my kids love to surf.</li>
            <li>It has no color or fragrance added to it, and I have found Aloe to be the best remedie for sunburn and minor to moderate burns in the kitched and around the campfire.</li>
            <li>Pretty dope, but don&#x27;t get to excited and</li>
            <li>Used day after day this spray works GREAT as a very natural leave in conditioner for all of us, while still being used as a styling spray for short hair and detangler for the granddaughters&#x27; longer hair, all in one!  </li>
            <li>I thought from the description I was purchasing a pure chemical free product</li>
            <li>(maybe too well... got a little bit of hypopigmentation now lol).</li>
            <li>We found it for a good price on Amazon and bought 4 large bottles just in case we can&#x27;t get it later.  </li>
            <li>I continued applications several times a day over the next 2 weeks, and the wound healed beautifully, leaving a clean line where it would have scarred.</li>
            <li>It is a great moisturizer for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I PURCHASED A HUGE ALOE LEAF FROM WHOLE FOODS FOR $2.00.</li>
            <li>Economical.</li>
            <li>i love how naturally moisturizing this aloe vera gel is.</li>
            <li>Nice big jug of Aloe!</li>
            <li>:  this is otherwise a decent product that dries very quickly, and makes a non-greasy Hair gel and skin moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>Product is great, but pump top was broken off in shipping.</li>
            <li>I love Fruit of the Earth - Clear Aloe.  </li>
            <li>Medically, it has found use in treating acute hypercalcemia, mercury poisoning and lead poisoning.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, and have tried most mousses, gels, and curl creams there are out on the market.  </li>
            <li>This is the first one that 1, is fragrance free, and 2, lists aloe as the first ingredient, which means its percentage is highest among ingredients.</li>
            <li>(I didn&#x27;t feel it was worth the time or effort to return).</li>
            <li>Love this clear aloe vera 100% gel.</li>
            <li>Better if you look for Aloe from a company named \\&quot;JASON\\&quot;, from Jason Natural Products.</li>
            <li>Clears out my blemishes &amp; keeps my oily skin feeling fresh &amp; moisturized.</li>
            <li>Works for me, but I am not crazy about it.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get it anywhere near my eyes and yet somehow it was still able to make my eyes burn and tear up uncontrollably.</li>
            <li>I make my own hair and skin products, including face masks, lotions, leave in and deep conditioners, and AVG will officially be a staple in all of them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, so it&#x27;s worth buying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was not charged for it, but I bought another and the product itself is really nice;  especially in the hotter months.</li>
            <li>A nice savings by buying the larger bottle.</li>
            <li>Well worth the savings and easier to get then sometimes trying to find it at the grocery or pharmacy,</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re golden.</li>
            <li>the large original container.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tocopheryl Acetate: Tocopheryl acetate is a chemical compound that consists of acetic acid and tocopherol, Human skin toxicant or allergen - strong evidence, One or more animal studies show tumor formation at high doses, Suspected to be an environmental toxin and be persistent or bioaccumulative, One or more animal studies show tumor formation at high doses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will need to use it a little more to write more of a full review.</li>
            <li>Very versatile and useful making skin care recipes!</li>
            <li>delivered right away.</li>
            <li>right after you shave</li>
            <li>Price is right.</li>
            <li>Somehow that doesn&#x27;t seem right.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t connect the two because it didn&#x27;t develop right away.</li>
            <li>Cleared up my problem right away.</li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>Arrived right on time.</li>
            <li>Customer reviews are a major factor of why I use Amazon--I like the first-hand user reports, and many of my purchasing decisions are based on these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very large skeptic and</li>
            <li>I have a very large Aloe Vera Desert Plant.</li>
            <li>but they are much less and more harmless than additives found in most brand name products.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t spend a lot of money on such a cheap and easy to find product.</li>
            <li>But still a great product to use year round!</li>
            <li>If you have bug bites, minor skin abrasions or other issues with your skin, this is a wonderful healing protectant.</li>
            <li>It is light, not sticky, and adds just enough body for my fine curly hair.</li>
            <li>I just love this scent free and sinks right in no stickiness.  </li>
            <li>This time arrived quickly, was properly packaged, and most all, exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this gel is good for other things, but I only use it for sunburns.</li>
            <li>oh pure FoTE aloe!</li>
            <li>and this is amazing for  the dry skin.</li>
            <li>The 100% gel works great for bug bites as well as legs with circulation issues such as from diabetes or May Thurner Syndrome or Deep Vein</li>
            <li>works FAST on burns and heals them quickly.</li>
            <li>Quick shipment and the cost was reasonable.</li>
            <li>In theory, it is possible that some carcinogens may become water soluble and hence be more easily absorbed by your skin as well.</li>
            <li>Since this product is 100% natural it makes the process of hair removal much safer and also much more</li>
            <li>Great for my curly African American hair.</li>
            <li>I spent some time looking them up because I wanted to know for my own choice; I should probably just get some aloe vera plants to have the fresh 100% stuff.</li>
            <li>I have had trouble finding it in local stores happy to have it here on Amazon in bulk !!</li>
            <li>An added benefit is that whatever is left on my hands after I apply it to my hair can be rubbed on my face or arms for a double win.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff, not much to say really</li>
            <li>and being a grandma of a 5 year old, it&#x27;s amazing how soft my skin is.  </li>
            <li>I really like it very much !</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>A little pricey, but good product.  </li>
            <li>A pretty substantial supply of Aloe Vera, at a very reasonable</li>
            <li>First i used to get it at walmart</li>
            <li>She absolutely LOVES it!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find this brand in my local stores, so I am glad to see it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I LOVE FRUIT OF THE EARTH PRODUCTS AND ESPECIALLY THE 100% ALOE VERA GEL.</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT IS SMOOTH, AND NATURAL.</li>
            <li>Many people seem to like this product, but it needs to be labeled properly.  </li>
            <li>First, this is labeled \\&quot;100% Gel\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I have never once peeled or had discomfort for more than ~2 days if I start applying this stuff the same day of a burn.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t magic, like instant or anything like that</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what I need it to do.  </li>
            <li>It also keeps my skin smooth and young looking.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It leaves it soft and tangle free without the greasy buildup.</li>
            <li>I only wish they had wrapped the product better because it leaked and the pump did not work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Price is also acceptable, All in all, pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That would be too logical wouldn&#x27;t it?</li>
            <li>bought this product to add to my boutique hair products as I try to get as safe as possible products to my butter-based hair food.</li>
            <li>but, it was a smaller size and a lot more money.</li>
            <li>It contains mostly aloe vera gel but adds additional ingredients such as Tetrasodium ETDA, DMDM Hydantoin, Diazolidinyl Urea, &amp;#34;plus stabilizers and preservatives to insure potency and efficacy&amp;#34; (unnamed).  </li>
            <li>I really really like it!</li>
            <li>I purchased it with Nutiva coconut oil, so I tried styling my hair in twists with them, and my hair came out really defined!</li>
            <li>Aloe vera fixes soo much!</li>
            <li>I used this aloe vera on my acne throughout high school and it works wonders!!  </li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>But adding this to an order to get the free shipping I am once again re-united with an old friend.</li>
            <li>I love this aloe gel especially with the pump as a bonus.  </li>
            <li>Buying more when my current supply is gone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be lost if I wasn&#x27;t able to regularly purchase this.  </li>
            <li>I recently switched over to using aloe vera as a moisturizer after my skincare routine, and this product has held up to be reliable and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I Vit E on my skin then cover with this gel and it keeps me from getting windburned and my skin stays soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This was a much better price than I ever found when I was buying it in local stores.  </li>
            <li>But very moistureous!</li>
            <li>And fast!</li>
            <li>It really pissed me off!</li>
            <li>and I really like using it!</li>
            <li>One or more animal studies show effects at moderate doses!&lt;br</li>
            <li>There was a sticker in the back of the bottle when I peeled off, revealed a lot more chemical makeup than what it makes up to be.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I bought this months ago and still have not finished the first bottle.</li>
            <li>and it lives my skin baby smooth and soft</li>
            <li>I am just now finishing my first bottle of this brand and type</li>
            <li>I think I will but more in the future!!</li>
            <li>It is not expensive at all.</li>
            <li>The bottle I got was different from the one in the photo in that it has a pump top, like a soap dispenser.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly and does not stay gummy and wet like many lotions.</li>
            <li>This large pump is great at home and helps me easily refill the convenient travel sizes, ultimately saving money and time (re-purchasing the small sizes).</li>
            <li>I have a HUGE problem with companies using deceptive advertising by making claims that their products are ALL NATURAL or 100% pure, when in fact they are NOT.  </li>
            <li>Way back I used to buy this brand of aloe but was much more pure.</li>
            <li>but the ingredients have to be a little bit more accurate.</li>
            <li>No perfumes or smells, just clear, clean and soothing.</li>
            <li>It has a clean clear feel once I applied it to my skin&#x27;</li>
            <li>Clean and natural feeling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad to have a big supply of straight aloe gel.</li>
            <li>The bottle I received actually has a pump style top, which is very convenient to use.</li>

            <li>If you&#x27;re one that is used to grabbing a tube of cheap Vaseline lotion or something like that for general hand lotion, get this instead!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used this product for sunburn, minor scrapes, bruises, or burns that occur around the home, so was very fortunate to have it handy when I tripped and fell, hitting one side of my face against a piece of metal as I went down.</li>
            <li>on the positive side, it is made in the USA.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would be fine for mild sunburn or another skin problem where the skin is not raw, but I don&#x27;t recommend it for use on raw or peeling skin.</li>
            <li>my eyebrows would not grow because of the waxing, now I don&#x27;t have to shade in my eyebrows at all, I have a natural full shape</li>
            <li>It was good as usual.</li>
            <li>FEAV feels like it &amp;#34;cures&amp;#34; or removes the dry skin without creating more while Aveeno just masks</li>
            <li>It  makes it easy to apply the next section of the face with one hand while finishing up the one you are working on.</li>
            <li>did I finally Scratch OFF the AMAZON Label to find ALL the CARCINOGENS in this Heinous WASTE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Triethanolamine: a strongly alkaline substance used as surfactant and pH adjusting chemical, Human immune and respiratory toxicant or allergen - strong evidence,</li>
            <li>I give credit to this brand of pure aloe.</li>
            <li>it was pure Aloe Vera gel.</li>
            <li>Large size.  </li>
            <li>The advertising may lead some folks to believe the product is 100% pure aloe vera gel...  </li>
            <li>Please forget about 100% pure aloe vera gel</li>
            <li>Now, I see some have taken exception to the fact that it&#x27;s not 100% pure aloe</li>
            <li>I bought this because it said, &amp;#34;Aloe Vera 100% Gel,&amp;#34; which I thought meant it was pure aloe gel.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be buying again, but will be looking for something that really is pure aloe vera.</li>
            <li>I do not use hair gel or hairspray and instead use pure aloe as a gel.</li>
            <li>Lakewood Pure Aloe Gel</li>
            <li>Pure Aloe Gel</li>
            <li>Large bottle.  </li>
            <li>I was in need of pure aloe vera gel and chose this because it was advertised as &amp;#34;pure,&amp;#34; even in the product description.  </li>
            <li>LARGE BOTTLE</li>
            <li>seems to work well, but why not just use pure aloe, e.g., from Trader Joe&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the pure stuff</li>
            <li>/&gt;Carbomer: is a large polymeric chemical composed of acrylic acid monomers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It says it&#x27;s 100% pure Aloe vera gel</li>
            <li>My skin scraped off and put some of this so called pure aloe</li>
            <li>Every purchase so easy and trouble free...</li>
            <li>The fine print on the back of the bottle warns that this product may stain some fabrics and it does.  </li>
            <li>I work construction and this is great for sunburn and other minor burns.  </li>
            <li>and I will agree, the seller is pretty clever to straddle honesty this way.  </li>
            <li>I think every lotion should have that as their main ingredient!  </li>
            <li>and I really owe a large part to this product.  </li>
            <li>I definitely like the fact that a large size is available for purchase, because I use this product whenever I can.</li>
            <li>This bottle is HUGE, too, so it&#x27;ll probably last us forever!</li>
            <li>Well my whole FACE started peeling, then I broke out in bumps.</li>
            <li>I use it daily on the scar left from knee replacement and it not only feels cooling and comforting but also has done a great job in fading the scar.</li>
            <li>: My granddaughter somehow gets her hair VERY tangled and matted during her shower.  </li>
            <li>It really works so you don&#x27;t need so much.</li>
            <li>much healthier and waay cheaper.</li>
            <li>I really like it alot.</li>
            <li>It is working really well for both of us.</li>
            <li>And the only option out there I know of that is fragrance free.</li>
            <li>I only payed $10.09 and got free 2 day shipping with prime</li>
            <li>Although my pump was broken when I recieved it, I am happy that it comes in 24oz.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the reviewers below who described the chemicals.</li>
            <li>I then made the mistake of applying this over my whole face before going to bed.</li>
            <li>Thanks Brian</li>
            <li>It worked very well for me</li>
            <li>It really keeps my eyebrows in place and fades my spots well</li>
            <li>I use this to shave my head and it works very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much healthier and won&#x27;t plug up the pores.  </li>
            <li>thanks alot</li>
            <li>i recommend a real aloe vera leaf</li>
            <li>I now have peach colored stains on my white sheets and light colored tank tops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works VERY well.  </li>
            <li>Just try it, and enjoy its multiple benefits!</li>
            <li>No fragrance, super-absorbant, light, adds just enough moisture without that \\&quot;humid\\&quot; feeling.</li>
            <li>I disagree some of the reviewers saying too much chemicals in this aloe vera gel.</li>
            <li>the thing is this product doesn&#x27;t really keep your skin hydrated.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Purel has been really drying out my hands and using this once a day has made all the difference.</li>
            <li>So gentle.  </li>
            <li>Not sticky and never irritating.</li>
            <li>very soothing.</li>
            <li>Product works very well for me.</li>
            <li>Dogs seem to really like it too.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>No matter how much I caution them to use plenty of sunscreen, now</li>
            <li>but this company is really leading the pack.</li>
            <li>great product but pump came in broken..</li>
            <li>Really helps aide in healing.</li>
            <li>This a very healing product.  </li>
            <li>I really like this Aloe gel.</li>
            <li>Ordered this to use with my NuFace instead of the very pricey gel offered by NuFace.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping and received the correct product</li>
            <li>This product not only contains alcohol (as triethanolamine) which the bottle states it is free off</li>
            <li>Winter will be the real test</li>
            <li>The fumes of whatever is used in this to keep it liquified really irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li>fast drying.</li>
            <li>(if even that much).</li>
            <li>It really helps.</li>
            <li>The aloe vera does this gently with no irritation or residual build up.  </li>
            <li>There is plenty of it, so you can use it as much as you want to.</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten used to bleeding legs, really.</li>
            <li>Works very well for my hair.</li>
            <li>IF YOU HAVE ANY SKIN SENSITIVITIES AT ALL, ABSOLUTELY AVOID THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>so by the time i was ready to use it</li>
            <li>When I wear my hair straight, I put it on before blow-drying and it leaves my hair</li>
            <li>really soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Label is very misleading.</li>
            <li>It was ok, not what I expected, I will just use it for twist out vs wash and go.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It was tape up, and it wasn&#x27;t pack really well</li>
            <li>He began scratching so much that he would bleed on his clothes and on the sheets and furniture.  </li>
            <li>Whole family uses it.  </li>
            <li>I used the gel for my my whole body from my hair to my feet.</li>
            <li>It does have preservatives, but it works very well.</li>
            <li>Really helped out with the sunburn.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very grateful</li>
            <li>This helps ao much to heal skin scrapes and repair sun damage to your skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks for sending this so fast</li>
            <li>Wish I had read reviews more carefully about the chemical additives.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast.  </li>
            <li>IF YOU HAVE THE CHOICE TO PURCHASE THE REAL THING.</li>
            <li>If i find it is drying out to much</li>
            <li>It works, its soothing, and it doesn&#x27;t stink, and its a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>very good,as described and packaged well.</li>
            <li>I found that it really works fast at relieving wrinkles on fingers that come when you have had your hands in water for a while.</li>
            <li>Works very well on the brown &amp;#34;liver spots&amp;#34; on my hands.</li>
            <li>I have a fair, freckled Irish complexion that tends to be too pink and flushed, and, with time, has brought on age spots and reddening of some freckles.</li>
            <li>My hair has finally stopped breaking and is soft and more manageable.</li>
            <li>I am confused how so many people love this stuff?</li>
            <li>The additional make it not pure and some are more toxic than I wanted in a gel.  </li>
            <li>im glad i bought the larger size on line because they sell the smaller sizes of this stuff right now in stores.</li>
            <li>Like so many other products that are still made, but are hard to find in stores, I found this good deal on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good sized bottle of aloe vera with none of the inert embellishments you pay extra for in other brands.</li>
            <li>I felt it was a good deal and didn&#x27;t especially get irate as other reviewers, who didn&#x27;t read the label did.</li>
            <li>It is better than any other brand I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>Compare to many other brands</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other aloe products that didn&#x27;t work any better  or as well  than this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a healthy, skin-protecting alternative to shaving cream and other shaving products.  </li>
            <li>Helps heal sunburns, rashes, and many other problems.  </li>
            <li>[Sorry for the rambling! :D]</li>
            <li>I like to use it in my hair and on my skin because other products just have too many chemicals.</li>
            <li>Better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>, I mix it with jojoba oil to put on my face and it seems to keep my skin more moist than other cosmetic products.  </li>
            <li>I have mixed fine loose glitter into it to make cheap glitter gel</li>
            <li>This is still a great aloe vera product despite very minor potential concerns about minuscule quantities of chemical agents that are (presumably) added for thickening and preservative purposes only.  </li>
            <li>If you have convictions that prohibit you from using products with any un-natural chemical ingredients, that is understandable and there are other excellent alternatives (such as Lily of the Desert, which is 99% pure and organic, but also much more expensive).    </li>
            <li>Next best thing to cutting an aloe plant open, but more convenient.</li>
            <li>Very soothing and would highly recommend along with Witch Hazel.</li>
            <li>All replace by other cheap brand with red/green/blue color and funny smell.</li>
            <li>Overall it seems I use more Aloe Vera gel as a natural hair care product than as a natural skin care product.</li>
            <li>First off, I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I use this on my old dogs to prevent hot spots.  </li>
            <li>Barely used it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that useful.</li>
            <li>First, let me recommend, here on Amazon, &amp;#34;Aloe Vera Gel By Earth&#x27;s Daughter&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Lilly of the Valley Aloe Vera Juice&amp;#34; as alternatives to this product for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I used this product to try a wash single and go on my 4c hair and it worked out fine.  </li>
            <li>:) and for those who crying about it not being 100% pure what is?????</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure rubbing blue or green gel on my hair every day would be a great idea. :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m worth it, especially  eliminating the stress from bitching about those other products that I&#x27;d love to throw out.</li>
            <li>This time around there are new preservatives that I am not likeing so much.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the most less chemicals aloe vera gel in none organic class.</li>
            <li>I use it on my dry skin, it could not makes it feel smooth....</li>
            <li>The main reason I bought FEAV was for stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I would be interested to know the exact concentrations of each ingredient in the final product.   </li>
            <li>No razor burn, close shave, and skin is left soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>who needs smoothing from toner when you got this gel, who need those expensive moisturizers which always oily up my skin( i have really sensitive skin and get oily easy), i wash my face with gental face wash and then apply a light layer of aloe vera gel on my face, it like a face mask but stay on your face all day, the gel protects your face from getting too much containmination, provides a clean environment to speed up the healing of acne or scars.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying it for many years and have gone through a few bottles, it really does work well.</li>
            <li>If you want to soothe your skin while promoting skin cancer with the Diazolidinyl Urea then have fun, but I&#x27;d imagine only Fruit of the Earth wants that for you as they lead you to believe the Aloe of Vera in this gel is 100% when in reality the BS in this gel is 100%.  </li>
            <li>AVG from GNC works *slightly* better than the AVG from FOTE, but is much more expensive per oz.</li>
            <li>One or more animal studies show classified as toxic effects at low doses, Classified as toxic or harmful (only for products for use on skin; products for use around the mouth</li>
            <li>One or more animal studies show classified as toxic effects at low doses, Classified as toxic or harmful (only for products for use on skin; products for use around the mouth</li>
            <li>Also as I&#x27;m getting older it helps my skin from getting too wrinklelly.    </li>
            <li>Go all natural with Aloe,it&#x27;s to much of a fantastic healer to be mixed with garbage.</li>
            <li>I am pretty satisfied with this product, except for the fact that is feels a little sticky on your skin until it completely dries.  </li>
            <li>; Online, everyone said it had very light hold, but would give hair a nice shine- WRONG!</li>
            <li>Telling a friend that people have talked positively about her without her knowing always produces an unexpected thrill.</li>
            <li>This product does not contain a whole lot of unrelated ingredients like preservatives, etc.. and is as close to natural aloe vera as I could get without messing with the leaves for myself!  </li>
            <li>Good price for enough gel to last for a long time.</li>
            <li>its better than styling gel because it&#x27;s very moisturizing and won&#x27;t make your hair sticky and stiff.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for scrapes of all kinds.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Well packed - Prompt Delivery - Highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to those treated by radiation for breast cancer.</li>
            <li>Seems like high quality 100% aloe vera.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;product highly.</li>
            <li>It is great for burns and other skin issues, but my everyday use is as hair gel.  </li>
            <li>I tried so many other things and non of them made a DENT on my skin problems, but the AVG fixed it for about 40 hours or so.</li>
            <li>I was surprised with some of the ingredients in this pure aloe vera gel.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not 100% certain if it&#x27;s the direct result of usage or combination with use of an Aloe Vera shampoo yet but have noticed improvements with my ever increasing receding hair line.</li>
            <li>Feels a little better on the skin.</li>
            <li>Secondly, I strongly suggest that anyone considering this product should Google ALL of the other ingredients.</li>
            <li>The real aloe vera gel is known to clear up face pimples and acne</li>
            <li>While baking soda gets my hair clean, it also makes it really dry</li>
            <li>The aloe vera gel is versatile, reasonably priced, and natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a while, and that ONE bump is still there [GRR], but it&#x27;s greatly diminished, and no others have formed!</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and the Aloe works really well for me.  </li>
            <li>and I really like the fact that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>and sometimes I&#x27;ll add a few drops of my favorite body lotion and apply it after my shower.</li>
            <li>Every summer I get a few cases of poison ivy from working in the woods and this product is my favorite skin cover for helping with itching.</li>
            <li>I found my face was red and a lot of skin peeled thanks to this when I first tried it.</li>
            <li>Love it for sunburns and keep some in the refrigerator year round.</li>
            <li>Pure aloe vera gel usually has some light natural coloration (a yellowish tint) and a light, distinct, scent... and if it is of the pure organic nature, the color (and smell) may vary a little from batch to batch.  </li>
            <li>According to reviews by the industry-funded Cosmetic Ingredient Review panel, these cosmetic ingredients can release formaldehyde at levels as high as one-tenth that of the original ingredient (CIR 2006), The International Agency for Research on Carcinogens (IARC) has classified formaldehyde as &#x27;carcinogenic to humans,&#x27; and the U.S. National Toxicology Program has classified it as &#x27;reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen,&#x27; based on emerging evidence in humans and robust evidence in animals (</li>

            <li>I’m eight months pregnant, and when I rub this on my belly, it keeps my stretched skin from itching.  </li>
            <li>light and cooling for bug bites and other things</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this staple.</li>
            <li>My new humidifier is helping</li>
            <li>Since not a lot volume run out and  I live on campus, I did not claim a return .</li>
            <li>It seems to me me there is a sogn of usage while it shown as new.</li>
            <li>...AVG has officially beaten raw honey in my 1st place for favorite Skin∧Hair thing ever, and a staple in my leave in moisturizer/detangler.</li>
            <li>I thought about giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the - arguably - slightly misleading label, but the fact is the label is honest and all ingredients are clearly listed on the back for anyone with a brain to check out</li>
            <li>i thought it was going to make my skin very soft</li>
            <li>The first couple of days I only used it as a spot treatment and though it didn&#x27;t work wonders</li>
            <li>It has improved the quality and appearance of my skin and reduced my psoriasis problems on the scalp considerably!  </li>
            <li>Cannot consistently find at local stores</li>
            <li>If it was brown or yellow nobody would buy it because we buy, taste, smell etc with are eyes first so Relax.</li>
            <li>last month scientifically tested dozens of Aloe products and determined that this exact product contains close to ZERO percent Aloe!&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>However, the fact that it is listed first in the ingredients is a total lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Never buy any personal care product without looking here first - it will save your face, your baby, and your family&#x27;s health.</li>
            <li>Has replaced hair gel completely!</li>
            <li>so I applied some to her hair and immediately her hair appeared to have thicken considerably!  </li>
            <li>It helps against acne scars, helps against acne in general, and gets rid of bug bites really fast.</li>
            <li>but if you are using it instead of a moisturizer with sunscreen in it, you are not really getting protection from the sun or the full benefit of aloe.</li>
            <li>My first indication that Fruit of the Earth&#x27;s product was not actually \\&quot;pure\\&quot; was its perfectly clear color.    </li>
            <li>He has jet black, smooth hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it&#x27;s really useful for dry</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s made in the USA which is rare these days on just about any products sold to the general public.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I still had the empty bottle of Fruit of the Earth</li>
            <li>Quick shipping and packaged carefully.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use too much, and I usually dilute it with water, but I tried just using coconut oil one day [not much hold, loads of moisture, some shine], and just using aloe vera gel [no water] one day, and AVG worked amazingly at hold and shine, and gave a bit of moisture</li>
            <li>&quot; meaning that it&#x27;s 100% a substance that is gel-like and nothing more -- at least aloe vera is the first ingredient, but look at the next 5 ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I often use it elsewhere for a cool feeling in place of other moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is full of chemcals - probably toxic (read the other review about this and Google the chemicals) .</li>
            <li>However, FEAV does wash off easily with water which is not so bad because I find it to be so effective that I don&#x27;t need to reapply it.</li>
            <li>There are several companies that make pure aloe vera products.</li>
            <li>This is the only brand of pure aloe vera gel we buy.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the only Aloe products I can find that is almost pure aloe.  </li>
            <li>Large bottle seems to last forever.</li>
            <li>Or pick up your own Aloe Vera plant; they are surprisingly tough and prolific.</li>
            <li>The other reviewers have said pretty much everything, and I don&#x27;t have enough expertise to add much to the discussion.</li>
            <li>It contains pure aloe (the same way pop-tarts contain natural flavors).  </li>
            <li>never stop itching&#x27; problem better than every single other lotion, cream, or medicated gel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m transitioning from permed to natural hair, and my 2 year old is all natural.</li>
            <li>i tried it anyway to clear up face pimples.</li>
            <li>I like this non-irritating clear 100% aloe vera.  </li>
            <li>Its clear, non greasy and can be used in a hair or skin.  </li>
            <li>I find this works really well as a facial moisturizer for my adult (32 yo) skin.</li>
            <li>Think about it, would it really be clear if it were 100% aloe?  </li>
            <li>The store brands seem to like to add dyes to theirs, so I have stuck to Fruit of the Earth brand because theirs is clear.  </li>
            <li>I read on the NuFace website that you could also use clear aloe vera gel</li>
            <li>but I prefer the clear product.</li>
            <li>This gel really makes your skin feel soft, and dries instantly.</li>
            <li>As advertised,  totally clear aloe, no alcohol.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking EVERYWHERE for another bottle of Fruit of the Earth Aloe as it is a GREAT skin lotion for suntans and sunburns and everyday use AND is free of artificial dyes and colors.  </li>
            <li>it makes our skin soft.</li>
            <li>Just put a natural preservative in the Aloe gel, that&#x27;s all you need.</li>
            <li>I bought this gel as a natural way to help heal a couple of spots on my face where I had a breakout.</li>
            <li>I used it moisturize my natural African-American hair.  </li>
            <li>With sensitive skin this is what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li>Tetrasodium EDTA is a common salt of EDTA, or EthyleneDiamineTetraacetic Acid, and is used in many products (including soaps and cosmetics) as a chelating agent.</li>
            <li>IT HAS NATURAL HEALING PROPERTIES</li>
            <li>I would suggest researching before purchase and that Fruit of the Earth list a complete ingredient list on the sale page.  </li>
            <li>Works well so far.</li>
            <li>Using it as a natural hair gel.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my natural African-American hair.  </li>
            <li>It makes your hair soft and acts like a gel but without that crunchiness.</li>
            <li>I use this product on my natural hair for locking purposes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised none of the product was pumped out during shipping..</li>
            <li>This is not a all natural product</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is all natural since it does not need to be refrigerated like</li>
            <li>But it gives me a soft hold that lasts all day</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t believe how soft it makes your skin feel.  </li>
            <li>I have natural 4a/4b hair that has been giving me dryness problems.</li>
            <li>, they have sensitive skin, and it does not cause any irritation or redness.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin and this keeps me soft with out the over moisture</li>
            <li>This one is alcohol-free and does not cause any burning when used on sensitive or damaged shin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it makes your hands feel soft not sticky.</li>
            <li>It makes your hands soft Mmmmm</li>
            <li>Though the old scars exists, they are showing signs of fading out.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>Once all my old marks are gone</li>
            <li>I frequent.  </li>
            <li>My momma&#x27;s hair has been thinning as she is 90 years old</li>
            <li>Has a soft hold if used as a hair gel.</li>
            <li>I know it will last awhile, and is very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>it has not helped my skin in any way so far.</li>
            <li>Natural</li>
            <li>JUST GO TO YOUR LOCAL WHOLE FOODS OR GROCERY STORE AND BUY AN ALOE VERA PLANT OR LEAF.</li>
            <li>IT WILL BE ALL NATURAL AND SINCE ITS KEPT IN THE FRIDGE</li>
            <li>100% NATURAL.</li>
            <li>We use it to make our natural hair products.</li>
            <li>Now my skin is soft and glowing.</li>
            <li>The green aloe products make my skin more red and irritated, but this is sooo soothing.</li>
            <li>This gel works to cool down and prevent skin breakdown while treating breast cancer with radiation.</li>
            <li>Since aloe is a natural antibiotic of sorts and being that the old formula held up great over long time, not sure why co saw fit to add the few other unwanted ingredients?</li>
            <li>, that would actually stay on my skin and hair instead of the glitter falling right off, like when you mix glitter with regular lotion.   </li>
            <li>It absorbs well providing you give it time, but getting your hands wet right after applying makes them slicker than snot.</li>
            <li>I like this product, but be aware that just because it says pure 100% gel, it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s 100% pure.</li>
            <li>and I saw its clear contents, I knew it was not what I was looking for as pure aloe is not clear.  </li>
            <li>[...] found quite a few products that had significant amounts of Aloe.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I use aloe for EVERYTHING, to make my own hair gel, facial moisturizer, and tons of other HBC needs as I don&#x27;t purchase conventional products.  </li>
            <li>I was after natural gel that i can use in my hair that wont dry it out and would give definition with certain styles.</li>
            <li>It also has no funny smell, no stickiness (only a light residue - typical when using aloe vera - that fades away as it is absorbed in the skin).    </li>
            <li>This product quenches my thirsty skin like no other!</li>
            <li>I was quick to flush my face with water but not fast enough.  </li>
            <li>I have use this for many many years; it helps eased those painful sunburns (burn, peel turn white...</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected according to the description.</li>
            <li>if you read the label too quickly you will miss this little tidbit of information.</li>
            <li>People exposed to such formaldehyde-releasing ingredients may develop a formaldehyde allergy or an allergy to the ingredient itself, Known human toxicant or allergen, Human skin toxicant or allergen - strong evidence, Cancer - limited evidence!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This pure gel is the only Aloe Vera product I buy after trying numerous others.</li>
            <li>I love this gel and the big bottle is hard to find in the grocery stores.</li>
            <li>They were recently bought out and the new chain doesn&#x27;t have it.  </li>
            <li>random fact: its AMAZING for naturally kinky hair.</li>
            <li>This product really cools a heat rash and helps to dry it up.  </li>
            <li>Really has relieved my itching dry skin.</li>
            <li>I believe that the only way to get real 100% aloe is to extract it from the actual plant yourself.  </li>
            <li>For anyone who fights these issues on your feet, I would strongly recommend at least trying this product.</li>
            <li>My hair stays put all day and is very soft the next day.  </li>
            <li>Let me first start off by saying that I do agree with the other reviewers of this product who point out that Fruit of the Earth&#x27;s label is (perhaps) a bit misleading.  </li>
            <li>only thing is that I wish it had even less ingredients in it besides the true aloe vera gel.</li>
            <li>This is one of my secret weapons in keeping long, healthy hair!</li>
            <li>I found another aloe vera gel called Aubrey Organics (not totally free of other ingredients but better) and bought that one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several face moisturizers from big brands such as Aveeno, Olay, Dove, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Although Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera (FEAV) doesn&#x27;t lend itself as purely a face moisturizer, I use it for that reason.</li>
            <li>This product is made from pure aloe, but is not pure aloe.  </li>
            <li>I finally researched the ingredients and found that the second listed ingredient, Triethanolamine, according to the &amp;#34;National Library of Medicine, [shows] strong evidence that Triethanolamine is a human skin, immune system, and respiratory toxicant.&amp;#34; It has been determined that Triethanolamine is &amp;#34;designed for DISCONTINUOUS, BRIEF use followed by THOROUGH RINSING from the surface of the skin.&amp;#34; I threw away the bottle and wouldn&#x27;t use this brand again, especially on &amp;#34;sunburned, dry, or irritated skin,&amp;#34; as the bottle suggests.</li>
            <li>Found this at the Dollar General.</li>
            <li>On the back label it clearly says &amp;#34;100% aloe vera gel&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Sounds crazy, but it actually works really nice!</li>
            <li>That line is now barely visible.</li>
            <li>Bare ingredient.</li>
            <li>It made my skin red, sensitive and swelling.</li>
            <li>Recently I had a skin irritation that caused the skin to weep and be highly sensitive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very alloey varaly as expected.</li>
            <li>I normally use on my second third day hair if my edges get frizzy.</li>
            <li>Read the many reviews of broken pump and smashed product.</li>
            <li>The gel is OK, the bottle arrived broken, so I had to transfer to another bottle.</li>
            <li>not for ruining expensive sheets, I liked this brand and would have given five stars.</li>
            <li>The more of this I used the worse my hands got.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m writing amazon about this FALSE ADVERTISING.&lt;br /&gt;The top of their page says \\&quot;Fruit Of The Earth 100% Aloe Vera</li>
            <li>and I was looking for something a little more natural to use in it to keep it tame.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly PLUS keeps my scalp from getting dry when other products didn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li>This is a pure form of Aloe Vera, unlike the other brands.</li>
            <li>Pure Aloe Vera without lots of other stuff added that can cause problems.  </li>
            <li>This is huge in my book, as most all of the other aloe products contain harmful artificial colors which are derived from coal tar or petroleum.  </li>
            <li>People exposed to such formaldehyde-releasing ingredients may develop a formaldehyde allergy or an allergy to the ingredient itself, Known human toxicant or allergen, Human skin toxicant or allergen - strong evidence, Cancer - limited evidence!!!!!    </li>
            <li>I often use a combination of moisturizer and this Aloe Very to help moisturize my face and so far, my face hasn&#x27;t been dry and blemishes have decreased significantly.</li>
            <li>They are super white and pale and got burned by the Hawaiian sun.</li>
            <li>I am glad I brought the 24oz, it very hard to find such a lager bottle in the store.</li>
            <li>Unless you are flat out paranoid of preservatives, stop worrying (maybe even trust God a little), save a little money, and buy this cool product that does what it should and does it very well!  </li>
            <li>Turns out it has six other ingredients, some of which I&#x27;d really rather not use on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It might feel sticky when it is first put on the hair, but after my hair is set and dried, it is soft, plus it holds the hair set the next day.</li>
            <li>The only use I could see for this stuff is maybe as a special effect in an alien movie where people are stuck in a preservation tank.</li>
            <li>We live in a dry, windy climate.  </li>
            <li>a small dab goes a long way to secure hair.  </li>
            <li>This is the only brand of aloe gel that I have ever seen that is totally unscented and clear.  </li>
            <li>Most Definitely not best for sensitive skin, it irritates.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Any how went back and bought another Aloe plant I use Fruit of the Earth as lotion makes my skin extra soft but will never use it on a burn.</li>
            <li>Great base for home made natural hair moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Finally started using some Gold Bond Ultimate healing and My hands COMPLETELY cleared up overnight.</li>
            <li>I love the product the only reason I gave it a 3 star rating was because the package came broken and a lot spilled leaving me with like 3/4s of the product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m reporting &amp;#34;Fruit of the Earth&amp;#34;  to the Better Business Bureau for false and misleading advertising that could cause someone to have a toxic allergic reaction resulting in possible death.</li>
            <li>But telling her that people who seem not to admire her so much, in fact, do admire her -- in some small, secret way -- makes her feel as if she&#x27;s done such an amazing job that she&#x27;s somehow wiped out jealousy and pettiness.</li>
            <li>I assumed it was 100 percent pure as the title says, only just now after reading other reviews to I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the few tht has AV as the first ingredient.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Firstly, MONEY: this is INCREDIBLY cheap if you can find it in a store [less than half the price here]</li>
            <li>Almost impossible to find in drugstores large and small, 100% Aloe Vera Gel is unadulterated with all of the alcohol and camphor and other strange substances that do not contribute to the wondrous healing powers of these amazing sugars.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this gel, over the other chemically-based brands.</li>
            <li>My almost 2 year old son has very long hair</li>
            <li>I bought the travel size version of this (exactly the same) and it dried out my skin about a minute after every time I applied it.  </li>
            <li>FEAV takes care of my excessive dry skin much better than any other brand.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product above any other aloe vera gel product on the market.</li>
            <li>but one day they just stopped car-ringing it and replaced it with this green in color aloe that was not as pure as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive since so little is used as it is diluted.  </li>
            <li>Having done a little research, I believe that the whole tetrasodium EDTA scare is a bit of an overreaction.</li>
            <li>Now that that&#x27;s stopped, I can feel that my legs are much much smoother than they were before, leading me to believe I had a million tiny little bumps that the aloe vera gel has removed.</li>
            <li>The reason why this is the best hair gel is simple: It will keep your hair in place, but will never be hard and painful.</li>
            <li>It was so bad that I am speculating that the good reviews were made by some of the makers friends/owners.</li>

            <li> I used these to make &amp;#34;padsicles&amp;#34; that I saw in Pinterest and it was amazing!</li>
            <li> I love it, it works great !</li>
            <li> It feels nice against your skin too!</li>
            <li> I burned the top of my hand, a friend mention putting Aloe Vera on the burn would be the best for the burn.</li>
            <li> Loving it!</li>
            <li> Excellent product for so many things.  </li>

            <li> This stuff is so good .....</li>
            <li> really good deal.</li>
            <li> This is also good for any cuts, burns, and sunburns.</li>
            <li> Fruit of the Earth ruined a perfectly good product,it is not 100% aloe vera gel.</li>
            <li> This item is as good as the aloe gel I used to buy, but still it&#x27;s inexpensive and can moisturize my skin on legs and arms.</li>
            <li> Really good - it also helps with irritation of the skin and psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I often hear aloe is a good home rash treatment.</li>
            <li> It has no alcohol which is good because I&#x27;ve tried the trader joes aloe and that brand contains alcohol which ended up burning my rash and proabably made things worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The 24 oz bottle is a good size for the money.</li>
            <li> Yet good stuff works for all my needs.</li>
            <li> Good value and good quality.</li>
            <li> Good for applying to the skin as a lotion good also as a shaving gel.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years, loved it</li>
            <li> so I think if you want a product that you do not want to refrigerate, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.</li>
            <li> I use it as a moisturizer and it works fairly well for that.</li>
            <li> A good product at a good price,</li>
            <li> Really good for skin after a day in the sun.</li>
            <li> Good Product.</li>
            <li> Good price and delivery.</li>
            <li> On the good side, you get a lot for your money and the bottle is a sturdy well-made pump style that I can reuse.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, just came with a cracked lid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also good for treating sunburn.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I had heard about it as a good styling agent/hair product.</li>
            <li> The quality is always good.</li>
            <li> Good aloe.  </li>
            <li> good price.</li>
            <li> : AVG is almost as good as coconut oil at adding moisture and shine to my hair.</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried aloe, this is a good item to try.  </li>
            <li> fair price for good product</li>
            <li> We loved it.</li>

            <li> It is good on a rash.</li>
            <li> One good thing about it</li>
            <li> Works good on the face,skin and hair.</li>
            <li> Good price for 100% Aloe Vera Gel</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe ANYBODY would leave a good review.</li>
            <li> Bought this item because I heard it was good for razor burn.  </li>
            <li> Quality was good.  </li>
            <li> This is  good product and I will buy it again</li>
            <li> Good product,</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> Smells good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get it why put this toxin in something that is supposed to be good for us and misdirect labeling?</li>
            <li> Good for me</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is the best aloe vera gel i&#x27;ve had, but it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li> This product smells great and is good for many uses including hair.</li>
            <li> This gel is very good, light an not at all sticky like some I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> more concern is the addition of the perservatives/antimicrobials DMDM Hydantoin and Diazolidinyl Urea; these chemicals work by releasing Formaldehyde into the product, which kills any microbes and is great for the product but not so great for you, because Formaldehyde is a potent carcinogen as well as an irritant that can cause allergic reactions.</li>
            <li> It has a wonderful cooling sensation, is not sticky,hydrates the skin beautifully and reduces redness, scars, and works near miracles on cuts and scrapes.  </li>
            <li> Very glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the product and would tell everyone who is receiving radiation treatments to use this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for use on skin and hair for healing of damaged hair, scars on the skin, for maintaining healthy skin and hair.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also no reaction with my scalp and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of this and it has great health benefits too.</li>
            <li> MY hair is growing and I&#x27;m very satisfied because the rogaine didn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li> I use this as hair gel it works great to keep my scalp healthy.</li>
            <li> A great product with many usages.</li>
            <li> love the pump, great size and works well.</li>
            <li> Was very satisfied with this product and it lived up to it&#x27;s claim on the site.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very good and useful!</li>

            <li> So many uses for good aloe at a good price.</li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll probably wonder, as I did, if this stuff will CAUSE more problems than it CURES!</li>
            <li> it has many function, i use it every day!</li>
            <li> I have acne - still!- and this is probably the gentlest, most effective thing I have ever used on my skin!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>

            <li> This is the best buy I have ever found for pure aloe vera gel.  </li>

            <li> this is nice.</li>
            <li> Also saying its 100% gell is kind of a misnomer as it contains preservatives and some Aloe Vera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll say when I mix this with shea butter, my hair develops a nice curl pattern with an overnight twist out.  </li>
            <li> The hand pump is nice too</li>
            <li> Excellent for scars - it really does heal the skin leaving the scar almost non-existent.</li>
            <li> The excellent qualities of this product are very well known.</li>
            <li> A good buy for sure.</li>
            <li> I will be looking for another product that does not contain chemicals or growing my own Aloe Vera plant.</li>
            <li> Nice packaging too, like the pump.</li>
            <li> handy, nice after sun lotion..</li>
            <li> This stuff is nice, I use it in homemade hair gel.</li>
            <li> Nice pump bottle.</li>
            <li> So I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.   </li>
            <li> A necessity making your own lotion and etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thirdly, Face / Pimples: I make my own face mask, but I was still breaking out a bit.</li>
            <li> I bought this item to make my own alcohol-free hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I are making our own hand sanitizer with this aloe</li>
            <li> oh so nice.</li>
            <li> Nice to find aloe that has not been dyed</li>
            <li> which is nice.  </li>
            <li> It goes on kind of sticky, but as it dries, the stickiness goes away.</li>
            <li> the price is wonderful for how much you get.</li>
            <li> good product, I love that it&#x27;s made in the U.S.A.</li>
            <li> Feels nice and cooling on the skin.</li>
            <li> , I leave it on the bathroom counter, and the pump is handy.</li>
            <li> This particular bottle size (24oz) is an excellent value.</li>
            <li> However, I am so excited to be able to use my nuface again!!</li>
            <li> It applies easily and makes my skin feel good without being greasy.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s something in the gel that is very strong.</li>
            <li> holds just fine, but if you run your hands through it will soften up immediately like a mousse...and good for you&#x27;re hair and scalp to boot.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to the folks at Fruit of the Earth for a very good product (in my opinion).</li>
            <li> i use it for my skin and it also works as a wonderful conditioner for my dreadlocks as it is completely natural.</li>
            <li> Best of all, once the gel has rubbed-out, her hair is still soft.  </li>
            <li> Aloe vera is the best, some people might say you can get it from natural aloe vera plant, but i can use this as body lotion too.</li>
            <li> I grow my own Aloe Vera but needed a more convenient application manner.  </li>
            <li> I use it for my hands and it&#x27;s a really good light hair Gel.</li>
            <li> More than that, I use it on my face every day instead of any kind of moisture cream.</li>
            <li> Excellent, natural way to get immediate relief from irritated skin, rash or sunburn.  </li>
            <li> Nice product, you must give a shot :)...</li>
            <li> I liked this product, but not some of the ingredients, and I know you can do better.</li>
            <li> I have had great success using this stuff as an aftershave, in hair masks, body moisturizer, hair gel, eyebrow gel, and of course for rashes and wounds.</li>
            <li> By far the best aloe vera gel I have found for my needs.</li>
            <li> The girlfriend said the clear stuff is the best, I have to agree.</li>
            <li> Great for making my products and at the right price</li>
            <li> now with a pump top even better... love it!</li>
            <li> I use the aloe gel for everything from sunburn to hair gel to aftershave protection, so finding a large bottle like this, especially at a great price, is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> NIce big botte of wonderful aloe vera.  </li>
            <li> Its light, not sticky, great for sensitive or irritated skin and smells great.</li>
            <li> - I settle for the cheap stuff too and this really deserves a good review because it&#x27;s a GREAT product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since made another batch of body cream using Fruit of the Earth Aloe Gel, and as with my first batch, it turned out great.</li>
            <li> Keeps everything nice and clean and smelling nice without chemicals - very important to me.  </li>
            <li> Also, although the label boldly proclaims \\&quot;NO ALCOHOL\\&quot;, you will find that one of the ingredients is INDEED a \\&quot;tri-alcohol\\&quot;!!</li>
            <li> With this use, I can say that my face looks like that of a 410 something and very smooth.</li>
            <li> Not icky, not sticky, just nice and a great price too.  </li>
            <li> I grow my own aloe, easy.</li>
            <li> It is also good for sunburn and seems to help bruises heal more quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a fine product in my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li> this is amazing for a quick overnight pimple treatment!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product for your skin and perfect for natural lubrication!</li>
            <li> This product works great on my hair and I like the large bottle.</li>
            <li> A great product of pure aloe with no additives, cooling and efficacious.</li>
            <li> Just pure aloe, is great.</li>
            <li> wonderful price, great value and 100% pure aloe is the only type I buy.</li>
            <li> Also, the bottle is huge!</li>
            <li> Its more like hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many brands of aloe vera over the decades.</li>
            <li> Either way, I love this product.</li>

            <li> Glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> and I got through my treatments with nothing more than a rozy glow from the radiation.</li>
            <li> Love this, and will buy this again and again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;IT DOES.... make sure it&#x27;s 100% Aloe Vera with no added colors as this can damage some machines....</li>

            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> However this aloe seems to have a better consistency and smell then the dollar store kinds.</li>
            <li> Awesome product at a tiny cost.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love using Aloe Vera.  </li>

            <li> I would say that is a ok product coz it does make your skin more softer&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> IT HAS MANY ADDITIVES.  </li>
            <li> Pleased the way it is working now.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a decade and still love it.  </li>
            <li> I bought Fruit of the Earth Aloe Gel many years ago.  </li>
            <li> and I had to find a spare top to use instead</li>
            <li> I love the product but the pump doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Aloe vera gel is excellent for burns and for the topical use on sking.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a bit more of a pain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the next best thing to growing an Aloe Vera plant.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>

            <li> Has more than 1 purpose in our household.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try as many naturals mention it on their blogs and vlogs.</li>
            <li> This product is ok, but I&#x27;m hesitant to use it and go out in the sun.</li>
            <li> better than Olay</li>
            <li> So glad i was able to get this in a pump.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I was able to contact the manufacturer with a question</li>

            <li> 100% gel and no claim that more than a drop of Aloe is in it</li>
            <li> the greatest sunburn relief next the having an aloe Vera plant!</li>
            <li> Better than most Aloe gels out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera for my horses for MANY years.</li>
            <li> I love this for sunburns because it doesn&#x27;t have fragrance or color added.  </li>
            <li> It worked better than tea tree oil, than honey washing, rhassoul clay, etc.</li>
            <li> more words are required so I am done.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> :) You can get it from Walmart for $4</li>
            <li> Glad I found it (and love what I made - stronger scents</li>

            <li> I am glad that Fruit of the Earth is providing it through Amazon and that there were no surprise ingredients.</li>
            <li> I use it on my skin, but mostly as a setting gel for my hair.  </li>
            <li> It is ok, but no feeling....</li>
            <li> We have used this brand of Aloe Lotion for many years.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s brightened my face and my skin looks so healthy.</li>
            <li> So glad I found it here as could not find it in the retail stores</li>
            <li> I do love the product, I am going to re-order</li>
            <li> , I use it daily, it works wonderfully well.</li>

            <li> I have psoriasis and this stuff has helped in the relief, but it takes many applications to truly be affective.</li>
            <li> The more we neglect it the healthier</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> So much better than hair gels.</li>
            <li> More like, &#x27;they don&#x27;t provide health insurance.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> But I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t  may be the aloe vera gel from the leaf is better.</li>
            <li> and it felt better.  </li>
            <li> there are many websites that tell you all the uses of 100% aloe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was pleased by the deliberate shipping speed</li>
            <li> The price was better than any I have ever paid at a store.</li>
            <li> I was pleased all around.</li>

            <li> This works fine as a hair gel for me.</li>
            <li> love that it dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin felling sticky.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick!</li>
            <li> Read up on those yourself (they are listed in the reviews) but I am \\&quot;personally\\&quot; not worried about these -- this is a great product that has provided many fantastic benefits to me and I intend to continue using this product for as long as I can get it.</li>
            <li> Love it works great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> No it&#x27;s not 100% pure aloe vera, however it&#x27;s quite effective in the year I&#x27;ve used it.  </li>
            <li> I also use a little bit to rub on my head after washing my hair, and then comb it through  as a conditioner and it works great!</li>
            <li> While a little grease-ie for my likes, does an excellent job</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling clean, cool, and healthy.  </li>
            <li> I am a huge Aloe fan.  </li>
            <li> I use this on both of our hair to smooth it out and help it keep twist-outs.</li>
            <li> Great for  facial skin conditioning.</li>
            <li> This one really is smooth like a gel.</li>
            <li> It will heal and restore rather than just smooth away the dryness.    </li>
            <li> Fantastic as an aftersun lotion.</li>
            <li> To top it off it does not leave that greasy feeling - well absorbed.</li>
            <li> We have used this on sunburns and household light burns.</li>
            <li> This gel is light and can be used on the body as well as my hair.  </li>
            <li> Aloe is a great lubricating lotion to put some moisture back and protect the skin.</li>
            <li> It brings fantastic definition to otherwise undefined curls (I&#x27;m African-American with 4a hair).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on it as a sunburn reliever because I&#x27;ve never had sunburn in my life, but as a hair product it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> It is fragrance and color free, which is important when using it as a burn relief.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hands feel smooth and softer than any lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> It works well and keeps the skin smooth inspite of radiation effeects.</li>
            <li> The bottle that I received was slightly different than the one pictured, but in a great way.</li>
            <li> this is a great product for facial moisturizer and sunburns, but every time I order it online and get it there is always spillage perhaps from the changes in elevation during shipping, just seems to be wasteful.</li>
            <li> All I can say is this stuff is FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> great for skin care, especially razor nicks/burns.</li>
            <li> Fit for purpose - Not in my case.</li>
            <li> I might have smooth skin, WHAT?&lt;br /&gt;Finally, SKIN:</li>
            <li> all about it on the great unbiased EWG website (EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep Cosmetics Database &#x3D; [...] ).</li>
            <li> If you can get over that issue, then it is  surely well worth a try.</li>
            <li> though is that it is fragrance free</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s quite light on my hair and doesn&#x27;t leave residue....</li>
            <li> Some of the preservatives and chemicals in this Aloe Gel are worrisome, but overall it works great.</li>
            <li> I use it as a hair gel and to mix oils when i need a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> thanks for encouraging me to grow my own aloe plants.  </li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S NOT ALCOHOL FREE</li>
            <li> Great for the occasional mosquito bite or skin irritation.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s clear and good for my skin</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with the overall benefits of this product and would gladly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of this aloe gel, I purchased this to use on my face because I have really oily skin that breaks out very easily when I use lotion.  </li>
            <li> My new favorite!</li>
            <li> this is pure  and the true way to use aloe.  !!</li>
            <li> Loved it helped my hair become super soft and shiny it also helps with bruises I just ran out of it</li>
            <li> I have used this exact product for many years.</li>
            <li> My most recent order had a pump top, which is a huge plus!</li>
            <li> I rub my feet with aloe every morning to keep them cool, clean and bacteria free (that is why my feet don&#x27;t smell)</li>
            <li> Good for minor burns and is chemical and perfume free, which is good for people with allergies or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great stuff for dry skin</li>
            <li> this stuff is the best i&#x27;ve tried so far, and i&#x27;ve tried alot of different kinds.     </li>
            <li> It helps with my dry skin and great for me DIY hair moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great product for dry skin relief without any chemical additives.</li>
            <li> This product goes on cleanly and has no added scents.  </li>
            <li> Also works great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> Great for hands to, or just dry winter skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this company hires chemist who could think of more natural ingredients to use.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product to use as a hair gel and it has had some pleasant side-effects such as minimizing any sun exposure or sun burn on my head and face</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this Aloe Vera gel because it is 100% pure and is not dyed ....</li>
            <li> BUT I am looking for a more pure product with no GMO&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Great for very dry and itchy skin.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to use with a microcurrent device ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CE6CFLU/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 ) works great and doesn&#x27;t dry out to quickly.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not quite as good as right off the leaf, but it&#x27;s sooooo much better than using lotions, which (even the good ones, many times) have far more dangerous chemicals (and in greater quantity) than this product.  </li>
            <li> Amazing natural healing balm.  </li>
            <li> i love this stuff, it has no artificial coloring, no weird odor, and doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol (doesn&#x27;t separate when you put it on).</li>
            <li> Instead of cool, burns.</li>
            <li> You can also buy drinkable Aloe which is extremely good for your esophagus and stomach, especially if you have GERD.</li>
            <li> This is supposedly non-toxic but like many chemicals used in cosmetics, it&#x27;s not clinically tested and who really knows.  </li>
            <li> its not %100 percent aloe vera gel and now im growing a real aloe vera leaf plant and that leaf heals skin problems better than fruit of the earth products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle and it lasts for a good while.</li>
            <li> Yes, that is true.  </li>
            <li> We always have a bottle of aloe gel in the fridge to help cool and heal the burns.</li>
            <li> and I really believe it does something to make you look better.  </li>
            <li> Since, I&#x27;ve stopped using my rhassoul clay mask so much and mostly wash with grape seed oil, then apply aloevera.</li>
            <li> My skin has been overly bumpy all my life, but I didn&#x27;t really notice because I was always scratching it instead of touching it.</li>
            <li> It will prevent peeling and help cool the burn.</li>
            <li> Check out my full thoughts on why you should use aloe too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li> At night, I wash my face with neem soap bar and extensively apply a good layer of this gel and leave it overnight.</li>
            <li> Good product, big bottle.</li>
            <li> This is the straight stuff and easier to get than managing a plant and whacking off the leaves. :-)</li>
            <li> Product is FULL of JUNK &amp; BURNS my Eyes!!!&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> The Fruit of the Earth Aloe Very Gel helped heal up his sores and many of the scars are fading.  </li>
            <li> IT WILL COOL YOUR SUN BURN.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sticky - true aloe vera isn&#x27;t sticky.  </li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by another cancer patient who is also receiving radiation and it helps with the burns and blistering.&lt;br /&gt;Helps it after treatment, feels cool and reduces some of the pain.</li>
            <li> Good enough for me.</li>
            <li> It still is not perfect ingredient wise, but it keeps my son&#x27;s hair out of his eyes and does not leave his beautiful blond hair crunchy or greasy.</li>
            <li> not a bad thing to say about this product</li>
            <li> The main caution is to make sure that the injury is clean before treatment to avoid infection.</li>
            <li> Have been VERY satisfied, and left feeling clean and mosturized, and not slimy.</li>
            <li> No doubt it would be great for sunburn too, although I don&#x27;t get that anymore as I cover up due to a bought with skin cancer.</li>
            <li> this product, Tetrasodium EDTA is used to keep it nice and smooth and help its not-so-water-soluble components (such as preservatives) dissolve in the gel.</li>
            <li> I tried this gel and have seen tremendous results on my skin.</li>
            <li> but it contains many of the ingredients that are in the many commercial products I am trying to avoid.</li>
            <li> I have a network of artistic cuts on my arms now.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t happen to have a real medical Aloe Vera plant around that you can break a piece off to sooth a burn or cut or scrape, this is the next best thing.  </li>
            <li> I use it for my &amp;#34;sandal feet&amp;#34; in the summer to moisturize them and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mild acid</li>
            <li> Later I mixed it with Shea butter (and some water &amp; oils) and it is still awesome.</li>
            <li> The pump is super convenient.</li>
            <li> quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Quick Delivery</li>
            <li> and super curly hair too</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and has virtually no smell.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;ve faded tremendously</li>
            <li> Quick shipping,and wrapped in bags which was lucky because one of the handles broke a bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep it, may be good for something, but it doesn&#x27;t work on dry skin like my true 100% aloe vera did.</li>
            <li> pure clean light and does not feel sticky after use</li>
            <li> This aloe gel is pretty much the same consistency as the conductive gel from nuface and works beautifully</li>
            <li> Not as good as pure aloe, of course, but better than some of the other products out there.</li>
            <li> I forget: this is a great product for treating dry skin, and has a nice cooling effect on minor sunburns.</li>
            <li> This is a new favorite.</li>
            <li> We live in Hawaii and my kids love to surf.</li>
            <li> It has no color or fragrance added to it, and I have found Aloe to be the best remedie for sunburn and minor to moderate burns in the kitched and around the campfire.</li>
            <li> Pretty dope, but don&#x27;t get to excited and</li>
            <li> Used day after day this spray works GREAT as a very natural leave in conditioner for all of us, while still being used as a styling spray for short hair and detangler for the granddaughters&#x27; longer hair, all in one!  </li>
            <li> I thought from the description I was purchasing a pure chemical free product</li>
            <li> (maybe too well... got a little bit of hypopigmentation now lol).</li>
            <li> We found it for a good price on Amazon and bought 4 large bottles just in case we can&#x27;t get it later.  </li>
            <li> I continued applications several times a day over the next 2 weeks, and the wound healed beautifully, leaving a clean line where it would have scarred.</li>
            <li> It is a great moisturizer for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I PURCHASED A HUGE ALOE LEAF FROM WHOLE FOODS FOR $2.00.</li>
            <li> Economical.</li>
            <li> i love how naturally moisturizing this aloe vera gel is.</li>
            <li> Nice big jug of Aloe!</li>
            <li> :  this is otherwise a decent product that dries very quickly, and makes a non-greasy Hair gel and skin moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Product is great, but pump top was broken off in shipping.</li>
            <li> I love Fruit of the Earth - Clear Aloe.  </li>
            <li> Medically, it has found use in treating acute hypercalcemia, mercury poisoning and lead poisoning.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, and have tried most mousses, gels, and curl creams there are out on the market.  </li>
            <li> This is the first one that 1, is fragrance free, and 2, lists aloe as the first ingredient, which means its percentage is highest among ingredients.</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t feel it was worth the time or effort to return).</li>
            <li> Love this clear aloe vera 100% gel.</li>
            <li> Better if you look for Aloe from a company named \\&quot;JASON\\&quot;, from Jason Natural Products.</li>
            <li> Clears out my blemishes &amp; keeps my oily skin feeling fresh &amp; moisturized.</li>
            <li> Works for me, but I am not crazy about it.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get it anywhere near my eyes and yet somehow it was still able to make my eyes burn and tear up uncontrollably.</li>
            <li> I make my own hair and skin products, including face masks, lotions, leave in and deep conditioners, and AVG will officially be a staple in all of them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , so it&#x27;s worth buying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was not charged for it, but I bought another and the product itself is really nice;  especially in the hotter months.</li>
            <li> A nice savings by buying the larger bottle.</li>
            <li> Well worth the savings and easier to get then sometimes trying to find it at the grocery or pharmacy,</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re golden.</li>
            <li> the large original container.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tocopheryl Acetate: Tocopheryl acetate is a chemical compound that consists of acetic acid and tocopherol, Human skin toxicant or allergen - strong evidence, One or more animal studies show tumor formation at high doses, Suspected to be an environmental toxin and be persistent or bioaccumulative, One or more animal studies show tumor formation at high doses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will need to use it a little more to write more of a full review.</li>
            <li> Very versatile and useful making skin care recipes!</li>
            <li> delivered right away.</li>
            <li> right after you shave</li>
            <li> Price is right.</li>
            <li> Somehow that doesn&#x27;t seem right.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t connect the two because it didn&#x27;t develop right away.</li>
            <li> Cleared up my problem right away.</li>
            <li> , right?</li>
            <li> Arrived right on time.</li>
            <li> Customer reviews are a major factor of why I use Amazon--I like the first-hand user reports, and many of my purchasing decisions are based on these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very large skeptic and</li>
            <li> I have a very large Aloe Vera Desert Plant.</li>
            <li> but they are much less and more harmless than additives found in most brand name products.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t spend a lot of money on such a cheap and easy to find product.</li>
            <li> But still a great product to use year round!</li>
            <li> If you have bug bites, minor skin abrasions or other issues with your skin, this is a wonderful healing protectant.</li>
            <li> It is light, not sticky, and adds just enough body for my fine curly hair.</li>
            <li> I just love this scent free and sinks right in no stickiness.  </li>
            <li> This time arrived quickly, was properly packaged, and most all, exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this gel is good for other things, but I only use it for sunburns.</li>
            <li> oh pure FoTE aloe!</li>
            <li> and this is amazing for  the dry skin.</li>
            <li> The 100% gel works great for bug bites as well as legs with circulation issues such as from diabetes or May Thurner Syndrome or Deep Vein</li>
            <li> works FAST on burns and heals them quickly.</li>
            <li> Quick shipment and the cost was reasonable.</li>
            <li> In theory, it is possible that some carcinogens may become water soluble and hence be more easily absorbed by your skin as well.</li>
            <li> Since this product is 100% natural it makes the process of hair removal much safer and also much more</li>
            <li> Great for my curly African American hair.</li>
            <li> I spent some time looking them up because I wanted to know for my own choice; I should probably just get some aloe vera plants to have the fresh 100% stuff.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble finding it in local stores happy to have it here on Amazon in bulk !!</li>
            <li> An added benefit is that whatever is left on my hands after I apply it to my hair can be rubbed on my face or arms for a double win.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff, not much to say really</li>
            <li> and being a grandma of a 5 year old, it&#x27;s amazing how soft my skin is.  </li>
            <li> I really like it very much !</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but good product.  </li>
            <li> A pretty substantial supply of Aloe Vera, at a very reasonable</li>
            <li> First i used to get it at walmart</li>
            <li> She absolutely LOVES it!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this brand in my local stores, so I am glad to see it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I LOVE FRUIT OF THE EARTH PRODUCTS AND ESPECIALLY THE 100% ALOE VERA GEL.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS SMOOTH, AND NATURAL.</li>
            <li> Many people seem to like this product, but it needs to be labeled properly.  </li>
            <li> First, this is labeled \\&quot;100% Gel\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have never once peeled or had discomfort for more than ~2 days if I start applying this stuff the same day of a burn.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t magic, like instant or anything like that</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what I need it to do.  </li>
            <li> It also keeps my skin smooth and young looking.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It leaves it soft and tangle free without the greasy buildup.</li>
            <li> I only wish they had wrapped the product better because it leaked and the pump did not work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Price is also acceptable, All in all, pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That would be too logical wouldn&#x27;t it?</li>
            <li> bought this product to add to my boutique hair products as I try to get as safe as possible products to my butter-based hair food.</li>
            <li> but, it was a smaller size and a lot more money.</li>
            <li> It contains mostly aloe vera gel but adds additional ingredients such as Tetrasodium ETDA, DMDM Hydantoin, Diazolidinyl Urea, &amp;#34;plus stabilizers and preservatives to insure potency and efficacy&amp;#34; (unnamed).  </li>
            <li> I really really like it!</li>
            <li> I purchased it with Nutiva coconut oil, so I tried styling my hair in twists with them, and my hair came out really defined!</li>
            <li> Aloe vera fixes soo much!</li>
            <li> I used this aloe vera on my acne throughout high school and it works wonders!!  </li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> But adding this to an order to get the free shipping I am once again re-united with an old friend.</li>
            <li> I love this aloe gel especially with the pump as a bonus.  </li>
            <li> Buying more when my current supply is gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be lost if I wasn&#x27;t able to regularly purchase this.  </li>
            <li> I recently switched over to using aloe vera as a moisturizer after my skincare routine, and this product has held up to be reliable and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I Vit E on my skin then cover with this gel and it keeps me from getting windburned and my skin stays soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This was a much better price than I ever found when I was buying it in local stores.  </li>
            <li> But very moistureous!</li>
            <li> And fast!</li>
            <li> It really pissed me off!</li>
            <li> and I really like using it!</li>
            <li> One or more animal studies show effects at moderate doses!&lt;br</li>
            <li> There was a sticker in the back of the bottle when I peeled off, revealed a lot more chemical makeup than what it makes up to be.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I bought this months ago and still have not finished the first bottle.</li>
            <li> and it lives my skin baby smooth and soft</li>
            <li> I am just now finishing my first bottle of this brand and type</li>
            <li> I think I will but more in the future!!</li>
            <li> It is not expensive at all.</li>
            <li> The bottle I got was different from the one in the photo in that it has a pump top, like a soap dispenser.  </li>
            <li> It dries quickly and does not stay gummy and wet like many lotions.</li>
            <li> This large pump is great at home and helps me easily refill the convenient travel sizes, ultimately saving money and time (re-purchasing the small sizes).</li>
            <li> I have a HUGE problem with companies using deceptive advertising by making claims that their products are ALL NATURAL or 100% pure, when in fact they are NOT.  </li>
            <li> Way back I used to buy this brand of aloe but was much more pure.</li>
            <li> but the ingredients have to be a little bit more accurate.</li>
            <li> No perfumes or smells, just clear, clean and soothing.</li>
            <li> It has a clean clear feel once I applied it to my skin&#x27;</li>
            <li> Clean and natural feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad to have a big supply of straight aloe gel.</li>
            <li> The bottle I received actually has a pump style top, which is very convenient to use.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve always used this product for sunburn, minor scrapes, bruises, or burns that occur around the home, so was very fortunate to have it handy when I tripped and fell, hitting one side of my face against a piece of metal as I went down.</li>
            <li> on the positive side, it is made in the USA.</li>

            <li> Now, I see some have taken exception to the fact that it&#x27;s not 100% pure aloe</li>
            <li> I bought this because it said, &amp;#34;Aloe Vera 100% Gel,&amp;#34; which I thought meant it was pure aloe gel.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be buying again, but will be looking for something that really is pure aloe vera.</li>
            <li> I do not use hair gel or hairspray and instead use pure aloe as a gel.</li>
            <li> Lakewood Pure Aloe Gel</li>
            <li> Pure Aloe Gel</li>
            <li> Large bottle.  </li>
            <li> I was in need of pure aloe vera gel and chose this because it was advertised as &amp;#34;pure,&amp;#34; even in the product description.  </li>
            <li> LARGE BOTTLE</li>
            <li> seems to work well, but why not just use pure aloe, e.g., from Trader Joe&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the pure stuff</li>
            <li> /&gt;Carbomer: is a large polymeric chemical composed of acrylic acid monomers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It says it&#x27;s 100% pure Aloe vera gel</li>
            <li> My skin scraped off and put some of this so called pure aloe</li>
            <li> Every purchase so easy and trouble free...</li>
            <li> The fine print on the back of the bottle warns that this product may stain some fabrics and it does.  </li>
            <li> I work construction and this is great for sunburn and other minor burns.  </li>
            <li> and I will agree, the seller is pretty clever to straddle honesty this way.  </li>
            <li> I think every lotion should have that as their main ingredient!  </li>
            <li> and I really owe a large part to this product.  </li>
            <li> I definitely like the fact that a large size is available for purchase, because I use this product whenever I can.</li>
            <li> This bottle is HUGE, too, so it&#x27;ll probably last us forever!</li>
            <li> Well my whole FACE started peeling, then I broke out in bumps.</li>
            <li> I use it daily on the scar left from knee replacement and it not only feels cooling and comforting but also has done a great job in fading the scar.</li>
            <li> : My granddaughter somehow gets her hair VERY tangled and matted during her shower.  </li>
            <li> It really works so you don&#x27;t need so much.</li>
            <li> much healthier and waay cheaper.</li>
            <li> I really like it alot.</li>
            <li> It is working really well for both of us.</li>
            <li> And the only option out there I know of that is fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I only payed $10.09 and got free 2 day shipping with prime</li>
            <li> Although my pump was broken when I recieved it, I am happy that it comes in 24oz.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the reviewers below who described the chemicals.</li>
            <li> I then made the mistake of applying this over my whole face before going to bed.</li>
            <li> Thanks Brian</li>
            <li> It worked very well for me</li>
            <li> It really keeps my eyebrows in place and fades my spots well</li>
            <li> I use this to shave my head and it works very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much healthier and won&#x27;t plug up the pores.  </li>
            <li> thanks alot</li>
            <li> i recommend a real aloe vera leaf</li>
            <li> I now have peach colored stains on my white sheets and light colored tank tops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works VERY well.  </li>
            <li> Just try it, and enjoy its multiple benefits!</li>
            <li> No fragrance, super-absorbant, light, adds just enough moisture without that \\&quot;humid\\&quot; feeling.</li>
            <li> I disagree some of the reviewers saying too much chemicals in this aloe vera gel.</li>
            <li> the thing is this product doesn&#x27;t really keep your skin hydrated.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Purel has been really drying out my hands and using this once a day has made all the difference.</li>
            <li> So gentle.  </li>
            <li> Not sticky and never irritating.</li>
            <li> very soothing.</li>
            <li> Product works very well for me.</li>
            <li> Dogs seem to really like it too.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> No matter how much I caution them to use plenty of sunscreen, now</li>
            <li> but this company is really leading the pack.</li>
            <li> great product but pump came in broken..</li>
            <li> Really helps aide in healing.</li>
            <li> This a very healing product.  </li>
            <li> I really like this Aloe gel.</li>
            <li> Ordered this to use with my NuFace instead of the very pricey gel offered by NuFace.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping and received the correct product</li>
            <li> This product not only contains alcohol (as triethanolamine) which the bottle states it is free off</li>
            <li> Winter will be the real test</li>
            <li> The fumes of whatever is used in this to keep it liquified really irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li> fast drying.</li>
            <li> (if even that much).</li>
            <li> It really helps.</li>
            <li> The aloe vera does this gently with no irritation or residual build up.  </li>
            <li> There is plenty of it, so you can use it as much as you want to.</li>
            <li> Thanks again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten used to bleeding legs, really.</li>
            <li> Works very well for my hair.</li>
            <li> IF YOU HAVE ANY SKIN SENSITIVITIES AT ALL, ABSOLUTELY AVOID THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> so by the time i was ready to use it</li>
            <li> When I wear my hair straight, I put it on before blow-drying and it leaves my hair</li>
            <li> really soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> Label is very misleading.</li>
            <li> It was ok, not what I expected, I will just use it for twist out vs wash and go.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It was tape up, and it wasn&#x27;t pack really well</li>
            <li> He began scratching so much that he would bleed on his clothes and on the sheets and furniture.  </li>
            <li> Whole family uses it.  </li>
            <li> I used the gel for my my whole body from my hair to my feet.</li>
            <li> It does have preservatives, but it works very well.</li>
            <li> Really helped out with the sunburn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very grateful</li>
            <li> This helps ao much to heal skin scrapes and repair sun damage to your skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks for sending this so fast</li>
            <li> Wish I had read reviews more carefully about the chemical additives.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast.  </li>
            <li> IF YOU HAVE THE CHOICE TO PURCHASE THE REAL THING.</li>
            <li> If i find it is drying out to much</li>
            <li> It works, its soothing, and it doesn&#x27;t stink, and its a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> very good,as described and packaged well.</li>
            <li> I found that it really works fast at relieving wrinkles on fingers that come when you have had your hands in water for a while.</li>
            <li> Works very well on the brown &amp;#34;liver spots&amp;#34; on my hands.</li>
            <li> I have a fair, freckled Irish complexion that tends to be too pink and flushed, and, with time, has brought on age spots and reddening of some freckles.</li>
            <li> My hair has finally stopped breaking and is soft and more manageable.</li>
            <li> I am confused how so many people love this stuff?</li>
            <li> The additional make it not pure and some are more toxic than I wanted in a gel.  </li>
            <li> im glad i bought the larger size on line because they sell the smaller sizes of this stuff right now in stores.</li>
            <li> Like so many other products that are still made, but are hard to find in stores, I found this good deal on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good sized bottle of aloe vera with none of the inert embellishments you pay extra for in other brands.</li>
            <li> I felt it was a good deal and didn&#x27;t especially get irate as other reviewers, who didn&#x27;t read the label did.</li>
            <li> It is better than any other brand I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Compare to many other brands</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other aloe products that didn&#x27;t work any better  or as well  than this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a healthy, skin-protecting alternative to shaving cream and other shaving products.  </li>
            <li> Helps heal sunburns, rashes, and many other problems.  </li>
            <li> [Sorry for the rambling! :D]</li>
            <li> I like to use it in my hair and on my skin because other products just have too many chemicals.</li>
            <li> Better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> , I mix it with jojoba oil to put on my face and it seems to keep my skin more moist than other cosmetic products.  </li>
            <li> I have mixed fine loose glitter into it to make cheap glitter gel</li>
            <li> This is still a great aloe vera product despite very minor potential concerns about minuscule quantities of chemical agents that are (presumably) added for thickening and preservative purposes only.  </li>
            <li> If you have convictions that prohibit you from using products with any un-natural chemical ingredients, that is understandable and there are other excellent alternatives (such as Lily of the Desert, which is 99% pure and organic, but also much more expensive).    </li>
            <li> Next best thing to cutting an aloe plant open, but more convenient.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and would highly recommend along with Witch Hazel.</li>
            <li> All replace by other cheap brand with red/green/blue color and funny smell.</li>
            <li> Overall it seems I use more Aloe Vera gel as a natural hair care product than as a natural skin care product.</li>
            <li> First off, I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I use this on my old dogs to prevent hot spots.  </li>
            <li> Barely used it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that useful.</li>
            <li> First, let me recommend, here on Amazon, &amp;#34;Aloe Vera Gel By Earth&#x27;s Daughter&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Lilly of the Valley Aloe Vera Juice&amp;#34; as alternatives to this product for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I used this product to try a wash single and go on my 4c hair and it worked out fine.  </li>
            <li> :) and for those who crying about it not being 100% pure what is?????</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure rubbing blue or green gel on my hair every day would be a great idea. :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m worth it, especially  eliminating the stress from bitching about those other products that I&#x27;d love to throw out.</li>
            <li> This time around there are new preservatives that I am not likeing so much.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the most less chemicals aloe vera gel in none organic class.</li>
            <li> I use it on my dry skin, it could not makes it feel smooth....</li>
            <li> The main reason I bought FEAV was for stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I would be interested to know the exact concentrations of each ingredient in the final product.   </li>
            <li> No razor burn, close shave, and skin is left soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> who needs smoothing from toner when you got this gel, who need those expensive moisturizers which always oily up my skin( i have really sensitive skin and get oily easy), i wash my face with gental face wash and then apply a light layer of aloe vera gel on my face, it like a face mask but stay on your face all day, the gel protects your face from getting too much containmination, provides a clean environment to speed up the healing of acne or scars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying it for many years and have gone through a few bottles, it really does work well.</li>
            <li> If you want to soothe your skin while promoting skin cancer with the Diazolidinyl Urea then have fun, but I&#x27;d imagine only Fruit of the Earth wants that for you as they lead you to believe the Aloe of Vera in this gel is 100% when in reality the BS in this gel is 100%.  </li>
            <li> AVG from GNC works *slightly* better than the AVG from FOTE, but is much more expensive per oz.</li>
            <li> One or more animal studies show classified as toxic effects at low doses, Classified as toxic or harmful (only for products for use on skin; products for use around the mouth</li>
            <li> One or more animal studies show classified as toxic effects at low doses, Classified as toxic or harmful (only for products for use on skin; products for use around the mouth</li>
            <li> Also as I&#x27;m getting older it helps my skin from getting too wrinklelly.    </li>
            <li> Go all natural with Aloe,it&#x27;s to much of a fantastic healer to be mixed with garbage.</li>
            <li> I am pretty satisfied with this product, except for the fact that is feels a little sticky on your skin until it completely dries.  </li>
            <li> ; Online, everyone said it had very light hold, but would give hair a nice shine- WRONG!</li>
            <li> Telling a friend that people have talked positively about her without her knowing always produces an unexpected thrill.</li>
            <li> This product does not contain a whole lot of unrelated ingredients like preservatives, etc.. and is as close to natural aloe vera as I could get without messing with the leaves for myself!  </li>
            <li> Good price for enough gel to last for a long time.</li>
            <li> its better than styling gel because it&#x27;s very moisturizing and won&#x27;t make your hair sticky and stiff.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for scrapes of all kinds.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Well packed - Prompt Delivery - Highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to those treated by radiation for breast cancer.</li>
            <li> Seems like high quality 100% aloe vera.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;product highly.</li>
            <li> It is great for burns and other skin issues, but my everyday use is as hair gel.  </li>
            <li> I tried so many other things and non of them made a DENT on my skin problems, but the AVG fixed it for about 40 hours or so.</li>
            <li> I was surprised with some of the ingredients in this pure aloe vera gel.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not 100% certain if it&#x27;s the direct result of usage or combination with use of an Aloe Vera shampoo yet but have noticed improvements with my ever increasing receding hair line.</li>
            <li> Feels a little better on the skin.</li>
            <li> Secondly, I strongly suggest that anyone considering this product should Google ALL of the other ingredients.</li>
            <li> The real aloe vera gel is known to clear up face pimples and acne</li>
            <li> While baking soda gets my hair clean, it also makes it really dry</li>
            <li> The aloe vera gel is versatile, reasonably priced, and natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a while, and that ONE bump is still there [GRR], but it&#x27;s greatly diminished, and no others have formed!</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and the Aloe works really well for me.  </li>
            <li> and I really like the fact that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> and sometimes I&#x27;ll add a few drops of my favorite body lotion and apply it after my shower.</li>
            <li> Every summer I get a few cases of poison ivy from working in the woods and this product is my favorite skin cover for helping with itching.</li>
            <li> I found my face was red and a lot of skin peeled thanks to this when I first tried it.</li>
            <li> Love it for sunburns and keep some in the refrigerator year round.</li>
            <li> Pure aloe vera gel usually has some light natural coloration (a yellowish tint) and a light, distinct, scent... and if it is of the pure organic nature, the color (and smell) may vary a little from batch to batch.  </li>
            <li> According to reviews by the industry-funded Cosmetic Ingredient Review panel, these cosmetic ingredients can release formaldehyde at levels as high as one-tenth that of the original ingredient (CIR 2006), The International Agency for Research on Carcinogens (IARC) has classified formaldehyde as &#x27;carcinogenic to humans,&#x27; and the U.S. National Toxicology Program has classified it as &#x27;reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen,&#x27; based on emerging evidence in humans and robust evidence in animals (</li>
            <li> People exposed to such formaldehyde-releasing ingredients may develop a formaldehyde allergy or an allergy to the ingredient itself and its decomposition products, Known Human skin toxicant or allergen - strong evidence,</li>
            <li> Human irritant - strong evidence (only for products for use around the eyes, on the skin, or may be aerosolized (airborne))!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Ordered the lidocaine version from the same company and it healed right away plus no pain.</li>
            <li> So cool and soothing, and doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out.  </li>
            <li> Need this to keep in the house for burns and minor cuts and bruises and found if adequate to keep.</li>
            <li> I’m eight months pregnant, and when I rub this on my belly, it keeps my stretched skin from itching.  </li>
            <li> light and cooling for bug bites and other things</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this staple.</li>
            <li> My new humidifier is helping</li>
            <li> Since not a lot volume run out and  I live on campus, I did not claim a return .</li>
            <li> It seems to me me there is a sogn of usage while it shown as new.</li>
            <li> ...AVG has officially beaten raw honey in my 1st place for favorite Skin∧Hair thing ever, and a staple in my leave in moisturizer/detangler.</li>
            <li> I thought about giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the - arguably - slightly misleading label, but the fact is the label is honest and all ingredients are clearly listed on the back for anyone with a brain to check out</li>
            <li> i thought it was going to make my skin very soft</li>
            <li> The first couple of days I only used it as a spot treatment and though it didn&#x27;t work wonders</li>
            <li> It has improved the quality and appearance of my skin and reduced my psoriasis problems on the scalp considerably!  </li>
            <li> Cannot consistently find at local stores</li>
            <li> If it was brown or yellow nobody would buy it because we buy, taste, smell etc with are eyes first so Relax.</li>
            <li> last month scientifically tested dozens of Aloe products and determined that this exact product contains close to ZERO percent Aloe!&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> However, the fact that it is listed first in the ingredients is a total lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Never buy any personal care product without looking here first - it will save your face, your baby, and your family&#x27;s health.</li>
            <li> Has replaced hair gel completely!</li>
            <li> so I applied some to her hair and immediately her hair appeared to have thicken considerably!  </li>
            <li> It helps against acne scars, helps against acne in general, and gets rid of bug bites really fast.</li>
            <li> but if you are using it instead of a moisturizer with sunscreen in it, you are not really getting protection from the sun or the full benefit of aloe.</li>
            <li> My first indication that Fruit of the Earth&#x27;s product was not actually \\&quot;pure\\&quot; was its perfectly clear color.    </li>
            <li> He has jet black, smooth hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it&#x27;s really useful for dry</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s made in the USA which is rare these days on just about any products sold to the general public.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I still had the empty bottle of Fruit of the Earth</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and packaged carefully.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use too much, and I usually dilute it with water, but I tried just using coconut oil one day [not much hold, loads of moisture, some shine], and just using aloe vera gel [no water] one day, and AVG worked amazingly at hold and shine, and gave a bit of moisture</li>
            <li> &quot; meaning that it&#x27;s 100% a substance that is gel-like and nothing more -- at least aloe vera is the first ingredient, but look at the next 5 ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I often use it elsewhere for a cool feeling in place of other moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is full of chemcals - probably toxic (read the other review about this and Google the chemicals) .</li>
            <li> However, FEAV does wash off easily with water which is not so bad because I find it to be so effective that I don&#x27;t need to reapply it.</li>
            <li> There are several companies that make pure aloe vera products.</li>
            <li> This is the only brand of pure aloe vera gel we buy.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the only Aloe products I can find that is almost pure aloe.  </li>
            <li> Large bottle seems to last forever.</li>
            <li> Or pick up your own Aloe Vera plant; they are surprisingly tough and prolific.</li>
            <li> The other reviewers have said pretty much everything, and I don&#x27;t have enough expertise to add much to the discussion.</li>
            <li> It contains pure aloe (the same way pop-tarts contain natural flavors).  </li>
            <li> never stop itching&#x27; problem better than every single other lotion, cream, or medicated gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m transitioning from permed to natural hair, and my 2 year old is all natural.</li>
            <li> i tried it anyway to clear up face pimples.</li>
            <li> I like this non-irritating clear 100% aloe vera.  </li>
            <li> Its clear, non greasy and can be used in a hair or skin.  </li>
            <li> I find this works really well as a facial moisturizer for my adult (32 yo) skin.</li>
            <li> Think about it, would it really be clear if it were 100% aloe?  </li>
            <li> The store brands seem to like to add dyes to theirs, so I have stuck to Fruit of the Earth brand because theirs is clear.  </li>
            <li> I read on the NuFace website that you could also use clear aloe vera gel</li>
            <li> but I prefer the clear product.</li>
            <li> This gel really makes your skin feel soft, and dries instantly.</li>
            <li> As advertised,  totally clear aloe, no alcohol.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking EVERYWHERE for another bottle of Fruit of the Earth Aloe as it is a GREAT skin lotion for suntans and sunburns and everyday use AND is free of artificial dyes and colors.  </li>
            <li> it makes our skin soft.</li>
            <li> Just put a natural preservative in the Aloe gel, that&#x27;s all you need.</li>
            <li> I bought this gel as a natural way to help heal a couple of spots on my face where I had a breakout.</li>
            <li> I used it moisturize my natural African-American hair.  </li>
            <li> With sensitive skin this is what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> Tetrasodium EDTA is a common salt of EDTA, or EthyleneDiamineTetraacetic Acid, and is used in many products (including soaps and cosmetics) as a chelating agent.</li>
            <li> IT HAS NATURAL HEALING PROPERTIES</li>
            <li> I would suggest researching before purchase and that Fruit of the Earth list a complete ingredient list on the sale page.  </li>
            <li> Works well so far.</li>
            <li> Using it as a natural hair gel.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my natural African-American hair.  </li>
            <li> It makes your hair soft and acts like a gel but without that crunchiness.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my natural hair for locking purposes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised none of the product was pumped out during shipping..</li>
            <li> This is not a all natural product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is all natural since it does not need to be refrigerated like</li>
            <li> But it gives me a soft hold that lasts all day</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t believe how soft it makes your skin feel.  </li>
            <li> I have natural 4a/4b hair that has been giving me dryness problems.</li>
            <li> , they have sensitive skin, and it does not cause any irritation or redness.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin and this keeps me soft with out the over moisture</li>
            <li> This one is alcohol-free and does not cause any burning when used on sensitive or damaged shin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it makes your hands feel soft not sticky.</li>
            <li> It makes your hands soft Mmmmm</li>
            <li> Though the old scars exists, they are showing signs of fading out.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> Once all my old marks are gone</li>
            <li> I frequent.  </li>
            <li> My momma&#x27;s hair has been thinning as she is 90 years old</li>
            <li> Has a soft hold if used as a hair gel.</li>
            <li> I know it will last awhile, and is very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> it has not helped my skin in any way so far.</li>
            <li> Natural</li>
            <li> JUST GO TO YOUR LOCAL WHOLE FOODS OR GROCERY STORE AND BUY AN ALOE VERA PLANT OR LEAF.</li>
            <li> IT WILL BE ALL NATURAL AND SINCE ITS KEPT IN THE FRIDGE</li>
            <li> 100% NATURAL.</li>
            <li> We use it to make our natural hair products.</li>
            <li> Now my skin is soft and glowing.</li>
            <li> The green aloe products make my skin more red and irritated, but this is sooo soothing.</li>
            <li> This gel works to cool down and prevent skin breakdown while treating breast cancer with radiation.</li>
            <li> Since aloe is a natural antibiotic of sorts and being that the old formula held up great over long time, not sure why co saw fit to add the few other unwanted ingredients?</li>
            <li> , that would actually stay on my skin and hair instead of the glitter falling right off, like when you mix glitter with regular lotion.   </li>
            <li> It absorbs well providing you give it time, but getting your hands wet right after applying makes them slicker than snot.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but be aware that just because it says pure 100% gel, it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s 100% pure.</li>
            <li> and I saw its clear contents, I knew it was not what I was looking for as pure aloe is not clear.  </li>
            <li> [...] found quite a few products that had significant amounts of Aloe.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I use aloe for EVERYTHING, to make my own hair gel, facial moisturizer, and tons of other HBC needs as I don&#x27;t purchase conventional products.  </li>
            <li> I was after natural gel that i can use in my hair that wont dry it out and would give definition with certain styles.</li>
            <li> It also has no funny smell, no stickiness (only a light residue - typical when using aloe vera - that fades away as it is absorbed in the skin).    </li>
            <li> This product quenches my thirsty skin like no other!</li>
            <li> I was quick to flush my face with water but not fast enough.  </li>
            <li> I have use this for many many years; it helps eased those painful sunburns (burn, peel turn white...</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected according to the description.</li>
            <li> if you read the label too quickly you will miss this little tidbit of information.</li>
            <li> People exposed to such formaldehyde-releasing ingredients may develop a formaldehyde allergy or an allergy to the ingredient itself, Known human toxicant or allergen, Human skin toxicant or allergen - strong evidence, Cancer - limited evidence!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This pure gel is the only Aloe Vera product I buy after trying numerous others.</li>
            <li> I love this gel and the big bottle is hard to find in the grocery stores.</li>
            <li> They were recently bought out and the new chain doesn&#x27;t have it.  </li>
            <li> random fact: its AMAZING for naturally kinky hair.</li>
            <li> This product really cools a heat rash and helps to dry it up.  </li>
            <li> Really has relieved my itching dry skin.</li>
            <li> I believe that the only way to get real 100% aloe is to extract it from the actual plant yourself.  </li>
            <li> For anyone who fights these issues on your feet, I would strongly recommend at least trying this product.</li>
            <li> My hair stays put all day and is very soft the next day.  </li>
            <li> Let me first start off by saying that I do agree with the other reviewers of this product who point out that Fruit of the Earth&#x27;s label is (perhaps) a bit misleading.  </li>
            <li> only thing is that I wish it had even less ingredients in it besides the true aloe vera gel.</li>
            <li> This is one of my secret weapons in keeping long, healthy hair!</li>
            <li> I found another aloe vera gel called Aubrey Organics (not totally free of other ingredients but better) and bought that one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several face moisturizers from big brands such as Aveeno, Olay, Dove, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Although Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera (FEAV) doesn&#x27;t lend itself as purely a face moisturizer, I use it for that reason.</li>
            <li> This product is made from pure aloe, but is not pure aloe.  </li>
            <li> I finally researched the ingredients and found that the second listed ingredient, Triethanolamine, according to the &amp;#34;National Library of Medicine, [shows] strong evidence that Triethanolamine is a human skin, immune system, and respiratory toxicant.&amp;#34; It has been determined that Triethanolamine is &amp;#34;designed for DISCONTINUOUS, BRIEF use followed by THOROUGH RINSING from the surface of the skin.&amp;#34; I threw away the bottle and wouldn&#x27;t use this brand again, especially on &amp;#34;sunburned, dry, or irritated skin,&amp;#34; as the bottle suggests.</li>
            <li> Found this at the Dollar General.</li>
            <li> On the back label it clearly says &amp;#34;100% aloe vera gel&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Sounds crazy, but it actually works really nice!</li>
            <li> That line is now barely visible.</li>
            <li> Bare ingredient.</li>
            <li> It made my skin red, sensitive and swelling.</li>
            <li> Recently I had a skin irritation that caused the skin to weep and be highly sensitive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very alloey varaly as expected.</li>
            <li> I normally use on my second third day hair if my edges get frizzy.</li>
            <li> Read the many reviews of broken pump and smashed product.</li>
            <li> The gel is OK, the bottle arrived broken, so I had to transfer to another bottle.</li>
            <li> not for ruining expensive sheets, I liked this brand and would have given five stars.</li>
            <li> The more of this I used the worse my hands got.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing amazon about this FALSE ADVERTISING.&lt;br /&gt;The top of their page says \\&quot;Fruit Of The Earth 100% Aloe Vera</li>
            <li> and I was looking for something a little more natural to use in it to keep it tame.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly PLUS keeps my scalp from getting dry when other products didn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li> This is a pure form of Aloe Vera, unlike the other brands.</li>
            <li> Pure Aloe Vera without lots of other stuff added that can cause problems.  </li>
            <li> This is huge in my book, as most all of the other aloe products contain harmful artificial colors which are derived from coal tar or petroleum.  </li>
            <li> People exposed to such formaldehyde-releasing ingredients may develop a formaldehyde allergy or an allergy to the ingredient itself, Known human toxicant or allergen, Human skin toxicant or allergen - strong evidence, Cancer - limited evidence!!!!!    </li>
            <li> I often use a combination of moisturizer and this Aloe Very to help moisturize my face and so far, my face hasn&#x27;t been dry and blemishes have decreased significantly.</li>
            <li> They are super white and pale and got burned by the Hawaiian sun.</li>
            <li> I am glad I brought the 24oz, it very hard to find such a lager bottle in the store.</li>
            <li> Unless you are flat out paranoid of preservatives, stop worrying (maybe even trust God a little), save a little money, and buy this cool product that does what it should and does it very well!  </li>
            <li> Turns out it has six other ingredients, some of which I&#x27;d really rather not use on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It might feel sticky when it is first put on the hair, but after my hair is set and dried, it is soft, plus it holds the hair set the next day.</li>
            <li> The only use I could see for this stuff is maybe as a special effect in an alien movie where people are stuck in a preservation tank.</li>
            <li> We live in a dry, windy climate.  </li>
            <li> a small dab goes a long way to secure hair.  </li>
            <li> This is the only brand of aloe gel that I have ever seen that is totally unscented and clear.  </li>
            <li> Most Definitely not best for sensitive skin, it irritates.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Any how went back and bought another Aloe plant I use Fruit of the Earth as lotion makes my skin extra soft but will never use it on a burn.</li>
            <li> Great base for home made natural hair moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Finally started using some Gold Bond Ultimate healing and My hands COMPLETELY cleared up overnight.</li>
            <li> I love the product the only reason I gave it a 3 star rating was because the package came broken and a lot spilled leaving me with like 3/4s of the product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m reporting &amp;#34;Fruit of the Earth&amp;#34;  to the Better Business Bureau for false and misleading advertising that could cause someone to have a toxic allergic reaction resulting in possible death.</li>
            <li> But telling her that people who seem not to admire her so much, in fact, do admire her -- in some small, secret way -- makes her feel as if she&#x27;s done such an amazing job that she&#x27;s somehow wiped out jealousy and pettiness.</li>
            <li> I assumed it was 100 percent pure as the title says, only just now after reading other reviews to I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the few tht has AV as the first ingredient.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Firstly, MONEY: this is INCREDIBLY cheap if you can find it in a store [less than half the price here]</li>
            <li> Almost impossible to find in drugstores large and small, 100% Aloe Vera Gel is unadulterated with all of the alcohol and camphor and other strange substances that do not contribute to the wondrous healing powers of these amazing sugars.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this gel, over the other chemically-based brands.</li>
            <li> My almost 2 year old son has very long hair</li>
            <li> I bought the travel size version of this (exactly the same) and it dried out my skin about a minute after every time I applied it.  </li>
            <li> FEAV takes care of my excessive dry skin much better than any other brand.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product above any other aloe vera gel product on the market.</li>
            <li> but one day they just stopped car-ringing it and replaced it with this green in color aloe that was not as pure as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive since so little is used as it is diluted.  </li>
            <li> Having done a little research, I believe that the whole tetrasodium EDTA scare is a bit of an overreaction.</li>
            <li> Now that that&#x27;s stopped, I can feel that my legs are much much smoother than they were before, leading me to believe I had a million tiny little bumps that the aloe vera gel has removed.</li>
            <li> The reason why this is the best hair gel is simple: It will keep your hair in place, but will never be hard and painful.</li>
            <li> It was so bad that I am speculating that the good reviews were made by some of the makers friends/owners.</li>
            <li> I used this as the base to make my own chemical free (added a few essential oils) sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> &amp; it is helping with a combination of other natural essential oils.</li>
            <li> (W∧X∧Y∧Z for all you logical people out there!), but usually they can only do one or two things, and not very well.</li>
            <li> I have also started using it as hair gel which gives a light wet texture than a dull grey one.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find any large bottles of this locally and the small bottles were twice the price.</li>
            <li> but there are other ingredients in it that I was surprised to see once I got it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to go all natural and wanted just aloe without any other ingredients.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my eyes sting when I apply it to my cheeks (even though I am very careful not to get it anywhere near my eyes).  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and am very careful with any products I apply.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a tremendous product, especially compared to the other expensive products I have tried, and this one really works for me.     </li>
            <li> I normally mix with a little shea butter when I groom my locs.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars is the products into making it, which indicate that it has other ingredients rendering it as less pure.</li>
            <li> and I will be more wary before buying similar products in the future and will NOT do business with a company like Fruit of the Earth who tries to be so sneaky and borders on dishonesty.</li>
            <li> I actually prefer it to regular gel because I feel like it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> when I&#x27;m not in the office, I let it be..but need to keep it under control when I&#x27;m acting &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; - was super tired of mega-sticky hair glue, but mousse just didnt hack it...</li>
            <li> I have also taken a bottle to work, I work in a factory with machines that run at a temp of at least 350 degrees and if you accidentally hit the hot steel molds (accidents do happen even with safety equipment)</li>
            <li> As an alternative I suggest exploring your local health food or supplement store and searching for an aloe vera gel that does not contain any strange unpronouncable/chemical/synthetic ingredients.  </li>
            <li> This perceived danger is the same, however, if you stay in the bathtub for too long.</li>
            <li> (2 oz doesn&#x27;t last long if you are using 5+ days a week).</li>
            <li> but I must say it last me a long time.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes without any residue or greasy feeling, does not weigh my hair down and makes it hair feel really soft.</li>
            <li> I use the product on my feet because of dry and cracking skin, especially in winter.</li>
            <li> Use it daily on my dry chapped legs.</li>
            <li> I have black and have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> Product was fine, maybe a bit on the expensive side for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s aloe, no smell, no funny green color, did exactly what I needed it to do (spent a week at the beach).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product is not readily available at most stores, especially in Hawaii.  </li>
            <li> Goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Use it for scratches, insect bites, rashes, all skin irritations and minor wounds .  </li>
            <li> It works well for minor wounds, mixtures for hair care and skin care.  </li>
            <li> EDTA is a chelator; it is not really a problem either as such.   </li>
            <li> The soothing effect was immediate, and after hourly applications, the gash had closed by the next morning.</li>
            <li> I use it in my hair, bug bites, minor cuts, burns, and also if you use it</li>
            <li> Since the water is harsh on my skin, I will use it strictly for my natural curls to loosen them up.</li>
            <li> It can be used for a long time.</li>
            <li> Will continue to buy as long as it is sold.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff everyday on my sensitive skin, and it works wonders for redness and moisture.</li>
            <li> After a long day outdoors, I often blend this gel 50-50 with hand lotion</li>
            <li> minor thing:</li>
            <li> and I think cheaper in the long run).  </li>
            <li> even you did not directly put it if you put on your nose skin</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this was not entirely natural.</li>
            <li> used it for a long time.</li>
            <li> and I can use it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I used this up north in civilization and was really disappointed this product along with just about everything else worth having wasn&#x27;t available down here in rebel land.</li>
            <li> I was definitely skeptical when I saw a tube of this stuff on the shelf at my local drugstore boldly proclaiming</li>
            <li> With some other moisturizers such as Aveeno, they are harder to wash off and last longer, but after rinsing my face, dry skin reveals itself more and I will desperately need to reapply moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It also relieves redness and irritation that my skin gets from other brands or irritation from externalities such as people&#x27;s perfume or sweat at the gym.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how much is actual aloe vera and how much is other ingredients.</li>
            <li> I use this in place of hair gel and for other occasional moisturizing needs.  </li>
            <li> I always use aloe vera as a facial moisturizer along with other products.  </li>
            <li> only one other product has sort-of helped me</li>
            <li> that might not be the case, but I can&#x27;t explain what else could cause the sudden feeling of extreme smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how much is actual aloe vera and how much is other ingredients.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t bother looking up the other five chemicals though, one toxin was enough for me.</li>
            <li> (for reference I have soft curly black hair that is very fragile) and even into the next if I&#x27;m being lazy at night.</li>
            <li> There was little to no white residue left over after it was completely dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding the clear gel at any local stores</li>
            <li> It will take you a very long time to use up this bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product to help take care of blemishes as well help lock in moisture in my face during these dry winter months.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face after shaving and any &#x27;dry&#x27;spots during the winter.</li>
            <li> On dry hair or your eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Spend a lot of time in the sun and skin  gets dry and itchy sometimes.</li>
            <li> We use this for dry skin, foot care, insect bites, sunburn, rash, and scraped elbows or knees.</li>
            <li> Without it, my hair would be dry feeling.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone--I even use this on my dogs&#x27; bellies when they get a bite, or have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Helps with dry skin and is cooling when applied.</li>
            <li> I do apply 5 and 6 times per day on dry itching skin.</li>
            <li> and it kinda gel that dont really dry to your skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also helped some dry skin on my arms</li>
            <li> But this aloe gel still leaves my face dry and leaves a lot to be desired.  </li>
            <li> I also mix this with lotion and coconut oil to put on my dry legs, arms, hands, etc.</li>
            <li> They continued to dry and even started cracking.</li>
            <li> While we should all be concerned about the chemicals used in modern-day products, the fractional amount in this product coupled with the fact that it can be used very sparingly--a little goes a long way compared to ordinary hand lotion</li>
            <li> It does well for smoothing my hair back when I wear it up, and it brushes out very nicely at night without leaving a that nasty residue feeling.  </li>
            <li> The next day I woke up my left eye swelling like half of the egg, like somebody punched me on the eye, the area of the eye was red and dead skin peeling off .</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get it for hair regrowth but wanted an alternative natural hair gel that didn&#x27;t have any additional chemicals that I believed might be causing my past hair loss.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands of Aloe Vera gel by other companies and they did not compare to the high quality of the Fruit of Earth brand and other brands of aloe vera gel tend to blend in other unnecessary ingredients, while this brand is pure.  </li>
            <li> But every other aloe vera product I could find had other ingredients - particularly alcohol - which I did not want to apply to such delicate tissues.  </li>
            <li> The breakouts have stopped and now there is hardly any sign of new acne buildups.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so the bottle will last you ages!</li>
            <li> The picture resembles my previous bottle with just a plain cap, however I was shipped the new bottle with the convenient pump.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first, since I am not a fan of gel for daily use.  </li>
            <li> The gel that came with my fetal doppler is super expensive and I read online that Aloe Vera Gel will work just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband has very dry skin this worked wonders</li>
            <li> My husband has VERY DRY skin.  </li>
            <li> Gret for sun burns, any type other burns, minor scratches etc.  </li>
            <li> As for the concerns over chemical agents contained in this product, I personally think there might be a little bit of over-reaction in that regard.  </li>
            <li> I even apply with a little water for extra cooling.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve been a little extra sore today, so after my shower I ran some of this gel over the work.</li>
            <li> So I went out a bought a little Aloe Plant, The plant soothed and cooled the burn, after a short time I had almost used up all the stalks from the plant</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t really know [seriously, the itchy thing was not fun],</li>
            <li> I plan to use them in my hand and knees where I see a lot of dry skin due to chemo effect.</li>
            <li> I was desperate for something light, not tacky that wouldnt make my skin feel like it was sticky and melty.</li>
            <li> Negative reviews about all the additives gave me pause, but my skin is not overly sensitive</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I did not get it in a larger size!</li>
            <li> It has other ingredients, the names of which are too long and foreign to even write, plus it has stabilizers.  </li>
            <li> Read the packaging carefully.</li>
            <li> ORDER CAME FASTER THAN EXPECTED</li>
            <li> I use 2-3 pumps mixed with a few drops of vitamin E oil</li>
            <li> AND IF I WERE ON A STRANDED ISLAND, AND COULD ONLY BRING A FEW ITEMS, FRUIT OF THE EARTH ALOE VERA</li>
            <li> I bought this ages ago and never really got around to using it.</li>
            <li> Came sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> such, by law this product must change the ingredients list to list Aloe dead last.&lt;br /&gt;Shameful</li>
            <li> I think this stuff really helps the skin buy putting an ever so thin cover and hastens healing.  </li>
            <li> Works well to heal minor sunburn, and rough areas left over from acne and small cuts.&lt;br /&gt;Almost odorless.  </li>
            <li> and it arrived even sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Just use the money you would have spent in s+h and drive to Walmart</li>
            <li> Arrived and works as expected.</li>
            <li> All but one leaked and two plastic bottles were partially crushed.  </li>
            <li> Seller shipment came before expected.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Fruit of the Earth is the only brand of Aloe Vera  gel I can find that is natural, without a lot of unnecessary scents and chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not certain if it clears stretch marks.</li>
            <li> this word because there are no pure aloe vera gel in the market even for organic aloe vera gel.</li>
            <li> This is not pure aloe gel.</li>
            <li> The price is right as well in a field of products which are known for being unnecessarily expensive.</li>
            <li> I personally am not too concerned about the presence of the (few) chemical additives in this gel, but please read other reviews for the discussion on chemicals in the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;it is a very soft and thin texture, but if you wanna use for dry skin.</li>
            <li> With the dry season here locked in the house by Wisconsin&#x27;s bitter winter, I&#x27;ve found the old pins just are plum irritated and irritating.  </li>
            <li> I am sure that would have been less painful.</li>
            <li> I did find the product for less money at a local store but it had green coloring in it</li>
            <li> I starting breaking out no more than 5 minutes after putting this on my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will go without rather than use other brands........</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to apply globs of it as I do with other brands.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEAV also works on other areas of the skin.</li>
            <li> Even in small quantities these things can cause allergies or other health problems, and it only takes one mutation to start a cancer.  </li>
            <li> &quot; indeed it is, but there are other additives in the mix.    </li>
            <li> I like it because it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky film in my hair as other aloe vera gels I&#x27;ve tried seem to do.</li>
            <li> But you should check other people&#x27;s reviews before you buy it.</li>
            <li> I even use it as a hair styling gel, as it doesn&#x27;t remain greasy or sticky, like other styling gels tend to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE TRIED OTHER BRANDS</li>
            <li> That being said, the web page description is misleading, there are indeed other ingredients which are listed on the label but not by %</li>
            <li> The other ingredients tend to counteract the aloe vera and have a drying effect.</li>
            <li> I also combine with other lotions to up the healing qualities.</li>
            <li> I pitched my tube out immediately after reading what this other stuff is.</li>
            <li> Just as expected!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Currently trying to find another use for it other than a trash.</li>
            <li> I prefer this 100% untouched aloe vera gel as it does not contain lidocaine or other numbing agents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wish I had looked beyond the subtitle &amp;#34;100% Gel&amp;#34; as there are a number of other ingredients added that I prefer not to use.</li>
            <li> The store only sell small one.</li>
            <li> I should have read the description and other reviews which talked about the ingredients and I would have known.  </li>
            <li> use with nu face and does not irritate like some other brands.</li>
            <li> I did notice that it had stabilizers and other addditives to keep bacteria from growing in it</li>
            <li> Other reviews state that it&#x27;s not 100% aloe vera,</li>
            <li> This product contains Urea and other chemicals that were not indicated by the &amp;#34;100% pure&amp;#34; labeling.  </li>
            <li> the leaves to help wth burns, and other skin problems.</li>
            <li> That being said, the web page description is misleading, there are indeed other ingredients which are listed on the label but not by %</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s NOT 100% Aloe Vera, it has a bunch of other chemicals in it including tetrasodium ETDA, which is made from formaldehyde.</li>
            <li> These bites usually leave a lasting scar for up to 6 months.  </li>
            <li> It is not sticky and tacky feeling like some other gels.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little dry.</li>
            <li> The bottle was half crushed too, even though the box had NO damage.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;EDTA itself will actively bind with metal ions.</li>
            <li> Worse than anything you will pick up at CVS, Wlamart etc... and more expensive.  </li>
            <li> I bought this a few months ago for some dry itchy patches of skin.</li>
            <li> Not to mention what everyone else has- definitely not pure aloe vera!</li>
            <li> However, I usually buy this brand aloe vera gel from Walmart stores as it is half the price around $5.00 after taxes for the same size bottle of 24 oz.  </li>
            <li> Although I have no scientific proof but my facial skin has less small wrinkles.</li>
            <li> and I love it because there isn&#x27;t a bunch of other crap it in, and it doesn&#x27;t get flaky looking in my hair.</li>
            <li> There was not enough bubble wrap or other packing material to keep the heavy bottles from moving around excessively inside the box, which caused the pumps to engage and pump out gel.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about \\&quot;significant\\&quot; cancer dangers, but I doubt the other reviewers who worriedly shout \\&quot;AVOID!\\&quot; are scientists on the subject either.</li>
            <li> It must have some preservative!!It&#x27;s hard to find in my local store now.</li>
            <li> Hard to find this locally.</li>
            <li> I like using it as eyebrow gel and putting it over dark spots on my legs.</li>
            <li> moisturizes and doesn&#x27;t leave oily residue ... absorbs into skin as long as not used excessively</li>
            <li> I had some dark spots that went away after using this.</li>
            <li> and hopefully I can give a update a month or two from now and all of my dark spots will be gone.</li>
            <li> Heck, a breath of &amp;#34;fresh air&amp;#34; has more crap in it than this stuff does.  </li>
            <li> I bought it thinking it was 100% Aloe Vera and not full of other crap, should have known better and checked the ingredient list rather than trusting the 100% &amp;#34;Gel&amp;#34; claim.</li>
            <li> bought this for scar care a while back but never used it because I still had a lot of silicone gel left and someone told me it&#x27;s not good to use other products on scars unless you are at least 8 months post op</li>
            <li> The healing properties are obvious.&lt;br /&gt;There has to be some preservative quality added; this company has it down.</li>
            <li> It holds down frizz without looking unnatural.</li>
            <li> I like 100% Aloe Vera Gel, not 100% gel that contains aloe vera and a bunch of other additives!</li>
            <li> Not to mention it heals scabs extremely well!</li>
            <li> Pump container works extremely well!</li>
            <li> No more dry hair ends.  </li>
            <li> I have used aloe vera straight from the plant direct to skin without issue, so I am not sure what it was in the ingredients in this product that I reacted badly to.</li>
            <li> It does not have a bad odor and actually seems to work really well.</li>
            <li> My review is not going to be typical as my use of this product is not the norm.</li>
            <li> I got this at my hospital pharmacy and the price was slightly cheaper.</li>
            <li> There was a slight breeze and some of the mist got on my face.  </li>
            <li> mart at much less.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product in previous incarnations by this company for over 30 years and still like it even though there is no Aloe in it.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> Agreed with a previous review about cause swelling to the eye.</li>
            <li> Not your typical gel, this product soothes and cools.  </li>
            <li> it really helps hydrate your skin, the only complain i could say is it kinda painful on cut and in your eyes</li>
            <li> , then I clip off half an inch, and forget it.</li>
            <li> Literally less than 10 seconds</li>
            <li> Going back and forth wearing it straight and curly can make my hair really dry, and hate having to put a lot of product in my hair to prevent breakage.</li>
            <li> False advertising, pure and simple and should be illegal.</li>
            <li> I usually get my Aloe Vera Gel in 8 oz bottles at the health food store but they have been getting harder to find.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t have a mess in my package</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s flat-out NOT TRUE, and furthermore, this product will harm you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Upon using this product she ended up in the fetal position crying due to the increased pain!</li>
            <li> I bought a NuFace mini and the NuFace conductive gel is too expensive to buy a new tube every 2-4 weeks</li>
            <li> Makes the process less messy and faster for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not just little bumps--</li>
            <li> Totally not worth it!</li>
            <li> It does have a little sting to it when applied but</li>
            <li> The text on the bottle is a little misleading.</li>
            <li> But I think there is a little tightening of the skin as it dries.  </li>
            <li> I have a little itching on my face</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t go out on this \\&quot;venture\\&quot; due to price, but dicovered at B&amp;BW that the sizes of hand sanitizers were getting extremely small and the scent selections slimmer.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;And a little bit smell.....</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, DO NOT get these on your hands because they seem to dry up my hands a little (even though theoretically they&#x27;re supposed trap moisture - a little weird there).</li>
            <li> Not very sexy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced that with any other aloe product I&#x27;ve used in the past which is what raised a red flag for me to dig a little deeper.  </li>
            <li> This is also why you shouldn&#x27;t ingest it: since it is a decalcifying agent, it is not good for your bones in the long run.</li>
            <li> like the green goo.</li>
            <li> but it contains a few preservatives to compensate for the lack of alcohol</li>
            <li> Like others I agree they shouldn&#x27;t call themselves &#x27;Fruit of the Earth&#x27; if their product is heavily processed with preservatives.</li>
            <li> The resulting 3\\&quot; gash, which narrowly missed my eye, ran from the corner of the eye to my cheekbone.</li>
            <li> Personally, I consider it criminally misleading.</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it for burns but am treating my skin from winter harsh weather</li>
            <li> Use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> hope this information will set a few minds at ease.</li>
            <li> And this isn&#x27;t dyed green and has no alcohol added.</li>
            <li> It has no smell to it and it does not leave any white residue behind.</li>
            <li> have turned a few friends on to it</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m now using it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I use this product everyday.</li>
            <li> But this gel does not fit the bill.</li>
            <li> I bought this after receiving quite a few sun burns during the summer, and this gel helps relieve the burning sensation.</li>
            <li> I am outdoors everyday.  </li>
            <li> After 3 days, I can firmly say it appears to be gone.</li>
            <li> I still keep a few of the cactus plants around for aesthetics, and just in case.  </li>
            <li> lotion is a bit sticky after application, but this goes away in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> His dermatologist prescribed a lotion that works, but my husband doesn&#x27;t like it feeling heavy and greasy.  </li>
            <li> The only problem was that the bottle is shipped without a box and the pump got completely broken in shipping.  </li>
            <li> waste a lot of money \\&quot;exploring\\&quot; products that I don&#x27;t use up.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday to shave and as hair gel.</li>
            <li> The picture description is not accurate.</li>
            <li> Be wary of other products that have little or no actual aloe vera in them, even though they have &amp;#34;aloe&amp;#34; in their name.  </li>
            <li> It contains formaldehyde, diazolidinyl urea (formaldehyde releaser), and triethanolamine (very bad for allergies, immunotoxic), and more.</li>
            <li> Anyway, mixing some of this gel with baking soda, and a little water to make it go further, and my hair is clean, shiny, and manageable without the horrible dryness it had from just the baking soda.</li>
            <li> I had a bad rash an needed aloe gel right away.</li>
            <li> Although I have bought a lot of this product in the past when it was less adulterated, I&#x27;ll never buy any Fruit of the Earth Product again.    </li>
            <li> It gives definition to my curls but does not make them stiff.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find plain aloe vera gel in the stores.  </li>
            <li> No strong odor.  </li>
            <li> To tame frizz before drying or for air-drying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It may be in small quantities, but how about not sneaking a little bit of carcinogen into the product we are trying to use to make us healthier eh?  </li>
            <li> Burned my finger bad today with the hot oil frying tortillas for nachos.  </li>
            <li> Scarification care includes chemical irritation &amp; exfoliation, to encourage the scarring, and it can be pretty painful.</li>
            <li> Those other ingredients that some complain about are very small in percentage and used to preserve the product and retain consistency.</li>
            <li> It works by releasing small amounts of formaldehyde, a toxic and carcinogenic substance used to embalm dead bodies.</li>
            <li> After just 2 days, I can already see the scar diminishing and the hard knot has softened, though my skin is still slightly raised</li>
            <li> all natural aloe without that extra crap</li>
            <li> You just need a small amount, and this bottle lasts awhile.</li>
            <li> Non alcoholic aloe was recommended by cancer therapist to treat radiation burn on my neck.</li>
            <li> I used no more.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they also feel it is necessary to add Carbomer 940, a synthetic thickener, to change the consistency.  </li>
            <li> I keep a small container of it in my kitchen so that if I accidentally burn myself I don&#x27;t have to run all the way upstairs to get</li>
            <li> I have used the usual brands and store brands for years.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they&#x27;re NOT formulated the same.  </li>
            <li> But not sure I would buy this aloe again.</li>
            <li> Dont get the icky green stuff-</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using this product for past 5 years.  </li>
            <li> they used to sell it at our Walmart but no more...</li>
            <li> so I am not doing 4 stars as it is just a small item to wash hands after apply.</li>
            <li> In the past, I did cut off some&lt;br /&gt;of</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the Aloe and/or the cooler weather that is helping that problem.</li>
            <li> This gel makes a great base for the water base moisturizer I make with it.</li>
            <li> I thought that I was always going to have at least three [small] pimples at any given time.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this is not pure aloe and when I used it on the raw skin it caused severe discomfort.</li>
            <li> Hard to find</li>
            <li> Hard to find at the stores in my area</li>
            <li> effect is to make sodium, calcium and magnesium salts, as found in hard water, water-soluble.</li>
            <li> HAD A HARD TIME FINDING THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Fruit of the earth, hardly.</li>
            <li> On my hair it doesn&#x27;t leave any flakes and it doesn&#x27;t leave a hard finish.</li>
            <li> I learned this the hard way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been hard to find in the retail stores lately, so I tried here.</li>
            <li> but I still have leg patches that felt almost as bad as an old case of singles I had years ago</li>
            <li> The reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because the label is confusing.  </li>
            <li> --I think it&#x27;s not a safety hazard, at least to me.</li>
            <li> These chemicals are used commonly in cosmetics AND there are competing opinions regarding their safety.</li>
            <li> aloe vera juice needs to be and there is at least one preservative in it.</li>
            <li> The skin stayed moisturized at least.</li>
            <li> Not Real Aloe vera... seems fake..</li>
            <li> The website gives at least a dozen stores to purchase---cannot be found.  </li>
            <li> I applied a thick layer of this gel, after cleaning with antiseptic.</li>
            <li> This is way to thick of a gel, when they said 100% gel they weren&#x27;t kidding.</li>
            <li> I tried this aloe vera for slow healing severe sunburn.</li>
            <li> Living by the beach you need slow.</li>
            <li> They may not be so bad, but Diazolidinyl Urea should not be on there plain and simple.  </li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s Aloe Vera Gel.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when local retailers quit carrying this product and started using aloe vera products with green colouring and other additives in it.  </li>
            <li> In small writing it says no animal testing, but Thiethanolamine have already been tested on animals and it game them cancer.</li>
            <li> Serious homeopathic healing.  </li>
            <li> I had some serious acne since 1.5 years.</li>
            <li> After using this, following sun exposure, my skin seemed to become red and terribly irritated.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s bad enough that the label says 100% Gel when it&#x27;s not, but even the description gave no indication of the added ingredients.  </li>
            <li> We purchased this product when my wife had an extremely bad sunburn with blisters and open sores.</li>
            <li> My one complaint is the pump bottle came to me with a broken pump.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shame on Fruit of the Earth for putting all this crap which MIGHT BE carcinogenic in their aloe which people use because they want a NATURAL</li>
            <li> The whole area was swollen and very painful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tetrasodium EDTA: (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) is a chelating agent, used to sequester and decrease the reactivity of metal ions that may be present in a product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> product is very hard to find in stores, so I have to order it online.</li>
            <li> This product is very hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> My skin had a bad reaction to this product and almost became dry after every usage.  </li>
            <li> Aloe isnt green!!!</li>
            <li> There is some unhealthy stuff in there.&lt;br /&gt;Remember any garbage can be marketed as 100% anything</li>
            <li> I like that it has a pump, although mine arrived broken</li>
            <li> Also, it burned my eyes worse than anything I have ever used before.</li>
            <li> my skin got 1OO% times worse after using it for 2 weeks as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> They were poorly packed.  </li>
            <li> We are not happy with the experience because of this.</li>
            <li> but its ingredient list is way too scary.  </li>
            <li> I was unable to find any products in drug stores or department stores that match the purity of this product.</li>
            <li> in all seriousness, wtf.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely disappointed in this purchase - I should have looked past the information provided on Amazon for the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i always thought aloe was suppose to help with acne, hyper pigmentation, and scarring; however, using this proved me wrong.</li>
            <li> The manufacturers should be ashamed of themselves, and held to account, for blatantly misleading advertising.</li>
            <li> After I unpacked the package, I found it was broken!</li>
            <li> applied mask  twice/thrice a week, along with this Aloe Vera gel which I use every night without fail.</li>
            <li> gave 4 stars to this product because it is doing the job which expensive chemical products failed to do.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find 100% aloe in stores.</li>
            <li> It feels the same weight as those terrible makeup primers and isn&#x27;t harmful or oily like lotions.  </li>
            <li> This turns out to contain tocopherol acetate, which can be very irritating to the skin.</li>
            <li> I had terrible dry itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> This product is crap, it is not a hundred percent aloe vera gel, AND has nasty chemicals like urea which is completely carcinogenic.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed and annoyed when I found out</li>
            <li> Gel\\&quot; but the bottle does not contain 100% aloe, it contains a gel which has a bunch of (possibly dangerous) additives added to it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As soon as I applied Fruit of the Earth to the burn it stung like crazy</li>
            <li> Crazy to me.  </li>
            <li> This product is dangerously misleading.</li>
            <li> you have a crazy idea and wonder if this stuff will work, it probably will.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, this aloe gel burns MUCH worse than dousing my cuts in alcohol!!</li>
            <li> I got an awful mosquito bite that swelled to the size of a silver dollar and was a hard knot to the touch.  </li>
            <li> It was one of those flakey blotchy rashes that is usualy caused by bad dandruff and are often treated with medicated hydrocortisone cream of 1.5% to 2.5%.</li>
            <li> Over a year ago, I got a stung by a mosquito on the nose, so bad, the pus was releasing.  </li>
            <li> and I had a bad skin reaction to radiation.</li>
            <li> Price wasnt bad.</li>
            <li> On a particularily bad week where I was ruining the sides of my jeans in record time, I bought some AVG from GNC, when I got home</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to give the aloe a bad review because it was not designed to work for what I was using it for, so the 4 star review.</li>
            <li> and it does not have a bad smell.</li>
            <li> I have notice my acne(which will be getting painful and swollen) stop swollen after using this gel 3 times a day after cleaning my face.</li>
            <li> painful bite.</li>
            <li> and then they come home with painful sunburns.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the nerves and muscles become painful, but when i apply a generous&lt;br /&gt;amount of Aloe Vera Gel, the pain and tingling disappear.</li>
            <li> It was itchy and painful and ugly.</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed to learn it is 100% Gel NOT 100% Aloe Vera.</li>
            <li> When I \\&quot;took care\\&quot; of it, the leaves rotted off at the base.</li>
            <li> My whipped body cream, which contained some very expensive oils and butters, turned out awful with the junk I got from the store.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to the terrible peopel rating this product badly ...</li>
            <li> have arthritis and when it travels to my feet it can be very painful.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s awful in store</li>
            <li> This is a horrible product that is NOT 100% ALOE!  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s made me miserable</li>
            <li> [it was a lotion by Lubriderm, I believe] but it smelled horrible</li>
            <li> but it was horrible for me.</li>
            <li> , it wasn&#x27;t a horrible leak.</li>
            <li> I am appalled!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff for defining my curls (Curls I didn&#x27;t know I had! I have 4C hair by the way). Also, this is great for cuts, burns, and the like. The reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because the label is confusing.  100% Aloe Vera Gel? Of course people take it as it being 100% Aloe Vera and the company knows that. With that being said, I would not use this on your face. I starting breaking out no more than 5 minutes after putting this on my face. Not just little bumps-- some are big pimples so beware.</li>
            <li> The best aloe gel out there.  My second bottle and won&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff for dry skin</li>
            <li> Instead of cool, burns.</li>
            <li> Excellent seller. Great product. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Its more like hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li> This product is good for everything love this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American and I purchased this to help get rid of stretch marks. I started using it on my face. Boy Ole boy what a mistake. Aloe is in plenty of facial creams and is suppose to get rid of finelines. Well my whole FACE started peeling, then I broke out in bumps. I stopped using it immediately.</li>
            <li> I use it daily on the scar left from knee replacement and it not only feels cooling and comforting but also has done a great job in fading the scar.</li>
            <li> great product. delivered right away.</li>
            <li> We bought this for sunburn relief, and it&#x27;s great! Not as good as pure aloe, of course, but better than some of the other products out there. The green aloe products make my skin more red and irritated, but this is sooo soothing. I also like that they add Vitamin E, which is great for the skin. This bottle is HUGE, too, so it&#x27;ll probably last us forever!</li>
            <li> I have been looking EVERYWHERE for another bottle of Fruit of the Earth Aloe as it is a GREAT skin lotion for suntans and sunburns and everyday use AND is free of artificial dyes and colors.  This is huge in my book, as most all of the other aloe products contain harmful artificial colors which are derived from coal tar or petroleum.  The 100% gel works great for bug bites as well as legs with circulation issues such as from diabetes or May Thurner Syndrome or Deep Vein Thrombosis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bought [[ASIN:B000ALDK1A Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera 100% Gel, 24 oz (680 g)]] before, bought again now and intend to buy in the future. The picture resembles my previous bottle with just a plain cap, however I was shipped the new bottle with the convenient pump. Yeah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: My granddaughter somehow gets her hair VERY tangled and matted during her shower.  I put a pump or three of Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera gel in a spray bottle, fill with water and shake.  I use this mixture on her hair when brushing out tangles and mats.  Used day after day this spray works GREAT as a very natural leave in conditioner for all of us, while still being used as a styling spray for short hair and detangler for the granddaughters&#x27; longer hair, all in one!  Very inexpensive since so little is used as it is diluted.  Overall it seems I use more Aloe Vera gel as a natural hair care product than as a natural skin care product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many brands of aloe vera over the decades. This brand is easily the best. Clean and natural feeling. The healing properties are obvious.&lt;br /&gt;There has to be some preservative quality added; this company has it down. It really works so you don&#x27;t need so much. The form it comes in lasts a year or two without going stale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will go without rather than use other brands........like the green goo.</li>
            <li> great product - no problems or complaints</li>
            <li> This stuff is so good ..... First i used to get it at walmart but one day they just stopped car-ringing it and replaced it with this green in color aloe that was not as pure as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So i came to amazon to get it and i just found out that my local dollar store carries it !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for the skin on any occasion and hair !!!!!</li>
            <li> Product was fine, maybe a bit on the expensive side for me.</li>
            <li> Great natural product.  Convenient dispenser.  Goes a long way.  Economical.</li>
            <li> I was surprised with some of the ingredients in this pure aloe vera gel.  The additional make it not pure and some are more toxic than I wanted in a gel.  I will try it and see how it works.</li>
            <li> Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera is no longer carried where I shop.  I&#x27;ve used it for 10 years and am so happy to find it on line at amazon. Can&#x27;t be without it....Use it for scratches, insect bites, rashes, all skin irritations and minor wounds .  Also used it to help heal two surgery scars. Amazing natural healing balm.  Even used over the years on my pets for their topical skin issues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years as hair gel. much healthier and waay cheaper. lasts for a year or so.</li>
            <li> this is nice. it makes our skin soft. there is no scent. perfect!</li>
            <li> i love how naturally moisturizing this aloe vera gel is. i use it for my skin and it also works as a wonderful conditioner for my dreadlocks as it is completely natural. really good deal.</li>
            <li> I have used this Aloe Vera for years both on my face and as a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; for my hair. With this use, I can say that my face looks like that of a 410 something and very smooth. I give credit to this brand of pure aloe. This is also good for any cuts, burns, and sunburns. This is a pure form of Aloe Vera, unlike the other brands. You can also buy drinkable Aloe which is extremely good for your esophagus and stomach, especially if you have GERD.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m transitioning from permed to natural hair, and my 2 year old is all natural. I use this on both of our hair to smooth it out and help it keep twist-outs. I can&#x27;t find it in my local Wal-Mart anymore, so I get this, which is a lot bigger than the one I got from the store. I use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair daily (no flakes, no build-up). You just need a small amount, and this bottle lasts awhile.</li>
            <li> Read the packaging carefully. They lead you to believe it&#x27;s 100% aloe vera- but it&#x27;s not. they put &amp;#34;100% Gel&amp;#34;...well obviously it&#x27;s gel but there are other ingredients in it that I was surprised to see once I got it. If you&#x27;re looking for something without additives and that&#x27;s truly 100% ALOE VERA, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking by the name and the label it was pure Aloe Vera gel. I plan to return it. Fruit of the Earth ruined a perfectly good product,it is not 100% aloe vera gel. It has Tetrasodium EDTA, an ingredient Ralph Nader once said he wouldn&#x27;t even touch with gloved hands. It is a penetration enhancer that increases the absorption rate of carcinogens, and can be a skin irritant. There is a reason the bottle says not to ingest it and keep out of the reach of children. Leave mother nature alone Fruit of the Earth. Just put a natural preservative in the Aloe gel, that&#x27;s all you need. I&#x27;m going to go back to Aubrey Organics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Google \\&quot;tetrasodium edta\\&quot; and harmful</li>
            <li> First off, I have sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve used several face moisturizers from big brands such as Aveeno, Olay, Dove, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Although Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera (FEAV) doesn&#x27;t lend itself as purely a face moisturizer, I use it for that reason. It works. FEAV takes care of my excessive dry skin much better than any other brand. I don&#x27;t have to apply globs of it as I do with other brands. It doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling oily on application or oily later on in the day. It also relieves redness and irritation that my skin gets from other brands or irritation from externalities such as people&#x27;s perfume or sweat at the gym. However, FEAV does wash off easily with water which is not so bad because I find it to be so effective that I don&#x27;t need to reapply it. With some other moisturizers such as Aveeno, they are harder to wash off and last longer, but after rinsing my face, dry skin reveals itself more and I will desperately need to reapply moisturizer. FEAV feels like it &amp;#34;cures&amp;#34; or removes the dry skin without creating more while Aveeno just masks it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEAV also works on other areas of the skin. The main reason I bought FEAV was for stretch marks. I&#x27;m not certain if it clears stretch marks. I can&#x27;t tell a difference after use but I don&#x27;t use FEAV religiously on my stretch marks. Either way, I love this product.</li>
            <li> Great for my skin/face</li>
            <li> I have a HUGE problem with companies using deceptive advertising by making claims that their products are ALL NATURAL or 100% pure, when in fact they are NOT.  This includes Fruit Of The Earth&#x27;s 100% Aloe Vera Gel.  This product contains fillers and preservatives to extend its shelf life.  My skin had a bad reaction to this product and almost became dry after every usage.  I&#x27;ve never experienced that with any other aloe product I&#x27;ve used in the past which is what raised a red flag for me to dig a little deeper.  I was extremely disappointed and annoyed when I found out this wasn&#x27;t what they claimed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing amazon about this FALSE ADVERTISING.&lt;br /&gt;The top of their page says \\&quot;Fruit Of The Earth 100% Aloe Vera Gel\\&quot; but the bottle does not contain 100% aloe, it contains a gel which has a bunch of (possibly dangerous) additives added to it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame on Fruit of the Earth for putting all this crap which MIGHT BE carcinogenic in their aloe which people use because they want a NATURAL product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give this 0 stars if I could!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s something in the gel that is very strong. When I apply it on my face my eyes hurt a lot even though i didn&#x27;t have any close to eyes. I won&#x27;t apply it on my face again. This item is as good as the aloe gel I used to buy, but still it&#x27;s inexpensive and can moisturize my skin on legs and arms.</li>
            <li> Really good - it also helps with irritation of the skin and psoriasis. I really like it alot.</li>
            <li> Non alcoholic aloe was recommended by cancer therapist to treat radiation burn on my neck. I searched and found; it burned like fire on read rash. I used no more. I think it contained alcohol in spite of the labeling.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff, it has no artificial coloring, no weird odor, and doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol (doesn&#x27;t separate when you put it on). works FAST on burns and heals them quickly. this stuff is the best i&#x27;ve tried so far, and i&#x27;ve tried alot of different kinds.     its a great deal for the amount of gel you get, and the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product to help take care of blemishes as well help lock in moisture in my face during these dry winter months. My mom has been using it to heal an itchy portion of her face. It is working really well for both of us. I often use a combination of moisturizer and this Aloe Very to help moisturize my face and so far, my face hasn&#x27;t been dry and blemishes have decreased significantly. I think this is a great product and I plan on buying it again when I run out of my current bottle.</li>
            <li> Awesome price for the size.</li>
            <li> I worked in the sun for years and have used Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera for my exposed skin..  I was very disappointed when local retailers quit carrying this product and started using aloe vera products with green colouring and other additives in it.  I ordered 4 bottles and it arrived in a very short time in sturdy packaging.  Happy to find this retailer!</li>
            <li> False advertising, pure and simple and should be illegal. This makes me furious when companies claim that their product is 100 percent, when in fact, it is not. And, includes harmful ingredients too!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fruit Of The Earth, you should be ashamed of yourselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disgusted with this practice and I&#x27;ll never touch another Fruit Of The Earth product again and will warn others to do the same.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer, hair gel, sunburn relief ever! And the only option out there I know of that is fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I got this to see if it would help with a facial rash I was dealing with. I often hear aloe is a good home rash treatment. It was one of those flakey blotchy rashes that is usualy caused by bad dandruff and are often treated with medicated hydrocortisone cream of 1.5% to 2.5%. My doctor before subscribed me 2.5! Which is allot and hydrocortisone thins the skin which isn&#x27;t good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This aloe did the trick and my rash is 90% gone after only 2 to 3 days of use! It has no alcohol which is good because I&#x27;ve tried the trader joes aloe and that brand contains alcohol which ended up burning my rash and proabably made things worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t contain alchol but it contains a few preservatives to compensate for the lack of alcohol so keep that in mind if you have phobia against health products that contain preservatives. Like others I agree they shouldn&#x27;t call themselves &#x27;Fruit of the Earth&#x27; if their product is heavily processed with preservatives. Also saying its 100% gell is kind of a misnomer as it contains preservatives and some Aloe Vera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proabably the best things about this product is no alcohol no artifical coloring and it&#x27;s made in the USA which is rare these days on just about any products sold to the general public. I also like how it has multiple uses. You can use it for rashes, sun burns, &amp; as a hair gell. The 24 oz bottle is a good size for the money. I only payed $10.09 and got free 2 day shipping with prime and it arivef on a Sunday via USPS priority. I would by this again.</li>
            <li> Believing the big lie on the front of the bottle (100% GEL! Yay!) I bought a big bottle of Fruit of the Earth several years ago, thinking I was buying 100% Aloe Vera Gel. This was back before I wised up to reading ingredient lists.     Fruit of the Earth&#x27;s \\&quot;100% Gel\\&quot; is a 100% fraud, chockful of skin irritants, endocrine disruptors, immunotoxins and formaldehyde. Read up on the actual ingredients, then decide if you want to put this stuff on your skin. There are several companies that make pure aloe vera products. But you&#x27;ll have to read the ingredient lists. Don&#x27;t believe what it says on the front of the bottle, because there are a lot of companies like Fruit of the Earth who use deceptive labeling to peddle their wares. Read the ingredient lists. Accept no substitutes.</li>
            <li> Best no scent product I have found.</li>
            <li> This is the only brand of pure aloe vera gel we buy.  It works perfectly on us and on our dogs.  Definitely recommend it and we buy it all the time.</li>
            <li> My sister, who happens to be a beautician recommended that I buy this product for my daughter.  I was a bit skeptical at first, since I am not a fan of gel for daily use.  However, she mentioned that it is 100% aloe vera.  I purchased it and received it in &amp;#34;no-time,&amp;#34; since I have &amp;#34;Amazon - Prime!&amp;#34;  The gel does not disappoint.  It keeps my daughter&#x27;s hair neat and amazing.  Best of all, once the gel has rubbed-out, her hair is still soft.  I highly recommend this gel, over the other chemically-based brands.</li>
            <li> My skin loves aloe vera! I use it on my face to prevent moisturize and shield my skin. Although my pump was broken when I recieved it, I am happy that it comes in 24oz.</li>
            <li> Bottle was just tossed in a bag, and thrown in a box. Pump was brown and bottle leaked all over inside bag. The bottle was half crushed too, even though the box had NO damage. Buy a smaller bottle without the pump. Read the many reviews of broken pump and smashed product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have been using it for years.  Great as a hair gel.  Great for conditioning the scalp. Great for  facial skin conditioning.</li>
            <li> Most Definitely not best for sensitive skin, it irritates.</li>
            <li> Nice big jug of Aloe!</li>
            <li> I use it for literally everything</li>
            <li> Got this product for my wife. She absolutely LOVES it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good sized bottle of aloe vera with none of the inert embellishments you pay extra for in other brands. It does everything aloe vera is known for when used externally.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with my skin and this stuff is a miracle.  This is the second time I have ordered it.</li>
            <li> No it&#x27;s not 100% pure aloe vera, however it&#x27;s quite effective in the year I&#x27;ve used it.  It works well for minor wounds, mixtures for hair care and skin care.  I&#x27;ll say when I mix this with shea butter, my hair develops a nice curl pattern with an overnight twist out.  When I make a separate batch for my face, it moisturizes beautifully.  Over a year ago, I got a stung by a mosquito on the nose, so bad, the pus was releasing.  I did my regular night regime and applied my moisturizing concoction on,  within a month NO SCARING or DISCOLORATION.  I think if you are a purest, suffer from a skin irritation or someone not looking to making things for a product to work I would not advise you to get it.  Yet good stuff works for all my needs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 100% gel but not necessarily 100% Aloe Vera... obviously.  I like the fact they use Tocopherol Acetate, which is Vitamin E, it is probably added as an antioxidant and preservative.  Unfortunately they also feel it is necessary to add Carbomer 940, a synthetic thickener, to change the consistency.  This is supposedly non-toxic but like many chemicals used in cosmetics, it&#x27;s not clinically tested and who really knows.  The Triethanolamine is used to solubilize and reduce the acidity of the Carbomer but should be nontoxic.  EDTA is a chelator; it is not really a problem either as such.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Of more concern is the addition of the perservatives/antimicrobials DMDM Hydantoin and Diazolidinyl Urea; these chemicals work by releasing Formaldehyde into the product, which kills any microbes and is great for the product but not so great for you, because Formaldehyde is a potent carcinogen as well as an irritant that can cause allergic reactions. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Although this product is only applied topically, and the concentration of Formaldehyde is hopefully too low to cause irritation and cancer, that is not known.  I would be interested to know the exact concentrations of each ingredient in the final product.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Good things:  this is otherwise a decent product that dries very quickly, and makes a non-greasy Hair gel and skin moisturizer.  I have mixed fine loose glitter into it to make cheap glitter gel, that would actually stay on my skin and hair instead of the glitter falling right off, like when you mix glitter with regular lotion.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bad things:  the formaldehyde-producing preservatives; you would think a company by the name of Fruit of the Earth should actually use some earth-friendly preservatives.  As an alternative I suggest exploring your local health food or supplement store and searching for an aloe vera gel that does not contain any strange unpronouncable/chemical/synthetic ingredients.  Even in small quantities these things can cause allergies or other health problems, and it only takes one mutation to start a cancer.  Or pick up your own Aloe Vera plant; they are surprisingly tough and prolific.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used this product for sunburn, minor scrapes, bruises, or burns that occur around the home, so was very fortunate to have it handy when I tripped and fell, hitting one side of my face against a piece of metal as I went down. The resulting 3\\&quot; gash, which narrowly missed my eye, ran from the corner of the eye to my cheekbone. The whole area was swollen and very painful. I applied a thick layer of this gel, after cleaning with antiseptic. The soothing effect was immediate, and after hourly applications, the gash had closed by the next morning. I continued applications several times a day over the next 2 weeks, and the wound healed beautifully, leaving a clean line where it would have scarred. That line is now barely visible. Thank you Fruit of the Earth for a wonderful product! I would&#x27;nt be without it!</li>
            <li> Although not technically a lie, putting 100% in the label is grossly misleading considering all the additives in this product. Personally, I consider it criminally misleading. Although I have bought a lot of this product in the past when it was less adulterated, I&#x27;ll never buy any Fruit of the Earth Product again.    I recommend \\&quot;Aloe Vera Gelly\\&quot; produced by \\&quot;Lily of the Desert\\&quot;.    Thanks to the reviewers below who described the chemicals.</li>
            <li> I bought this gel as a natural way to help heal a couple of spots on my face where I had a breakout. The first couple of days I only used it as a spot treatment and though it didn&#x27;t work wonders it didn&#x27;t have any adverse effects. I then made the mistake of applying this over my whole face before going to bed. I woke up the next morning with a rash over my entire face including my eyelids. I was horrified! It was only then that I read the ingredients of this product. Not only is it not \\&quot;100% aloe vera\\&quot; &amp; \\&quot;alcohol free,\\&quot; this stuff is toxic! Shame on me for not reading the ingredients before using this product. Shame, shame, shame on this company for claiming to be 100% aloe vera!</li>
            <li> Quick shipment and the cost was reasonable. Love this product for my hair. I normally mix with a little shea butter when I groom my locs.</li>
            <li> Aloe vera 1st on ingredients list!</li>
            <li> I had purchased another &amp;#34;100%&amp;#34; aloe vera product. Like some had noted, it was essentially liquid, like an aloe vera drink. This one really is smooth like a gel. I had a fairly strong sunburn on my shoulders. This was wonderful, soothing and healing in the process.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to get this at Target, but not anymore. Glad I found it on Amazon. Great price and easy service...just don&#x27;t ever discontinue this needy item. Thanks Brian</li>
            <li> Large size.  Used during radiation treatments to keep skin from burning or blistering.  It worked very well for me and I got through my treatments with nothing more than a rozy glow from the radiation.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Use it as a hair gel and skin hydrator. The hand pump is nice too</li>
            <li> I use this as a replacement for lotion. Have been VERY satisfied, and left feeling clean and mosturized, and not slimy. Love this, and will buy this again and again.</li>
            <li> i use this all the time for razor burn as an after shave (dr oz tip) has worked wonders.... now with a pump top even better... love it!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT Product! Hard to find but well worth it. I use it on my face after shaving and any &#x27;dry&#x27;spots during the winter. It also works great for sun burn. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love it, it works great !</li>
            <li> Bare ingredient. Love it!</li>
            <li> Great to sooth sun burned skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even close to putting a dent in this and I use it everyday. I like using it as eyebrow gel and putting it over dark spots on my legs. It really keeps my eyebrows in place and fades my spots well (maybe too well... got a little bit of hypopigmentation now lol). The shipping was quick and the price was nice, I recommend this 100%</li>
            <li> I use this to shave my head and it works very well.</li>
            <li> The gel that came with my fetal doppler is super expensive and I read online that Aloe Vera Gel will work just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT DOES.... make sure it&#x27;s 100% Aloe Vera with no added colors as this can damage some machines....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But we saved over $50 if we had gotten this size container of Doppler Gel</li>
            <li> I always had blotch flakey skin around my nose and cheeks but after using this Aloe jell it helps those areas!!!  Great product!!!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product that I use often and love!!! :)    Let me first start off by saying that I do agree with the other reviewers of this product who point out that Fruit of the Earth&#x27;s label is (perhaps) a bit misleading.  The advertising may lead some folks to believe the product is 100% pure aloe vera gel...  Well, close, but not quite...  100% \\&quot;gel\\&quot; indeed it is, but there are other additives in the mix.    Pure aloe vera gel usually has some light natural coloration (a yellowish tint) and a light, distinct, scent... and if it is of the pure organic nature, the color (and smell) may vary a little from batch to batch.  My first indication that Fruit of the Earth&#x27;s product was not actually \\&quot;pure\\&quot; was its perfectly clear color.    As for the concerns over chemical agents contained in this product, I personally think there might be a little bit of over-reaction in that regard.  This is a fine product in my honest opinion.  Reviewer \\&quot;Torben&#x27;s\\&quot; comments, I think, are excellent (with reference to the additives used in this product).  If you have convictions that prohibit you from using products with any un-natural chemical ingredients, that is understandable and there are other excellent alternatives (such as Lily of the Desert, which is 99% pure and organic, but also much more expensive).    While I prefer using organic products as well, I confess that - sometimes - I settle for the cheap stuff too and this really deserves a good review because it&#x27;s a GREAT product.  I use it often on my face and scalp and as a hair gel (it doesn&#x27;t flake off or leave hair feeling greasy).  I also use it as a shaving gel sometimes.  It has improved the quality and appearance of my skin and reduced my psoriasis problems on the scalp considerably!  Whoever said this product is a skin irritant obviously has never used it.  I also use it on my hands (which have severe dryness and cracking problems) and it works healing wonders.  It has a wonderful cooling sensation, is not sticky,hydrates the skin beautifully and reduces redness, scars, and works near miracles on cuts and scrapes.  Granted it&#x27;s not quite as good as right off the leaf, but it&#x27;s sooooo much better than using lotions, which (even the good ones, many times) have far more dangerous chemicals (and in greater quantity) than this product.  If you&#x27;re one that is used to grabbing a tube of cheap Vaseline lotion or something like that for general hand lotion, get this instead!  It&#x27;s much healthier and won&#x27;t plug up the pores.  It will heal and restore rather than just smooth away the dryness.    I don&#x27;t know about \\&quot;significant\\&quot; cancer dangers, but I doubt the other reviewers who worriedly shout \\&quot;AVOID!\\&quot; are scientists on the subject either. ;) But I digress.  This is still a great aloe vera product despite very minor potential concerns about minuscule quantities of chemical agents that are (presumably) added for thickening and preservative purposes only.  There is no coloring or fragrance chemicals added and that is a big plus for health-conscious users (and shows the manufacturer&#x27;s desire to appeal to health concerns of their buyers).  It also has no funny smell, no stickiness (only a light residue - typical when using aloe vera - that fades away as it is absorbed in the skin).    Unless you are flat out paranoid of preservatives, stop worrying (maybe even trust God a little), save a little money, and buy this cool product that does what it should and does it very well!  I thought about giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the - arguably - slightly misleading label, but the fact is the label is honest and all ingredients are clearly listed on the back for anyone with a brain to check out so I won&#x27;t count that against it.  Thanks to the folks at Fruit of the Earth for a very good product (in my opinion).</li>
            <li> NIce big botte of wonderful aloe vera.  This stuff has so many purposes.  The pump bottle is great.  I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> The gel is OK, the bottle arrived broken, so I had to transfer to another bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad to have a big supply of straight aloe gel. Good price for enough gel to last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Product is great, but pump top was broken off in shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It is great on sunburns as well as accidental burns from cooking.  I keep a small container of it in my kitchen so that if I accidentally burn myself I don&#x27;t have to run all the way upstairs to get the large original container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is 100% gel.  It is not 100% aloe vera.  The labeling is a tad bit misleading so buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this aloe vera gel.  I used it moisturize my natural African-American hair.  I mix it with shea butter.  I like it because it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky film in my hair as other aloe vera gels I&#x27;ve tried seem to do. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This product is very hard to find in stores, so I have to order it online. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only thing is that I wish it had even less ingredients in it besides the true aloe vera gel.</li>
            <li> Great value. Haven&#x27;t used it for burns but am treating my skin from winter harsh weather &amp; it is helping with a combination of other natural essential oils.</li>
            <li> im glad i bought the larger size on line because they sell the smaller sizes of this stuff right now in stores. i use this every day. thanks alot</li>
            <li> Even though this product is not %100 percent aloe vera gel i tried it anyway to clear up face pimples. The real aloe vera gel is known to clear up face pimples and acne but this stuff left my face swollen and puffy and i will not buy again. its not %100 percent aloe vera gel and now im growing a real aloe vera leaf plant and that leaf heals skin problems better than fruit of the earth products. i recommend a real aloe vera leaf</li>
            <li> I usually get my Aloe Vera Gel in 8 oz bottles at the health food store but they have been getting harder to find. I thought I would try Fruit of the Earth thou I had never heard of them before. This product works great on my hair and I like the large bottle. I hope Amazon gets selling them!</li>
            <li> I love Fruit of the Earth - Clear Aloe.  Use it everyday.  Hard to find at the stores in my area so ordered it online.</li>
            <li> Good stuff at the right price. Cannot consistently find at local stores</li>
            <li> I have been using this aloe as a hair gel for about two years. It gives definition to my curls but does not make them stiff. The bottle I received actually has a pump style top, which is very convenient to use. I can&#x27;t find this brand in my local stores, so I am glad to see it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> nice and useful thing</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis on my legs and this is amazing for  the dry skin. I have used it for years, it also works well for removing make-up. I have also taken a bottle to work, I work in a factory with machines that run at a temp of at least 350 degrees and if you accidentally hit the hot steel molds (accidents do happen even with safety equipment) this works immediately. Everyone knows where the bottle is kept and they come looking for it should they need it.</li>
            <li> Burns; pain; hair; aftershave; bug bites, and I&#x27;m sure I will come across more it&#x27;s a remedy to share with family and friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for years. It&#x27;s one of the few tht has AV as the first ingredient. It&#x27;s been hard to find in the retail stores lately, so I tried here. Incredible price. Very happy with the service.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my $85 face serum. I&#x27;m trying to go all natural and wanted just aloe without any other ingredients. This works.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve used the 100% gel for several years as an after shaving moisturizer for my face.  It leaves your skin feeling clean, cool, and healthy.  This particular bottle size (24oz) is an excellent value.</li>
            <li> My mom needed it for radiation and it worked perfectly</li>
            <li> Fantastic as an aftersun lotion. Excellent for scars - it really does heal the skin leaving the scar almost non-existent. Great for very dry and itchy skin. To top it off it does not leave that greasy feeling - well absorbed.</li>
            <li> A great product of pure aloe with no additives, cooling and efficacious.</li>
            <li> Totally not worth it! It made my skin red, sensitive and swelling. Maybe it works on somebody else I don&#x27;t know. But you should check other people&#x27;s reviews before you buy it.</li>
            <li> This product is crap, it is not a hundred percent aloe vera gel, AND has nasty chemicals like urea which is completely carcinogenic. Please do your research, be vigilant and not buy crappy products like this one.</li>
            <li> You can find aloe at a dollar store and it does the trick. However this aloe seems to have a better consistency and smell then the dollar store kinds. Feels a little better on the skin. Great in hand sanitizer and after sun lotions.</li>
            <li> Love it works great for dry skin. My husband has very dry skin this worked wonders he even has a sheen to his legs now</li>
            <li> The fine print on the back of the bottle warns that this product may stain some fabrics and it does.  I now have peach colored stains on my white sheets and light colored tank tops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If not for ruining expensive sheets, I liked this brand and would have given five stars.</li>
            <li> I use this as hair gel and I love it because there isn&#x27;t a bunch of other crap it in, and it doesn&#x27;t get flaky looking in my hair.</li>
            <li> With sensitive skin this is what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> The bottle was taped shut and it is a pump.  Some of the gel leaked out as soon as I opened the tape.  The picture description is not accurate.</li>
            <li> Best item ever created! I use this incredible stuff for an aftershave, hair gel, moisturizer, and skin protectant. Where I work there is dust in the air that sometimes would clog pores and give me zits. But then I started rubbing a squeeze of this gel over my face before work and the problem went away. Also, it tightens up your skin and smooths out wrinkles. Awesome product at a tiny cost.</li>
            <li> Having done a little research, I believe that the whole tetrasodium EDTA scare is a bit of an overreaction. Tetrasodium EDTA is a common salt of EDTA, or EthyleneDiamineTetraacetic Acid, and is used in many products (including soaps and cosmetics) as a chelating agent. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Its effect is to make sodium, calcium and magnesium salts, as found in hard water, water-soluble. As you know, prolonged exposure to water makes your skin absorb water and swell (that&#x27;s why it wrinkles). Since chelating agents decrease the surface tension of water, they will accelerate this process. In theory, it is possible that some carcinogens may become water soluble and hence be more easily absorbed by your skin as well. This perceived danger is the same, however, if you stay in the bathtub for too long. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In this product, Tetrasodium EDTA is used to keep it nice and smooth and help its not-so-water-soluble components (such as preservatives) dissolve in the gel. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;EDTA itself will actively bind with metal ions. Medically, it has found use in treating acute hypercalcemia, mercury poisoning and lead poisoning. This is also why you shouldn&#x27;t ingest it: since it is a decalcifying agent, it is not good for your bones in the long run. It shouldn&#x27;t be necessary to say this, but just in case: do not use this product to treat any of the above medical conditions. It is for external use only. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I hope this information will set a few minds at ease. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Before I forget: this is a great product for treating dry skin, and has a nice cooling effect on minor sunburns. I even use it as a hair styling gel, as it doesn&#x27;t remain greasy or sticky, like other styling gels tend to.</li>
            <li> Good value and good quality.</li>
            <li> ORDER CAME FASTER THAN EXPECTED AND PRODUCT WAS EXCELLENT</li>
            <li> Deceptive advertiser!  DO NOT BUY!!</li>
            <li> My wife loves the product and i will buy another bottle of Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera 100% Gel in the future.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It helps with my dry skin and great for me DIY hair moisturizer. It is odorless, which a definite plus.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love using Aloe Vera.  I use it in my hair, bug bites, minor cuts, burns, and also if you use it right after you shave it will prevent any red bumps from appearing.  I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding the clear gel at any local stores so I found it here at Amazon and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Customer reviews are a major factor of why I use Amazon--I like the first-hand user reports, and many of my purchasing decisions are based on these. I like this product for the following reasons:     1) It diminishes age spots! I have a fair, freckled Irish complexion that tends to be too pink and flushed, and, with time, has brought on age spots and reddening of some freckles. I read online for \\&quot;home\\&quot; remedies of age spots that aloe vera works. I tried this gel and have seen tremendous results on my skin. Not only has it solved the red, flushed appearance and reddened freckles, but also it has diminished the brown age spots. I think it&#x27;s a tremendous product, especially compared to the other expensive products I have tried, and this one really works for me.     2) I use the product on my feet because of dry and cracking skin, especially in winter. It softens them and actually heals the skin. Aloe is hailed as having anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and healing properties. For anyone who fights these issues on your feet, I would strongly recommend at least trying this product. There is also a Vitamin E formula by the same company that I have tried.     While we should all be concerned about the chemicals used in modern-day products, the fractional amount in this product coupled with the fact that it can be used very sparingly--a little goes a long way compared to ordinary hand lotion--I think it&#x27;s not a safety hazard, at least to me. I have found that radical changes to my diet have had the most beneficial and long-term results on my health.</li>
            <li> Nothing soothes my sunburn like this product! No alcohol to burn, just the cooling sensation of aloe vera! I even apply with a little water for extra cooling. This product quenches my thirsty skin like no other! I recommend this to everyone I know. And it is Made in the USA</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to this... but it cure my skin after my allergic disappear! Amazing!</li>
            <li> have used for years, great product. moisturizes and doesn&#x27;t leave oily residue ... absorbs into skin as long as not used excessively all at once</li>
            <li> Aloe is great!  And this isn&#x27;t dyed green and has no alcohol added.</li>
            <li> I have used this exact product for many years. We have used this on sunburns and household light burns. It is a great moisturizer. Like so many other products that are still made, but are hard to find in stores, I found this good deal on Amazon. I ordered three and gave one as a gift..&lt;br /&gt;shorty</li>
            <li> A friend suggested I use aloe vera  instead of shave cream.  It works VERY well.  No razor burn, close shave, and skin is left soft and smooth.  Tr.y it</li>
            <li> Great for making my products and at the right price</li>
            <li> Great for my TENS machine and for after being in the pool!</li>
            <li> Great product for dry skin relief without any chemical additives.</li>
            <li> Items is as described.</li>
            <li> Contains formaldehyde releaser as preservative.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Use it every day.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff...I&#x27;m on my second bottle and it lasts for a good while. I use 2-3 pumps mixed with a few drops of vitamin E oil and sometimes I&#x27;ll add a few drops of my favorite body lotion and apply it after my shower.</li>
            <li> I like this non-irritating clear 100% aloe vera.  Next best thing to cutting an aloe plant open, but more convenient.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good product. Very glad I purchased it. Good for applying to the skin as a lotion good also as a shaving gel.</li>
            <li> HAD A HARD TIME FINDING THIS PRODUCT. SO, SO GLAD IT&#x27;S HERE ON AMAZON NOW. I LOVE FRUIT OF THE EARTH PRODUCTS AND ESPECIALLY THE 100% ALOE VERA GEL. I&#x27;VE TRIED OTHER BRANDS BUT THEY WERE NOT TO MY SATISFACTION. THIS PRODUCT IS SMOOTH, AND NATURAL. IT HAS NATURAL HEALING PROPERTIES AND IF I WERE ON A STRANDED ISLAND, AND COULD ONLY BRING A FEW ITEMS, FRUIT OF THE EARTH ALOE VERA 100% GEL WOULD DEFINITELY BE ONE OF MY ITEMS TO BRING.</li>
            <li> I use this for my scalp issues in my hair. Also serves as a gel for my curly style hair do. I can&#x27;t live without this staple.</li>
            <li> Great for moisturizing hair and skin. Its light, not sticky, great for sensitive or irritated skin and smells great. I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> Aloe Vera is excellent for sunburns, as a moisturizer and now for my hair! What can be said about Aloe Vera that hasn&#x27;t been said before! The excellent qualities of this product are very well known. Just try it, and enjoy its multiple benefits!</li>
            <li> This is the only brand of aloe gel that I have ever seen that is totally unscented and clear.  It works wonders by itself or as an additive in lotions, etc.</li>
            <li> Aloe Vera was recommended to me some years ago by my beautician.  I use about a quarter size dab to rub on my hair after shampoo.  No more dry hair ends.  Great product, great price!! JL</li>
            <li> My wife loves using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She uses it as a shaving gel and as an after shave to help ease burn that can occur while shaving. Since this product is 100% natural it makes the process of hair removal much safer and also much more enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other uses for Aloe Vera are:&lt;br /&gt;- To tame frizz before drying or for air-drying.&lt;br /&gt;- Instead of an oil-free moisturizer, especially if you’re acne-prone.&lt;br /&gt;- On dry hair or your eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;- On seborrheic dermatitis or psoriasis.&lt;br /&gt;- To help infections heal.&lt;br /&gt;- Cooking burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The list keeps going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using this lotion/ gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this review helped you please let me know. Thanks and happy shopping.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve given this a 5 star rating if the labeling had been correct! I do love the product, I am going to re-order, I use it daily, it works wonderfully well. That being said, the web page description is misleading, there are indeed other ingredients which are listed on the label but not by % so I don&#x27;t know how much is actual aloe vera and how much is other ingredients. I like that there aren&#x27;t any coloring agents etc.. and understand that this product requires preservatives. But that should be in the description. So go a head and buy this product if you are an aloe vera fan because it is a very good product, just be aware it is not 100% pure.</li>
            <li> The reason why this is the best hair gel is simple: It will keep your hair in place, but will never be hard and painful. and if you accidently rub it off or sleep with it on, it will not flake and leave white stuff in your hair. You need this stuff.</li>
            <li> Found this at the Dollar General. I never tried a gel or FOTE before, and so I got this and the vit e cream. This gel is terrific. I was desperate for something light, not tacky that wouldnt make my skin feel like it was sticky and melty. Well, I&#x27;m so glad I took a chance! No fragrance, super-absorbant, light, adds just enough moisture without that \\&quot;humid\\&quot; feeling. I wish larger stores carried it but if DG decides not to, I&#x27;ll order from here. This is a new favorite.</li>
            <li> My oncology radiologist told me about this. I was very pleased with the product and would tell everyone who is receiving radiation treatments to use this product.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s bad enough that the label says 100% Gel when it&#x27;s not, but even the description gave no indication of the added ingredients.  As soon as the bottle came and I saw its clear contents, I knew it was not what I was looking for as pure aloe is not clear.  Many people seem to like this product, but it needs to be labeled properly.  Shame on me for not reading the reviews, I guess.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product as hair gel for about a year and it works great. It is better than any other brand I have ever tried. It has no smell to it and it does not leave any white residue behind.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but be aware that just because it says pure 100% gel, it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s 100% pure.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years it is the best</li>
            <li> This gel is light and can be used on the body as well as my hair.  Since the water is harsh on my skin, I will use it strictly for my natural curls to loosen them up.</li>
            <li> Great for skin irritations and acne!!</li>
            <li> Very good on the scalp and as a disappearing hair gel.</li>
            <li> For now its OK. I will need to use it a little more to write more of a full review.</li>
            <li> On the topic of whether this can be taken internally:  If you read what it actually says on the bottle, it says \\&quot;100% Gel.\\&quot;  Yes, that is true.  It is 100% gel.  Nothing but gel in there.    But the gel is not 100% aloe vera.  Of course, don&#x27;t take any aloe vera internally unless it is 100% aloe vera.    Externally, the stuff does the job, although I would have preferred it to be 100% aloe vera even for external use.  The other ingredients tend to counteract the aloe vera and have a drying effect.</li>
            <li> First, this is labeled \\&quot;100% Gel\\&quot; not \\&quot;100% Aloe Vera Gel\\&quot;. It does have some additives. Read up on those yourself (they are listed in the reviews) but I am \\&quot;personally\\&quot; not worried about these -- this is a great product that has provided many fantastic benefits to me and I intend to continue using this product for as long as I can get it. I absolutely love it. I use it on try skin etc, PLUS it makes a great hair gel. Dries quickly PLUS keeps my scalp from getting dry when other products didn&#x27;t help at all. I can&#x27;t speak highly enough about this product.</li>
            <li> I cannot find this product locally. This is the best buy I have ever found for pure aloe vera gel.  I will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best hair gel I have ever used.  I have naturally curly hair, and have tried most mousses, gels, and curl creams there are out on the market.  Nothing compares to 100% Aloe Vera gel!  It activates my curl without leaving my hair greasy or crunchy.  I get compliments weekly on my hair and I really owe a large part to this product.  For ppl with curly hair, try scrunching your hair with the gel after you get out of the shower and diffusing it.  You won&#x27;t believe the results.  It&#x27;s also great for touch ups throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I use 10+ brands of aloe vera gel and find out this is the best one. I disagree some of the reviewers saying too much chemicals in this aloe vera gel. Compare to many other brands it&#x27;s the most less chemicals aloe vera gel in none organic class. Of course, if you have extra money you can go for organic that&#x27;s better. Please forget about 100% pure aloe vera gel this word because there are no pure aloe vera gel in the market even for organic aloe vera gel. It must have some preservative!!It&#x27;s hard to find in my local store now. All replace by other cheap brand with red/green/blue color and funny smell. I use this for many years. It helps my skin a lot. I would recommend to anyone needs aloe vera gel!</li>
            <li> Even though this is marketed as 100% aloe vera gel it is not. According to the ingredients it is: Aloe Vera (Aloe Barbadensis) Gel, Triethanolamine, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Carbomer 940, Tetrasodium EDTA, DMDM Hydantoin, Diazolidinyl Urea. There is some unhealthy stuff in there.&lt;br /&gt;Remember any garbage can be marketed as 100% anything but the ingredients have to be a little bit more accurate.</li>
            <li> I had a bad rash an needed aloe gel right away. I&#x27;m allergic to most everything but also. This gel is very good, light an not at all sticky like some I&#x27;ve used. A good buy for sure.</li>
            <li> This lotion is so soothing.</li>
            <li> Spend a lot of time in the sun and skin  gets dry and itchy sometimes. Aloe is a great lubricating lotion to put some moisture back and protect the skin.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this product a higher rating because it smells and feels wonderful and was packaged very well but its ingredient list is way too scary.  I thought from the description I was purchasing a pure chemical free product but it contains many of the ingredients that are in the many commercial products I am trying to avoid. Here is the list from the bottle which is not shown online:&lt;br /&gt; • Triethanolamine&lt;br /&gt; • Tocopheryl Acetate&lt;br /&gt; • Carbomer&lt;br /&gt; • Tetrasodium EDTA&lt;br /&gt; • DMDM Hydantoin&lt;br /&gt; • DIAZOLIDINYL UREA&lt;br /&gt;Researching shows that some are not that harmful but could cause allergic reactions to could cause cancer.  I would suggest researching before purchase and that Fruit of the Earth list a complete ingredient list on the sale page.  I will be looking for another product that does not contain chemicals or growing my own Aloe Vera plant.</li>
            <li> I bought this ages ago and never really got around to using it. One day I ran out of my regular hair gel and looked at the bottle on my dresser. &amp;#34;Okay, let&#x27;s see what this stuff will do.&amp;#34; Online, everyone said it had very light hold, but would give hair a nice shine- WRONG! It gave my hair awesome hold AND great shine. I actually prefer it to regular gel because I feel like it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair. If you have frizzy hair, I think you might find this product helpful. It brings fantastic definition to otherwise undefined curls (I&#x27;m African-American with 4a hair). I can&#x27;t comment on it as a sunburn reliever because I&#x27;ve never had sunburn in my life, but as a hair product it&#x27;s fantastic. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great for soothing skin after sun exposure</li>
            <li> I regularly buy Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera Gel.  It is the best. It&#x27;s great for use on skin and hair for healing of damaged hair, scars on the skin, for maintaining healthy skin and hair.  I also use it sometimes to style my hair as a replacement of regular hair gel.  Great stuff. I have tried other brands of Aloe Vera gel by other companies and they did not compare to the high quality of the Fruit of Earth brand and other brands of aloe vera gel tend to blend in other unnecessary ingredients, while this brand is pure.  However, I usually buy this brand aloe vera gel from Walmart stores as it is half the price around $5.00 after taxes for the same size bottle of 24 oz.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is the best aloe vera gel i&#x27;ve had, but it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li> I would say that is a ok product coz it does make your skin more softer&lt;br /&gt;but the thing is this product doesn&#x27;t really keep your skin hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;it is a very soft and thin texture, but if you wanna use for dry skin. My answer is no.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years, loved it</li>
            <li> Had a bottle of this from probably 10 years ago that I always kept in the fridge to put on if I got a sunburn.  We moved recently, and it seems it got lost in the packing and unpacking.  Couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere locally, but Amazon came to my rescue getting it to me overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the BEST stuff to put on after a burn.  So cool and soothing, and doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out.  Be wary of other products that have little or no actual aloe vera in them, even though they have &amp;#34;aloe&amp;#34; in their name.  I have never once peeled or had discomfort for more than ~2 days if I start applying this stuff the same day of a burn.</li>
            <li> This is a great solution if you have a rash.  I picked Non-alcohol because my doctor suggested it.  Great price.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended as I had to undergo Radiation therapy for 7 weeks for breast cancer.  I applied it after treatment, and at night before I went to bed.  Helped quite a bit!</li>
            <li> has a suspicious chemical in there called Triethanolamine that i would avoid.  why do these companies use stuff like this in their ingredients?  i don&#x27;t know but i sent it back and won&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I assumed 100% Aloe Vera Gel meant 100% ALOE VERA.  IT IS NOT 100% ALOE VERA.  IT IS ONLY 100% GEL.  IT HAS MANY ADDITIVES.  I CONSIDER THIS PURPOSELY MISLEADING.  DON&#x27;T YOU?</li>
            <li> So, I recently had scarification work done- I have a network of artistic cuts on my arms now. They&#x27;ve been a little extra sore today, so after my shower I ran some of this gel over the work. OWWW!! Scarification care includes chemical irritation &amp; exfoliation, to encourage the scarring, and it can be pretty painful. Let me tell you, this aloe gel burns MUCH worse than dousing my cuts in alcohol!! I can&#x27;t speak to moisturization, hair gel or sunburn, but this is a big NO for cuts! Not to mention what everyone else has- definitely not pure aloe vera!</li>
            <li> I love the product the only reason I gave it a 3 star rating was because the package came broken and a lot spilled leaving me with like 3/4s of the product.</li>
            <li> Very nice aloe.  No colors or additives.  A little pricey, but good product.  As soothing and as healthful as aloe is, it still stung on my break outs.  I also combine with other lotions to up the healing qualities.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It is made in the USA. It does not have a bad odor and actually seems to work really well. Purel has been really drying out my hands and using this once a day has made all the difference. I disagree with the reviews the it is &amp;#34;100% gel&amp;#34; as if the manufacturer is trying to deceive the consumer. On the back label it clearly says &amp;#34;100% aloe vera gel&amp;#34;. There is an asterisk that  references additives necessary for product stabilty and these are listed in ingredients. Any product of this sort that is not refrigerated is going to require these additives so I think if you want a product that you do not want to refrigerate, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> I have itchy skin on my legs and if I put this on after I get out of the shower they don&#x27;t itch. Love it!</li>
            <li> Product came in on time and met our expectation. Works well so far. Pleased the way it is working now.</li>
            <li> It is quite good, there is no any special smell, I believe it is the pure aloe and I use it in many ways. It can be used for a long time.</li>
            <li> Needed this for radiation treatment.  Excellent product.  This was recommended by my doctor and could not find it locally. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I love using it on my eyebrows it actually help me grow them out, Ihave been using it for 1 year my eyebrows would not grow because of the waxing, now I don&#x27;t have to shade in my eyebrows at all, I have a natural full shape</li>
            <li> who needs smoothing from toner when you got this gel, who need those expensive moisturizers which always oily up my skin( i have really sensitive skin and get oily easy), i wash my face with gental face wash and then apply a light layer of aloe vera gel on my face, it like a face mask but stay on your face all day, the gel protects your face from getting too much containmination, provides a clean environment to speed up the healing of acne or scars. I have notice my acne(which will be getting painful and swollen) stop swollen after using this gel 3 times a day after cleaning my face. Nobody wants to put all the chemical stuff on your face and still believe that is good for your face. Aloe vera is the best, some people might say you can get it from natural aloe vera plant, but i can use this as body lotion too.</li>
            <li> Every summer I get a few cases of poison ivy from working in the woods and this product is my favorite skin cover for helping with itching. I&#x27;ve been buying it for many years and have gone through a few bottles, it really does work well. No doubt it would be great for sunburn too, although I don&#x27;t get that anymore as I cover up due to a bought with skin cancer.</li>
            <li> I normally use on my second third day hair if my edges get frizzy. I have used in the summertime for a wash n go. Great for my curly African American hair.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and cannot find it in Walgreen&#x27;s.  I started using it to put on radiation burns (breast cancer therapy).  So gentle.  Many uses.  Not sticky and never irritating.</li>
            <li> I was definitely skeptical when I saw a tube of this stuff on the shelf at my local drugstore boldly proclaiming \\&quot;100% Gel\\&quot;----OF COURSE it&#x27;s 100% GEL----it&#x27;s NOT 100% Aloe Vera though, obviously!! Secondly, I strongly suggest that anyone considering this product should Google ALL of the other ingredients. You&#x27;ll probably wonder, as I did, if this stuff will CAUSE more problems than it CURES! I pitched my tube out immediately after reading what this other stuff is. One of the ingredients, Diazolidinyl urea, for example, is a KNOWN CARCINOGEN and has been banned in Europe! Also, although the label boldly proclaims \\&quot;NO ALCOHOL\\&quot;, you will find that one of the ingredients is INDEED a \\&quot;tri-alcohol\\&quot;!! You simply cannot trust advertising and I will be more wary before buying similar products in the future and will NOT do business with a company like Fruit of the Earth who tries to be so sneaky and borders on dishonesty.</li>
            <li> I like this gel it works great on my skin just what i needed living in los angeles.</li>
            <li> Telling a friend that people have talked positively about her without her knowing always produces an unexpected thrill. But telling her that people who seem not to admire her so much, in fact, do admire her -- in some small, secret way -- makes her feel as if she&#x27;s done such an amazing job that she&#x27;s somehow wiped out jealousy and pettiness.</li>
            <li> This is one of the only Aloe products I can find that is almost pure aloe.  It is fragrance and color free, which is important when using it as a burn relief.  I was unable to find any products in drug stores or department stores that match the purity of this product.</li>
            <li> With the dry season here locked in the house by Wisconsin&#x27;s bitter winter, I&#x27;ve found the old pins just are plum irritated and irritating.  My new humidifier is helping but I still have leg patches that felt almost as bad as an old case of singles I had years ago and my elbows and knees are like sandpaper. It wasn&#x27;t magic, like instant or anything like that but liberal slathering on the legs and even arms has taken me from &amp;#34;don&#x27;t touch me,&amp;#34; to .no problem.  Now, I see some have taken exception to the fact that it&#x27;s not 100% pure aloe and I will agree, the seller is pretty clever to straddle honesty this way.  It is not 100% aloe, no getting around it.  I&#x27;ve used other aloe products that didn&#x27;t work any better  or as well  than this, it serves my purpose so I don&#x27;t have a problem  with using this product.  Heck, a breath of &amp;#34;fresh air&amp;#34; has more crap in it than this stuff does.  Nice packaging too, like the pump.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Best aloe vera that I have used . light and cooling for bug bites and other things I would buy again!!!      update. :  no alcohol.in this product. I used last  fall , when I was bitten by a spider during the night. painful bite. it worked to take the pain out in 24 hours. better aloe gel than what I have bought in stores. very soothing.</li>
            <li> Its clear, non greasy and can be used in a hair or skin.  I had some dark spots that went away after using this.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it said, &amp;#34;Aloe Vera 100% Gel,&amp;#34; which I thought meant it was pure aloe gel.  Turns out it has six other ingredients, some of which I&#x27;d really rather not use on my skin.  I won&#x27;t be buying again, but will be looking for something that really is pure aloe vera.</li>
            <li> I have used the usual brands and store brands for years. This is the first one that 1, is fragrance free, and 2, lists aloe as the first ingredient, which means its percentage is highest among ingredients. This gel goes on smoothly, and dries quickly,leaving skin very smooth. The healing properties of aloe are legendary, there is no need to add glycerin and fragrance like other brands do. This is without question the best one yet. Those other ingredients that some complain about are very small in percentage and used to preserve the product and retain consistency. Not enough to cause harm.</li>
            <li> Product works very well for me.</li>
            <li> I love it.  This gel is perfect to be used alone or in my DIY lotions.</li>
            <li> Almost impossible to find in drugstores large and small, 100% Aloe Vera Gel is unadulterated with all of the alcohol and camphor and other strange substances that do not contribute to the wondrous healing powers of these amazing sugars.  Serious homeopathic healing.  Not very sexy.</li>
            <li> This gel makes a great base for the water base moisturizer I make with it. My hair loves it the only thing is I can&#x27;t over do it or it gets a bit sticky;) I loved it.</li>
            <li> I have use this product since it came out during the 1984 Los Angeles Summer Olympics who was the product Sponsor.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this every day to shave.  It&#x27;s a healthy, skin-protecting alternative to shaving cream and other shaving products.  He, and I, love Fruit of the Earth.  The dispenser is very handy on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> I use this on my old dogs to prevent hot spots.  Works awesome and doesn&#x27;t overly smell.  Dogs seem to really like it too.</li>
            <li> I use this daily. It great stuff</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what I need it to do.  It&#x27;s great for sunburns and for making body and face lotions.</li>
            <li> My review is not going to be typical as my use of this product is not the norm. I practice &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; meaning I do not use shampoo in my hair. While baking soda gets my hair clean, it also makes it really dry and I needed to find a product that would combat that, and not cause a reaction on my scalp. I gave up shampoo because despite trying dozens of different ones, they all cause my scalp to break out in bleeding sores. Gross! Anyway, mixing some of this gel with baking soda, and a little water to make it go further, and my hair is clean, shiny, and manageable without the horrible dryness it had from just the baking soda. There&#x27;s also no reaction with my scalp and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I bought two bottles of aloe, and when I wrapped my package I found one of them are run over. Since not a lot volume run out and  I live on campus, I did not claim a return .</li>
            <li> You can find this at Walmart for $3.99 or something like that. But I use it on my skin &amp; for acne/dark spot. Well I just got it and 3 days later I can see and feel a different. Im sold and hopefully I can give a update a month or two from now and all of my dark spots will be gone. :) and for those who crying about it not being 100% pure what is????? If it was brown or yellow nobody would buy it because we buy, taste, smell etc with are eyes first so Relax.</li>
            <li> I use this every day on my hair and face after saving. I often use it elsewhere for a cool feeling in place of other moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> I use this product and have been for the last five years as my shaving cream. It also keeps my skin smooth and young looking.&lt;br /&gt;I have turned a few friends on to it and now they swear by it. Okay world, now it&#x27;s your turn.</li>
            <li> handy, nice after sun lotion..I felt it was a good deal and didn&#x27;t especially get irate as other reviewers, who didn&#x27;t read the label did.</li>
            <li> Using it as a natural hair gel. It works GREAT as a light hold natural hair gel. No complaints and does as intended. HOWEVER, DO NOT get these on your hands because they seem to dry up my hands a little (even though theoretically they&#x27;re supposed trap moisture - a little weird there).</li>
            <li> perfect product ! I love it. it has many function, i use it every day! Highly recommend! And it also cheap!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a decade and still love it.  It makes a great shave gel and all purpose skin hydration.  I keep a bottle in my shower at all times.</li>
            <li> I use this on my hands every time I wash them.  Makes my hands feel smooth and softer than any lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  I also use it on my natural African-American hair.  It leaves it soft and tangle free without the greasy buildup.</li>
            <li> I do not use hair gel or hairspray and instead use pure aloe as a gel. It makes your hair soft and acts like a gel but without that crunchiness. This is one of my secret weapons in keeping long, healthy hair!</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time with 2 day shipping.  Feels good on skin after a whole day of sun bathing. Tube big enough to last for a week of vacation with 4 person!</li>
            <li> I bought Fruit of the Earth Aloe Gel many years ago.  I&#x27;ve recently started making homemade whipped body creams and butters.  When I ran out of Fruit of the Earth Aloe Gel, I went to my local CVS Pharmacy and picked up some of their brand of aloe gel, which looked the same.  I thought one gel would be the same as another, so I regret not checking the ingredients.  Unfortunately, they&#x27;re NOT formulated the same.  My whipped body cream, which contained some very expensive oils and butters, turned out awful with the junk I got from the store.  Luckily, I still had the empty bottle of Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera Gel, so I could check the brand name.  I&#x27;ve since made another batch of body cream using Fruit of the Earth Aloe Gel, and as with my first batch, it turned out great. I will never buy another brand.</li>
            <li> This size is great since I use the Aloe Vera for homemade lotions.  I like that it has a pump, although mine arrived broken and I had to find a spare top to use instead (I didn&#x27;t feel it was worth the time or effort to return).</li>
            <li> I love the product but the pump doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent.  The uses are multifaceted.  I use this product on my natural hair for locking purposes.  Aloe vera gel is excellent for burns and for the topical use on sking.  If burned, the gel can be applied immediately and it not only takes the pain away immediately but begins the healing of the skin.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT.  I only wish they had wrapped the product better because it leaked and the pump did not work.</li>
            <li> We live in Hawaii and my kids love to surf. No matter how much I caution them to use plenty of sunscreen, now and then they come home with painful sunburns. We always have a bottle of aloe gel in the fridge to help cool and heal the burns.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t happen to have a real medical Aloe Vera plant around that you can break a piece off to sooth a burn or cut or scrape, this is the next best thing.  I have used this for years to heal a multitude of things and it works.  Great for sore muscles, and as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Just as expected! It&#x27;s aloe, no smell, no funny green color, did exactly what I needed it to do (spent a week at the beach). The bottle is giant and I think will last quite awhile!</li>
            <li> The best you can use this product for everything I know because I do.</li>
            <li> This stuff is nice, I use it in homemade hair gel. Very good quality I think, but I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to. My one complaint is the pump bottle came to me with a broken pump. I can still use it but it&#x27;s a bit more of a pain.</li>
            <li> I use Fruit of the Earth Aloe regularly (twice a week) as an overnight mask for my face. It tends to even out blemishes, while moisturizing and reducing acne/random bumps. It feels nice against your skin too! I&#x27;ve also used it on peeling/cracked skin, burns, and scabs and it&#x27;s helped heal all of these. I personally am not too concerned about the presence of the (few) chemical additives in this gel, but please read other reviews for the discussion on chemicals in the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 2 cents is to look for it in your local store! I found it at my grocery store for a third of the price ($3.50). Amazon doesn&#x27;t always have the best deal!</li>
            <li> My almost 2 year old son has very long hair and I was looking for something a little more natural to use in it to keep it tame. This was the best bang for your buck without a bunch of terrible ingredients. It still is not perfect ingredient wise, but it keeps my son&#x27;s hair out of his eyes and does not leave his beautiful blond hair crunchy or greasy.</li>
            <li> Best sunburn remedy ever!!!! I LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a good product. I use it as a moisturizer and it works fairly well for that. The bottle came individually wrapped with the pump engaged. I&#x27;m surprised none of the product was pumped out during shipping.. but I didn&#x27;t have a mess in my package so I won&#x27;t complain. Overall, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It matches with what promises in the introduction.&lt;br /&gt;Price is also acceptable, All in all, pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using it in the future.</li>
            <li> I find this works really well as a facial moisturizer for my adult (32 yo) skin. I have acne - still!- and this is probably the gentlest, most effective thing I have ever used on my skin! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product is made from pure aloe, but is not pure aloe.  It contains pure aloe (the same way pop-tarts contain natural flavors).  It still works well, so it&#x27;s as good as the real thing.</li>
            <li> We use this for dry skin, foot care, insect bites, sunburn, rash, and scraped elbows or knees. It healed a burn on my finger from the oven in 3 days with several applications. There is no scent added, no coloring, just whatever makes it gel. It&#x27;s the next best thing to growing an Aloe Vera plant. The value is great, and it is convenient to get it shipped to the house.</li>
            <li> This product goes on cleanly and has no added scents.  It soothes irritated skin and does not inflame it further.  I like the price, too.</li>
            <li> Was recently suggested by my radiologist to use this gel two times a day on the skin where I am getting radiation. It works well and keeps the skin smooth inspite of radiation effeects. I got this at my hospital pharmacy and the price was slightly cheaper. I plan to use them in my hand and knees where I see a lot of dry skin due to chemo effect.</li>
            <li> This is way to thick of a gel, when they said 100% gel they weren&#x27;t kidding. Ive seen some deceptive marketing in my day but this company is really leading the pack. I dont like how they dont say how much actual \\&quot;aloe\\&quot; is in it 0%. This stuff is thicker and stickier than Vaseline. Fruit of the earth, hardly. The only use I could see for this stuff is maybe as a special effect in an alien movie where people are stuck in a preservation tank. in all seriousness, wtf. Says it&#x27;s American made which is an insult. Not even china would try to pass this stuff off.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand of aloe vera for years and like to take the travel size with me.  This large pump is great at home and helps me easily refill the convenient travel sizes, ultimately saving money and time (re-purchasing the small sizes).</li>
            <li> A pretty substantial supply of Aloe Vera, at a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s really useful for dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I use this as an aftershave ... has worked great.  I shave my head and face with Creamo Brand shaving cream, and then I use aloe as an aftershave.</li>
            <li> great product but pump came in broken.. have to switch bottles..</li>
            <li> I love this product. It would get 5 stars had it not leaked in the packaging. We used it for a birthday project and it was a hit.</li>
            <li> Love the product, the pump, the price and the size. Excellent value all around.</li>
            <li> I used this for everything and it is a very good product. Really helps aide in healing. Just pure aloe, is great.</li>
            <li> Great product and service! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this add it to liquid hand soap in winter to help keep my hands from drying out.will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is not a moisturizer nor should it take the place of one.  Aloe is an excellent astringent that adds moisture to your skin and then dries. It is best used before your apply a moisturizer to your face or body.  Once it has soaked in, then use a moisturizer with some sun block in it.  A good product at a good price, but if you are using it instead of a moisturizer with sunscreen in it, you are not really getting protection from the sun or the full benefit of aloe.</li>
            <li> I grow my own Aloe Vera but needed a more convenient application manner.  It is working o.k. but I was disappointed to learn it is 100% Gel NOT 100% Aloe Vera.</li>
            <li> Love this clear aloe vera 100% gel. Perfect and non-sticky!</li>
            <li> uh Hello... Triethanolamine, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Carbomer 940, Tetrasodium EDTA, DMDM Hydantoin, Diazolidinyl Urea&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what is that doing in there?</li>
            <li> The bottle that I received was slightly different than the one pictured, but in a great way. The bottle I received had a built in pump that makes it super easy to use!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Used this big bottle as a refill for some smaller bottles. I use it for my hands and it&#x27;s a really good light hair Gel.</li>
            <li> Use this for post laser treatments - It works well and calms (also cools) irritated skin. Also great for sunburns.</li>
            <li> This a very healing product.  Helps heal sunburns, rashes, and many other problems.  It does have a little sting to it when applied but blowing on it takes the sting out.  I highly recommend this for scrapes of all kinds.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because it advertises as 100% aloe and I had a bad skin reaction to radiation. The doctor recommended using aloe to soothe it. Unfortunately this is not pure aloe and when I used it on the raw skin it caused severe discomfort. I&#x27;m sure it would be fine for mild sunburn or another skin problem where the skin is not raw, but I don&#x27;t recommend it for use on raw or peeling skin.</li>
            <li> Fruit of the Earth is the only brand of Aloe Vera  gel I can find that is natural, without a lot of unnecessary scents and chemicals. I use it for my &amp;#34;sandal feet&amp;#34; in the summer to moisturize them and it dries quickly. I also use a little bit to rub on my head after washing my hair, and then comb it through  as a conditioner and it works great!</li>
            <li> Got it for the boyfriend. He uses it daily and appreciates that it doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;girly.&amp;#34; He uses it on his face and bald head and it does the trick without breaking him out.</li>
            <li> I really like this Aloe gel. Fruit of the earth manufactures this product in the United States. It has no color or fragrance added to it, and I have found Aloe to be the best remedie for sunburn and minor to moderate burns in the kitched and around the campfire. I would recommend this brand of Aloe</li>
            <li> Ordered this to use with my NuFace instead of the very pricey gel offered by NuFace.  Even though NuFace says you must use theirs, this seems to work the same for me.  I was very pleased with the amount of product I received for the very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> If you want to soothe your skin while promoting skin cancer with the Diazolidinyl Urea then have fun, but I&#x27;d imagine only Fruit of the Earth wants that for you as they lead you to believe the Aloe of Vera in this gel is 100% when in reality the BS in this gel is 100%.  It&#x27;s \\&quot;100% gel\\&quot; meaning that it&#x27;s 100% a substance that is gel-like and nothing more -- at least aloe vera is the first ingredient, but look at the next 5 ingredients.  They may not be so bad, but Diazolidinyl Urea should not be on there plain and simple.  It may be in small quantities, but how about not sneaking a little bit of carcinogen into the product we are trying to use to make us healthier eh?  That would be too logical wouldn&#x27;t it?</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and received the correct product</li>
            <li> Wife loves this gel and would not be without it.</li>
            <li> Really good for skin after a day in the sun.</li>
            <li> The only brand of Aloe Vera Gel that I use. No perfumes or smells, just clear, clean and soothing.</li>
            <li> this is pure  and the true way to use aloe.  !! pure clean light and does not feel sticky after use</li>
            <li> I am absolutely disappointed in this purchase - I should have looked past the information provided on Amazon for the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product to add to my boutique hair products as I try to get as safe as possible products to my butter-based hair food. This product not only contains alcohol (as triethanolamine) which the bottle states it is free off but there are also two formaldehyde releasers (as DMDM hydantoin and dizolindinyl urea). I&#x27;m will definitely not be putting this in my products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently trying to find another use for it other than a trash.</li>
            <li> Good for minor burns and is chemical and perfume free, which is good for people with allergies or sensitive skin. This product is very hard to find in stores. I found one store that carried it but, it was a smaller size and a lot more money.</li>
            <li> We use this at our cabin for our quests.</li>
            <li> I burned the top of my hand, a friend mention putting Aloe Vera on the burn would be the best for the burn. So I went out a bought a little Aloe Plant, The plant soothed and cooled the burn, after a short time I had almost used up all the stalks from the plant So I purchased Fruit of the Earth think it was the same thing. As soon as I applied Fruit of the Earth to the burn it stung like crazy the Aloe Plant never stung like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any how went back and bought another Aloe plant I use Fruit of the Earth as lotion makes my skin extra soft but will never use it on a burn.</li>
            <li> this is a great product for facial moisturizer and sunburns, but every time I order it online and get it there is always spillage perhaps from the changes in elevation during shipping, just seems to be wasteful. But still a great product to use year round!</li>
            <li> Way back I used to buy this brand of aloe but was much more pure. This time around there are new preservatives that I am not likeing so much. I like Fruit of The Earth overall. But not sure I would buy this aloe again. Since aloe is a natural antibiotic of sorts and being that the old formula held up great over long time, not sure why co saw fit to add the few other unwanted ingredients? Come back to me oh pure FoTE aloe! I use aloe from my garden too but this type of prod blends well with my lotions etc. and easier/neater to use.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I use it all over my body and face.  It helps with acne, rashes, and skin problems.</li>
            <li> Good Product. Arrived in time.</li>
            <li> Worse than anything you will pick up at CVS, Wlamart etc... and more expensive.  Save your $$, DO not order..</li>
            <li> I have been using this aloe as a moisturizer. love that it dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin felling sticky. highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I buy it all the time.  Good price and delivery.</li>
            <li> Love this product, use as my lotion morning/night.</li>
            <li> Works well, but not as well as the aloe plant in my back yard</li>
            <li> This is not a all natural product</li>
            <li> Hard to find this locally. I prefer this 100% untouched aloe vera gel as it does not contain lidocaine or other numbing agents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it as hair gel to avoid using chemicals.</li>
            <li> I am pretty satisfied with this product, except for the fact that is feels a little sticky on your skin until it completely dries.  I use it on my husband&#x27;s back for low back pain and it seems to help for a while.  It is also good for sunburn and seems to help bruises heal more quickly.</li>
            <li> This summer I was spraying Wink rust remover on vinyl siding.  There was a slight breeze and some of the mist got on my face.  It&#x27;s a mild acid so it burned.  I was quick to flush my face with water but not fast enough.  It felt like a sun burn.  The Aloe took the sting away.</li>
            <li> I found my face was red and a lot of skin peeled thanks to this when I first tried it. But then I changed it into a spot treatment so it helps my red cystic acne when it pops up.</li>
            <li> I wish I had looked beyond the subtitle &amp;#34;100% Gel&amp;#34; as there are a number of other ingredients added that I prefer not to use. It contains mostly aloe vera gel but adds additional ingredients such as Tetrasodium ETDA, DMDM Hydantoin, Diazolidinyl Urea, &amp;#34;plus stabilizers and preservatives to insure potency and efficacy&amp;#34; (unnamed).  These chemicals are used commonly in cosmetics AND there are competing opinions regarding their safety. I spent some time looking them up because I wanted to know for my own choice; I should probably just get some aloe vera plants to have the fresh 100% stuff. When I have used this product, it stings and causes redness on my skin so I will look for something else. On the good side, you get a lot for your money and the bottle is a sturdy well-made pump style that I can reuse.</li>
            <li> Great base for home made natural hair moisturizer. You can&#x27;t always find this size in regular stores.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what it is -- pure aloe vera gel, at a great price.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, just came with a cracked lid.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff !!! Keep it in the fridge and it is great on sunburns !!! I have had trouble finding it in local stores happy to have it here on Amazon in bulk !!</li>
            <li> Great product. Multiple uses. I mix it with 100% Shea butter and coconut oil for an awesome hair moisturizer. It&#x27;s also good for treating sunburn.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and packaged carefully. Love it, thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this for years for a setting gel for my hair.  It might feel sticky when it is first put on the hair, but after my hair is set and dried, it is soft, plus it holds the hair set the next day.</li>
            <li> Need this to keep in the house for burns and minor cuts and bruises and found if adequate to keep.</li>
            <li> This time arrived quickly, was properly packaged, and most all, exactly as described.  Many stores  don&#x27;t carry it in the winter months.  Crazy to me.  I&#x27;ve used the brand for a while, an I think it&#x27;s the best quality aloe product around.</li>
            <li> Barely used it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that useful.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Plus it&#x27;s one of the ingredients I need to make my hair potion. Without it, my hair would be dry feeling. I am glad I brought the 24oz, it very hard to find such a lager bottle in the store. The store only sell small one. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> As a redhead this is an essential tool in my skin care program. I have use this for many many years; it helps eased those painful sunburns (burn, peel turn white...lol) I also use it in my home made lotions... great tool for skin care wouldnt live without it!  Dont get the icky green stuff- Aloe isnt green!!!</li>
            <li> This is the saving grace for sun burns.  Don&#x27;t go to the beach without some of this with you.  Will continue to buy as long as it is sold.</li>
            <li> This is a keeper.  I will be buying more of this and it has great health benefits too.</li>
            <li> The text on the bottle is a little misleading. 100% Gel? Well, yes, it is. But what percent of Aloe Vera is IN the gel? 20%? 90%? You will never know, because they won&#x27;t tell you. Also, this stuff contains Diazolidinyl Urea, which is a preservative that prevents bacterial growth. It works by releasing small amounts of formaldehyde, a toxic and carcinogenic substance used to embalm dead bodies. So there you are. Better if you look for Aloe from a company named \\&quot;JASON\\&quot;, from Jason Natural Products. [[ASIN:B001EWEP6S Jason Aloe Vera 98% Moisturizing Gel, 8-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 3)]]</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I had heard about it as a good styling agent/hair product. I really really like it! I purchased it with Nutiva coconut oil, so I tried styling my hair in twists with them, and my hair came out really defined! Later I mixed it with Shea butter (and some water &amp; oils) and it is still awesome. I don&#x27;t think it is all natural since it does not need to be refrigerated like aloe vera juice needs to be and there is at least one preservative in it. But it gives me a soft hold that lasts all day (for reference I have soft curly black hair that is very fragile) and even into the next if I&#x27;m being lazy at night. Also, the bottle is huge! Can&#x27;t speak for this as a sunscreen or anything though.</li>
            <li> People think aloe is only for sunburns. I actually started using it every day after my shower.  Wow.  You won&#x27;t believe how soft it makes your skin feel.  Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> 100% makes the difference. This product is the best thing on a man&#x27;s face after a shave, and works great as a natural hair gel. Thank you, Fruit Of The Earth!</li>
            <li> Looks like 100% aloe vera gel, but isn&#x27;t.  Didn&#x27;t work at all.  Ordered the lidocaine version from the same company and it healed right away plus no pain.</li>
            <li> i use this as hair gel and it&#x27;s great.  Don&#x27;t listen to the terrible peopel rating this product badly ... it&#x27;s a fine product.</li>
            <li> Love it. Use it as a body &amp; facial moisturizer. Clears out my blemishes &amp; keeps my oily skin feeling fresh &amp; moisturized.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using this product for past 5 years.  We were told by friends that we look younger than five years ago.  I do not put anything else on my face.  Although I have no scientific proof but my facial skin has less small wrinkles. I get this same product at W..mart at much less.  Everytime I go there I just buy the entire stock.  I have about ten at home but I keep buying these just in case the company stop making them.</li>
            <li> Has more than 1 purpose in our household.  Love it.  Perfect size container.  Price is right.</li>
            <li> I have natural 4a/4b hair that has been giving me dryness problems. I tried plenty of moisturizers and oil sealants to combat this problem with no luck. I decided to give this a try as many naturals mention it on their blogs and vlogs. All I can say is this stuff is FANTASTIC. I am so surprise how it gets my hair moisturized. Though it isn&#x27;t 100% aloe vera and it does contain added ingredients, I have not had any problems.  My hair has finally stopped breaking and is soft and more manageable. I even started added this product to my lotions which have been great. I will definitely continue using this product!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Aloe vera fixes soo much!</li>
            <li> It was good as usual. I have bought every two years. The quality is always good.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff everyday on my sensitive skin, and it works wonders for redness and moisture. The aloe vera gel is versatile, reasonably priced, and natural. The pump is super convenient. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I used this aloe vera on my acne throughout high school and it works wonders!!  I am very pleased to see it&#x27;s available on amazon and will be ordering some soon!!</li>
            <li> Nice pump bottle. You get a lot for the money</li>
            <li> This product is ok, but I&#x27;m hesitant to use it and go out in the sun.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I use this product immediately after radiation treatment.  It cools and soothes the skin.  In essence it&#x27;s like cooling a sunburn.  Not sticky or gunky.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this gel but only because I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the ingredients.  My doctor said to get 100% aloe vera gel to use on my skin while undergoing radiation therapy for cancer.  I saw that it said &amp;#34;Aloe Vera 100% gel&amp;#34; and just bought it.  I realized when it came that I had made a mistake.  I should have read the description and other reviews which talked about the ingredients and I would have known.  I found another aloe vera gel called Aubrey Organics (not totally free of other ingredients but better) and bought that one.  I love it and the doctor has been very surprised and happy at how well my skin is doing during radiation.  I recommend that brand of aloe vera unless you could get a plant instead. -- Lisa</li>
            <li> Good aloe.  It does not burn or hurt when applying.  I have used it with my girls, they have sensitive skin, and it does not cause any irritation or redness.</li>
            <li> good price. quick delivery. great for skin care, especially razor nicks/burns. better than Olay</li>
            <li> So glad i was able to get this in a pump.  Came sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> The Pump was a great idea..  I will order again..</li>
            <li> Works for me, but I am not crazy about it.  Negative reviews about all the additives gave me pause, but my skin is not overly sensitive so I gave it a shot.  Winter will be the real test, the ends of my fingers crack and my former solution, Bag Balm, is too greasy.  It absorbs well providing you give it time, but getting your hands wet right after applying makes them slicker than snot.</li>
            <li> use with nu face and does not irritate like some other brands. My mom swears by this stuff to tighten her face</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I was able to contact the manufacturer with a question and they answered me in a timely manner.  This product smells great and is good for many uses including hair.</li>
            <li> Love...Love..&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin and this keeps me soft with out the over moisture</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my eyes sting when I apply it to my cheeks (even though I am very careful not to get it anywhere near my eyes).  Somehow that doesn&#x27;t seem right.</li>
            <li> Makes a great chemical free hair gel</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I&#x27;m using it for hair loss(alopecia).  I lost every strand of hair on my scalp.  I wash my scalp, apply Aloe Vera Gel, massage and put on plastic cap for an hour of more and rinse.I&#x27;m seeing great results.  I started using it twice a week but I&#x27;m now using it everyday.  This is really, really great.  MY hair is growing and I&#x27;m very satisfied because the rogaine didn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday. It&#x27;s very good for burns, cuts, and sunburns. More than that, I use it on my face every day instead of any kind of moisture cream. Everyone says I look much younger than I actually am.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what is in this, but it burned my face and gave me a rash. I had to send it back. I have used aloe vera straight from the plant direct to skin without issue, so I am not sure what it was in the ingredients in this product that I reacted badly to. Note the wording on the container says \\&quot;100% Gel\\&quot; NOT &gt;100% Aloe Vera like the title of this listing misleadingly says. Buy the plant, don&#x27;t trust this stuff.  Also, it burned my eyes worse than anything I have ever used before. The fumes of whatever is used in this to keep it liquified really irritated my eyes. I didn&#x27;t get it anywhere near my eyes and yet somehow it was still able to make my eyes burn and tear up uncontrollably. Be careful if you have sensitive eyes/skin. I am confused how so many people love this stuff?</li>
            <li> I used this up north in civilization and was really disappointed this product along with just about everything else worth having wasn&#x27;t available down here in rebel land. But adding this to an order to get the free shipping I am once again re-united with an old friend.</li>
            <li> no scent. fast drying. great for face or body. i love using this in my hair as well. not a bad thing to say about this product</li>
            <li> This product has close to ZERO percent Aloe and is a total scam!&lt;br /&gt;[...](that I subscribe to) last month scientifically tested dozens of Aloe products and determined that this exact product contains close to ZERO percent Aloe!&lt;br /&gt;As such, by law this product must change the ingredients list to list Aloe dead last.&lt;br /&gt;Shameful scam by Fruit of the Earth and the FDA should (but won&#x27;t) put them out of business.&lt;br /&gt;BTW I have used this product in previous incarnations by this company for over 30 years and still like it even though there is no Aloe in it.&lt;br /&gt;Note the sneaky syntax in the title of the product Aloe Vera 100% gel -- it does not say 100% Aloe Vera gel, but 100% gel and no claim that more than a drop of Aloe is in it (if even that much). However, the fact that it is listed first in the ingredients is a total lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...] found quite a few products that had significant amounts of Aloe.&lt;br /&gt;This product was totally rejected as they could not find any Aloe in it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two Aloe gel products approved to contain the claimed Aloe are:&lt;br /&gt;1) Lakewood Pure Aloe Gel&lt;br /&gt;2) Aubrey Organics Pure Aloe Gel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also found that the majority of Aloe pills are bogus, but some are real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See also [...]</li>
            <li> I used this product to try a wash single and go on my 4c hair and it worked out fine.  There was little to no white residue left over after it was completely dry.</li>
            <li> Excellent, natural way to get immediate relief from irritated skin, rash or sunburn.  Very soothing and would highly recommend along with Witch Hazel.</li>
            <li> I love this gel and the big bottle is hard to find in the grocery stores. I like the pump handle because I have RA and it is easy to push than to squeeze.</li>
            <li> the greatest sunburn relief next the having an aloe Vera plant!</li>
            <li> I think this is one of the purer gels with no color, smell, etc.  I cover my head with this stuff.  All over my face and use is as hair gel as well.  After shower, shaving, in the sun, etc.  I think this stuff really helps the skin buy putting an ever so thin cover and hastens healing.  I keep it on my sink next to the soap.  And because I own an aloe plant I sometimes add some fresh from the aloe leaf.  Finally, for a guy I would rather put this on after shaving than smelly lotion. Cover your face with it and I really believe it does something to make you look better.  How?  Haven&#x27;t the slightest idea.  But I think there is a little tightening of the skin as it dries.  Anyway, I like the stuff.</li>
            <li> Use it daily on my dry chapped legs. It really helps.</li>
            <li> Better than most Aloe gels out there. Price wasnt bad. I would totally recommend this product to anyone who asked.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this Aloe Vera gel because it is 100% pure and is not dyed .... they used to sell it at our Walmart but no more... so of course we found it on Amazon....we are more and more just going right to Amazon...Every purchase so easy and trouble free...</li>
            <li> Fit for purpose - Not in my case. I was after natural gel that i can use in my hair that wont dry it out and would give definition with certain styles. But this gel does not fit the bill. However, I have decided to include it in my body butters for my skin. So I guess it is not a total loss.</li>
            <li> I have chemical sensitivities to fragrances and it&#x27;s awful in store bought hand sanitizers.  I used this as the base to make my own chemical free (added a few essential oils) sanitizer.  Worked excellently!</li>
            <li> i always thought aloe was suppose to help with acne, hyper pigmentation, and scarring; however, using this proved me wrong. my skin got 1OO% times worse after using it for 2 weeks as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Works well to heal minor sunburn, and rough areas left over from acne and small cuts.&lt;br /&gt;Almost odorless.  After a long day outdoors, I often blend this gel 50-50 with hand lotion&lt;br /&gt;and treat skin that was exposed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera for my horses for MANY years. There was only one drugstore chain in my area that carried it. They were recently bought out and the new chain doesn&#x27;t have it.  So I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.   I&#x27;ll skip the details, but horse people know the importance of cleaning the sheath, teats and perineal areas.  The aloe vera does this gently with no irritation or residual build up.  But every other aloe vera product I could find had other ingredients - particularly alcohol - which I did not want to apply to such delicate tissues.  So my horses and I want to thank Fruit of the Earth for its product and Amazon for carrying it.</li>
            <li> This is a horrible product that is NOT 100% ALOE!  Read it. It says 100% GEL.  Like with fruit juices, almost all manufacturers lie and use deceptive labelling with aloe. They are allowed to call it aloe (or juice) if one drop is actually in there.  If you contact any manufacturer and ask the percentage, they will answer that it is a \\&quot;proprietary blend\\&quot;.  They are all lying profiteers. Think about it, would it really be clear if it were 100% aloe?  This product is full of chemcals - probably toxic (read the other review about this and Google the chemicals) . I bought the travel size version of this (exactly the same) and it dried out my skin about a minute after every time I applied it.  I believe that the only way to get real 100% aloe is to extract it from the actual plant yourself.  I would give this product zero stars if I could.</li>
            <li> A necessity making your own lotion and etc.</li>
            <li> I bought this after receiving quite a few sun burns during the summer, and this gel helps relieve the burning sensation. There is plenty of it, so you can use it as much as you want to.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s great for skin AND as a hair gel. On my hair it doesn&#x27;t leave any flakes and it doesn&#x27;t leave a hard finish. It holds down frizz without looking unnatural.</li>
            <li> Happy with this aloe vera.  The aloe vera gel i used to use had alcohol in it, which caused a burning sensation when used on sunburned or damaged skin.  This one is alcohol-free and does not cause any burning when used on sensitive or damaged shin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with it!</li>
            <li> I use this in place of hair gel and for other occasional moisturizing needs.  It does well for smoothing my hair back when I wear it up, and it brushes out very nicely at night without leaving a that nasty residue feeling.  An added benefit is that whatever is left on my hands after I apply it to my hair can be rubbed on my face or arms for a double win.  The store brands seem to like to add dyes to theirs, so I have stuck to Fruit of the Earth brand because theirs is clear.  I&#x27;m not sure rubbing blue or green gel on my hair every day would be a great idea. :-)</li>
            <li> I take this product everywhere i go. This works best</li>
            <li> I love this for sunburns because it doesn&#x27;t have fragrance or color added.  I let it soak in and then apply calendula lotion.</li>
            <li> I always use aloe vera as a facial moisturizer along with other products.  I just love this scent free and sinks right in no stickiness.  Thanks again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used loads of things people say can do w and x and y and z (W∧X∧Y∧Z for all you logical people out there!), but usually they can only do one or two things, and not very well. I make my own hair and skin products, including face masks, lotions, leave in and deep conditioners, and AVG will officially be a staple in all of them.&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, MONEY: this is INCREDIBLY cheap if you can find it in a store [less than half the price here], so it&#x27;s worth buying.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, LEGS: this actually cured my &#x27;legs never stop itching&#x27; problem better than every single other lotion, cream, or medicated gel. I don&#x27;t know what my skin condition is, but my doctors *insist* that it&#x27;s not eczema. I&#x27;ve had it all of my life and it&#x27;s made me miserable: I scratch holes into my pants, my legs bleed from all the scratching, etc etc. I&#x27;ve gotten used to bleeding legs, really. On a particularily bad week where I was ruining the sides of my jeans in record time, I bought some AVG from GNC, when I got home I rubbed it on and my *immediately stopped itching, and didn&#x27;t start up again minutes/hours later*. I&#x27;m a very large skeptic and only one other product has sort-of helped me [it was a lotion by Lubriderm, I believe] but it smelled horrible so I wanted to try something else. I tried so many other things and non of them made a DENT on my skin problems, but the AVG fixed it for about 40 hours or so. I added it to my lotion, and my skin is happy.&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, Face / Pimples: I make my own face mask, but I was still breaking out a bit. I thought that I was always going to have at least three [small] pimples at any given time. Eventually, I got a really big one that wouldn&#x27;t go away for weeks, so I finally decided to start using aloe vera to moisturized. Every bump but that one was gone the next morning. It worked better than tea tree oil, than honey washing, rhassoul clay, etc. Since, I&#x27;ve stopped using my rhassoul clay mask so much and mostly wash with grape seed oil, then apply aloevera. It&#x27;s been a while, and that ONE bump is still there [GRR], but it&#x27;s greatly diminished, and no others have formed! I might have smooth skin, WHAT?&lt;br /&gt;Finally, SKIN: My skin has been overly bumpy all my life, but I didn&#x27;t really notice because I was always scratching it instead of touching it. Now that that&#x27;s stopped, I can feel that my legs are much much smoother than they were before, leading me to believe I had a million tiny little bumps that the aloe vera gel has removed. Since I don&#x27;t really know [seriously, the itchy thing was not fun], that might not be the case, but I can&#x27;t explain what else could cause the sudden feeling of extreme smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;Hair: AVG is almost as good as coconut oil at adding moisture and shine to my hair. It also makes my styles last a big longer. I don&#x27;t use too much, and I usually dilute it with water, but I tried just using coconut oil one day [not much hold, loads of moisture, some shine], and just using aloe vera gel [no water] one day, and AVG worked amazingly at hold and shine, and gave a bit of moisture [it didn&#x27;t feel like I hadn&#x27;t moisturized].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...AVG has officially beaten raw honey in my 1st place for favorite Skin∧Hair thing ever, and a staple in my leave in moisturizer/detangler. Whoa! I was calling honey &#x27;hair and skin duct tape&#x27; What does that make AVG?&lt;br /&gt;One minor thing: AVG from GNC works *slightly* better than the AVG from FOTE, but is much more expensive per oz. [Sorry for the rambling! :D]</li>
            <li> Awesome! Use it every day on my face and body. Aloe Vera is amazing and this brand delivers in term of price and performance</li>
            <li> I used this product before for burns now for my hair very happy with it. I was just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I bought a NuFace mini and the NuFace conductive gel is too expensive to buy a new tube every 2-4 weeks (2 oz doesn&#x27;t last long if you are using 5+ days a week). I read on the NuFace website that you could also use clear aloe vera gel so I got this instead  - 24 oz for $10 vs. 2 oz for $20... it&#x27;s a no brainer. This aloe gel is pretty much the same consistency as the conductive gel from nuface and works beautifully (I tried the Ulta brand before this but the consistency was thinner so I didn&#x27;t want to buy it again). Plus, I specifically got this one for the pump. It  makes it easy to apply the next section of the face with one hand while finishing up the one you are working on. Makes the process less messy and faster for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 11/7/16: This worked well with the Nuface tool in the beginning. Over the course of 6-8 weeks - using 2-3 times a week - i started developing an itchy, red, bumpy rash on my face and neck every time I used the microcurrent tool. I didn&#x27;t connect the two because it didn&#x27;t develop right away. After a year of trying it from time to time and still getting the rash I gave up. Then a couple days ago I was thinking about it again and had the thought that this was only thing I changed (didn&#x27;t get the rash before the aloe) so I decided to buy the Nuface gel again and see what happened. I have used it for three consecutive days and NO RASH (unheard of with the aloe)! This aloe gel seems to work for a lot of people with the tool, but it obviously doesn&#x27;t work for me. However, I am so excited to be able to use my nuface again!! I don&#x27;t want to give the aloe a bad review because it was not designed to work for what I was using it for, so the 4 star review.</li>
            <li> Agreed with a previous review about cause swelling to the eye. I have a little itching on my face so I applied this one the face and under the left eye. The next day I woke up my left eye swelling like half of the egg, like somebody punched me on the eye, the area of the eye was red and dead skin peeling off . It cool on the skin but very strong when I apply it, I can feel like almost hurt my skin because I applied on the rash area,  but after 2-3 hours you will need to apply again, It temporary stop the itch but it didn&#x27;t heal my itching skin.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I love this aloe gel especially with the pump as a bonus.  The pump makes it so much easier to get the amount you need and not get too messy.  Wish all lotions and oils would just use a pump instead of a flip cap.  I had terrible dry itchy skin.  This along with witch hazel, gold bond, and kerel lotion seem to help it a lot.  Gret for sun burns, any type other burns, minor scratches etc.  I love the uses for aloe!!!  I think every lotion should have that as their main ingredient!  That and cocoa and shea!</li>
            <li> This is the only e ale Vera gel that I will use. Large bottle.  Good price.</li>
            <li> Bought this product for twisting locs. Works very well for my hair. Need to use quite a bit if shine is the goal. Does not leave my hair crunchy.</li>
            <li> Put this in my hair/scalp, totally had helped with hair growth. Perfect</li>
            <li> This Product contains multiple toxins !!  It contains formaldehyde, diazolidinyl urea (formaldehyde releaser), and triethanolamine (very bad for allergies, immunotoxic), and more. Never believe in any product without knowing what&#x27;s in it!  Fruit of the Earth has a lot of nerve calling this \\&quot;Aloe Vera 100% gel\\&quot; ! It&#x27;s flat-out NOT TRUE, and furthermore, this product will harm you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read all about it on the great unbiased EWG website (EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep Cosmetics Database &#x3D; [...] ). Never buy any personal care product without looking here first - it will save your face, your baby, and your family&#x27;s health.</li>
            <li> This product is dangerously misleading. I was in need of pure aloe vera gel and chose this because it was advertised as &amp;#34;pure,&amp;#34; even in the product description.  I have extremely sensitive skin and am very careful with any products I apply. This turns out to contain tocopherol acetate, which can be very irritating to the skin. I learned this the hard way. I have had a severe, red, itchy rash in the abdominal area where I applied it to help heal from a surgical scar, well over a week ago. This shows no signs of abating anytime soon. I have had allergic reactions like this last for weeks. IF YOU HAVE ANY SKIN SENSITIVITIES AT ALL, ABSOLUTELY AVOID THIS PRODUCT. The manufacturers should be ashamed of themselves, and held to account, for blatantly misleading advertising. And Amazon should stop carrying the product unless this is changed.</li>
            <li> I use this as hair gel it works great to keep my scalp healthy. Also works great for dry skin. I am definitely. Buying more when my current supply is gone.</li>
            <li> This is a great Aloe Vera Gel.  It goes on smoothly and dries quickly.  It is a great moisturizer for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Found this product while vacationing in Mexico and my sister in law had it with her. It&#x27;s great when you have &amp;#34;overdone&amp;#34; your sun time. Very cool and soothing to parched skin. Stops the burning.</li>
            <li> This product gets 4 stars rather than 5 because I would prefer it didn&#x27;t have the formaldehyde-type ingredients in it.  However, it is one of the purest aloe gel products I can find, and it&#x27;s a great price for the size.  I use aloe for EVERYTHING, to make my own hair gel, facial moisturizer, and tons of other HBC needs as I don&#x27;t purchase conventional products.  I&#x27;d be lost if I wasn&#x27;t able to regularly purchase this.  My most recent order had a pump top, which is a huge plus!</li>
            <li> 100% gel, not 100% aloe vera. marketing.....but the product works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nine more words are required so I am done.</li>
            <li> I have used aloe vera for years to soothe and heal bites, burns, and wounds.  I was looking for 100% pure aloe, no additives, at a good price, and was very happy to find this item.  If you haven&#x27;t tried aloe, this is a good item to try.  I recommend it to anyone--I even use this on my dogs&#x27; bellies when they get a bite, or have dry skin.  It is refreshing in hot weather, and they love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this item to make my own alcohol-free hand sanitizer. I worked out great.  it makes your hands feel soft not sticky.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use as a hair gel and it has had some pleasant side-effects such as minimizing any sun exposure or sun burn on my head and face (I also put some there as well). I went out golfing with some friends and didn&#x27;t take sun lotion, cap or any sun protection and didn&#x27;t get any sun burns like I used to. I&#x27;m not 100% certain if it&#x27;s the direct result of usage or combination with use of an Aloe Vera shampoo yet but have noticed improvements with my ever increasing receding hair line. I didn&#x27;t get it for hair regrowth but wanted an alternative natural hair gel that didn&#x27;t have any additional chemicals that I believed might be causing my past hair loss. I have been very pleased with the overall benefits of this product and would gladly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I recently switched over to using aloe vera as a moisturizer after my skincare routine, and this product has held up to be reliable and refreshing. I definitely like the fact that a large size is available for purchase, because I use this product whenever I can. The only reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars is the products into making it, which indicate that it has other ingredients rendering it as less pure. Nevertheless, I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT ON BURNS OR IRRITATIONS WITH OPEN SORES! We purchased this product when my wife had an extremely bad sunburn with blisters and open sores. Upon using this product she ended up in the fetal position crying due to the increased pain! We stopped using it on her sunburn, but kept it just in case. Recently I had a skin irritation that caused the skin to weep and be highly sensitive. The bottle says that it is cooling and soothing. Upon application I contemplated using a knife to cut out the affected area. I am sure that would have been less painful. It was as if someone had poured boiling acid into my wound. At no point was it cooling or soothing. Unless you are a sadomasochist in which case this is the product for you. Do yourself a favor and find a different product. This one doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> fair price for good product</li>
            <li> WARNING:  NOT 100% ALOE VERA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for scar care a while back but never used it because I still had a lot of silicone gel left and someone told me it&#x27;s not good to use other products on scars unless you are at least 8 months post op.....so by the time i was ready to use it it was a month from it&#x27;s expiration date so i threw it in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways I re-ordered this gel and noticed under the ingredients they list 6 ADDITIONAL ingredients (chemicals and preservatives)....one of which I&#x27;m allergic to and could have wound up in the ER if I had put it on my skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m reporting &amp;#34;Fruit of the Earth&amp;#34;  to the Better Business Bureau for false and misleading advertising that could cause someone to have a toxic allergic reaction resulting in possible death.</li>
            <li> if you read the label too quickly you will miss this little tidbit of information. I like 100% Aloe Vera Gel, not 100% gel that contains aloe vera and a bunch of other additives! on the positive side, it is made in the USA.</li>
            <li> I am outdoors everyday.  We live in a dry, windy climate.  I Vit E on my skin then cover with this gel and it keeps me from getting windburned and my skin stays soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I tried this aloe vera for slow healing severe sunburn. I have psoriasis as well and have tried just about every variety and brand of moisturizers and shower jells. This product has been wonderfully soothing and does not burn on damaged skin. It has accelerated the healing process substantially on my sunburn. It dries quickly and does not stay gummy and wet like many lotions. It has virtually no \\&quot;smell\\&quot; residue, no scents and perfumes that can cause burning. The price is right as well in a field of products which are known for being unnecessarily expensive. I did notice that it had stabilizers and other addditives to keep bacteria from growing in it but they are much less and more harmless than additives found in most brand name products. If you can get over that issue, then it is  surely well worth a try.</li>
            <li> Best sunburn relief ever.  It will prevent peeling and help cool the burn.</li>
            <li> Repeat buyer, this product is an excellent and inexpensive skin moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. This was a much better price than I ever found when I was buying it in local stores.  Also it was so easy to buy. Just ordered it and it arrived even sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> wonderful product. Cleared up my problem right away.</li>
            <li> All gel and no alcohol.</li>
            <li> This Aloe Gel is the best I have found. It&#x27;s not sticky. But very moistureous! Well packed - Prompt Delivery - Highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> This product really cools a heat rash and helps to dry it up.  It came damaged and I was not charged for it, but I bought another and the product itself is really nice;  especially in the hotter months.</li>
            <li> this is amazing for a quick overnight pimple treatment! Not to mention it heals scabs extremely well! And fast! :) You can get it from Walmart for $4</li>
            <li> This was suggested as a way to reduce acid reflux. After suffering from it nightly, I started using this twice a day as suggested. After 3 days, I can firmly say it appears to be gone.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find plain aloe vera gel in the stores.  Bought this to make homemade hand sanitizer (all you need is rubbing alcohol, scented oils, aloe vera gel).  Glad I found it (and love what I made - stronger scents and I think cheaper in the long run).  I didn&#x27;t go out on this \\&quot;venture\\&quot; due to price, but dicovered at B&amp;BW that the sizes of hand sanitizers were getting extremely small and the scent selections slimmer.  Glad I took the chance.</li>
            <li> This is the cheapest cleanest Aloe in a bottle I feel you can buy.  I love Aloe and use it for many things.  Check out my full thoughts on why you should use aloe too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> We loved it. It is 100% aloe and it works well for the burned skin.</li>
            <li> My family no longer uses hair gel, because we all use this instead.  Works great... a small dab goes a long way to secure hair.  Other reviews state that it&#x27;s not 100% aloe vera, and it&#x27;s true.  This is why we only use it on our hair and not on our skin.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product for your skin and perfect for natural lubrication!</li>
            <li> After I unpacked the package, I found it was broken! It really pissed me off!</li>
            <li> Helps with dry skin and is cooling when applied. I do apply 5 and 6 times per day on dry itching skin.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I are making our own hand sanitizer with this aloe and it&#x27;s oh so nice. It makes your hands soft Mmmmm</li>
            <li> Feels good and smells good</li>
            <li> The gel itself is awesome. I use it to moisturize my face and define the curl in my hair. I love that it doesn&#x27;t have alcohol in it too. However, you can get a 12 oz bottle of this at Walmart for $3.97 + tax so by getting two bottles to equal 24 oz you still come out cheaper. Just use the money you would have spent in s+h and drive to Walmart lol.</li>
            <li> I had some serious acne since 1.5 years. I used Proactiv and Proactiv+ for several months. I took its monthly membership to get rid of my acne after seeing all those brilliant looking people in their commercials. Yes, my acne was reduced but as soon as I stopped using Proactiv, it started again. I came to know that Proactiv doesn&#x27;t cure the problem but just patches it up temporarily until you use it.&lt;br /&gt;So I started finding herbal/non-chemical solutions which could take time but cure acne from its root.&lt;br /&gt;I started using paste/mask of&lt;br /&gt;-- Neem Powder + Lemon juice&lt;br /&gt;-- Mango Turmeric powder + Neem powder + Lemon juice&lt;br /&gt;-- Mango Turmeric powder + Sandalwood powder + Honey + Milk (Optional)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied mask  twice/thrice a week, along with this Aloe Vera gel which I use every night without fail. At night, I wash my face with neem soap bar and extensively apply a good layer of this gel and leave it overnight. The results are showing up real good. The breakouts have stopped and now there is hardly any sign of new acne buildups. Though the old scars exists, they are showing signs of fading out.&lt;br /&gt;One of my Indian friend recommended Vicco Turmeric Cream as daily face cream. So I am using it with nightly Aloe treatment since a month now and am happy to see the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave 4 stars to this product because it is doing the job which expensive chemical products failed to do. Once all my old marks are gone I would update my review and rating as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is coming from my experience. I am not a doctor but just want others to benefit. Cheers...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: June 29 2016&lt;br /&gt;This product is really good and have no side-effects on my body/face. I have also started using it as hair gel which gives a light wet texture than a dull grey one. Nice product, you must give a shot :)...</li>
            <li> My wife used this during radiation therapy.  It seems to have helped.  The skin stayed moisturized at least.</li>
            <li> I have black and have naturally curly hair. Going back and forth wearing it straight and curly can make my hair really dry, and hate having to put a lot of product in my hair to prevent breakage. This is perfect! It moisturizes without any residue or greasy feeling, does not weigh my hair down and makes it hair feel really soft. When I wear my hair straight, I put it on before blow-drying and it leaves my hair really soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also helps with detangling.</li>
            <li> This is soooo much better than making it myself.  Great price, great product.  My skin feels better by anticipation just by picking up the bottle.  I was damaged in a fire some years ago and I use aloe on a regular basis.  This is now how I acquire it.  I still keep a few of the cactus plants around for aesthetics, and just in case.  Be safe.</li>
            <li> Great product thank you</li>
            <li> wonderful price, great value and 100% pure aloe is the only type I buy. Love it for sunburns and keep some in the refrigerator year round.</li>
            <li> Loving it! Has replaced hair gel completely!</li>
            <li> Good product, big bottle.</li>
            <li> These products are the price is cheap,&lt;br /&gt;Now I like this product.</li>
            <li> Arrived and works as expected.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL ALOE VERA PRODUCT. LARGE BOTTLE SO I USE IT LAVISHLY ON HANDS, LEGS AND FACE.</li>
            <li> Great Size. Quick Delivery... I&#x27;ll buy again!!!</li>
            <li> First, let me recommend, here on Amazon, &amp;#34;Aloe Vera Gel By Earth&#x27;s Daughter&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Lilly of the Valley Aloe Vera Juice&amp;#34; as alternatives to this product for those with sensitive skin. I bought &amp;#34;Fruit of the Earth&amp;#34; aloe vera gel because it says &amp;#34;100%&amp;#34; on the label, but I should have read the ingredients. After using this, following sun exposure, my skin seemed to become red and terribly irritated. I did not have a sunburn any of the times I used this, but after several uses, I noticed redness and burning. I finally researched the ingredients and found that the second listed ingredient, Triethanolamine, according to the &amp;#34;National Library of Medicine, [shows] strong evidence that Triethanolamine is a human skin, immune system, and respiratory toxicant.&amp;#34; It has been determined that Triethanolamine is &amp;#34;designed for DISCONTINUOUS, BRIEF use followed by THOROUGH RINSING from the surface of the skin.&amp;#34; I threw away the bottle and wouldn&#x27;t use this brand again, especially on &amp;#34;sunburned, dry, or irritated skin,&amp;#34; as the bottle suggests.</li>
            <li> While a little grease-ie for my likes, does an excellent job so I am not doing 4 stars as it is just a small item to wash hands after apply.</li>
            <li> The quality and price are great.  I will re purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Love this for my shower.  Keeps everything nice and clean and smelling nice without chemicals - very important to me.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This has no alcohol in it, so if you are going to use Aloe Vera, this is the way to go. We all know Aloe has healing properties, so why use diluted? This is the straight stuff and easier to get than managing a plant and whacking off the leaves. :-)</li>
            <li> So many uses for good aloe at a good price. Great hair and skin conditioner. Doesn&#x27;t leave hair sticky or oily.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find 100% aloe in stores. I am glad that Fruit of the Earth is providing it through Amazon and that there were no surprise ingredients. I will be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> seems to work well, but why not just use pure aloe, e.g., from Trader Joe&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i use aloe as a moisturizer for face, scalp and skin in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not so happy with the chemical soup</li>
            <li> This product contains Urea and other chemicals that were not indicated by the &amp;#34;100% pure&amp;#34; labeling.  I will be returning this item.</li>
            <li> Very nice Aloe!  Not your typical gel, this product soothes and cools.  Perfect for sunburns or dry/irritated skin.  The pump bottle works great.</li>
            <li> I have a very large Aloe Vera Desert Plant. In the past, I did cut off some&lt;br /&gt;of the leaves to help wth burns, and other skin problems. When I found&lt;br /&gt;Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera Gel, I found it worked  perfectly and my plant&lt;br /&gt;was left to grow in my garden.&lt;br /&gt;I have arthritis and when it travels to my feet it can be very painful. I feel&lt;br /&gt;the nerves and muscles become painful, but when i apply a generous&lt;br /&gt;amount of Aloe Vera Gel, the pain and tingling disappear. My friend has&lt;br /&gt;diabetes, and she finds relief for her sore feet too.</li>
            <li> This is the pure stuff and I really like using it! Very versatile and useful making skin care recipes! Shipping was quick!</li>
            <li> I use it on my skin, but mostly as a setting gel for my hair.  It is good on a rash.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, not much to say really I mean it&#x27;s Aloe Vera Gel. I use it somewhat as an aftershave if I get any cuts especially under the chin where ingrown hairs are.</li>
            <li> Used it to make a solution which is supposed to get rid of age spots. Don&#x27;t know if it works yet.</li>
            <li> It is ok, but no feeling....&lt;br /&gt;And a little bit smell.....&lt;br /&gt;When I use it on my dry skin, it could not makes it feel smooth....</li>
            <li> This pure gel is the only Aloe Vera product I buy after trying numerous others. It leaves no greasy residue and works to perfection.</li>
            <li> I used these to make &amp;#34;padsicles&amp;#34; that I saw in Pinterest and it was amazing! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for so many things.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Good value, works very well. The other reviewers have said pretty much everything, and I don&#x27;t have enough expertise to add much to the discussion.</li>
            <li> This gel works to cool down and prevent skin breakdown while treating breast cancer with radiation. I would highly recommend to those treated by radiation for breast cancer.</li>
            <li> I did find the product for less money at a local store but it had green coloring in it but I prefer the clear product. If you have bug bites, minor skin abrasions or other issues with your skin, this is a wonderful healing protectant.</li>
            <li> Decent price - good product</li>
            <li> A great product with many usages.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  I use it for hair gel and shaving gel.</li>
            <li> Nice to find aloe that has not been dyed</li>
            <li> A huger bottle than I thought...... It&#x27;s a little dry.</li>
            <li> I was about to purchase the &amp;#34;100%&amp;#34; aloe but then I saw the ingredients.  Do your research.  The preservitives are made from formaldehyde which is a known carcinogen!  This is not pure aloe gel.</li>
            <li> We have used this brand of Aloe Lotion for many years. Aloe heals cuts, burns and abrasions in short order. The main caution is to make sure that the injury is clean before treatment to avoid infection. The cut will close very quickly with Aloe.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is a bit sticky after application, but this goes away in a few minutes. The healing is forever.</li>
            <li> it really helps hydrate your skin, the only complain i could say is it kinda painful on cut and in your eyes even you did not directly put it if you put on your nose skin still hurt my eyes and it kinda gel that dont really dry to your skin so not so like this product</li>
            <li> PLEASE STOP misleading People!!!&lt;br /&gt;Your Product is FULL of JUNK &amp; BURNS my Eyes!!!&lt;br /&gt;Only after TRYING to treat a 2nd Degree BURN did I finally Scratch OFF the AMAZON Label to find ALL the CARCINOGENS in this Heinous WASTE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Triethanolamine: a strongly alkaline substance used as surfactant and pH adjusting chemical, Human immune and respiratory toxicant or allergen - strong evidence, One or more animal studies show effects at moderate doses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tocopheryl Acetate: Tocopheryl acetate is a chemical compound that consists of acetic acid and tocopherol, Human skin toxicant or allergen - strong evidence, One or more animal studies show tumor formation at high doses, Suspected to be an environmental toxin and be persistent or bioaccumulative, One or more animal studies show tumor formation at high doses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carbomer: is a large polymeric chemical composed of acrylic acid monomers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tetrasodium EDTA: (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) is a chelating agent, used to sequester and decrease the reactivity of metal ions that may be present in a product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DMDM Hydantoin: is an antimicrobial formaldehyde releaser preservative.

            <li> Not 100% Aloe Vera as I had thought. Label is very misleading. However, I&#x27;ve been using it 3 days now and it&#x27;s brightened my face and my skin looks so healthy. It&#x27;s also helped some dry skin on my arms</li>
            <li> It was ok, not what I expected, I will just use it for twist out vs wash and go. Thanks</li>
            <li> It seems to me me there is a sogn of usage while it shown as new. It was tape up, and it wasn&#x27;t pack really well</li>
            <li> I fell relieved after getting a sunburn or bug bite.</li>
            <li> you guys know that you can buy this for wayyyyyyy cheaper at any local convenience  store, right? don&#x27;t spend a lot of money on such a cheap and easy to find product. random fact: its AMAZING for naturally kinky hair. and super curly hair too, i guess. its better than styling gel because it&#x27;s very moisturizing and won&#x27;t make your hair sticky and stiff. i also suggest mixing it with oils (jojoba, evoo, coconut, grapeseed, etc) it works wonders!!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by a physician for use with radiation treatments for my mother.  I started using it too as an all over body lotion.  So glad I found it here as could not find it in the retail stores I frequent.  It is an excellent soothing moisturizer.  No coloring and no scent.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of this aloe gel, I purchased this to use on my face because I have really oily skin that breaks out very easily when I use lotion.  But this aloe gel still leaves my face dry and leaves a lot to be desired.  One good thing about it though is that it is fragrance free which is nice.  I would not buy this product again,</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve given this a 5 star rating if the labeling had been correct! I do love the product, I am going to re-order, I use it daily, it works wonderfully well. That being said, the web page description is misleading, there are indeed other ingredients which are listed on the label but not by % so I don&#x27;t know how much is actual aloe vera and how much is other ingredients. I like that there aren&#x27;t any coloring agents etc.. and understand that this product requires preservatives. But that should be in the description. So go a head and buy this product if you are an aloe vera fan because it is a very good product, just be aware it is not 100% pure.</li>
            <li> Its not 100% aloe vera but it gets the job done. In fact This has worked better on my skin then the aubrey aloe vera which is 100% and  plus I prefer the gel rather then liquid.</li>
            <li> My new favorite! Re-ordering soon!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this was not entirely natural. It says it&#x27;s 100% aloe vera, but it&#x27;s not. There was a sticker in the back of the bottle when I peeled off, revealed a lot more chemical makeup than what it makes up to be. I immediately threw it away after I saw the list of chemicals on it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! No added color.</li>
            <li> love the pump, great size and works well. all natural aloe without that extra crap</li>
            <li> Was very satisfied with this product and it lived up to it&#x27;s claim on the site. Would recommend it to others. Really has relieved my itching dry skin.</li>
            <li> I use this gel to hold my hair when I twist it.....it seems to work....it&#x27;s quite light on my hair and doesn&#x27;t leave residue....but it has to be used sparingly though.....seems to also condition my hair</li>
            <li> This gel works and feels so good if you get too much sun. It takes the sting and warmth out of the sunburn. It goes on kind of sticky, but as it dries, the stickiness goes away. Recently, I had run out of this aloe vera gel and used my aloe vera plant, which works so well, but I used quite a bit of my plant and I want it to replenish itself. I&#x27;m sure this gel is good for other things, but I only use it for sunburns.</li>
            <li> When I applied this product to my back shoulder, my skin felt burnt, became swollen and got rashes. I must be allergic to some of the ingredients in this product. I have actually applied Lily of the Dessert 99% Aloe Vera Jelly to the same area before without problem.</li>
            <li> This is well worth the price!! I have been using it &amp; love it. After washing my face, I massage it in as moisturizer. Sounds crazy, but it actually works really nice!</li>
            <li> Use this facial moisturizer, legs after shaving, hair gel... Multiple uses.. Love this stuff</li>
            <li> I use this for my hair. Love it. I also use this on my husband (and his family weren&#x27;t they came to visit) sunburn. They are super white and pale and got burned by the Hawaiian sun. It seemed to sooth their skin and works in my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I can use on my face for dryness, with out braking out.  Great for hands to, or just dry winter skin any ware.  I’m eight months pregnant, and when I rub this on my belly, it keeps my stretched skin from itching.  Very pleased!</li>
            <li> My husband has VERY DRY skin.  He began scratching so much that he would bleed on his clothes and on the sheets and furniture.  His dermatologist prescribed a lotion that works, but my husband doesn&#x27;t like it feeling heavy and greasy.  The Fruit of the Earth Aloe Very Gel helped heal up his sores and many of the scars are fading.  His skin feels much more moist without him feeling uncomfortable, especially wearing it under his work clothes.  Unfortunately, this product is not readily available at most stores, especially in Hawaii.  We used to find it at Longs Drugs, but recently they don&#x27;t seem to carry it either.  We found it for a good price on Amazon and bought 4 large bottles just in case we can&#x27;t get it later.  There was a problem with shipping the bottles with the pumps already in the bottle -- 3 out of the 4 bottles leaked into the plastic bags each bottle was enclosed in.  There was not enough bubble wrap or other packing material to keep the heavy bottles from moving around excessively inside the box, which caused the pumps to engage and pump out gel.  Still very happy with the product just the same.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, great for skin and natural hair!</li>
            <li> Very good buy.  It&#x27;s very alloey varaly as expected.</li>
            <li> We purchased four bottles of Aloe Vera.  They were poorly packed.  All but one leaked and two plastic bottles were partially crushed.  We are not happy with the experience because of this. Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera is an excellent product however; always has been.</li>
            <li> Love this.  Whole family uses it.  Great price and excellent volume.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I am so very satisfied with this product, in fact, I have to order more right away, because I used it up so fast!. It has a clean clear feel once I applied it to my skin&#x27; This product does not contain a whole lot of unrelated ingredients like preservatives, etc.. and is as close to natural aloe vera as I could get without messing with the leaves for myself!  I used the gel for my my whole body from my hair to my feet. I love the fact that it is not greasy or oily and is quickly absorbed into the skin!  My momma&#x27;s hair has been thinning as she is 90 years old so I applied some to her hair and immediately her hair appeared to have thicken considerably!  She loves it too! My only complaint is that I did not get it in a larger size!</li>
            <li> I have used this on my face every morning, after my shower, for years.  It feels the same weight as those terrible makeup primers and isn&#x27;t harmful or oily like lotions.  Love me some aloe!</li>
            <li> Excellent gel and great for the skin to moisturize without being oily. Works good on the face,skin and hair. Has a soft hold if used as a hair gel.</li>
            <li> I rub my feet with aloe every morning to keep them cool, clean and bacteria free (that is why my feet don&#x27;t smell) Because I walk just about everywhere I go!</li>
            <li> I am a huge Aloe fan.  Burned my finger bad today with the hot oil frying tortillas for nachos.  Went immediately to the Aloe and put some on.  Without it, I have no doubt it would be blistering now.  I also mix this with lotion and coconut oil to put on my dry legs, arms, hands, etc. and being a grandma of a 5 year old, it&#x27;s amazing how soft my skin is.  If nothing else, keep it in the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> Good price for 100% Aloe Vera Gel</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find any large bottles of this locally and the small bottles were twice the price. This stuff is great for burns.</li>
            <li> This is the skin-care product recommended by my doctor for radiation therapy.  It applies easily and makes my skin feel good without being greasy.  The only problem was that the bottle is shipped without a box and the pump got completely broken in shipping.  I had to take the pump off another product to use.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and this stuff has helped in the relief, but it takes many applications to truly be affective.</li>
            <li> Cool and refreshing on your face. A nice savings by buying the larger bottle. Well worth the savings and easier to get then sometimes trying to find it at the grocery or pharmacy,</li>
            <li> Some of the preservatives and chemicals in this Aloe Gel are worrisome, but overall it works great. I use it as a hair gel. Lasts most of the day and keeps your hair in place and looking great!</li>
            <li> Aloe Vera Gel, and about the same price, 6 oz tube, 2 for $5. I grow my own aloe, easy. The more we neglect it the healthier it is. When I \\&quot;took care\\&quot; of it, the leaves rotted off at the base. So I just clipped them and they sealed themselves until I use it, then I clip off half an inch, and forget it. It heals and seals itself. No fridge, no bags,  no jars no preservatives!&lt;br /&gt;I waste a lot of money \\&quot;exploring\\&quot; products that I don&#x27;t use up. Masters Miracle Gel II is the only one I keep going back to the last molecule.  It works miracles on almost every boo boo. It is $28  for 22 oz. I&#x27;m worth it, especially  eliminating the stress from bitching about those other products that I&#x27;d love to throw out.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I use it as a hair gel and to mix oils when i need a light moisturizer. It does have preservatives, but it works very well.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this as a hair gel. Works well AND nurishes the scalp in the process. So much better than hair gels.</li>
            <li> Great product and delivery was excellent</li>
            <li> Really helped out with the sunburn. I&#x27;m very grateful</li>
            <li> The packaging is deceiving  - it&#x27;s NOT 100% Aloe Vera, it has a bunch of other chemicals in it including tetrasodium ETDA, which is made from formaldehyde. I bought it thinking it was 100% Aloe Vera and not full of other crap, should have known better and checked the ingredient list rather than trusting the 100% &amp;#34;Gel&amp;#34; claim.</li>
            <li> Listen, my hair can be whacky sometimes...when I&#x27;m not in the office, I let it be..but need to keep it under control when I&#x27;m acting &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; - was super tired of mega-sticky hair glue, but mousse just didnt hack it...enter Aloe ... stuff works like a champ...holds just fine, but if you run your hands through it will soften up immediately like a mousse...and good for you&#x27;re hair and scalp to boot.  Give it a whirl</li>
            <li> I work construction and this is great for sunburn and other minor burns.  I also use it as a hair gel and It works great.  My hair stays put all day and is very soft the next day.  Also as I&#x27;m getting older it helps my skin from getting too wrinklelly.    Also works great as shave cream, it&#x27;s clear and good for my skin so I don&#x27;t have to rinse it off or use aftershave.</li>
            <li> Fruit of the earth has some awesome products. This helps ao much to heal skin scrapes and repair sun damage to your skin. It is awesome aloe gel.</li>
            <li> No, I am not a scientist but I am literate.  I don&#x27;t want products I use to cause me cancer.  Fruit of the Earth?  More like, &#x27;they don&#x27;t provide health insurance.&#x27;  I&#x27;m sure this company hires chemist who could think of more natural ingredients to use.  I will NEVER buy this product again, but thanks for encouraging me to grow my own aloe plants.  I liked this product, but not some of the ingredients, and I know you can do better.</li>
            <li> I use this as a facial moisturizer. It takes a bit to get used to it,because it is a gel, and not a lotion. But I love this stuff. It helps against acne scars, helps against acne in general, and gets rid of bug bites really fast. This doesn&#x27;t have any alcohol in it, so it&#x27;s not drying. It also has vitamin E in it. So all in all, this stuff is great for your skin. A little goes a long way, so the bottle will last you ages!</li>
            <li> I tried this stuff. I can&#x27;t believe ANYBODY would leave a good review. The more of this I used the worse my hands got. They continued to dry and even started cracking. Finally started using some Gold Bond Ultimate healing and My hands COMPLETELY cleared up overnight. Maybe this product works for SOME but it was horrible for me. It was so bad that I am speculating that the good reviews were made by some of the makers friends/owners. My hands reacted as if I was putting straight alcohol on them !!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with my Nuface machine, and it works great.  I know it will last awhile, and is very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Thanks for sending this so fast it&#x27;s aloe it&#x27;s the best everyone needs aloe if you don&#x27;t have it you need to get it now</li>
            <li> Love this. Got this to help with my scalp issues. Also great for the rest of my very sensitive skin. Soothing.</li>
            <li> Bought this item because I heard it was good for razor burn.  It arrived quickly.  The pump dispenser makes it easy to use.  Large bottle for a good price.  No complaints whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Bought this to help with my eczema. After all the great reviews, thought I was getting an excellent product. Maybe I was. But the minute I applied it to my skin, my skin started burning. I had to wash it off immediately and have not used it since. Wish I had read reviews more carefully about the chemical additives. I would not have purchased it.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years.  It is great for burns and other skin issues, but my everyday use is as hair gel.  It is light, not sticky, and adds just enough body for my fine curly hair.</li>
            <li> This product actually hydrates my skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!  I keep it on my bathroom vanity and use it for anything and everything.  I have extremely sensitive skin and the Aloe works really well for me.  I also mix it with oils and clays for various reasons.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS! IT&#x27;S NOT ALCOHOL FREE AND IT IS NOT EVEN 100% ALOE VERA! IT FUC*ED MY DAM* FACE UP</li>
            <li> If you use aloe gel please know this is a very good product at a really good price. It will take you a very long time to use up this bottle. You get alot for you money.</li>
            <li> i thought it was going to make my skin very soft but it didn&#x27;t  may be the aloe vera gel from the leaf is better.</li>
            <li> Save your money,go to your local supermarket and pick up a Aloe plant for the same price if not cheaper,or an Aloe stalk for a dollar. Go all natural with Aloe,it&#x27;s to much of a fantastic healer to be mixed with garbage. It&#x27;s the plant of the Gods,Mother Natures recipe for our skin intended to be used in its purest form. Just fillet a stalk,put it in a container,keep in the fridge ( or make aloe ice cubes ) and you&#x27;re golden.</li>
            <li> well... sighs.. it has not helped my skin in any way so far. Works well in hair though.</li>
            <li> Just Aloe, that&#x27;s all</li>
            <li> This gives me a rash.</li>
            <li> It does not relieve the pain but it does help sooth radiation burned skin. My wife loves this product.</li>
            <li> Seems like high quality 100% aloe vera. great price.</li>
            <li> I am never allergy to any cosmetics before, but when I try some of this on my face, my face feel burned and hurt. After I wash it away, it stop hurts. I will not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommand this one</li>
            <li> I use Aloe a lot and bought this in a 3 pack. I bought this months ago and still have not finished the first bottle. Very pleased with the product. I would definitely put in another order with this seller once my set is finished.</li>
            <li> I had the travel size version of this product when I traveled to the Caribbean recently.  I got an awful mosquito bite that swelled to the size of a silver dollar and was a hard knot to the touch.  My husband could see it protruding on my leg from a distance.  It was itchy and painful and ugly. Out of desperation, I applied this product and I felt instant relief.  Literally less than 10 seconds and it felt better.  I have had these types of severe allergic reactions for years and I wish I had known about this product sooner.  It was absolutely amazing.  These bites usually leave a lasting scar for up to 6 months.  After just 2 days, I can already see the scar diminishing and the hard knot has softened, though my skin is still slightly raised, it&#x27;s obviously healing.  I am sold on this product!</li>
            <li> this is the best quality aloe I could find and the price is wonderful for how much you get. I have had great success using this stuff as an aftershave, in hair masks, body moisturizer, hair gel, eyebrow gel, and of course for rashes and wounds. there are many websites that tell you all the uses of 100% aloe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you have a crazy idea and wonder if this stuff will work, it probably will.</li>
            <li> I purchased one bottle and have been using it for months now. I was pleased by the deliberate shipping speed and I recommend this organic formula to everyone.</li>
            <li> Not Real Aloe vera... seems fake..&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Aloe vera since childhood... this seems something else</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t buy these item in stores anymore.  The website gives at least a dozen stores to purchase---cannot be found.  I bought a double size of Fruit of the Earth Aloe Gel and it came with a pump. The price was better than any I have ever paid at a store.</li>
            <li> How on earth can they write on the label 100% aloe gel when the next five ingredients are things you can&#x27;t pronounce or need to be a scientist to understand?</li>
            <li> Seller shipment came before expected. Product packaged well and works like a charm and I really like the fact that it&#x27;s all natural. I bought it for the purpose of using it as a hair gel.</li>
            <li> I recently bought a bottle of this brand and found it to be a&lt;br /&gt;very good product, I love that it&#x27;s made in the U.S.A. The price&lt;br /&gt;is great and it lives my skin baby smooth and soft, I use it after&lt;br /&gt;my shower, it keeps my skin from drying out. I recommend this&lt;br /&gt;product highly.</li>
            <li> This product exceeded my expectations 100 percent. It is not sticky and tacky feeling like some other gels. This gel really makes your skin feel soft, and dries instantly.</li>
            <li> Quality was good.  Been into herbs for a while prefer the 100% stuff like this.  Arrived fast.  I was pleased all around.</li>
            <li> very good product and lasts a long time. Natural and it does not have a bad smell. will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and has virtually no smell. Feels nice and cooling on the skin. HUGE bottle too :)</li>
            <li> I like the product it iz the scond time I have ordered it</li>
            <li> I use it on sunburns, cut, aftershave, hairgel... Seriously. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> This is  good product and I will buy it again but I must say it last me a long time. It is great for many uses...sunburns, and just for your your skin in general!</li>
            <li> By far the best aloe vera gel I have found for my needs. I use it as a moisturizer before bed and under my make up for the day. I have used it as hair gel as well. Does not contain any alcohol as others do. I love what it does for skin and hair. I highly recommend this product above any other aloe vera gel product on the market.</li>
            <li> This is the big bottle.  I like to use it in my hair and on my skin because other products just have too many chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure what happened. Still, its the best aloe vera gel around. Great for the occasional mosquito bite or skin irritation. I personally use it as a hair gel. Pretty dope, but don&#x27;t get to excited and over do it. It WILL harden.</li>
            <li> I am just now finishing my first bottle of this brand and type aloe vera gel.  I assumed it was 100 percent pure as the title says, only just now after reading other reviews to I see additives such as formaldahyde (sp?). Personally I like this gel it does what I expect it to for my skin. BUT I am looking for a more pure product with no GMO&#x27;s. Good product, but if you are looking for pureness, I suggest looking at others.</li>
            <li> Works great as a non greasy light hair gel and wonderful healer for sunburns</li>
            <li> Have replaced all moisturizers with this aloe and my skin has never been happier. Better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> JUST GO TO YOUR LOCAL WHOLE FOODS OR GROCERY STORE AND BUY AN ALOE VERA PLANT OR LEAF. IT WILL BE ALL NATURAL AND SINCE ITS KEPT IN THE FRIDGE IT WILL COOL YOUR SUN BURN. I PURCHASED A HUGE ALOE LEAF FROM WHOLE FOODS FOR $2.00. I  KEEP IT IN THE FRIDGE AND CUT OFF A PIECE TO MOISTURIZER MY FACE IN THE A.M. &amp; P.M.  IT&#x27;S GOING ON 2 MONTHS AND STILL HAVE A LOT LEFT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DONT PUT TOXIC THINGS IN YOUR BODY, ESP. IF YOU HAVE THE CHOICE TO PURCHASE THE REAL THING. 100% NATURAL.</li>
            <li> Loved it helped my hair become super soft and shiny it also helps with bruises I just ran out of it but they&#x27;ve faded tremendously</li>
            <li> It has other ingredients, the names of which are too long and foreign to even write, plus it has stabilizers.  It&#x27;s sticky - true aloe vera isn&#x27;t sticky.  I&#x27;ll keep it, may be good for something, but it doesn&#x27;t work on dry skin like my true 100% aloe vera did.</li>
            <li> Great for sunburns and itching.  Pure Aloe Vera without lots of other stuff added that can cause problems.  No strong odor.  We&#x27;ll keep some of this on hand in the future.  Large bottle seems to last forever.</li>
            <li> I like the product. used it for a long time.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by another cancer patient who is also receiving radiation and it helps with the burns and blistering.&lt;br /&gt;Helps it after treatment, feels cool and reduces some of the pain.</li>
            <li> My husband loves using this for hair gel...it doesnt flake and leave any residue.  He has jet black, smooth hair.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to use with a microcurrent device ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CE6CFLU/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 ) works great and doesn&#x27;t dry out to quickly. If i find it is drying out to much I simply spritz my face with water to rejuvinate the aloe vera gel.</li>
            <li> Sent this as a gift, recipients were happy</li>
            <li> Good product.  Crappy packaging.  Grow an aloe vera plant.</li>
            <li> Great gel. Quick shipping,and wrapped in bags which was lucky because one of the handles broke a bit. No worries though, it wasn&#x27;t a horrible leak.</li>
            <li> Smells good. Seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> I like the product, I mix it with jojoba oil to put on my face and it seems to keep my skin more moist than other cosmetic products.  I bought it to help my eczema and dermatitis based on a lot of reviews but I am not noticing it helping the redness.  My skin does not itch or sting as it used to and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the Aloe and/or the cooler weather that is helping that problem.</li>
            <li> Great price and product. Have used this for years as hair gel. Best gel  I have found, and&lt;br /&gt;all day hold without drying out your hair. Its not water proof but  hair is soft when wet.</li>
            <li> As advertised,  totally clear aloe, no alcohol.  Dispenses easily. Great price</li>
            <li> Great hair conditioner.</li>
            <li> This works fine as a hair gel for me.</li>
            <li> Good size and doesn&#x27;t stink like the new TJ&#x27;s formula.  I don&#x27;t care about the nitpicking comments on the formula.  It works, its soothing, and it doesn&#x27;t stink, and its a reasonable price.  Good enough for me.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I needed and at a good price.</li>
            <li> If you look into the nature of the chemical additives in this product, you may consider it to be toxic. I am appalled!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected according to the description. Thank goodness for fragrance-free skin products.</li>
            <li> very good,as described and packaged well. Arrived right on time.</li>
            <li> This is not 100% Aloe Vera even though it is 100% Gel.  Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> It says it&#x27;s 100% pure Aloe vera gel but it contains Triethanolamine. My skin scraped off and put some of this so called pure aloe but it stung a lot so I checked the ingredients and it has six additional chemicals in it. The Triethanolamine is toxic.  I didn&#x27;t bother looking up the other five chemicals though, one toxin was enough for me. In small writing it says no animal testing, but Thiethanolamine have already been tested on animals and it game them cancer. I don&#x27;t get it why put this toxin in something that is supposed to be good for us and misdirect labeling? It says 100% gel but it seems it does not me Aloe gel, it just means that this is in gel form.</li>
            <li> I really like it very much ! it&#x27;s very good and useful! I think I will but more in the future!!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Pump container works extremely well!</li>
            <li> This product works great for my family. We use it to make our natural hair products. Great hold without  crunch or flake. I only rated it 4 stars because I recently found it in Walmart. So I would probably shop there next time.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  I use it everyday to shave and as hair gel.</li>
            <li> I like it very much. It is so big and I can use it for a long time. It is not expensive at all.</li>
            <li> Living by the beach you need slow. The girlfriend said the clear stuff is the best, I have to agree.</li>
            <li> Not icky, not sticky, just nice and a great price too.  Works well with the Nuface device as a conductive gel.</li>
            <li> Use it for burns, moisturizing, after shaving, and rashes.</li>
            <li> I use the aloe gel for everything from sunburn to hair gel to aftershave protection, so finding a large bottle like this, especially at a great price, is fantastic.  The bottle I got was different from the one in the photo in that it has a pump top, like a soap dispenser.  Good for me, I leave it on the bathroom counter, and the pump is handy.</li>
            <li> This aloe gel is a necessary staple of our home.  It comes in a pump bottle which is not shown in the picture but is a lovely help.  I found that it really works fast at relieving wrinkles on fingers that come when you have had your hands in water for a while.</li>
            <li> very good for the skin a good product to have for the skin care.  Nothing to not like about being a gel for the skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few months ago for some dry itchy patches of skin. It worked great so I started using it as my daily moisturizer. Now my skin is soft and glowing. It&#x27;s such a great value too! I even use it as a shaving gel.</li>
            <li> Best Aloe Vera I tried. Works very well on the brown &amp;#34;liver spots&amp;#34; on my hands. Use on arms, elbows,and legs. Great product.</li>
