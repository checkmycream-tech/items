            <li>This chair is very comfortable and easy to get in and out of.</li>
            <li>easy to assemble and perfect fit inside a regular tub.</li>
            <li>I have much greater peace of mind now, knowing that the chair is available for them to use in the shower.</li>
            <li>just the right size - the ease of use is great , love that u can adjust the height steady chair</li>
            <li>They are easy to move and no pinched fingers.</li>
            <li>Fit well in tub, easy to assemble and easy to adjust and remove from tub when not in use.</li>
            <li>It works fine and removable</li>
            <li>It is light and easy to move around.</li>
            <li>When I weighed 286 pounds, it worked fine with no signs of bending, cracking, or breaking.</li>
            <li>This bath chair was the smallest in width we could find to fit our bathtub.  </li>
            <li>Super easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>Using it without you could get your body really clean.  </li>
            <li>I find it more comfortable and convenient with the back removed.......and the seat part is really more comfortable, on my spine, than any of our upholstered furniture.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed mine so much that I got one for my roomate&#x27;s mother.</li>
            <li>Be sure to turn the lugs completely into the slots, to make them secure.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, I wasn&#x27;t sitting on it at the time.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, I wasn&#x27;t sitting on it at the time.  </li>
            <li>This item is very sturdy and easy to put together.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise it is worth the money and comfort and it is well designed..  </li>
            <li>Was priced right and delivered timely.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong and sturdy but not heavy.</li>
            <li>Fit perfectly in my old tub.</li>
            <li>It was purchased for my daughter to be more independent.  </li>
            <li>This is my first shower chair.</li>
            <li>When I first bought the chair, I did not lock the legs in place, and had a surprise collapse when I set the chair in the shower.</li>
            <li>This sturdy chair is a good investment for anyone who is disabled.</li>
            <li>It took a few good whacks on the bottom of the chair legs to snap them into place, but the arms and back assembled easily.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for making taking showers so much easier.</li>
            <li>I really like the one I have.  </li>
            <li>My parents have an older bathtub, which is smaller than today&#x27;s standards, and the chair fits inside fine.  </li>
            <li>If I were any less agile it would have thrown me to the tub bottom or the floor</li>
            <li>To be safe, if you need something for someone weighing over 300 pounds, try looking for medical equipment using the code word &amp;#34;bariatric&amp;#34;, that the medical industry uses for equipment designed for obese people.</li>
            <li>The little buttons which change the  height of the chair do not seem to be very secure.  </li>
            <li>I reccommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I really was looking forward to the chair as I&#x27;m 75 yrs old and am at the age where I&#x27;ve already fallen, and the shower scares me.</li>
            <li>Live and learn.</li>
            <li>Live and learn.</li>
            <li>higher than the side of the standard tub and about Â½ in.</li>
            <li>I first used this tub shower chair while recovering from abdominal surgery, and later on while recovering from knee surgery.</li>
            <li>When I sit down(95#)  they were ok, but when my husband actually used it in a shower,  he almost fell down because the some buttons slipped.  </li>
            <li>Only flaw is it wobbles in the bath tub at certain locations..  </li>
            <li>I placed the shower chair in the tub and adjusted the front 2 legs to compensate for the natural downward slope.  </li>
            <li>For this chair, as far as the seat height goes, it can be set anywhere from 17 inches to 21 inches.</li>
            <li>Better yet, learn to read the instructions before using it (a common guy problem).</li>
            <li>Just be sure to leave open the center drain hole, and then just push each rubber end cap back on.</li>

            <li>This may be an easy job for a strong men but for the measly and the old</li>
            <li>I like it and highly recommend the Bath Shower Chair with Removable Back and Arms from Improving Lifestyles Inc.</li>
            <li>Very little assembly and easy to do especially for senior citizens.</li>
            <li>Your fingers should be dexterous and strong in order to squeeze the base of the chair arm (you know you are touching it without turning the chair upside down) enough to free it from its anchor.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this shower chair for my 80-year old parents.  </li>
            <li>She grabbed the shower curtain as her body moved downward and fortunately avoided serious injury.  </li>
            <li>Using a kitchen chair as a guide, I fairly easily (one leg was a little stubborn) raised the height of the shower chair such that it was slightly elevated, in comparison to the kitchen chair.</li>

            <li> I still have painful knee problems, and until I get my knees replaced, I can&#x27;t safely stand up long enough to take a shower.</li>
            <li> I also use a rubber shower mat under the chair, and after showering I put the mat over the chair until they dry off.</li>
            <li> A few weeks earlier, my mom was showering when she suddenly felt dizzy.  </li>
            <li> If the legs are coming loose from moving the chair around, find the height you prefer, lock in the legs at that height, and cover the two slots you are using and the area around those slots with waterproof silicone glue like &amp;#34;GOOP&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> That should take care of any concerns that you might have about the legs coming loose and collapsing.</li>
            <li> Not all people are overweight and need a chair this wide.</li>
            <li> The outside arm was not very easy to remove, but it took me less than 1 minute to do.  </li>
            <li> After they dry, I put the mat upside down over the shower curtain rod, and take the chair out of the tub shower.</li>
            <li> inherited a plastic shower chair that is extra wide with one set of legs sitting on the bathroom floor outside the tub, but it is heavier and very clumsy to move around.</li>

            <li> However I must say that it is taller than the side of the bath tub and very wide.  </li>
            <li> If you turn the chair upside down, you will see two lugs on each chair leg for adjusting the height, and five pairs of slots for adjusting the height.</li>
            <li> I got it for my husband a few days ago.</li>
            <li> Rather than go through the work of sanding the insides of the narrow legs and coating them with axle grease, I just said forget it, and recycled the chair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> Arrived broken with small pieces of the underside of the seat loose in the box....</li>
            <li> You need to slide slowly the legs into the seat until they lock in.  </li>
            <li> My shower is very small and my mom weighs 200lbs.</li>
            <li> Snap in legs were very hard to lock into position...</li>
            <li> The only thing they gave me the wrong  seat!!  </li>
            <li> I effortlessly attached the legs, arms and back to the base of the chair without even reading the instructions.  </li>
            <li> The chair seat is approximately 3 in.</li>
            <li> My mom is disabled and I was always afraid she would fall in the shower.</li>
            <li> it is very tough.  </li>
            <li> My hand was weakened after having removed it from its base.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed cuz this was supposed to be used by my elder parents!!</li>

            <li> I got it for my husband a few days ago. The little buttons which change the  height of the chair do not seem to be very secure.  When I sit down(95#)  they were ok, but when my husband actually used it in a shower,  he almost fell down because the some buttons slipped.  He weighs  145pounds!!</li>
            <li> This chair is very comfortable and easy to get in and out of. I reccommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly in my old tub. It&#x27;s strong and sturdy but not heavy. Super easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product. Very little assembly and easy to do especially for senior citizens. Thank you for making taking showers so much easier.</li>
            <li> I have been using this chair now for over three years and three back surgerys. This chair is awesome especially for the price. I would recommend this chair to you! This chair has been a life saver for me!</li>
            <li> A very good product..  Only flaw is it wobbles in the bath tub at certain locations..  Otherwise it is worth the money and comfort and it is well designed..  Snap in legs were very hard to lock into position...</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this shower chair for my 80-year old parents.  A few weeks earlier, my mom was showering when she suddenly felt dizzy.  She grabbed the shower curtain as her body moved downward and fortunately avoided serious injury.  The next day, I was online shopping for shower chairs.  It took a few good whacks on the bottom of the chair legs to snap them into place, but the arms and back assembled easily.  The chair, arms, and back are sturdy.  My parents have an older bathtub, which is smaller than today&#x27;s standards, and the chair fits inside fine.  The chair sits on one side of the tub and there&#x27;s still room for them to stand up to shower.  I have much greater peace of mind now, knowing that the chair is available for them to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> This bath chair was the smallest in width we could find to fit our bathtub.  It was purchased for my daughter to be more independent.  It works great for her.  She is able to take a shower on her own.  The shower head holder works well.  This was also the cheapest price we could find.  The thing I didn&#x27;t care for is the length of time it took to get it.  It was over a month.</li>
            <li> This product will work.  However I must say that it is taller than the side of the bath tub and very wide.  Therefore water ends up out of the tub and on the floor.  Not all people are overweight and need a chair this wide.</li>
            <li> Broke my ankle and needed this chair for my tub.  It works fine and removable the removable arms were a plus.</li>
            <li> easy to assemble and perfect fit inside a regular tub. sturdy,comfy and warm, no metal parts.</li>
            <li> This item is very sturdy and easy to put together.  The only thing they gave me the wrong  seat!!  The seat I got didn&#x60;t have the placement for the shower hose.  It was completely solid in the front.  Very disappointed cuz this was supposed to be used by my elder parents!!</li>
            <li> I really like the one I have.  I needed one after my lung operation for cancer.I enjoyed mine so much that I got one for my roomate&#x27;s mother.</li>
            <li> Arrived broken with small pieces of the underside of the seat loose in the box.... took several days to get it settled but I did get a replacement .. It is sturdy but I was smaller than what it is and I can not use it where I wanted to.  Just make sure that each leg is locked into the height that you want.</li>
            <li> The shower chair is perfect, especially how the legs adjust.  They are easy to move and no pinched fingers.</li>
            <li> If you put the legs above the bottom position they will suddenly without warning disengauge and one will drop tilting the seat suddenly!!! happened 3 times in three showers so I now leave it in the lowest position only. If I were any less agile it would have thrown me to the tub bottom or the floor but I was able to catch the tub sides.</li>
            <li> just the right size - the ease of use is great , love that u can adjust the height steady chair</li>
            <li> Chair was all it was advertised to be.  Fit well in tub, easy to assemble and easy to adjust and remove from tub when not in use. Was priced right and delivered timely.  Would definitely recommend it for others recovering from knee surgery.</li>
            <li> For my mom, I purchased a Bath Shower Chair with Removable Back and Arms from Improving Lifestyles Inc. I effortlessly attached the legs, arms and back to the base of the chair without even reading the instructions.  No tools are needed. Using a kitchen chair as a guide, I fairly easily (one leg was a little stubborn) raised the height of the shower chair such that it was slightly elevated, in comparison to the kitchen chair. I placed the shower chair in the tub and adjusted the front 2 legs to compensate for the natural downward slope.  In order to help mom into the shower chair, I removed the outside arm, sat mom in the chair (from outside the tub), lifted her legs and maneuvered mom by swiveling her body into position inside the tub.  The outside arm was not very easy to remove, but it took me less than 1 minute to do.  Your fingers should be dexterous and strong in order to squeeze the base of the chair arm (you know you are touching it without turning the chair upside down) enough to free it from its anchor. The chair seat is approximately 3 in. higher than the side of the standard tub and about Â½ in. (bows out on the sides) away from the inside of the tub. The arm went back into place well enough after about 15 seconds of trying. My hand was weakened after having removed it from its base. This is my first shower chair. I like it and highly recommend the Bath Shower Chair with Removable Back and Arms from Improving Lifestyles Inc.</li>
            <li> The suction cups would not stick to the tile in my shower.  Using it without you could get your body really clean.  I ended up just taking it out. I really was looking forward to the chair as I&#x27;m 75 yrs old and am at the age where I&#x27;ve already fallen, and the shower scares me.</li>
            <li> I first used this tub shower chair while recovering from abdominal surgery, and later on while recovering from knee surgery. I still have painful knee problems, and until I get my knees replaced, I can&#x27;t safely stand up long enough to take a shower. This plastic shower chair with rubber feet is perfect when the pain of standing becomes intolerable. I also use a rubber shower mat under the chair, and after showering I put the mat over the chair until they dry off. After they dry, I put the mat upside down over the shower curtain rod, and take the chair out of the tub shower. It is light and easy to move around. This sturdy chair is a good investment for anyone who is disabled. The instructions with the chair list a weight limit of 300 pounds. When I weighed 286 pounds, it worked fine with no signs of bending, cracking, or breaking. To be safe, if you need something for someone weighing over 300 pounds, try looking for medical equipment using the code word &amp;#34;bariatric&amp;#34;, that the medical industry uses for equipment designed for obese people. Try to avoid buying any shower chairs with steel legs, as they fill with water and rust. For this chair, as far as the seat height goes, it can be set anywhere from 17 inches to 21 inches. There are five height settings. If you turn the chair upside down, you will see two lugs on each chair leg for adjusting the height, and five pairs of slots for adjusting the height. Be sure to turn the lugs completely into the slots, to make them secure.  I use the next to the highest setting, and I do not have any problems with the legs collapsing. If the legs are coming loose from moving the chair around, find the height you prefer, lock in the legs at that height, and cover the two slots you are using and the area around those slots with waterproof silicone glue like &amp;#34;GOOP&amp;#34;. That should take care of any concerns that you might have about the legs coming loose and collapsing. When I first bought the chair, I did not lock the legs in place, and had a surprise collapse when I set the chair in the shower. Luckily, I wasn&#x27;t sitting on it at the time.  Live and learn. Better yet, learn to read the instructions before using it (a common guy problem). This chair contains only a few metal parts, so you do not have to worry too much about rust or corrosion affecting metal parts that get wet and stay wet on the inside. The rubber caps on the bottom of the legs contain galvanized metal washers, and to keep them from rusting, you can remove each cap and coat the washer with axle grease or silicone glue. Just be sure to leave open the center drain hole, and then just push each rubber end cap back on. Another option would be to replace them with brass washers from a hardware store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before this chair, I used to have a chair with steel legs, but after a while they collected water and started to rust on the inside. Rather than go through the work of sanding the insides of the narrow legs and coating them with axle grease, I just said forget it, and recycled the chair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I inherited a plastic shower chair that is extra wide with one set of legs sitting on the bathroom floor outside the tub, but it is heavier and very clumsy to move around. That one is now in storage, along with the potty chair that I also inherited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sent by: RTA HOME MEDICAL, 255 WILMINGTON/WEST CHESTER PIKE, CHADDS FORD, PA 19317; PH: 1.610.558.6222.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made by: ABLEWARE(R) INDEPENDENT LIVING FROM MADDAK, INC., MADDAK INC., PEQUANNOCK, NJ 07440-1993, USA; CATALOG NUMBER: 727142121, BATH SAFE ADJ SHOWER SEAT W/ARMS&amp;BACK, BB.s in place, and had a surprise collapse when I set the chair in the shower.

            <li> Great price and very study</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t rate this chair because i did not get the chair i ordered, how ever i did get a refund for my lesser chair i did receive.&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t belive the chair i received is quite as sturdy as the one i ordered but it will do.</li>
            <li> My mom is disabled and I was always afraid she would fall in the shower. My shower is very small and my mom weighs 200lbs. The chair is&lt;br /&gt;Strong and perfect size to get in and out of the shower. Lite weight to lift.&lt;br /&gt;Great price, you can&#x27;t put on price on safety&lt;br /&gt;For your lover ones.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> You need to slide slowly the legs into the seat until they lock in.  This may be an easy job for a strong men but for the measly and the old it is very tough.  Also was worried about breaking the leg by using a hammer or something to hammer the legs in.  The chair itself looks nice.</li>
            <li> This bath chair is perfect. It is very stable, excellent size for my butt, and on top of that it&#x27;s quite good looking.</li>
            <li> I have stenosis of the spine and require help with showering.  Before I purchased this chair I had to stand in the shower and have my husband assist me in keeping my balance.  I have 2 of these chairs now.......just wanted to have a back-up in case something happened to one of them.  I find it more comfortable and convenient with the back removed.......and the seat part is really more comfortable, on my spine, than any of our upholstered furniture.  Love my bath shower chair.</li>
