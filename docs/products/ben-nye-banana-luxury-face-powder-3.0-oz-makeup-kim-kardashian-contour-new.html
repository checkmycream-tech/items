            <li> This is fake, if you go to the Nigel&#x27;s Beauty Emporium website you will see that the word Banana is in a different font</li>
            <li> how could I go wrong?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very thin powder that&#x27;s suppose to go over concealer.</li>

            <li> Love this stuff, works great for various types of make up applications</li>
            <li> Lovely product. Every professional make-up artist owns this and I know why. Sets concealer very well and I wear it just as a light highlight atop full coverage foundation. As a woman of color, I recommend this to dark skinned women. Banana and topaz.</li>
            <li> Great product. ..it really does a matt finish with amazing natural color. I highly recommend it for oily skin type.</li>
            <li> This powder is a must for highlighting the face for a night out... I would never go without !&lt;br /&gt;makes your look seems tan (without the tan !).</li>
            <li> Luv luv luv this product will be repurchasing again. A highlighted and brighten my face to perfection. This product is amazing</li>
            <li> This powder is worth  purchasing! Use this to get that perfect Kim K under eye highlight look.</li>
            <li> The CLA that I purchased from Amazon is awesome. The product and customer service was very good!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Nothing special.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product, can&#x27;t believe  I hadn&#x27;t purchase earlier.  This is a must item in my makeup routine.</li>
            <li> The same as any powder.</li>
            <li> I love the Ben nye banana powder, it&#x27;s awesome for setting your highlights and just gives you an amazing glow! I&#x27;m an NC 45 and this product works amazing for me,I heard its great for complexions darker as well but I&#x27;d definitely give this baby a try, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> Watch YouTube videos! Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Must have ! Absolutely wonderful!</li>
            <li> The pictures of Kim posted here are very misleading. Search Ben Nye Banana Application on YouTube. It&#x27;s a very thin powder that&#x27;s suppose to go over concealer. This is not a magic cure all for your dark circles. It&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Nice smooth face powder good coverage and color is really nice</li>
            <li> Like it. Only wish the bottle was round</li>
            <li> Exxxxxactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. You need to know how to a</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 2 weeks and this item has not even been shipped. ....</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve been duped by the Kardashian marketing machine. I bought this powder because Kim Kardashian has the same skin tone as me: olive skin tone with dark under eyes. So I thought, let me do what she&#x27;s supposedly doing. I followed all the techniques: bought the powder, bought the sponge, bought the fan brush. I was excited to try this out. When I applied the powder I allowed for it to set in for 5 minutes. I even put alot on, just like some tutorials show you to do. I put it on top of yellow corrective creme...yellow corrective creme + yellow corrective setting powder &#x3D; how could I go wrong? It doesn&#x27;t fully camouflage my dark under eyes. They can still be seen. On top of this, this powder is horribly wasteful. I have to tap out a pile of it on top of a tissue so then I can use my sponge on it to apply to my under eyes. I end up throwing away unused powder on that tissue. I feel duped because it doesn&#x27;t cover up my under eye circles well enough. The same job this powder gives me, is also given to me by using yellow corrective creme + regular face powder.... I end up putting regular face powder over this banana powder anyway. Thus, my under eyes eventually look cakey. I can live without this Banana powder. I feel as though I&#x27;ve been duped by the Kardashian marketing gimmick. She showed us a few pictures of using this to her millions of followers, now those millions of followers went out and bought this and ranted and raved how good this stuff is. I wonder if she got a cut of profit from the Ben Nye makeup people.</li>
            <li> I left me with a wonderful glow and I plan on getting Topaz soon. The only downfall is I have to order it, the product isn&#x27;t sold in any store near my home.</li>
            <li> Great product and even better price!</li>
            <li> never use powder , this is very light , didnt hold or clog your skin , look natural on your face , stay long no need touch up</li>
            <li> I think I fell for the hype about this product, because I can&#x27;t find anything exceptional about it. It&#x27;s rather messy because it just pours out of the bottle unobstructed. It seems just like a regular powder to me, not worth the money. I used it twice and went back to what I was using before.</li>
            <li> This is fake, if you go to the Nigel&#x27;s Beauty Emporium website you will see that the word Banana is in a different font and it&#x27;s written before Luxury powder instead of after.</li>
            <li> Best foundation powder I have ever used. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have been intending to purchase this product for at least a year and finally after putting it off for so long decided to go ahead and do it and I&#x27;m glad I did. This powder is amazing!! it prevents creasing under my eye area and throughout the day leaves the areas I apply it flawless &amp; matte. I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase. And the shipper ppmarket shipped my product quickly.</li>
            <li> Great, I love it. ..I definitely will recommend. ..</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.  A MUST have for theatrical make up work.  ANY look would benefit from this powder, but the quantity alone makes it an EXCELLENT source for any make up artist out there.  I&#x27;ll be showing plenty of uses in the months to come on my channel if there is anyone wanting to see how versatile this product is!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who knows!  You may just find your next obsession in one or more of my videos!&lt;br /&gt;Julie Hill/Big Sky Beauty&lt;br /&gt; 3553 Greyrock&lt;br /&gt;Helena, MT  59602&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big Sky Beauty&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX4ddHxZIQTL1Y-n7fUqh4A</li>
            <li> Had an allergic reaction to the product.  The SELLER, however was MAGNIFICENT TO WORK WITH!</li>
            <li> Got this to try but takes to much time for me. I like to get ready quick. Could be fun to work with and can change your look.</li>
