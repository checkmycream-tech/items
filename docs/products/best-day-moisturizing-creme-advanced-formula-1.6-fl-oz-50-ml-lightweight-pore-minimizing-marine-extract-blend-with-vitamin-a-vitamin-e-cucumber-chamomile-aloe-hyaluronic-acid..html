            <li>I liked the product!</li>
            <li>, I can just feel the moment it touches my skin that its a good nutritious cream.</li>
            <li>, I loved the feeling on my face as well but the texture I just couldn&#x27;t handle.</li>
            <li>The creme comes in a fairly size jar with a good screw on lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I find this moisturizer to be the perfect fit for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I use it in the evening on top of the Best Retinol 1.0% Advanced Formula by Cosmetic Skin Solutions.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It came nicely secured since the jar is made of glass.  </li>
            <li>I am going to be honest here</li>
            <li>Mineral makeup goes on nicely over these products.  </li>
            <li>does smell nice tho.</li>
            <li>Very nice, light, non-greasy moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and I can spread the foundation on my face very easily</li>
            <li>Best moisturizer that I&#x27;ve found and not heavy on the wallet.</li>
            <li>I just love it feel awesome cool, fresh and helped my face a lot in the healing process</li>
            <li>This cream spreads very easily and has a nice smooth and silky formulato it.  </li>
            <li>but my skin is getting better and glowing day by day.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>ended up using this on my neck and shoulders after too much sun in Costa Rica, and it felt great</li>
            <li>However I had to admit I LOVE their shipping rate.  </li>
            <li>This is a great, lightweight and immediately absorbing moisturizer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because I&#x27;ve experienced great results with the vitamin C+E serum and Hydra B5 gel from this line, I expected more.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Day Moisturizing creme is more like a gel rather than a creme.</li>
            <li>My skin is clearer, smoother, better-hydrated and my makeup even goes on better.  </li>
            <li>This product dries nicely, almost a matte, smooth finish.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks better and likes this one a lot.</li>
            <li>After researching the market, I have noticed a lot of companies are moving their face creams and serums to these types of vacuum sealed pumps in order to offer the consumer the best quality they can get from the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fantastic moisturizer, the whole line is great.</li>
            <li>It certainly didn&#x27;t break it out, and had a good moisturizing level without being too greasy.  </li>
            <li>The safe non-toxic ingredients are a huge plus.</li>
            <li>was using the Korean brand Sulwhasoo hydro-acid cream and it is as good as the Sulwahasoo but at at much much lower price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also beenlooking for the perfect moisturizer to fit my dry and flaky skin conditions.</li>
            <li>Especially at such a great price you won&#x27;t find a better moisturizer on the market.</li>
            <li>All products available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Their Hydra B5 Masque Advanced Formula</li>
            <li>their Exfoliating Gel Cleanser Advanced</li>
            <li>Upon looking at their line of products I noticed their Day Moisturizing Creme Advanced</li>
            <li>This one dries smooth and is never greasy.  </li>
            <li>My skin just feel so hydrate and smooth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect consistency as I dislike heavy oily products.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this new moisturizer as it just feels much more velvety and smooth on my skin.</li>
            <li>I liked how they were all well packaged and sold at a decent price.  </li>
            <li>Its plant based, is a cream color, by weight heavier on the finger but goes onto the face light and full of moisture</li>
            <li>I noticed that this cream has witch hazel in it which was the smell that I originally mentioned.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly and smoothly; however I do not feel hydrated even after layering over the two serums.</li>
            <li>Pure healthy, glowing, hydrated skin.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t feel like it did anything special for my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good standard moisturizer</li>
            <li>Absolutely brilliant for the Australian climate i live in.</li>
            <li>This one absorbs nicely, and is also immediately hydrating as I believe the formula is just more advanced compared to conventional moisturizers.</li>
            <li>This creme also adsorbs quickly into the skin so by the time my head hits the pillow, my face is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>When I came across this company I was taken by their amazing different assortment of products they sold for the skin.  </li>
            <li>Many ingredients breakdown with the constant exposure to light and air.  </li>
            <li>, I had a very sensitive skin, what I like this moisturizer is about super hydrated throughout the day and night and giving my skin a smooth and matt finish and leave my skin</li>
            <li>so it soaks right in.</li>
            <li>Hey, it just you and me talking right now, and I know you may look at all the ingredients and</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of hydration.  </li>
            <li>First thing I noticed was that this does come in a jar form, but more about that later.  </li>
            <li>This company has never failed me before so</li>
            <li>It is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Overall better toned and hydrated before first use.  </li>
            <li>Its actually pretty cheap and doesn&#x27;t leave you wondering if you can could of bought a whole new product with the amount of money some companies want in shipping for Canada.  </li>
            <li>So I would say if this came in a vacuum sealed pump, I believe the product would be better protected and stabilize longer.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so smooth and soft and very hydrated.</li>
            <li>I have bought for the second time and could not be more happier, I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>But I feel that each product on the skin should do something of benefit, and certainly didn&#x27;t feel that to be the case on this product.  </li>
            <li>Lets get real people, its Vitamin C not gold.  </li>
            <li>The Day Moisturizing Crème is absolute heaven for my skin.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the CSS staff is so knowledgeable about their products and very helpful.</li>
            <li>I am an esthetician an take skin care very seriously.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this product goes on smooth and actually absorbs into the skin instead of creating a layer on-top allowing me to apply sunscreen without it mixing and rubbing off.</li>
            <li>Not sure if this will be enough moisture for winter months, but for now, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>Lucky for me, my facial cream had just run out</li>
            <li>say WOW this must really do wonders on your skin...</li>
            <li>I normally use this cream at night alternating it with their B5 Masque Gel creme.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight and doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out like other moisturizers.</li>
            <li>This line, however, carries some other fantastic products that I consider to be staples in my regimen.  </li>
            <li>and I was in the market for a new one, so</li>
            <li>Since I live in Canada, it takes about two weeks to get here.  </li>
            <li>while I don&#x27;t like the fact that this comes in a jar form and has witch hazel, nonetheless I will say I was surprised by the results!</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling tight, you&#x27;ll need a sunscreen  or day cream as well.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise my skin looks smooth, I put it on after the vitamin B gel and vitamin C serum</li>
            <li>Other brands only offered 30g or less as this one is 50g for less the costs, not to mention it has vitamin A, vitamin E, and a wonderful collection of botanicals.</li>
            <li>Letsme be real, half the people who apply their facial products don&#x27;t wash their hands before hand which you should before EVER touching your face.  </li>
            <li>It made my T-zone super oily and my make-up run half way through the day</li>
            <li>This moisturizer helped do not only bring down the redness but also make my skin silky smooth all around.</li>
            <li>I have normal skin with occasional oiliness in the t-zone during warmer weather, but I have used this moisturizer both in the summer and winter.  </li>
            <li>The cream is a light yellowish tint and has hardly a smell.  </li>
            <li>I am throwing it away, going back to my Skinceuticals Daily Moisturize Pore-minimizing Moisturizer For Normal to Oily</li>
            <li>This creme helped to not only bring down the redness, but to also help heal the dry patches and make my skin silky smooth all around.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several products from this line, so far the results just keep me coming back.</li>
            <li>If you live in a dry climate or have TRULY DRY SKIN and need a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; moisturizer steer clear of this junk.</li>
            <li>Some I&#x27;ve tried in the past even left smudges or films from not fully being absorbed.</li>
            <li>My skin type is dry ,and by using this in my regimen morning and evening including other CSS products (including the HydraB and Vitamin C), I have noticed a marked improvement in the last two months with my skin - particularly the neck and chest area (use to have sun damage ).  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see any appreciable difference from when I started using it</li>
            <li> once you put this on skin feels like silk. not greasy at all just perfect.</li>
            <li> Fantastic moisturizer, the whole line is great.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling tight, you&#x27;ll need a sunscreen  or day cream as well.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise my skin looks smooth, I put it on after the vitamin B gel and vitamin C serum</li>
            <li> Every morning I apply it to my skin. Maybe I have not seen a visible effect but my skin is getting better and glowing day by day.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer that I&#x27;ve found and not heavy on the wallet. It&#x27;s light weight and doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out like other moisturizers. My skin tends to be dehydrated in the winter and this is the perfect amount of moisture to offset the drying I have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used LaPrarie, Clinique, Shiseido and they&#x27;re all good but Cosmetic Skin Solution&#x27;s Best Day Moisturizing Creme product  is something  entirely different in the advancement of the science of moisturizing. Its not a creme as in &#x27;white&#x27; and its not oil based. Its plant based, is a cream color, by weight heavier on the finger but goes onto the face light and full of moisture so it soaks right in. I use it daily and I love it. It also acts like a sealant for moisture its providing which is the pore minimizer aspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Serumtologie C 22% underneath daily and once a week at night I use ADSM&#x27;s 10% Glycolic Acid pads and after following those directions I then use Clinique&#x27;s moisture night mask. All products available on Amazon. I bought all these products myself and no one contacted me for my opinion.</li>
            <li> This product has a &amp;#34;marine extract&amp;#34; blend. It is supposed to be a day moisturising creme..but I found it had the opposite effect. It was exceedingly drying to my skin. I used it a few days, let several days pass, tried again....same result. Beware of ordering item through Amazon....they do not refund your $$ after one month. Poor product and now no refund.</li>
            <li> Whatever is in this feels great, I can just feel the moment it touches my skin that its a good nutritious cream. However it is not one you can mix with makeup, for whatever reason the creme drys and when you add even another lotion, serum or any-kind of makeup either before or after it creates a lumpy scale type of texture and sort of peels off.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up using this on my neck and shoulders after too much sun in Costa Rica, and it felt great, I loved the feeling on my face as well but the texture I just couldn&#x27;t handle.</li>
            <li> Bottom line....this product DOES NOT MOISTURIZE TRULY DRY SKIN. It is a gel form of Alcohol/Astringent, basically a gel form of Sea Breeze. If you live in a dry climate or have TRULY DRY SKIN and need a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; moisturizer steer clear of this junk. Hey, it just you and me talking right now, and I know you may look at all the ingredients and say WOW this must really do wonders on your skin...yea the only &amp;#34;wonder&amp;#34; that will occur is you will &amp;#34;wonder why&amp;#34; you didn&#x27;t listen to my warning/review. Overall they need to go back to the drawing board on this stuff and try all over again, if you want your skin to be dry like this will leave yours, simply buy a bottle of rubbing-alcohol and cotton balls and have at it, for people who value their hard earned money I have two last words for you: KEEP LOOKING!!!</li>
            <li> I heard about Cosmetic Skin Solutions (CSS) last year when I was on the hunt for a decent Vitamin C serum that that had at least 15% to 20% of vitamin C,  no fillers or unnecessary binders.  When I came across this company I was taken by their amazing different assortment of products they sold for the skin.  I liked how they were all well packaged and sold at a decent price.  Other Vitamin C serums I looked into went well into the hundreds of dollars.  Lets get real people, its Vitamin C not gold.  While this stuff isn&#x27;t cheap to make, however its not that ridiculously expensive either.  I also have tried their 1% retinol which works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months back, I received an email from the company notifying me of two new products they came out with.  Their Hydra B5 Masque Advanced Formula + (which I currently use) and their Exfoliating Gel Cleanser Advanced + (which I haven&#x27;t tried).  Upon looking at their line of products I noticed their Day Moisturizing Creme Advanced Formula+.  Now I have seen this creme before, but some how I just always skipped by it.  Lucky for me, my facial cream had just run out and I was in the market for a new one, so I decided to order this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This arrived to my house about two weeks later.  Since I live in Canada, it takes about two weeks to get here.  However I had to admit I LOVE their shipping rate.  Its actually pretty cheap and doesn&#x27;t leave you wondering if you can could of bought a whole new product with the amount of money some companies want in shipping for Canada.  It came nicely secured since the jar is made of glass.  First thing I noticed was that this does come in a jar form, but more about that later.  The cream is a light yellowish tint and has hardly a smell.  The creme comes in a fairly size jar with a good screw on lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this creme on the days I wasn&#x27;t using their other product, the B5 Masque cream gel.  This cream spreads very easily and has a nice smooth and silky formulato it.  I decided to read the ingredients and one thing caught my eye.  I noticed that this cream has witch hazel in it which was the smell that I originally mentioned.  I am going to be honest here and say, I don&#x27;t use products at all that have witch hazel and/or alochol in them.  I don&#x27;t see the point in these ingredients in skincare.  However I will admit that it was further down the list of ingredients at the back so that means not a lot is actually in the jar.  Nonetheless, I do trust CSS so I decided to put aside my biases (which I totally admit they are) and give it a shot.  This company has never failed me before so I don&#x27;t see how it would now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I was impressed by this cream.  The last few months I have been suffering from an allergic face rash that leaves my skin swollen, dry and red.  At times it hurts to touch it.  When I started using this cream it was around the time when the face rash was going down but I was still left with dry patches and irritation on my face.  This creme helped to not only bring down the redness, but to also help heal the dry patches and make my skin silky smooth all around.  My skin never felt burned, got red or worse while using this creme.  It has actually helped my face a lot in the healing process.  I normally use this cream at night alternating it with their B5 Masque Gel creme.  This creme also adsorbs quickly into the skin so by the time my head hits the pillow, my face is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have about this creme is the fact that it comes in a jar.  I would have preferred the company put this cream in a vacuum sealed pump because it allows the ingredients in it to stabilize longer and last longer.  Many ingredients breakdown with the constant exposure to light and air.  Creams that come in jars are victims to this breakdown and research has shown this.  Also, it allows for bacteria to affect the product when you constantly have to stick your fingers in the cream to apply it.  Letsme be real, half the people who apply their facial products don&#x27;t wash their hands before hand which you should before EVER touching your face.  So I would say if this came in a vacuum sealed pump, I believe the product would be better protected and stabilize longer.  After researching the market, I have noticed a lot of companies are moving their face creams and serums to these types of vacuum sealed pumps in order to offer the consumer the best quality they can get from the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while I don&#x27;t like the fact that this comes in a jar form and has witch hazel, nonetheless I will say I was surprised by the results!</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer suitable for all skin type, I had a very sensitive skin, what I like this moisturizer is about super hydrated throughout the day and night and giving my skin a smooth and matt finish and leave my skin feel great all day. This moisturizer helped do not only bring down the redness but also make my skin silky smooth all around. I just love it feel awesome cool, fresh and helped my face a lot in the healing process👍👍👍Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film on your face.  Excellent product,</li>
            <li> The Day Moisturizing Crème is absolute heaven for my skin. It is lightweight but very effective in hydrating and shrinking pores. The ingredient list shows that it is a powerhouse for your skin. For the price you can not beat it for the quality. Additionally, the CSS staff is so knowledgeable about their products and very helpful.</li>
            <li> Especially at such a great price you won&#x27;t find a better moisturizer on the market. My skin feels so smooth and soft and very hydrated. The safe non-toxic ingredients are a huge plus. Buy this product you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I liked the product! It is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I have always hated moisturizers. When I tried this one a few years ago I was pleasantly surprised. I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s now and I find this moisturizer to be the perfect fit for my skin.  This one dries smooth and is never greasy.  Just the right amount of hydration.  I use it in the morning over CE and B5.  Mineral makeup goes on nicely over these products.  In the evening I use it over Resurfacing gel and B5.  It&#x27;s been a wonderful product for me.  It&#x27;s an individual thing about creme or gel and I favor gel.  What can I say--I love it!</li>
            <li> It actually makes me face feel tight. I have to use an additional moisturizer. I was expecting something different.&lt;br /&gt;It does smell nice tho.</li>
            <li> This is a great, lightweight and immediately absorbing moisturizer. Unlike conventional moisturizers or creams that leave white residue on the surface, this product has a entirely different moisturizing base that my skin just absolutely LOVES.  My skin type is dry ,and by using this in my regimen morning and evening including other CSS products (including the HydraB and Vitamin C), I have noticed a marked improvement in the last two months with my skin - particularly the neck and chest area (use to have sun damage ).  Overall better toned and hydrated before first use.  Off to tell my girlfriends about this little secret!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the use of Propylene Glycol , In all their products. :/</li>
            <li> when I first opened up the jar the cream color was a weird color. It wasn&#x27;t white like on the picture.. and  it was a jelly feeling texture.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for a month now. It made my T-zone super oily and my make-up run half way through the day (Yes, I do use a make-up prime on my face) and it still run.  I am throwing it away, going back to my Skinceuticals Daily Moisturize Pore-minimizing Moisturizer For Normal to Oily</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this product. I am an esthetician an take skin care very seriously.&lt;br /&gt;Because I&#x27;ve experienced great results with the vitamin C+E serum and Hydra B5 gel from this line, I expected more.&lt;br /&gt;The Day Moisturizing creme is more like a gel rather than a creme. It dries quickly and smoothly; however I do not feel hydrated even after layering over the two serums. Tried it for two weeks, still need extra moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have bought for the second time and could not be more happier, I have very oily skin and this moisturizer is just the best I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> After I notice my skin improvement after I have tried the B5 gel for a while, I bought another six product of its brand including this moisturizer and it do not disappoint me. My skin just feel so hydrate and smooth and I can spread the foundation on my face very easily and evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using the Korean brand Sulwhasoo hydro-acid cream and it is as good as the Sulwahasoo but at at much much lower price.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I have used.  My skin is clearer, smoother, better-hydrated and my makeup even goes on better.  I have normal skin with occasional oiliness in the t-zone during warmer weather, but I have used this moisturizer both in the summer and winter.  People tell me that my skin looks radiant!</li>
            <li> This product dries nicely, almost a matte, smooth finish.  Gel-like consistency.  Would feel wonderful if chilled in fridge.  A little product goes a long way.  I do have a problem of not giving this product time to settle in...my foundation tends to not apply well (clumps up, smears) if I put it on too soon after putting on the moisturizer, even though the moisturizer sinks in and feels dry.  I now wait longer than I probably should to put on my foundation (15 minutes or so.)  I currently alternate between two different foundation types (liquid and creme-to-powder.)  The clumping/smearing happens with both foundations.  I do not have this problem if I skip this moisturizer or use a different one in my morning routine.</li>
            <li> I use day and night. SO luxurious to apply and my skin loves it. It&#x27;s the perfect consistency as I dislike heavy oily products. I have been using this product for over 5 years and it has never faulted! Pure healthy, glowing, hydrated skin. Absolutely brilliant for the Australian climate i live in.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product that I can layer with other products. I have tried several and had issues with clumping or rubbing off when layering but this product goes on smooth and actually absorbs into the skin instead of creating a layer on-top allowing me to apply sunscreen without it mixing and rubbing off. If I could change one thing it would be to already contain sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Very nice, light, non-greasy moisturizer. I use it in the evening on top of the Best Retinol 1.0% Advanced Formula by Cosmetic Skin Solutions. Not sure if this will be enough moisture for winter months, but for now, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good standard moisturizer but I didn&#x27;t feel like it did anything special for my skin.  It certainly didn&#x27;t break it out, and had a good moisturizing level without being too greasy.  But I feel that each product on the skin should do something of benefit, and certainly didn&#x27;t feel that to be the case on this product.  This line, however, carries some other fantastic products that I consider to be staples in my regimen.  Phyto and Phlorcetin CF, check em out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several products from this line, so far the results just keep me coming back. I&#x27;ve also beenlooking for the perfect moisturizer to fit my dry and flaky skin conditions. I am pleased with this new moisturizer as it just feels much more velvety and smooth on my skin. I like how it just instantly adds moisture to my dehydrated skin, as I so often have this need. I compared this to other moisturizers which I&#x27;ve used in the past, and my skin tells me this one&#x27;s GOT the edge. Other brands only offered 30g or less as this one is 50g for less the costs, not to mention it has vitamin A, vitamin E, and a wonderful collection of botanicals. Some I&#x27;ve tried in the past even left smudges or films from not fully being absorbed. This one absorbs nicely, and is also immediately hydrating as I believe the formula is just more advanced compared to conventional moisturizers. My skin looks better and likes this one a lot.</li>
