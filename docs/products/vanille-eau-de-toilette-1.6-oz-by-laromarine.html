            <li>My boyfriend was in the middle of talking to me about something, but I was so struck by the wonderful evolution of scent on me</li>
            <li>/&gt;Needless to say, I am in love with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll never get as many compliments with anything else.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it and it lasts forever.</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I love that people can&#x27;t smell me coming.  </li>
            <li>Ever since my favorite vanilla perfume, Vanille Abricot by Comptoir Sud Pacifique, has gone south</li>
            <li>but I have yet to be able to find it again.</li>
            <li>My favorite.</li>
            <li>This is the most desirable vanilla perfume I&#x27;ve ever smelled.</li>
            <li>When I sprayed this perfume on myself, I was very pleased with how it smelled right out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>After about ten to fifteen minutes on me I had almost forgotten about it, but then I started to get a whiff of an exquisite toasted marshmallow/sugar cookie/vanilla cake right out of the oven smell!</li>
            <li>Got here before due date and smells wonderful!!</li>
            <li>And thank you very much Sam for the amazing samples.</li>
            <li>It is sweet without being cloying and has no awful, chemical scent.</li>
            <li>It is a warm, sexy adult perfume.  </li>
            <li>Light and airy</li>
            <li>The vanilla smell is fresh and I have never had more compliments then when I&#x27;m wearing this...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too strong and almost sickly sweet.</li>
            <li>this is a beautiful scent that lasts forever!!&lt;br /&gt;Smell: Pure, soft vanilla.</li>
            <li>The scent is very light at first, but becomes stronger as it develops on the skin.</li>
            <li>Packaged wonderfully and even came with samples and a little handwritten note!</li>
            <li>This perfume smells divine and at first I was head over heels in love with it.</li>
            <li>I feel like I smell like a vanilla cupcake fresh out of the oven!</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing but the lasting power is even better.</li>
            <li>I find myself reaching for this more often than my beloved Pink Suagr- which I never thought would happen.</li>
            <li>Love this scent, the best part is it last a long time on the skin.</li>
            <li>And yet it&#x27;s yummy and not to sweet.</li>
            <li>it really should be marketed more as a body spray, in all honesty.</li>
            <li>If this was a stronger scent it would be my absolute favorite, but I ended up just using it as a body spray after taking a shower.</li>
            <li>And the bottle looks really cool too.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and wrapped in a cute box.</li>
            <li>I recommend this everyone who likes sweet scents.</li>
            <li>It was like a sweet vanilla, almost like cotton candy, but not headache inducing.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume so incredibly much, I just can&#x27;t begin to tell you.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll love it so much you&#x27;ll panic at the thought of the company not making it anymore.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume so much, it smells so sweet.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast:)))</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m very picky), but he fell in love with it, and luckily I did too.</li>
            <li>If you like Pink Sugar you&#x27;ll love this too!!</li>
            <li>it can be overwhelming sometimes because it has a strong sent, but as long as you do not over spray it, you should be fine.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic and is reasonably priced!</li>
            <li>These people are fabulous and certainly know how to keep their buyers.</li>
            <li>I received it more than a week early and included were samples and a hand written thank you card.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a natural scent that isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day and is not artificial smelling.</li>
            <li>Yumm... freshly baked sugar cookie.</li>
            <li>I rarely have to reapply it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this would be a great first perfume gift for a little girl.</li>
            <li>This is my very first Amazon review EVER, but as soon as I sprayed this perfume for the first time today, I knew I had to write a review</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to strong perfumes but this one doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li>Smells like warm vanilla cake and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>One little boy even told me \\&quot;I wish my mom smelled that good.</li>
            <li>Also, the sprayer leaks more onto the sides of the bottle than it actually sprays from the nozzle.</li>
            <li>Ok I&#x27;m writing this after using up the entire bottle.</li>
            <li>I panicked when I went back to purchase some more</li>
            <li>I first tried it at Anthropologie.</li>
            <li>The REASONABLE price seals the deal!</li>
            <li>Not only does my boyfriend love it</li>
            <li>But on a good note I got three small samples for free(perfume, lotion, body cream) and a hand written thank u card.</li>
            <li>Soft, sweet, and a VERY feminine vanilla.</li>
            <li>The smell is a mixture of vanilla and cotton candy, and ultimately, pure deliciousness.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Thank the heavens for Jaclyn Hill hahaha.</li>
            <li>This smells VERY Vanilla-y.</li>
            <li>I get compliments whenever I wear this,  and the scent really lasts on me.  </li>
            <li>This is just straight up vanilla marshmallow scented.</li>
            <li>Thanks again</li>
            <li>Very soft, and pretty.</li>
            <li>I love it alone and layered with other colognes to give them a sweeter depth.</li>
            <li>I love the other scents by L&#x27;Aromarine though.</li>
            <li>Very simple, clean.</li>
            <li>I originally picked this up at Anthropologie and quickly ran out as I use it everyday now.  </li>
            <li>Long lasting and very sweet, home-y scent.</li>
            <li>It is subtle and smells like  warm sugar cookies.  </li>
            <li>Still one of my must have favorites, even my 4 year old loves it!</li>
            <li>Overall, I go to this one more than my more expensive bottles 10 to 1.</li>
            <li>(it now smells SUPER chemically and disgusting), I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for the perfect vanilla perfume.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a great plus that it doesn&#x27;t give me an awful headache like most gourmand scents do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried others that don&#x27;t last the whole day like this one does.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not really a surprise given the price, however, I still expected more then a couple hours.</li>
            <li>The scents are very similar to each other but Pink Sugar has more of a spicy, warmth to it.</li>
            <li>I like really sweet and cozy vanillas that don&#x27;t have even a hint of alcohol or muskiness, and this is the PERFECT one (and it&#x27;s reminiscent of vanille abricot before it went bad!).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much lighter than pink sugar.&lt;br /&gt;Lasting</li>
            <li>But within a couple of minutes, it starts to dry down into a sweet vanilla.</li>
            <li>It smells a little alcohol-ish at first.</li>
            <li>I have Pink Sugar and find it to be a little too sweet</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love this perfume so incredibly much, I just can&#x27;t begin to tell you.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll love it so much you&#x27;ll panic at the thought of the company not making it anymore.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume so much, it smells so sweet.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast:)))</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m very picky), but he fell in love with it, and luckily I did too.</li>
            <li> If you like Pink Sugar you&#x27;ll love this too!!</li>
            <li> it can be overwhelming sometimes because it has a strong sent, but as long as you do not over spray it, you should be fine.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic and is reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> These people are fabulous and certainly know how to keep their buyers.</li>
            <li> I received it more than a week early and included were samples and a hand written thank you card.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a natural scent that isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and is not artificial smelling.</li>
            <li> Yumm... freshly baked sugar cookie.</li>
            <li> I rarely have to reapply it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this would be a great first perfume gift for a little girl.</li>
            <li> This is my very first Amazon review EVER, but as soon as I sprayed this perfume for the first time today, I knew I had to write a review</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to strong perfumes but this one doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li> Smells like warm vanilla cake and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> One little boy even told me \\&quot;I wish my mom smelled that good.</li>
            <li> Also, the sprayer leaks more onto the sides of the bottle than it actually sprays from the nozzle.</li>
            <li> Ok I&#x27;m writing this after using up the entire bottle.</li>
            <li> I panicked when I went back to purchase some more</li>
            <li> I first tried it at Anthropologie.</li>
            <li> The REASONABLE price seals the deal!</li>
            <li> Not only does my boyfriend love it</li>
            <li> But on a good note I got three small samples for free(perfume, lotion, body cream) and a hand written thank u card.</li>
            <li> Soft, sweet, and a VERY feminine vanilla.</li>
            <li> The smell is a mixture of vanilla and cotton candy, and ultimately, pure deliciousness.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Thank the heavens for Jaclyn Hill hahaha.</li>
            <li> This smells VERY Vanilla-y.</li>
            <li> I get compliments whenever I wear this,  and the scent really lasts on me.  </li>
            <li> This is just straight up vanilla marshmallow scented.</li>
            <li> Thanks again</li>
            <li> Very soft, and pretty.</li>
            <li> I love it alone and layered with other colognes to give them a sweeter depth.</li>
            <li> I love the other scents by L&#x27;Aromarine though.</li>
            <li> Very simple, clean.</li>
            <li> I originally picked this up at Anthropologie and quickly ran out as I use it everyday now.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting and very sweet, home-y scent.</li>
            <li> It is subtle and smells like  warm sugar cookies.  </li>
            <li> Still one of my must have favorites, even my 4 year old loves it!</li>
            <li> Overall, I go to this one more than my more expensive bottles 10 to 1.</li>
            <li> (it now smells SUPER chemically and disgusting), I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for the perfect vanilla perfume.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a great plus that it doesn&#x27;t give me an awful headache like most gourmand scents do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others that don&#x27;t last the whole day like this one does.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not really a surprise given the price, however, I still expected more then a couple hours.</li>
            <li> The scents are very similar to each other but Pink Sugar has more of a spicy, warmth to it.</li>
            <li> I like really sweet and cozy vanillas that don&#x27;t have even a hint of alcohol or muskiness, and this is the PERFECT one (and it&#x27;s reminiscent of vanille abricot before it went bad!).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much lighter than pink sugar.&lt;br /&gt;Lasting</li>
            <li> But within a couple of minutes, it starts to dry down into a sweet vanilla.</li>
            <li> It smells a little alcohol-ish at first.</li>
            <li> I have Pink Sugar and find it to be a little too sweet</li>
            <li> The only downside is it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> For an eau de toilette it&#x27;s pretty long lasting, at least on me.</li>
            <li> But this one fell flat.</li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t smell like a cheap, fake vanilla, it smells like actual vanilla.</li>
            <li> And it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> And just like everyone says, it lasts long and it isn&#x27;t headache-inducing.</li>
            <li> It is one of those perfumes that you can smell but not overpowering and other people can smell you but only if they are close to you.  </li>
            <li> No vanilla here, just smells like cotton candy, not what I expected at all.</li>
            <li> Purchased due to a Jaclyn Hill recommendation.</li>
            <li> : My perfume arrived in 3 days with other perfume samples AND</li>
            <li> Seems to be watered down</li>
            <li> wish the scent lasted a little longer, but maybe it&#x27;s just the fact that it&#x27;s vanilla.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t yet attest to its longevity, but even if I have to reapply a few times a day</li>
            <li> It actually smells like vanilla and doesn&#x27;t have that weird smell after you&#x27;ve had it on for awhIle.</li>
            <li> I interrupted him by suddenly crying out, &amp;#34;Oh my God!</li>
            <li> (can&#x27;t believe there are so few)!  </li>
            <li> I wanted a vanilla that wasn&#x27;t complex with floral stuff going on in the background and Vanille delivered.</li>
            <li> This was a blind buy due to Jaclyn Hill&#x27;s recommendation.</li>
            <li> Seriously..</li>
            <li> It is just way too subtle.</li>
            <li> Also on several occasions the person who comments on it calls over someone else to \\&quot;Smell her perfume!\\&quot; Not one of those fragrances that  makes you sick or get headaches.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry if you buy it, in fact...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It smells a little alcohol-ish at first. But within a couple of minutes, it starts to dry down into a sweet vanilla. I love it alone and layered with other colognes to give them a sweeter depth.</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent! Very simple, clean. On me it lasts about 4-5 hours.  Shipping was super fast:))) Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Great product! !!! Smells awesome!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume so much, it smells so sweet. it can be overwhelming sometimes because it has a strong sent, but as long as you do not over spray it, you should be fine. This is not one of those perfumes where you spray and then the sent goes away within ten minutes, this stays on forever !</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! Purchased due to a Jaclyn Hill recommendation. Smells fantastic and is reasonably priced! And the seller made this experience 10x better! I received it more than a week early and included were samples and a hand written thank you card. Very impressed and happy with my purchase and experience.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell nice. I only smell alcohol:/ But on a good note I got three small samples for free(perfume, lotion, body cream) and a hand written thank u card.</li>
            <li> The scent is very light.  You can barley make out the vanilla.  Also, the sprayer leaks more onto the sides of the bottle than it actually sprays from the nozzle.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. I love it!</li>
            <li> I AM IN LOVE. EVERYONE TELLS ME I SMELL LIKE COOKIES. And yet it&#x27;s yummy and not to sweet. I hope I can always find this. Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It actually smells like vanilla and doesn&#x27;t have that weird smell after you&#x27;ve had it on for awhIle. It actually lasts.  Love love love. Jaclyn Hill had this on her favorites video and she nailed it!!!!</li>
            <li> Omg  this smell is absolutely  delicious  !! Word can&#x27;t express how wonderful this specially if u luv the smell of pure vanilla!!!!!</li>
            <li> Riveting.  I love this stuff.  Can&#x27;t get enough.</li>
            <li> Thank the heavens for Jaclyn Hill hahaha. Seriously..this is a beautiful scent that lasts forever!!&lt;br /&gt;Smell: Pure, soft vanilla. Very warm. I have Pink Sugar and find it to be a little too sweet sometimes but this perfume is just perfect. If you like vanilla, you have to buy this. It&#x27;s much lighter than pink sugar.&lt;br /&gt;Lasting Power: I wash my hands all the time (germaphobe..don&#x27;t judge me) and I was still able to smell this on my wrist at the end of the night!!&lt;br /&gt;Sellers: My perfume arrived in 3 days with other perfume samples AND a hand written thank you note adressed to me! These people are fabulous and certainly know how to keep their buyers. It was so nice opening my box!&lt;br /&gt;In all, buy it!</li>
            <li> This perfume smells beautiful. The only downside is it doesn&#x27;t last long. Within a couple hours I can&#x27;t smell it at all. That&#x27;s not really a surprise given the price, however, I still expected more then a couple hours. The seller also sent beautiful samples too with my order.</li>
            <li> Ok I&#x27;m writing this after using up the entire bottle. This was a blind buy due to Jaclyn Hill&#x27;s recommendation. This perfume smells divine and at first I was head over heels in love with it. But it DOES NOT last. it really should be marketed more as a body spray, in all honesty. It is just way too subtle. I will spray it on myself and five minutes later ask a friend how I smell, and they say are you even wearing anything? I&#x27;d say this would be a great first perfume gift for a little girl. If this was a stronger scent it would be my absolute favorite, but I ended up just using it as a body spray after taking a shower.</li>
            <li> This smells VERY Vanilla-y. It&#x27;s too strong and almost sickly sweet. I love the other scents by L&#x27;Aromarine though. But this one fell flat.</li>
            <li> The scent is very light at first, but becomes stronger as it develops on the skin. It has a marshmallow sweetness to it,  i think. The 5 star review is actually for BeautyHabit. The service from this company is exceptional. The packaging of product was awesome, very personalized, they also included samples with a \\&quot;Thank you\\&quot; note as well. I would recommend as well as purchase from this company again regardless of product, which was also great :-)</li>
            <li> smells amazing... not over powering at all</li>
            <li> Arrived within the stated time and it smells heavenly.  I originally picked this up at Anthropologie and quickly ran out as I use it everyday now.  I panicked when I went back to purchase some more and they didn&#x27;t have any! I get compliments whenever I wear this,  and the scent really lasts on me.  I&#x27;ve been told it smells like vanilla, cake, ice cream, and/or marshmallows. I also adore the bottles design - so cute!</li>
            <li> The smell is a mixture of vanilla and cotton candy, and ultimately, pure deliciousness. I get loads of compliments every time I wear this. And the bottle looks really cool too. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Love this scent, the best part is it last a long time on the skin. Not like others that fade over a period of an hour. Amazing!</li>
            <li> Smells like warm vanilla cake and lasts a long time! Use sparingly! I love love love this!</li>
            <li> love this smell! perfect for summer day!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, beautiful packaging and presentation.  Perfume smells delicious! Will buy again:)</li>
            <li> I LOVE this perfume!!! If you like Pink Sugar you&#x27;ll love this too!! I find myself reaching for this more often than my beloved Pink Suagr- which I never thought would happen. The scents are very similar to each other but Pink Sugar has more of a spicy, warmth to it. This is just straight up vanilla marshmallow scented. You end up smelling like a bag of cadbury mini eggs! :) A HUGE THANK YOU to JACLYN HILL for recommending this in one of her favorites videos!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume! Long lasting and very sweet, home-y scent. Packaged wonderfully and even came with samples and a little handwritten note!</li>
            <li> Love it!  I am very sensitive to strong perfumes but this one doesn&#x27;t bother me.  And it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Love love it! This is the best vanilla perfume out there. Seriouly, you smell good all day and it stays on body and cloths.  And thank you very much Sam for the amazing samples. Love them too. Looking to purchase the perfume you send as sample. Oh and the hand written thank you. Fast shipping and wrapped in a cute box. Thanks again</li>
            <li> LOVE this scent. Soft, sweet, and a VERY feminine vanilla. I first tried it at Anthropologie. I get TONS of compliments from men and women whenever I wear it. One little boy even told me \\&quot;I wish my mom smelled that good. You smell like a candle.\\&quot; Also on several occasions the person who comments on it calls over someone else to \\&quot;Smell her perfume!\\&quot; Not one of those fragrances that  makes you sick or get headaches. The REASONABLE price seals the deal! You will always feel good when you spray some on!</li>
            <li> Would bathe in this if I could.</li>
            <li> This is the best, sweet smelling perfume I have ever had. I doesn&#x27;t smell like a cheap, fake vanilla, it smells like actual vanilla. The smell is amazing but the lasting power is even better. I will spray this on me and 8:00 in the morning and it will stay on me ALL DAY. I&#x27;ll wake up the next morning to take a shower and the scent will still be there. I recommend this everyone who likes sweet scents.</li>
            <li> Seems to be watered down</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for years.  It&#x27;s a natural scent that isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li> No vanilla here, just smells like cotton candy, not what I expected at all.</li>
            <li> lovely scent of vanilla</li>
            <li> When I sprayed this perfume on myself, I was very pleased with how it smelled right out of the bottle. It was like a sweet vanilla, almost like cotton candy, but not headache inducing. After about ten to fifteen minutes on me I had almost forgotten about it, but then I started to get a whiff of an exquisite toasted marshmallow/sugar cookie/vanilla cake right out of the oven smell! My boyfriend was in the middle of talking to me about something, but I was so struck by the wonderful evolution of scent on me I interrupted him by suddenly crying out, &amp;#34;Oh my God! I smell amazing!!!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I am in love with my purchase. I wanted a vanilla that wasn&#x27;t complex with floral stuff going on in the background and Vanille delivered. It&#x27;s also a great plus that it doesn&#x27;t give me an awful headache like most gourmand scents do.</li>
            <li> This is a great perfume for those who love the pure vanilla scent. Still one of my must have favorites, even my 4 year old loves it!</li>
            <li> This is the best Vanilla scent you can buy. It lasts all day and is not artificial smelling. Seller ships very quickly and packaged nice. I&#x27;d give 10 stars if I could!</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic! Light and airy and I have received many compliments! Love it. Will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> Tons of compliments every time I wear it. The vanilla smell is fresh and I have never had more compliments then when I&#x27;m wearing this... Love it</li>
            <li> Great product smells really nice and clean</li>
            <li> I love this perfume so incredibly much, I just can&#x27;t begin to tell you. If you have been searching for the perfect vanilla- THIS IS IT. Honest. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for almost a decade and it&#x27;s definitely my signature. You&#x27;ll never get as many compliments with anything else. And just like everyone says, it lasts long and it isn&#x27;t headache-inducing. You won&#x27;t be sorry if you buy it, in fact... you&#x27;ll love it so much you&#x27;ll panic at the thought of the company not making it anymore.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s vanilla, what&#x27;s &amp;#34;not&amp;#34; to love????&lt;br /&gt;Had it before, hay ladies, the men love this!!!!</li>
            <li> Have repeatedly bought this perfume. Absolutely love it and it lasts forever.</li>
            <li> Best scent ever! Love it... wish the scent lasted a little longer, but maybe it&#x27;s just the fact that it&#x27;s vanilla.</li>
            <li> I have been using this now for quite awhile and I absolutely love it.  It is subtle and smells like  warm sugar cookies.  It is one of those perfumes that you can smell but not overpowering and other people can smell you but only if they are close to you.  I love that people can&#x27;t smell me coming.  L&#x27;Aromarine has a customer for life!</li>
            <li> Every time I wear this I smell like marshmallows and vanilla. It is literally the best scent ever! Men seem to love it as well!(;</li>
            <li> Got here before due date and smells wonderful!! Super happy!</li>
            <li> This is my very first Amazon review EVER, but as soon as I sprayed this perfume for the first time today, I knew I had to write a review ASAP (can&#x27;t believe there are so few)!  It&#x27;s absolutely AMAZING! Ever since my favorite vanilla perfume, Vanille Abricot by Comptoir Sud Pacifique, has gone south (it now smells SUPER chemically and disgusting), I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for the perfect vanilla perfume.  I like really sweet and cozy vanillas that don&#x27;t have even a hint of alcohol or muskiness, and this is the PERFECT one (and it&#x27;s reminiscent of vanille abricot before it went bad!). It is warm, inviting, and simply delicious. I feel like I smell like a vanilla cupcake fresh out of the oven! I can&#x27;t yet attest to its longevity, but even if I have to reapply a few times a day I don&#x27;t care-this is vanilla perfume perfection!!</li>
            <li> Great scent. Used to be sold at Anthropologie but I have yet to be able to find it again.</li>
            <li> My favorite. This is the most desirable vanilla perfume I&#x27;ve ever smelled. Not only does my boyfriend love it I get compliments every time I wear it. It lasts all day as well, just when I think I can&#x27;t smell it anymore someone else tells me I smell really good!</li>
            <li> Yumm... freshly baked sugar cookie. A must for a gourmand lover.</li>
            <li> Best vanilla perfume ever!</li>
            <li> My husband picked this up at Anthropologie a couple years ago and bought it for me on a whim. He NEVER does that with perfume (I&#x27;m very picky), but he fell in love with it, and luckily I did too. For an eau de toilette it&#x27;s pretty long lasting, at least on me. I&#x27;ve tried others that don&#x27;t last the whole day like this one does. I rarely have to reapply it. Overall, I go to this one more than my more expensive bottles 10 to 1. Very soft, and pretty.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful vanilla scent.  It is sweet without being cloying and has no awful, chemical scent. It is a warm, sexy adult perfume.  This has become my every day fragrance.  It tends to last all day.</li>
