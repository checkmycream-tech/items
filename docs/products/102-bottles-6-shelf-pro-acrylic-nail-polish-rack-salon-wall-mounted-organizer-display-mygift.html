            <li>Since  I filled it and still have polishes left over, I am considering purchasing another.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s much better than having your polishes all hidden in a drawer, and it makes finding what you want very</li>
            <li>My collection is mostly OPI, a few Zoya, and a couple of China Glaze.</li>

            <li> This works perfectly for my Young Living Essential Oils. It holds a lot or bottles and I can still read the labels since the shelf is clear!</li>
            <li> Love this but it does not hold 102 bottles. My collection is mostly OPI, a few Zoya, and a couple of China Glaze.</li>
            <li> Perfect for its purpose. Only 4 stars because did not come with mounting hardware (though it says that in the description, that would have been a nice no-brainer thing to include).</li>
            <li> Update April 2016: I still love this rack, and bought a second one for the rest of my collection. It is easy to clean, and holds a other small items as well - I have one shelf devoted to essential oils, and another that holds all my hair clips and bands.&lt;br /&gt;Original Review:&lt;br /&gt;Overpriced for what it is; one star off for that, and for no accompanying hardware to attach item to the wall, although I knew that when I purchased. I also felt four screws was not enough (100 bottles of nail polish is HEAVY!) so I drilled two more holes, and used screws and drywall anchors. It does look pretty cool up and filled with all my pretties :)  Since  I filled it and still have polishes left over, I am considering purchasing another. If you are a nail polish addict, you will like this - it&#x27;s much better than having your polishes all hidden in a drawer, and it makes finding what you want very simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this review was useful to you, please hit the &amp;#34;helpful&amp;#34; button down below - thanks!</li>

            <li> Bought this for our Shopkin collection and it is perfect and easily mountable!</li>
            <li> I purchased this shelf to store my essential oils and nail polishes.  I love being able to see what I have instead of rooting though a container in the closet.  It fits perfectly inside the linen closet door!  Well made, arrived on time and was packaged securely.</li>
            <li> Was very satisfied with product.</li>
            <li> Ok so this came in the mail a few days before saying so that&#x27;s awesome!! I have one issue that&#x27;s the reason for 4 stars! the bottom shelf has a safety thingy broken like on the front, I was gonna return it but y the hassle! So just in case that happens hotglue it! Love the shelf and comes with screws and hikes ore add in the rack! Thanks!</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t do my nails, but I use a LOT of essential oils which also come in small bottles. This is great to display ANY small bottles or objects and it keeps them handy. Of course if you have young children, make sure it&#x27;s hung out of their reach - I could just see lots of color on your walls if left unattended.</li>
            <li> 2 of the 3 polish racks I ordered arrived broken. Even though I didn&#x27;t want to hassle with returning the product I tried.&lt;br /&gt;But you have to have a printer for the labels, and if you want ups to pick up the product an adult must be present, otherwise you have to drive the items to the post office yourself!&lt;br /&gt;I am very frustrates by this because the nail polish racks were needed for the opening of my nail salon!
