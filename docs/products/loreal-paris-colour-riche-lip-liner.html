            <li>My FAVORITE LIP LINER EVER!</li>
            <li>Tried others, but this is my favorite!  </li>
            <li>Love the color!</li>
            <li>I also love that I don&#x27;t need to use a sharpener to sharpen it!</li>
            <li>Prevents bleeding with gloss too which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>If you want a better one though, MAC&#x27;s are amazing.</li>
            <li>This does it&#x27;s job, easy to use, nice color, and stays on well.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect balance between warm and cool, probably a bit warmer than cool if I need to be really picky about the description.</li>
            <li>Love the shade for my skin color.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>My favorite color - I use it with all my lipsticks to change their color.  </li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>Application is smooth and nice</li>
            <li>easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>and it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I color my lips with it sparingly, and smooth on nude color lipstick.  </li>
            <li>Perfect color for me to use everyday!</li>
            <li>I really like it and it feel very comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>Good color lip liner, seems to stay on for a long time .</li>
            <li>Feels nice, not dry or greasy.</li>
            <li>and I expected it to be lighter but nonetheless good lip liner.</li>
            <li>The price was right as well.</li>
            <li>The liner itself is good quality, but be prepared for it to be dark.</li>
            <li>Nice product and long wearing</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it stays put as much as I would like, but the color is very pretty.  </li>
            <li>It will only be good if I want to wear a red lipstick, which I rarely do.</li>
            <li>These are pretty creamy.  </li>
            <li>I really like it and will re-order.</li>
            <li>Glides on smoothly, Stays put for a long while!  ...</li>
            <li>Funny thing is that I went back to order another color and ended up ordering the exact same one.  </li>
            <li>I prefer flat lipliners, and feel that true nudes should mimic the color  actual lip shades...</li>
            <li>Like it, smooth application, last few hours, my only complain is that is brown and not Nude</li>
            <li>This is a subtle lip liner that goes on smoothly and creates just enough of a lining to define the lips, but not enough to be obvious.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t last long enough for me.</li>
            <li> alot of &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; lip colors are basically for white people, this is alittle &amp;#34;darker&amp;#34; in the sense that there is a little grey to the nude color that makes wearing nude lipstick not looking like azombie and all washed out.</li>
            <li> A bit lighter than expected</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t care for the color, it&#x27;s too dark, with almost brownish tinges, and it&#x27;s too shimmery for my liking.</li>
            <li> It is very dark.</li>
            <li> I got L&#x27;Oreal because all my revlon lip liners have gone stiff.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I ordered a neutral color and that is what I got.  Goes on smooth. The price was right as well.</li>
            <li> Good color lip liner, seems to stay on for a long time .</li>
            <li> My FAVORITE LIP LINER EVER! Glides on smoothly, Stays put for a long while!  ...Tried others, but this is my favorite!  I hope they never discontinue it!</li>
            <li> Like it, smooth application, last few hours, my only complain is that is brown and not Nude (as I thought), will use it but not as often.</li>
            <li> I use this color  all the time. Love the shade for my skin color. Would have given a 5 but L&#x27;Oreal has taken away the sharpener that used to be on the end.</li>
            <li> This is a subtle lip liner that goes on smoothly and creates just enough of a lining to define the lips, but not enough to be obvious.  I really like it and it feel very comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> love it. perfect color for me. easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I added a star because I like the texture and it goes on smoothly. However, I don&#x27;t care for the color, it&#x27;s too dark, with almost brownish tinges, and it&#x27;s too shimmery for my liking. I prefer flat lipliners, and feel that true nudes should mimic the color  actual lip shades...this does not.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; lip liner. It is very dark. It will only be good if I want to wear a red lipstick, which I rarely do. The liner itself is good quality, but be prepared for it to be dark.</li>
            <li> Very Happy with is product. Love the color!</li>
            <li> This does it&#x27;s job, easy to use, nice color, and stays on well. Prevents bleeding with gloss too which was a nice surprise. I really like it and will re-order.</li>
            <li> One of the faves in my makeup case. It&#x27;s perfect for me.</li>
            <li> A bit lighter than expected but I still use it and like it.  Funny thing is that I went back to order another color and ended up ordering the exact same one.  Nice product and long wearing</li>
            <li> What can I say...It&#x27;s L&#x27;Oreal Paris...Perfect color. Stays put. Feels nice, not dry or greasy. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect color for me.  I think I have found my &#x27;staple&#x27; lip liner.</li>
            <li> good lip color for women of color. alot of &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; lip colors are basically for white people, this is alittle &amp;#34;darker&amp;#34; in the sense that there is a little grey to the nude color that makes wearing nude lipstick not looking like azombie and all washed out. reccomend for anyone with a tane or olive colored skin tone</li>
            <li> My favorite color - I use it with all my lipsticks to change their color.  I hope they never discontinue it.</li>
            <li> Perfect color for me to use everyday! Not too brown and not too orange.  I also love that I don&#x27;t need to use a sharpener to sharpen it!</li>
            <li> It is the perfect balance between warm and cool, probably a bit warmer than cool if I need to be really picky about the description.</li>
            <li> I got the nudes for life shade or whatever and I expected it to be lighter but nonetheless good lip liner. If you want a better one though, MAC&#x27;s are amazing. But for the price you can&#x27;t beat... Lol... Will stick to NYX products though</li>
            <li> Great color and quality.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it stays put as much as I would like, but the color is very pretty.  It glides on well, too. It just doesn&#x27;t last long enough for me.</li>
            <li> Perfect color.  I color my lips with it sparingly, and smooth on nude color lipstick.  No need to sharpen, twist stick. I got L&#x27;Oreal because all my revlon lip liners have gone stiff.  These are pretty creamy.  Love them. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Application is smooth and nice</li>
