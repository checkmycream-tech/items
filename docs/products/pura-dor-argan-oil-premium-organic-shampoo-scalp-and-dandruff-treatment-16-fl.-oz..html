            <li>This is a great product and i love that it is organic.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Has a nice presentation, smells good but</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells nice and does give a good lather, which is why it got two stars, but I won&#x27;t be ordering it again.</li>
            <li>Most dandruff shampoos that seem to work at all didn&#x27;t smell very good and were more chemical-ly than I wanted for her.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo!  </li>
            <li>I Love the way it Works!</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing shampoo I have ever tried!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love the product!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I have also seen my hair grow more!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nothing more to say!</li>
            <li>and since I tried it once I fall in love!</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo!  </li>
            <li>We love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Received the uplift product very quickly which made me quite happy.  </li>
            <li>but it certainly isn&#x27;t the best as well.</li>
            <li>and the after effect was amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing all natural-organic shampoo.</li>
            <li>This product is really amazing.</li>
            <li>Since then, I have found Aesop, which is amazing.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has been so amazing</li>
            <li>Nice smell, and one bottle</li>
            <li>I tried a Neem shampoo/conditioner I got here on Amazon, it worked about as well as this Pura d&#x27;or did, not horrible but not as good as the one I just ordered a refill of yesterday by just naturals.  </li>
            <li>This is absolutely the BEST dandruff shampoo in the world.  </li>
            <li>Oh and it smells nice too.</li>
            <li>I gave it a two star tho because it smells nice and supposedly</li>
            <li>Smelled kinda nice though</li>
            <li>This is really a nice shampoo.</li>
            <li>Is not quite as effective as say Selsun</li>
            <li>The absolute best shampoo I have ever tried!  </li>
            <li>I waited to write my review to see if it would be effective or not.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is soothing, smells good, and seems to work better than anything I&#x27;ve used before.  </li>
            <li>A number of people commeted about loving the smell.  </li>
            <li>Product not as effective as I was hoping</li>
            <li>May not get rid of dandruff permanently, but still a good and safe shampoo product.</li>
            <li>Shampoo has a nice texture &amp; is not &amp;#34;runny&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It has helped the flaking and itching, but my hair doesn&#x27;t have the texture and shine that I like after a nice shampoo and for that reason I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It lathers nicely without using a handful of shampoo</li>
            <li>For a while I was looking for an effective organic anti dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li>She really liked it.</li>
            <li>The hair looks nice and silky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too easy to mark-up their own products!    </li>
            <li>Its a really good shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;It smells good, and more important</li>
            <li>Smells very healthy and my hair looks better after using it.</li>
            <li>Smells great but more importantly works well as an anti dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li>Gnerally chemicals are added in most of the hair conditioners for silky and smooth and attractive hair.</li>
            <li>Pretty good stuff!</li>
            <li>as another review suggested this product when used with nizoral 1% antidandruff also available on Amazon is a good combination.</li>
            <li>Although I love the idea, and it does leave my hair feeling nice</li>
            <li>I honestly saw value in this product and it did make my hair better.</li>
            <li>Best dandruff shampoo that I have tried thus far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been two weeks since I tried the shampoo and so far I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Will probably be more effective.</li>
            <li>We are a hyper-sensitive family with many allergies and it is nice to have an organic product like Pura d&#x27;or as an option.</li>
            <li>I shifted to Nizoral after this and found it to be more effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across Pura d&#x27;or shampoos and I was impressed by its natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>The fact that its organic is even better as too many chemicals do more harm then good.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is the best in my experience so far.</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells great and leaves my hair feeling fresh.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is amazing, it&#x27;s very light and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is amazing, it&#x27;s very light and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the feeling knowing this product is safe to use and good for a head of hair.</li>
            <li>Smell is not too good but not bad.</li>
            <li>The scalp felt very comfortable and soothing after use.</li>
            <li>I feel very comfortable with this feeling.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s hair issue is better now.</li>
            <li>i will buy more again.</li>
            <li>The feeling on my scalp was so much better also</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not doing that much magic on my hair.</li>
            <li>But I been trying out product that cost me more money</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Better than Head &#x27;n Shoulders and</li>
            <li>I love this produce.</li>
            <li>Our kids love it a lot.</li>
            <li>I suffer from seborrheic dermatitis and had used another shampoo for many years.  </li>
            <li>Works great and fast shippers</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Organic and magic?</li>
            <li>My scalp healed itself like magic.</li>
            <li>and I still see nothing but a healthy scalp..</li>
            <li>5 stars :)</li>
            <li>I found the shampoo to be the best of all dandruff and itchy scalp treatments compared to what I use daily: Paul Mitchell tea tree and head and shoulders</li>
            <li>Our favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>And it leaves my scalp in better condition than before washing.</li>
            <li>You can definitely feel the peppermint oil refresh your scalp, and the smell of lavender and thyme is delightful.</li>
            <li>but now i have,flaky and itchy.i have been using it for more than a month along with the consitioner</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>The shampoo did an okay job at relieving the itchy and flakiness of my scalp.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Im 100% satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>If you do some scalp massage when you use it, it works better.</li>
            <li>Love this product I bought it for myself for dandruff and to prevent hair loss.</li>
            <li>the shampoo is helping me at this time, but i suffer from SPORADIC severe scalp issue, that my scalp may develop resistance to many types of anti dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li>I would say 80% better.</li>
            <li>I love how my hair feels, but I still have the dandruff problem.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months now, and I feel my hair is more healthy.</li>
            <li>It feels thicker and more healthy.</li>
            <li>I will continue using the shampoo until I need to buy more and update my review then.</li>
            <li>I was also pleased to find my hair shiny and with greater body.</li>
            <li>I was able to tell the difference after just 1 week.</li>
            <li>Finally tried Pura D&#x27;Or am very happy with the results after a month of use.</li>
            <li>I used to love this shampoo, but my latest bottle leaves my hair looking almost as greasy as it was before I washed it.  </li>
            <li>Love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li>dandruff itches the scalp and makes worry also a working person in a magnificient  healthy conditioner product  manufacturing Industry.</li>
            <li>I am going to continue using it for awhile and see if it will work better.  </li>
            <li>It works better when it has been in the scalp for awhile.</li>
            <li>I am really glad I found this one.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair shiny with more volume.</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Also, the amount of time one bottle can last for is great!</li>
            <li>but this is a great most days shampoo because it is gentle on the hair.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love argon because I don&#x27;t like washing my hair that often</li>
            <li>love it must try.</li>
            <li>I have allergic reactions to most shampoos and styling products.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>this product does not bother me and I will continue to buy this shampoo:)</li>
            <li>Sure, it is a bit pricey compared to many of the &amp;#34;off the shelf&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I would expect to see better results by now.&lt;br</li>
            <li>overall its great product will buy again!!</li>
            <li>With more uses I&#x27;m sure his scalp will be</li>
            <li>even more improved.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy to have finally found this product which has everything that I&#x27;m looking for (all-natural, good lather, dandruff control).  </li>
            <li>I had problems with  flaking of scalp and hair loss after showering for many years.</li>
            <li>But, hey, if I wanted to be \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; and dandruff-free I had better pay</li>
            <li>I can gladly report that my hair loss has virtually stopped.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have noticed an increase in itching in the area with the most severe scales</li>
            <li>I had used a lot of non-organic shampoos(head and shoulders, Dove) and they were able to control dandruff</li>
            <li>much more than before I started using the product almost three weeks ago now.  </li>
            <li>Anyone else feel like they started experiencing more danfruff?</li>
            <li>Entirely satisfied.</li>
            <li>and i think i am getting more dandruff than before.</li>
            <li>Better than Head &#x27;n Shoulders and</li>
            <li>I will keep using the product and update the review if it gets better.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found it.</li>
            <li>It has worked better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li>, I love the pump bottle.</li>
            <li>I believe it will be safe to use this everyday.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But most of all I love that it works so well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay at relieving itch, but didn&#x27;t get hair very clean - looked like it was greasy or had a residue.</li>
            <li>So far so good!  </li>
            <li>just kind of a minty clean smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks now and it seems pretty good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad in the warm weather, but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good shampoo.</li>
            <li>The smell is Devine and the results are nothing short of amazing!!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the cost!!</li>
            <li>Every body wants to be free from dandruff and happy.</li>
            <li>Love that it has no chemicals, all natural, and it smells great too.</li>
            <li>After stumbling onto this beauty of a product and experiencing the magic that is Pura d&#x27;or anti-dandruff shampoo it quickly made it to my top 10 favorite shampoos ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it is organic yet unlike many organic products this one leaves me feeling clean.</li>
            <li>very good shampoo is my second bottle</li>
            <li>and the most important part is:</li>
            <li>Smells nice and seems to calm my scalp.</li>
            <li>its worth trying as its a nice shampoo.</li>
            <li>It smelled good and works very well to keep dandruff away.</li>
            <li>I started using it right away, and I can honestly say that it truly does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the smell very much, but I love that its organic and ir helped a lot with mi scalp problem!</li>
            <li>Their shampoo/conditioner isn&#x27;t perfect, which is why I&#x27;ve been trying a couple other brands, but now I know that I&#x27;m just wasting money and time</li>
            <li>Smells great almost like fresh cedar, it doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair or scalp though</li>
            <li>One thing that I was impressed with was the lather as sometimes with all natural shampoos you can&#x27;t get much of a lather.</li>
            <li>Really easy to get lots of foamy.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong, yes, and sticks around for hours and hours and hours.</li>
            <li>Since then my hair even looks more alive, try this product, its a good price</li>
            <li>Good ingredients, but need A LOT of product to make a decent lather.</li>
            <li>Im glad I got it on special.</li>
            <li>Amazing product i felt the diffrence on the first wash.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo it has solved my problem and leaves my hair full and manageable.</li>
            <li>-No need to look for fine print.  </li>
            <li>So if you do have oily or fine hair, you might want to take this into consideration before trying.</li>

            <li>Good, it seems very soft,</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s natural, it&#x27;s sulfate-free, and it smells lovely!</li>

            <li>my hair is 100% free of dandruff.</li>
            <li>I used this shampoo for almost 4 weeks now, and my hair had begun thinning and it looks  fuller and filled.</li>

            <li>Overall great product</li>
            <li>It feels smooth and nourishing</li>
            <li>I got this as the second bottle for my dad.&lt;br /&gt;It is great for preventing loss of hair</li>
            <li>It is really helpful, nice product.</li>

            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Hair feels light and smooth after shower.</li>
            <li>My Dandruff is in control and hair is smooth.</li>
            <li>i get some hair back which is great.</li>
            <li>Light scent and light formula.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far I can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s good or not, maybe after one month using.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine, so if yours is normal, maybe it&#x27;ll leave your hair looking better than mine.  </li>
            <li>I am so pleased and hooked right from the start.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first product ever to work for me!!</li>
            <li>I am very dissatisfied !!!</li>
            <li>and I love how clean and fresh this leaves my hair.</li>
            <li>It really deals with dandruff perfectly, but it makes my hair too dry.</li>
            <li>From the first wash I noticed the dandruff that would fall on my clothing was much greater than it had ever been before.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any significant results yet after using it for three months.</li>
            <li>First off, I love that this shampoo is organic.</li>
            <li>No artificial perfume smell to it either!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this shampoo after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>but maybe I need to use it more consistently</li>
            <li>sure, After the first bottle amount of my dad&#x27;s hair seems same.&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
            <li>best part about using this product is that if you want to wash your hair everyday, you can!</li>
            <li>I have been using this shampoo for 1 week and have noticed a significant improvement in my dandruff and scaliness of my scalp.</li>
            <li>so i was willing to spend more.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied thus far and feel in my bones and premenition this will be the product of choice from here on out.</li>
            <li>At first it doesn&#x27;t seem to work but after two weeks it really works!!!!</li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge decrease in how quickly my hair gets oily and decrease in my itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair clean and I don&#x27;t get an itchy head</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but this stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li>Makes my scalp feel clean.</li>
            <li>Before I used this shampoo, a lot hair will drop when I clean my hair.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clean your hair.</li>
            <li>I heard of it through a popular website, and I&#x27;m glad that I finally find an organic shampoo which can prevent hair loss.</li>
            <li>My scalp feels clean and like it is healing.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li>still I don&#x27;t get that squeaky clean feeling that I like.  </li>
            <li>I think this is a great shampoo, it cleans well and doesnt dry out my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several brands and this one has worked best so far.</li>
            <li>From the very first use I could feel and see a huge difference in my hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li>Since I have been using this shampoo my dermatitis episodes are rare and my scalp is healthier and free of dandruff.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s full effect,</li>
            <li>I used this shampoo once and my hair was incredibly shiny once it dried.</li>
            <li>It is a superior product and will never go back to using Nioxin again.</li>
            <li>This shampoo feels good, doesnt give that chemical feel like with commercial shampoos.</li>
            <li>It does help with dandruff, and it has been gentle and safe for thinning, graying and brittle hair.  </li>
            <li>I really like the scent of the product and absolutely love the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Good product, wish the bottle was a bit bigger!!!!</li>
            <li>The reason I dont give a full 10 is because it does not cure the problem</li>
            <li>I must say I am loving so far.</li>
            <li>Overall good shampoo.</li>
            <li>I was pretty surprised by how good this shampoo smelled for being an organic product.</li>
            <li>It smells natural and did pretty good cleaning job.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li>It feels natural and has a strong tea tree oil smell which I love.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The aroma is a bit strong at first</li>
            <li>works good but smells like medicine to me, not unpleasant but definitely medicinal</li>
            <li>Great product with a great price tag, will definitely purchase again in the near future.</li>
            <li>An awesome product, that leaves your hair very fresh and clean with out all the unnecessary chemicals .</li>
            <li>Leaves the scalp very clean, is gentle and provides body for our hair type.  </li>
            <li>(I can&#x27;t stand the smell of patchouli), my daughter is happy with the results; mainly that her scalp doesn&#x27;t get irritated or flaky after use as it does with most other products.</li>
            <li>Be aware that your hair will not feel silky after rinsing but don&#x27;t worry it will still comb out just fine.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I found this gentle but powerfully cleansing product.</li>
            <li>and I felt that I just had to say something about this wonderful thing, only because its so different from everything else out there.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great product, only down fall is that it does not smell the greatest, but if you use the conditioner that will offset that.</li>
            <li>I was concerned at first that even though it says it&#x27;s sulfate free it still lathers quite a bit.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like the smell very much, hope it will works!</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a good organic shampoo for a long time.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this shampoo -- very fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>Definitely my new favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>Wow this shampoo is utterly amazing even after the first use.</li>
            <li>I notice my hair is much more full, soft and flows in the wind.</li>
            <li>It smells good and does not make my hair nor my skin dry.</li>
            <li>I notice my hair is much more full, soft and flows in the wind.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much Pura D&#x27;or!!</li>
            <li>This is my first review on Amazon!</li>
            <li>99% of the ingredients are driven from natural products, except phenoxyethanol which is a mild preservative that is used in many cosmetic products.</li>
            <li>I love love love this product, my hair use to be full of body and thick in my 20 &amp; 30.</li>
            <li>It does clean my hair pretty well</li>
            <li>The smell is very herbal and I am fine with that, but some people may not like it.  </li>
            <li>And my hair stays healthier for so much longer-I don&#x27;t have to cut it as often because the ends don&#x27;t split nearly as quickly since purchasing this !</li>
            <li>And my flakes are huge and some are so fine they stick out and make my hair look like its just filled with white dust.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a huge change in my scalp and new hair growth, mainly on the front part of my hair line where i used to part my hair for so many years.</li>
            <li>Second, the smell was amazing.</li>
            <li>price was a bit daunting yet after using it for a while, it&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>but I love that it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li>The hair feel soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>Well worth the purchase to rid yourself of dandruff issues.  </li>
            <li>Is it worth it?</li>
            <li>And just to see how powerful this stuff is</li>
            <li>I bought this stuff because I wanted to get away from head and shoulders and be more natural.  </li>
            <li>Im not crazy about it though....</li>
            <li>So far I love it.</li>
            <li>I love that one, this anti-dandruff  shampoo doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft.</li>
            <li>WONDERFUL PRODUCT, would recommend to any middle aged woman with hair problems.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>This shampoo was worth a try.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair from falling out, and to me its worth price.</li>
            <li>That said, I don&#x27;t think any shampoo is worth $49 per bottle.</li>
            <li>but it also doesn&#x27;t foam as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>The product anti dandruff mentioned here is better than Head&#x27;n sholders and it is all organic and  natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll pick the more natural of the two, thank you.</li>
            <li>Changed the review to 4 stars - still worth buying/trying in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like fragrances, but the lovely scent of this won me over, maybe because it smells so natural.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Hopefully with some more time my dandruff will completely go away.</li>
            <li>It only takes one squirt from the pump and it lathers up nicely.</li>
            <li>Love how this shampoo leaves my hair feeling so soft.</li>
            <li>The price is worth the results.</li>
            <li>Thus far I love the way it smooths on my neck and lower skin.</li>
            <li>It still gets a little flakey in extreme weather but for the most part it works great!</li>
            <li>I wash every other day and have noticed good results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had my hopes up because of all the good reviews on here, and with the high price I figured it must contain only the purest ingredients (and</li>
            <li>and i can see results right away.</li>
            <li>It seems to have just the right blend of tea tree oil to keep the pain and itchy at bay.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this for as long as it keeps my scalp healthy and flake free.</li>
            <li>Pretty satisfied with the results so far.</li>
            <li>Great Shampoo does what it advertises and will be buying again,shipping was a little slow but other than that great buy! :)</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair free of dandruff and also makes it very soft!  </li>
            <li>Some of them made it better for a couple of days but the problem always came back quickly.    </li>
            <li>for the last few weeks i have been using \\&quot;Premium Organic Shampoo\\&quot;.i am happy with this product because it cleared my hair well.it performs better than  \\&quot;Head &#x27;n Shoulders\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>So fresh and not hair loss first time</li>
            <li>As I grew older, I had more and more problems with dandruff and dry scalp.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and I noticed fewer flakes, but it has not completely solved my dandruff problem.</li>
            <li>The first wash removes the oil from your hair and then the second is able to penetrate and lathers better than my old SLS shampoo.</li>
            <li>but I quickly got used to it and actually really like it now.</li>
            <li>Lathers well, decent scent, gets hair clean and seems to have helped with some scalp issues I was having.</li>
            <li>As far as natural shampoos go, this Pura d&#x27;or anti-dandruff shampoo is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It lathers really well when most natural products don&#x27;t, and it leaves my hair shiny and silky.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy that my husband finally found something to prevent further hair loss that I was experiencing.  </li>
            <li>a felt really soft  and easy to mashable  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the most gentle product if you have fine dry hair</li>
            <li>Used in conjunction with other products and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I used the conditioner after the shampoo the first time, although I realized that it is not necessary, my hair are just great with the shampoo only!</li>
            <li>I have very straight hair</li>
            <li>I received it very fast..</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use very much of it either.  </li>
            <li>and I had that issue at first</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>so if you really care about your hair than go for it because its worth every penny u spend</li>
            <li>I tried the pine tar shampoos (they stink but work pretty well)</li>
            <li>This \\&quot;Pura\\&quot; shampoo really does what it says!</li>
            <li>This product really changed the texture of my hair!</li>
            <li>This is the first product that 100% got rid of my dandruff.</li>
            <li>it does relieve the itching and flaking on the first day, but because everything is organic, it isnt as aggressive as it probably should be.</li>
            <li>He is looking forward to washing his hair a second time and hoping for NO dandruff at all :)</li>
            <li>and it really does work!</li>
            <li>Firstly, I don&#x27;t have thinning hair.</li>
            <li>More so in recent years, so I decided to do something about it.</li>
            <li>Firstly, I don&#x27;t have thinning hair.</li>
            <li>More so in recent years, so I decided to do something about it.</li>
            <li>I just used it for the first time and to my surprise</li>
            <li>will definitely continue using it :)</li>
            <li>Before I switched to this product, my scalp was irritated and hot, my hair was falling out and the dandruff was out of control.  </li>
            <li>When I tried this organic shampoo I felt a difference on the first wash.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many products to treat dandruff and they only work for one or two days...</li>
            <li>This shampoo yields results from the first use.</li>
            <li>The first is the price.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more when this bottle runs out.</li>
            <li>This shampoo actually works for the most part.  </li>
            <li>and I was looking for all kinds of treatments everywhere and tried so many different \\&quot;Anti-dandruff\\&quot; shampoo.</li>
            <li>This product was MUCH better several months ago.</li>
            <li>Just the alteration of that first bullet point.</li>
            <li>It did get my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It seems really work!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I came back for more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my first bottle and will update how it ends.</li>
            <li>I have been using Pura d&#x27;or thinning hair shampoo for several years now and love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it about every three days or so for several weeks now and so far am very pleased.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This may take some time getting use to but a lot of dandruff will begin to show up upon first using the shampoo, but don&#x27;t be alarmed.</li>
            <li>This is my first review on Amazon</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when I decided to plunge into the world of higher quality shampoos.</li>
            <li>It keeps me dandruff free completely granted</li>
            <li>Product seems to do exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>this is the first time I&#x27;ve attempted to do something about it.</li>
            <li>I first saw this shampoo on Groupon and decided to try it out.</li>
            <li>so if you really care about your hair than go for it because its worth every penny u spend.</li>
            <li>If you have medium-long hair, you need to pump so many times to get enough shampoo.</li>
            <li>GREAT PRICE  -Compared to high-end European products  -Saves on constant grocery store visits for less effective products  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find a significant improvement after the first use.</li>
            <li>I bought this product due to the amazing reviews in how it controls dandruff...</li>
            <li>So I was really surprised when this all-natural shampoo lowered my dandruff significantly when chemical based products couldn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Being sulfate free it doesn&#x27;t lather up as well as most drugstore brands, but it really gets your hair clean, and her scalp has hardly any flaking at all anymore.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling squeaky clean, but not dried or frizzy.</li>
            <li>It does leave the hair feeling clean and not heavy</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft since using it and I love how this product is all natural.</li>
            <li>If you know what tea tree oil smells like, yeah that pretty much is the idea.</li>
            <li>After one week of use dandruff control seems slightly better than other tea tree shampoos I&#x27;ve tried, if the price was lower it might be worth it.</li>
            <li>the texture was strange my dandruff became more and ichy</li>
            <li>AMAZING shampoo totally going to buy it again, its so gentle and make my hair soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really going all organic in my life and this is one my first steps.  </li>
            <li>The itching had reduced considerably and my hair really looked clean and shiny.</li>
            <li>My hair is so much easier to straighten and blow dry and sits much better for much longer!</li>
            <li>wish it worked a little better!</li>
            <li>The rare ones that offer some results usually dry my fine, wavy, color-treated, frizzy hair to no end.</li>
            <li>When I recently discovered that Pura d&#x27;or makes a premium organic shampoo made for dandruff and scalp conditions it was an easy decision to give it a try.</li>
            <li>This summer&#x27;s heat has created hair problems even for those who can still keep weekly salon appointments, so this shampoo will certainly aid in the elimination of dandruff.    </li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this product to all my friends who want relief from scalp flaking and itching.</li>
            <li>It lathers very well,rinses quickly; the shampoo leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>This thing last, it holds its quality super well!</li>
            <li>Whereas the older formula, the first line read, \\&quot;Controls flaking, scaling, and</li>
            <li>For me, it truly is pure gold; eliminating that persistent itch and irritation has really improved my quality of life.</li>
            <li>wonder if it&#x27;s really 100% organic...or only organic enough to satisfy the standards for using that label, but regardless it appears to be one of the MOST organic shampoos available on Amazon, and a better value than my previous brand, Bumble and Bumble.</li>
            <li>I have just purchased my third bottle of this shampoo and have noticed a HUGE difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>It really helps.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much difference it has made on my flakes</li>
            <li>have now used the product for 5-6 times and the results are really visible.</li>
            <li>It very help your scalp itching and dandruff.</li>
            <li>My whole family use this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Thanks for make this shampoo.</li>
            <li>it very well may, I don&#x27;t know)</li>
            <li>but it sure didn&#x27;t help me as much as I expected.  </li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this shampoo</li>
            <li>The shampoo is fantastic and I use it daily.</li>
            <li>This shampoo really helps.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair very heavy/greasy.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I realize it&#x27;s because this shampoo lacks the chemicals that produce lather, but for the price and how much I have to use it will not be sustainable hair care for me.  </li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>this really does not help with my dandruff problem at all which is the whole reason I bought it.</li>
            <li>after just one day, my skin dries up and my hair gets really oily already.</li>
            <li>Does not suds up much.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Last of all, my hair was silky smooth after.</li>
            <li>I was really fedup with my itching scalp.</li>
            <li>I shampoo with cheapo shampoo once to cleanse my hair, rinse, and then use Pura D&#x27;or straight.</li>
            <li>I really recommend it for dandruff and damaged scalp</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>I shampoo with cheapo shampoo once to cleanse my hair, rinse, and then use Pura D&#x27;or straight.</li>
            <li>I very like this shampoo and use it every time.</li>
            <li>Smells too much like patchouli, a smell that I find intolerable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been suffering from dandruff/sd/inflamed scalp since childhood and it seems as if I&#x27;ve tried absolutely every shampoo out there.</li>
            <li>My scalp had really been bothering me with the heat and humidity this summer.  </li>
            <li>i really thought that this would help my dandruff problem.</li>
            <li>I have been struggling to use anti-dandruff shampoo that really works and does not damage my hair.</li>
            <li>Although it calms anti-dandruff, it isn&#x27;t really helping for my scalp.</li>
            <li>I tried it for two weeks straight</li>
            <li>I have used a variety of organic and &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; products, but none of them really seemed to help.</li>
            <li>I really bought it for my boyfriend who has thinning hair and he loves it.</li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>my hair gets to oily really fast</li>
            <li>a using this shampoo i can see that its not as oily as before and not to mention that my urge to srcatch is not as much...</li>
            <li>Very drying...</li>
            <li>My head skin became really itchy...</li>
            <li>I had used Head and Shoulders for years and it really worked to keep the dandruff away</li>
            <li>My hair is now stronger and also fuller, making styling a much easier process.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>This has helped so much.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo, when i put on my hair</li>
            <li>Thanks for</li>
            <li>He has used a lot of shampoos and none of them really helped.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>the flakes don&#x27;t show up much, but they do on her clothes.</li>
            <li>You can tell it&#x27;s the new formula because the first bullet point on the bottle now reads, \\&quot;Prevents</li>
            <li>I actually love the shampoo and it gets my hair nice and clean, but the dandruff turned into a huge problem and I had to switch back to my old shampoo for a little while to avoid scratching my head all day :/</li>
            <li>BUT... DOESN&#x27;T CLEAN DEEP AND DON&#x27;T EXPECT TOO MUCH</li>
            <li>In other words, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell the difference between using this and Johnson&#x27;s baby shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it controls it more than any other product I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>It also smells nice and natural, and it leaves his long hair soft</li>
            <li>After the first use, the dandruff disappeared right away, but it came back in about 4 days, not as much as before though.</li>
            <li>After several washes my hair feels clean and healthier.</li>
            <li>If I continue to get the same results it will be worth the higher price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found a natural solution for my itchy scalp that doesn&#x27;t hurt my hair, and long for, yet dread washing days.</li>
            <li>It make me lose less hair during the bath.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very important to stick on it, too.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, I was very pleasantly surprised as it showed results.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone wanting a higher quality natural shampoo that may help with hair growth.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and very shiny!</li>
            <li>tried another natural shampoo first</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the dispenser which allows me to control the amount of shampoo which is better than other bottles that can make a mess.</li>
            <li>WOW I can say it really works!</li>
            <li>I tried JƒÅs√∂n Dandruff Relief 2 in 1 Shampoo and Conditioner (because of the overwhelming positive reviews) with no success, so I was hesitant to try another natural product.</li>
            <li>I throughly enjoyed my experience with this not so typical scalp treatment shampoo.</li>
            <li>head and shaulders takes care of the problem for more than twice less the price</li>
            <li>After 1.5 months, I still have more than half the bottle.</li>
            <li>I really needed something that would clean my dandruff and at the same time to be natural.</li>
            <li>there some particular way of using it ?</li>
            <li>I have been having an issue with dryness and flakiness around my hairline for more than six months, which is now creeping a bit further back from my hairline.</li>
            <li>Argan oil comes from the seed of Argan oil which are mainly grown in Morocco.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li>I searched spent nearly three years (and who knows how many hundreds of dollars) searching for a shampoo that didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Luckily with blonde hair</li>
            <li>Used the entire bottle too quickly to want to re-purchase.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is extremely moisturizing, which is great for frizzy hair like mine, however I am finding that it&#x27;s resulting in a little bit of product buildup.</li>
            <li>and my scalp is very sensitive, itchy and has dandruff!</li>
            <li>I had high hopes when ordering this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and will buy again.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li>He highly recommend me to use this product to care hair.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My head always feel itchy after using this awful shampoo and gave me more and more dandruff !!!</li>
            <li>after using it for 2 weeks, it seems like my hair is a little bit more than before.</li>
            <li>I think my scalp has been slightly better since using the product but no significant improvement yet.</li>
            <li>Not very lathery, but as its is sulfate free what can you expect.</li>
            <li>&quot; you&#x27;ll find an old image still on Sears website, but this probably won&#x27;t exist for very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as shampoo goes, I really like it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried pine tar, coal tar, Head &amp; Shoulders anti-itch &amp; sensitive skin; I tried products my hairdresser or my dermatologist recommended, slathered my head with a tea tree oil mixture before shampooing, and was almost ready to get the hair shaved off in desperation.</li>
            <li>Well, after a month of continual use (I normally shampoo 2-3 times a week, otherwise hair gets too frizzy), I&#x27;m throwing in the towel.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m returning to selsun blue once a week that results in a better scalp but some minor side effects of dermatitis on the face that are manageable.</li>
            <li>I normally use Pureology products, which have been helpful to improve to condition of my hair.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s happening is that the shampoo is loosening up the dandruff so after using the shampoo a few more times all dandruff will be washed away...</li>
            <li>so I need one, however if I had normal hair</li>
            <li>This is my new go to high end shampoo.</li>
            <li>It has resolved the itchiness and large flakes from the seborrheic dermatitis and leaves my curly/wavy hair soft, shiny and conditioned (no small feat for someone over 50).  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it as it maybe takes a super long time for results.</li>
            <li>And the important thing is it hasn&#x27;t been a temporary fix, unlike the other shampoos and medicines I&#x27;ve tried in the part.    </li>
            <li>I have been using this for 9 months and have noticed thicker hair, and new hair growing in.</li>
            <li>furthermore, new hair is growing in.  </li>
            <li>Pura D&#x27;or doesn&#x27;t disclose anywhere that this is a new formula.</li>
            <li>There is no \\&quot;New Formula\\&quot; header on the bottle, no news on their website, nothing.</li>
            <li>I switched to a new shampoo</li>
            <li>and i noticed a lack of new hair growth ever since i was 30.</li>
            <li>While this is not for everyone I would recommend for people who want to live a organic lifestyle.  </li>
            <li>The whole bottle is very economical plus the fact that i shampoo everyday.  </li>
            <li>It makes my shin very soft, without an oily feeling.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive, somewhat oily scalp, seborrheic dermatitis, and am allergic to sulfates.  </li>
            <li>It feels good on my scalp, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s helped my dandruff, still lots of flakes and scalp is dry.  </li>
            <li>it is all organic and natural!</li>
            <li>Pretty solid HL and dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel soft and got rid of dandruff!</li>
            <li>Small price to pay to have a healthy scalp -- and</li>
            <li>I have tried many products in the past (all were non-organic) which did not work.  </li>
            <li>so I would definitely order this and anyone else that has dandruff problem with sensitive scalp they should really check this out as it really is a life changer.</li>
            <li>I have lots of dandruff in my hair and after only using this shampoo for about a week, I have noticed that the flakes have stopped coming so fast!</li>
            <li>It did help with the dandruff, however I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s exactly made the hair shinier or look any different.  </li>
            <li>it is all organic and natural!</li>
            <li>Most shampoos for SD have sulfates and fragrances, both of which irritate me further in other ways.</li>
            <li>The smell of the shampoo is a little strong</li>
            <li>Had been looking for a good organic shampoo with mostly essential oils because other shampoos were leaving my hair very dry.</li>
            <li>We bought this recently and after just a week of using it, I noticed the &amp;#34;cradle cap&amp;#34; was pretty much resolved and after two weeks I was combing my fingers through her hair to see how it worked, and found it to be so thick, soft, and luxurious that I decided to use it myself to alternate with my own shampoo.</li>
            <li>It scalp is dandruff free and his scalp is no long dry.</li>
            <li>It can be a bit strong on the hair itself so the ends get a bit dried by it.</li>
            <li>Soap was easy but shampoo was hard, because I needed something that really fought and prevented dandruff.</li>
            <li>After using Pura D&#x27;or for these two weeks my dandruff has definitely gotten better and my head is much less itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thinking of pairing with Shea Moisture African Black Soap Conditioner (supposed to help with scalp/skin conditions also) to see if I can keep the itchies at bay for longer, while giving my hair more moisture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like I need something that will give me a quick double-tap of shampoo in my hand, but this bottle I actually need to pull the pump back up before I can pump again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used various different shampoos the past few years in order to see which one works best for my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad we finally found something to prevent further dry scalp.</li>
            <li>This is very good argan Oil, I use it several times a day to keep my skin moisturized during this record cold winter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seems to help daughter&#x27;s dry scalp more than other shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I will now scope out the other products they carry and no doubt will have to gift myself more although my funds are limited as I was payed off.</li>
            <li>Inspite of trying different shampoos and natural products, nothing really worked.</li>
            <li>It is natural and works effectively -- Not to mention it smells lovely, too.</li>
            <li>and I notice I don&#x27;t need as much to make it lather unlike my last shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It does solve my dandruff problem, and I noticed that my hair became soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>We decided to try a sulfate free shampoo &amp; this cleared it up in just a few days.</li>
            <li>After ONE bottle of the shampoo, I shedding has completely stopped.</li>
            <li>This product leaves my hair with no frizz and in the humidity it stays soft and shinny not brittle.</li>
            <li>My friend told me about this product that she completely loves and told me I should try it.</li>
            <li>or so I saw that my hair had completely stopped falling out.</li>
            <li>It also made my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>After ONE bottle of the shampoo, I shedding has completely stopped.</li>
            <li>It smells like herbal medicine which means this is a natural one to some extent.</li>
            <li>I used it again this morning, and the itching is almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes my skin look young and smoother.</li>
            <li>I ordered this shampoo for my daughter who has extremely sensitive skin/scalp.  </li>
            <li>But, I was pleasantly surprised to have a non-itchy scalp the day after I washed my hair.</li>
            <li>It is made of all natural ingredients, which I like.  </li>
            <li>I just used it couple of times and i like so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 36 years old</li>
            <li>After researching for a natural and affordable shampoo, i found Pura d&#x27;or.</li>
            <li>but I had no redness for itchiness afterwards as I have a sensitive scalp</li>
            <li>Hair become really soft after using this.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive scalp &amp;</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s been helping out with the itching and flakes.</li>
            <li>One knock I will give is the pump action on the bottle.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t be jerking off a bottle in the shower just to get some shampoo; I&#x27;m busy jerkin...</li>
            <li>I wanted a premium organic shampoo with no harsh sulfates and this is what you get with the Pura d&#x27;or shampoo.</li>
            <li>So I searched specifically for a natural anti-dandruff shampoo &amp; found this Pura D&#x27;or brand.</li>
            <li>No harsh chemicals is what does it for me.</li>
            <li>Then I tried alternating between Head and Shoulders and Pura - the days I used H&amp;S, no dandruff; the days I used Pura, White Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted this to work -</li>
            <li>The hair became really soft.</li>
            <li>At least I believe there is nothing to do better than this.</li>
            <li>I tried different products but nothing really worked...</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li>I can go 2 days without washing my hair which is awesome with toddler twins, but I HATE the smell.  </li>
            <li>The plain argon oil is fantastic , as well.</li>
            <li>It seems to controlling my dry scalp pretty well too.</li>
            <li>I used John Frieda Frizz easy Shampoo + conditioner for the past 3 year and added a minoxidil 5% drops solution after every shower.</li>
            <li>so it was not totally on tight.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It leaves hair fresh and clean without unnecessary chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I have tried multiple products with limited success.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a little harder for me to rinse than most shampoos I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>His itchy scalp has gotten a lot better, dandruff is visibly less and all this without making his hair oily or rough!</li>
            <li>Just last week, my stylist told me I have a ton of new growth coming in.</li>
            <li>itching.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very hard to find an image of the old bottle, which is kind of... strange.</li>
            <li>I bought it as a gift for my husband and it really helped him take care of his dry scull.</li>
            <li>oh how long this bottle will last me on this first time purchase.</li>
            <li>It left our hair soft and shiny and her scalp looked clear.  </li>
            <li>We tried a couple of different remedies, including massaging her scalp with jojoba oil and then washing it, which really just made her teenage hair oily.</li>
            <li>This is the only thing so far that works for me !</li>
            <li>Results can be seen at the first use, but did not last very long...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a pretty dry scalp and have tried tons of different stuff to keep it in check.  </li>
            <li>Some has spoken about the pump mechanism and how it only releases a small amount of shampoo but as a guy I think it works really well to give you the right quantity.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to say this is a miricle product and will have a huge impact long term, but in general stronger healthier hair leads to less loss.  </li>
            <li>Sadly, all other shampoo that I used will not make you happy after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since it has argon oil, I think it is at least making it healthier and more protected from the heat of a flat iron.</li>
            <li>I have tried various other products over the counter and have not had success in 16 years.</li>
            <li>so it made my hair pretty flat, which I did not enjoy that much.  </li>
            <li>A little pricey, but worth it for me.</li>
            <li>I usually mix this product with a basic dandruff shampoo like Clear or Head&amp;Shoulders and it works well to both clean my scalp and to leave my curly hair manageable.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this out since regular dandruff shampoos didn&#x27;t seem to be helping to clear up my dandruff issues.</li>
            <li>I suffer from psoriasis and frequently get dermatitis especially after hair colors.</li>
            <li>So far it is the only product that has been working!</li>
            <li>I have 2b curly hair and use all natural products to cleanse, condition, and style, but my itchy scalp had been my constant conundrum.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I was looking for a dandruff shampoo that was natural and that wouldn&#x27;t turn my hair into a big ball of frizz.</li>
            <li>The one thing I don&#x27;t like is that it costs so much per bottle but that is expected as you are paying for quality ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a natural shampoo that actually controls my dandruff problem.</li>
            <li>I tried a lot of different kinds of shampoos, nothing helped my sensitive head skin until I found this one.</li>
            <li>( I don&#x27;t need to tell most people why this shampoo is just the worse)</li>
            <li>After using it for more than 3 weeks, my condition for dandruff got a lot worse.</li>
            <li>Works just as good a chemical product but without all the crazy chemicals.  </li>
            <li>He really likes this product and it definitely helped with his dry scalp and winter dandruff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other shampoos but I was not satisfied.</li>
            <li>and I was skeptical a more natural brand would work.</li>
            <li>I expected results that were at least half as good as head and shoulders.  </li>
            <li>I have struggled for a really long time to find a shampoo that will help curb the intense itchy and pain I experience during the dry winter months.</li>
            <li>The effect begins to reveal at the first bottle, obvious less hair went off after washing my hair.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t do reviews but this product was worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all the cheaper shampoos and none of them really cut down on the dandruff.</li>
            <li>The price was a little daunting (especially for an experiment) at first, but I will buy it again without hesitation.  </li>
            <li>I thought the problem was her not getting down to her scalp well enough when she washed it, but when I closely inspected her scalp it really looked like the cradle cap she had as an infant.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this shampoo based on the other reviews here, but it definitely didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>If you are the one out there still putting all your black and dark color clothes away,(just like me before) , and you are lucky to see this shampoo and my review , because it is time to wear anything you want again ,and never worry about the \\&quot;snow\\&quot; you always make from your head again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unlike other product, which felt greasy after use, this product makes the hair very naturally cleaned.</li>
            <li>After the 2nd and 3rd wash, last a little longer, so the results are promising.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive scalp due to health issues.</li>

            <li> I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Has a nice presentation, smells good but</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells nice and does give a good lather, which is why it got two stars, but I won&#x27;t be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> Most dandruff shampoos that seem to work at all didn&#x27;t smell very good and were more chemical-ly than I wanted for her.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!  </li>
            <li> I Love the way it Works!</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing shampoo I have ever tried!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love the product!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> I have also seen my hair grow more!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nothing more to say!</li>
            <li> and since I tried it once I fall in love!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!  </li>
            <li> We love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Received the uplift product very quickly which made me quite happy.  </li>
            <li> but it certainly isn&#x27;t the best as well.</li>
            <li> and the after effect was amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing all natural-organic shampoo.</li>
            <li> This product is really amazing.</li>
            <li> Since then, I have found Aesop, which is amazing.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has been so amazing</li>
            <li> Nice smell, and one bottle</li>
            <li> I tried a Neem shampoo/conditioner I got here on Amazon, it worked about as well as this Pura d&#x27;or did, not horrible but not as good as the one I just ordered a refill of yesterday by just naturals.  </li>
            <li> This is absolutely the BEST dandruff shampoo in the world.  </li>
            <li> Oh and it smells nice too.</li>
            <li> I gave it a two star tho because it smells nice and supposedly</li>
            <li> Smelled kinda nice though</li>
            <li> This is really a nice shampoo.</li>
            <li> Is not quite as effective as say Selsun</li>
            <li> The absolute best shampoo I have ever tried!  </li>
            <li> I waited to write my review to see if it would be effective or not.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is soothing, smells good, and seems to work better than anything I&#x27;ve used before.  </li>
            <li> A number of people commeted about loving the smell.  </li>
            <li> Product not as effective as I was hoping</li>
            <li> May not get rid of dandruff permanently, but still a good and safe shampoo product.</li>
            <li> Shampoo has a nice texture &amp; is not &amp;#34;runny&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It has helped the flaking and itching, but my hair doesn&#x27;t have the texture and shine that I like after a nice shampoo and for that reason I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It lathers nicely without using a handful of shampoo</li>
            <li> For a while I was looking for an effective organic anti dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> She really liked it.</li>
            <li> The hair looks nice and silky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too easy to mark-up their own products!    </li>
            <li> Its a really good shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;It smells good, and more important</li>
            <li> Smells very healthy and my hair looks better after using it.</li>
            <li> Smells great but more importantly works well as an anti dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> Gnerally chemicals are added in most of the hair conditioners for silky and smooth and attractive hair.</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff!</li>
            <li> as another review suggested this product when used with nizoral 1% antidandruff also available on Amazon is a good combination.</li>
            <li> Although I love the idea, and it does leave my hair feeling nice</li>
            <li> I honestly saw value in this product and it did make my hair better.</li>
            <li> Best dandruff shampoo that I have tried thus far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been two weeks since I tried the shampoo and so far I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Will probably be more effective.</li>
            <li> We are a hyper-sensitive family with many allergies and it is nice to have an organic product like Pura d&#x27;or as an option.</li>
            <li> I shifted to Nizoral after this and found it to be more effective.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across Pura d&#x27;or shampoos and I was impressed by its natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> The fact that its organic is even better as too many chemicals do more harm then good.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the best in my experience so far.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells great and leaves my hair feeling fresh.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing, it&#x27;s very light and refreshing.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing, it&#x27;s very light and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the feeling knowing this product is safe to use and good for a head of hair.</li>
            <li> Smell is not too good but not bad.</li>
            <li> The scalp felt very comfortable and soothing after use.</li>
            <li> I feel very comfortable with this feeling.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s hair issue is better now.</li>
            <li> i will buy more again.</li>
            <li> The feeling on my scalp was so much better also</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not doing that much magic on my hair.</li>
            <li> But I been trying out product that cost me more money</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Better than Head &#x27;n Shoulders and</li>
            <li> I love this produce.</li>
            <li> Our kids love it a lot.</li>
            <li> I suffer from seborrheic dermatitis and had used another shampoo for many years.  </li>
            <li> Works great and fast shippers</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Organic and magic?</li>
            <li> My scalp healed itself like magic.</li>
            <li> and I still see nothing but a healthy scalp..</li>
            <li> 5 stars :)</li>
            <li> I found the shampoo to be the best of all dandruff and itchy scalp treatments compared to what I use daily: Paul Mitchell tea tree and head and shoulders</li>
            <li> Our favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> And it leaves my scalp in better condition than before washing.</li>
            <li> You can definitely feel the peppermint oil refresh your scalp, and the smell of lavender and thyme is delightful.</li>
            <li> but now i have,flaky and itchy.i have been using it for more than a month along with the consitioner</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> The shampoo did an okay job at relieving the itchy and flakiness of my scalp.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Im 100% satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> If you do some scalp massage when you use it, it works better.</li>
            <li> Love this product I bought it for myself for dandruff and to prevent hair loss.</li>
            <li> the shampoo is helping me at this time, but i suffer from SPORADIC severe scalp issue, that my scalp may develop resistance to many types of anti dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> I would say 80% better.</li>
            <li> I love how my hair feels, but I still have the dandruff problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months now, and I feel my hair is more healthy.</li>
            <li> It feels thicker and more healthy.</li>
            <li> I will continue using the shampoo until I need to buy more and update my review then.</li>
            <li> I was also pleased to find my hair shiny and with greater body.</li>
            <li> I was able to tell the difference after just 1 week.</li>
            <li> Finally tried Pura D&#x27;Or am very happy with the results after a month of use.</li>
            <li> I used to love this shampoo, but my latest bottle leaves my hair looking almost as greasy as it was before I washed it.  </li>
            <li> Love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li> dandruff itches the scalp and makes worry also a working person in a magnificient  healthy conditioner product  manufacturing Industry.</li>
            <li> I am going to continue using it for awhile and see if it will work better.  </li>
            <li> It works better when it has been in the scalp for awhile.</li>
            <li> I am really glad I found this one.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair shiny with more volume.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Also, the amount of time one bottle can last for is great!</li>
            <li> but this is a great most days shampoo because it is gentle on the hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love argon because I don&#x27;t like washing my hair that often</li>
            <li> love it must try.</li>
            <li> I have allergic reactions to most shampoos and styling products.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> this product does not bother me and I will continue to buy this shampoo:)</li>
            <li> Sure, it is a bit pricey compared to many of the &amp;#34;off the shelf&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I would expect to see better results by now.&lt;br</li>
            <li> overall its great product will buy again!!</li>
            <li> With more uses I&#x27;m sure his scalp will be</li>
            <li> even more improved.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy to have finally found this product which has everything that I&#x27;m looking for (all-natural, good lather, dandruff control).  </li>
            <li> I had problems with  flaking of scalp and hair loss after showering for many years.</li>
            <li> But, hey, if I wanted to be \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; and dandruff-free I had better pay</li>
            <li> I can gladly report that my hair loss has virtually stopped.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I have noticed an increase in itching in the area with the most severe scales</li>
            <li> I had used a lot of non-organic shampoos(head and shoulders, Dove) and they were able to control dandruff</li>
            <li> much more than before I started using the product almost three weeks ago now.  </li>
            <li> Anyone else feel like they started experiencing more danfruff?</li>
            <li> Entirely satisfied.</li>
            <li> and i think i am getting more dandruff than before.</li>
            <li> Better than Head &#x27;n Shoulders and</li>
            <li> I will keep using the product and update the review if it gets better.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> It has worked better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> , I love the pump bottle.</li>
            <li> I believe it will be safe to use this everyday.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But most of all I love that it works so well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay at relieving itch, but didn&#x27;t get hair very clean - looked like it was greasy or had a residue.</li>
            <li> So far so good!  </li>
            <li> just kind of a minty clean smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks now and it seems pretty good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad in the warm weather, but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good shampoo.</li>
            <li> The smell is Devine and the results are nothing short of amazing!!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the cost!!</li>
            <li> Every body wants to be free from dandruff and happy.</li>
            <li> Love that it has no chemicals, all natural, and it smells great too.</li>
            <li> After stumbling onto this beauty of a product and experiencing the magic that is Pura d&#x27;or anti-dandruff shampoo it quickly made it to my top 10 favorite shampoos ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that it is organic yet unlike many organic products this one leaves me feeling clean.</li>
            <li> very good shampoo is my second bottle</li>
            <li> and the most important part is:</li>
            <li> Smells nice and seems to calm my scalp.</li>
            <li> its worth trying as its a nice shampoo.</li>
            <li> It smelled good and works very well to keep dandruff away.</li>
            <li> I started using it right away, and I can honestly say that it truly does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell very much, but I love that its organic and ir helped a lot with mi scalp problem!</li>
            <li> Their shampoo/conditioner isn&#x27;t perfect, which is why I&#x27;ve been trying a couple other brands, but now I know that I&#x27;m just wasting money and time</li>
            <li> Smells great almost like fresh cedar, it doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair or scalp though</li>
            <li> One thing that I was impressed with was the lather as sometimes with all natural shampoos you can&#x27;t get much of a lather.</li>
            <li> Really easy to get lots of foamy.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong, yes, and sticks around for hours and hours and hours.</li>
            <li> Since then my hair even looks more alive, try this product, its a good price</li>
            <li> Good ingredients, but need A LOT of product to make a decent lather.</li>
            <li> Im glad I got it on special.</li>
            <li> Amazing product i felt the diffrence on the first wash.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo it has solved my problem and leaves my hair full and manageable.</li>
            <li> -No need to look for fine print.  </li>
            <li> So if you do have oily or fine hair, you might want to take this into consideration before trying.</li>
            <li> full line of beauty products  -Organic and good for the whole family  </li>
            <li> Good, it seems very soft,</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s natural, it&#x27;s sulfate-free, and it smells lovely!</li>
            <li> I suffer from eczema and was in need of an SLS Free shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have been using Pura d&#x27;or Anti-dandruff Shampoo for 2 months and my hair is free of dandruff.</li>
            <li> my hair is 100% free of dandruff.</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo for almost 4 weeks now, and my hair had begun thinning and it looks  fuller and filled.</li>
            <li> would recommend to anyone who desires to have a itch free head, it works.</li>
            <li> Smells fabulous.</li>
            <li> This is an incredible product, all natural, including many natural products that benefit the scalp.</li>
            <li> This shampoo can make your hair so smooth but not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Overall great product</li>
            <li> It feels smooth and nourishing</li>
            <li> I got this as the second bottle for my dad.&lt;br /&gt;It is great for preventing loss of hair</li>
            <li> It is really helpful, nice product.</li>
            <li> Pura d&#x27;or has helped strengthen my hair and keep it smooth.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Hair feels light and smooth after shower.</li>
            <li> My Dandruff is in control and hair is smooth.</li>
            <li> i get some hair back which is great.</li>
            <li> Light scent and light formula.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far I can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s good or not, maybe after one month using.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine, so if yours is normal, maybe it&#x27;ll leave your hair looking better than mine.  </li>
            <li> I am so pleased and hooked right from the start.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first product ever to work for me!!</li>
            <li> I am very dissatisfied !!!</li>
            <li> and I love how clean and fresh this leaves my hair.</li>
            <li> It really deals with dandruff perfectly, but it makes my hair too dry.</li>
            <li> From the first wash I noticed the dandruff that would fall on my clothing was much greater than it had ever been before.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any significant results yet after using it for three months.</li>
            <li> First off, I love that this shampoo is organic.</li>
            <li> No artificial perfume smell to it either!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this shampoo after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> but maybe I need to use it more consistently</li>
            <li> sure, After the first bottle amount of my dad&#x27;s hair seems same.&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
            <li> best part about using this product is that if you want to wash your hair everyday, you can!</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for 1 week and have noticed a significant improvement in my dandruff and scaliness of my scalp.</li>
            <li> so i was willing to spend more.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied thus far and feel in my bones and premenition this will be the product of choice from here on out.</li>
            <li> At first it doesn&#x27;t seem to work but after two weeks it really works!!!!</li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge decrease in how quickly my hair gets oily and decrease in my itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair clean and I don&#x27;t get an itchy head</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but this stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> Makes my scalp feel clean.</li>
            <li> Before I used this shampoo, a lot hair will drop when I clean my hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clean your hair.</li>
            <li> I heard of it through a popular website, and I&#x27;m glad that I finally find an organic shampoo which can prevent hair loss.</li>
            <li> My scalp feels clean and like it is healing.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li> still I don&#x27;t get that squeaky clean feeling that I like.  </li>
            <li> I think this is a great shampoo, it cleans well and doesnt dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several brands and this one has worked best so far.</li>
            <li> From the very first use I could feel and see a huge difference in my hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li> Since I have been using this shampoo my dermatitis episodes are rare and my scalp is healthier and free of dandruff.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s full effect,</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo once and my hair was incredibly shiny once it dried.</li>
            <li> It is a superior product and will never go back to using Nioxin again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo feels good, doesnt give that chemical feel like with commercial shampoos.</li>
            <li> It does help with dandruff, and it has been gentle and safe for thinning, graying and brittle hair.  </li>
            <li> I really like the scent of the product and absolutely love the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Good product, wish the bottle was a bit bigger!!!!</li>
            <li> The reason I dont give a full 10 is because it does not cure the problem</li>
            <li> I must say I am loving so far.</li>
            <li> Overall good shampoo.</li>
            <li> I was pretty surprised by how good this shampoo smelled for being an organic product.</li>
            <li> It smells natural and did pretty good cleaning job.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li> It feels natural and has a strong tea tree oil smell which I love.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The aroma is a bit strong at first</li>
            <li> works good but smells like medicine to me, not unpleasant but definitely medicinal</li>
            <li> Great product with a great price tag, will definitely purchase again in the near future.</li>
            <li> An awesome product, that leaves your hair very fresh and clean with out all the unnecessary chemicals .</li>
            <li> Leaves the scalp very clean, is gentle and provides body for our hair type.  </li>
            <li> (I can&#x27;t stand the smell of patchouli), my daughter is happy with the results; mainly that her scalp doesn&#x27;t get irritated or flaky after use as it does with most other products.</li>
            <li> Be aware that your hair will not feel silky after rinsing but don&#x27;t worry it will still comb out just fine.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I found this gentle but powerfully cleansing product.</li>
            <li> and I felt that I just had to say something about this wonderful thing, only because its so different from everything else out there.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great product, only down fall is that it does not smell the greatest, but if you use the conditioner that will offset that.</li>
            <li> I was concerned at first that even though it says it&#x27;s sulfate free it still lathers quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell very much, hope it will works!</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a good organic shampoo for a long time.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this shampoo -- very fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> Definitely my new favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> Wow this shampoo is utterly amazing even after the first use.</li>
            <li> I notice my hair is much more full, soft and flows in the wind.</li>
            <li> It smells good and does not make my hair nor my skin dry.</li>
            <li> I notice my hair is much more full, soft and flows in the wind.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much Pura D&#x27;or!!</li>
            <li> This is my first review on Amazon!</li>
            <li> 99% of the ingredients are driven from natural products, except phenoxyethanol which is a mild preservative that is used in many cosmetic products.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product, my hair use to be full of body and thick in my 20 &amp; 30.</li>
            <li> It does clean my hair pretty well</li>
            <li> The smell is very herbal and I am fine with that, but some people may not like it.  </li>
            <li> And my hair stays healthier for so much longer-I don&#x27;t have to cut it as often because the ends don&#x27;t split nearly as quickly since purchasing this !</li>
            <li> And my flakes are huge and some are so fine they stick out and make my hair look like its just filled with white dust.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a huge change in my scalp and new hair growth, mainly on the front part of my hair line where i used to part my hair for so many years.</li>
            <li> Second, the smell was amazing.</li>
            <li> price was a bit daunting yet after using it for a while, it&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> but I love that it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li> The hair feel soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> Well worth the purchase to rid yourself of dandruff issues.  </li>
            <li> Is it worth it?</li>
            <li> And just to see how powerful this stuff is</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff because I wanted to get away from head and shoulders and be more natural.  </li>
            <li> Im not crazy about it though....</li>
            <li> So far I love it.</li>
            <li> I love that one, this anti-dandruff  shampoo doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL PRODUCT, would recommend to any middle aged woman with hair problems.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo was worth a try.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair from falling out, and to me its worth price.</li>
            <li> That said, I don&#x27;t think any shampoo is worth $49 per bottle.</li>
            <li> but it also doesn&#x27;t foam as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> The product anti dandruff mentioned here is better than Head&#x27;n sholders and it is all organic and  natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll pick the more natural of the two, thank you.</li>
            <li> Changed the review to 4 stars - still worth buying/trying in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like fragrances, but the lovely scent of this won me over, maybe because it smells so natural.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Hopefully with some more time my dandruff will completely go away.</li>
            <li> It only takes one squirt from the pump and it lathers up nicely.</li>
            <li> Love how this shampoo leaves my hair feeling so soft.</li>
            <li> The price is worth the results.</li>
            <li> Thus far I love the way it smooths on my neck and lower skin.</li>
            <li> It still gets a little flakey in extreme weather but for the most part it works great!</li>
            <li> I wash every other day and have noticed good results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had my hopes up because of all the good reviews on here, and with the high price I figured it must contain only the purest ingredients (and</li>
            <li> and i can see results right away.</li>
            <li> It seems to have just the right blend of tea tree oil to keep the pain and itchy at bay.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this for as long as it keeps my scalp healthy and flake free.</li>
            <li> Pretty satisfied with the results so far.</li>
            <li> Great Shampoo does what it advertises and will be buying again,shipping was a little slow but other than that great buy! :)</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair free of dandruff and also makes it very soft!  </li>
            <li> Some of them made it better for a couple of days but the problem always came back quickly.    </li>
            <li> for the last few weeks i have been using \\&quot;Premium Organic Shampoo\\&quot;.i am happy with this product because it cleared my hair well.it performs better than  \\&quot;Head &#x27;n Shoulders\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> So fresh and not hair loss first time</li>
            <li> As I grew older, I had more and more problems with dandruff and dry scalp.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice and I noticed fewer flakes, but it has not completely solved my dandruff problem.</li>
            <li> The first wash removes the oil from your hair and then the second is able to penetrate and lathers better than my old SLS shampoo.</li>
            <li> but I quickly got used to it and actually really like it now.</li>
            <li> Lathers well, decent scent, gets hair clean and seems to have helped with some scalp issues I was having.</li>
            <li> As far as natural shampoos go, this Pura d&#x27;or anti-dandruff shampoo is amazing.  </li>
            <li> It lathers really well when most natural products don&#x27;t, and it leaves my hair shiny and silky.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy that my husband finally found something to prevent further hair loss that I was experiencing.  </li>
            <li> a felt really soft  and easy to mashable  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the most gentle product if you have fine dry hair</li>
            <li> Used in conjunction with other products and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I used the conditioner after the shampoo the first time, although I realized that it is not necessary, my hair are just great with the shampoo only!</li>
            <li> I have very straight hair</li>
            <li> I received it very fast..</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use very much of it either.  </li>
            <li> and I had that issue at first</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> so if you really care about your hair than go for it because its worth every penny u spend</li>
            <li> I tried the pine tar shampoos (they stink but work pretty well)</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;Pura\\&quot; shampoo really does what it says!</li>
            <li> This product really changed the texture of my hair!</li>
            <li> This is the first product that 100% got rid of my dandruff.</li>
            <li> it does relieve the itching and flaking on the first day, but because everything is organic, it isnt as aggressive as it probably should be.</li>
            <li> He is looking forward to washing his hair a second time and hoping for NO dandruff at all :)</li>
            <li> and it really does work!</li>
            <li> Firstly, I don&#x27;t have thinning hair.</li>
            <li> More so in recent years, so I decided to do something about it.</li>
            <li> Firstly, I don&#x27;t have thinning hair.</li>
            <li> More so in recent years, so I decided to do something about it.</li>
            <li> I just used it for the first time and to my surprise</li>
            <li> will definitely continue using it :)</li>
            <li> Before I switched to this product, my scalp was irritated and hot, my hair was falling out and the dandruff was out of control.  </li>
            <li> When I tried this organic shampoo I felt a difference on the first wash.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many products to treat dandruff and they only work for one or two days...</li>
            <li> This shampoo yields results from the first use.</li>
            <li> The first is the price.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more when this bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> This shampoo actually works for the most part.  </li>
            <li> and I was looking for all kinds of treatments everywhere and tried so many different \\&quot;Anti-dandruff\\&quot; shampoo.</li>
            <li> This product was MUCH better several months ago.</li>
            <li> Just the alteration of that first bullet point.</li>
            <li> It did get my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It seems really work!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I came back for more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my first bottle and will update how it ends.</li>
            <li> I have been using Pura d&#x27;or thinning hair shampoo for several years now and love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it about every three days or so for several weeks now and so far am very pleased.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This may take some time getting use to but a lot of dandruff will begin to show up upon first using the shampoo, but don&#x27;t be alarmed.</li>
            <li> This is my first review on Amazon</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I decided to plunge into the world of higher quality shampoos.</li>
            <li> It keeps me dandruff free completely granted</li>
            <li> Product seems to do exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> this is the first time I&#x27;ve attempted to do something about it.</li>
            <li> I first saw this shampoo on Groupon and decided to try it out.</li>
            <li> so if you really care about your hair than go for it because its worth every penny u spend.</li>
            <li> If you have medium-long hair, you need to pump so many times to get enough shampoo.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE  -Compared to high-end European products  -Saves on constant grocery store visits for less effective products  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find a significant improvement after the first use.</li>
            <li> I bought this product due to the amazing reviews in how it controls dandruff...</li>
            <li> So I was really surprised when this all-natural shampoo lowered my dandruff significantly when chemical based products couldn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Being sulfate free it doesn&#x27;t lather up as well as most drugstore brands, but it really gets your hair clean, and her scalp has hardly any flaking at all anymore.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling squeaky clean, but not dried or frizzy.</li>
            <li> It does leave the hair feeling clean and not heavy</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft since using it and I love how this product is all natural.</li>
            <li> If you know what tea tree oil smells like, yeah that pretty much is the idea.</li>
            <li> After one week of use dandruff control seems slightly better than other tea tree shampoos I&#x27;ve tried, if the price was lower it might be worth it.</li>
            <li> the texture was strange my dandruff became more and ichy</li>
            <li> AMAZING shampoo totally going to buy it again, its so gentle and make my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really going all organic in my life and this is one my first steps.  </li>
            <li> The itching had reduced considerably and my hair really looked clean and shiny.</li>
            <li> My hair is so much easier to straighten and blow dry and sits much better for much longer!</li>
            <li> wish it worked a little better!</li>
            <li> The rare ones that offer some results usually dry my fine, wavy, color-treated, frizzy hair to no end.</li>
            <li> When I recently discovered that Pura d&#x27;or makes a premium organic shampoo made for dandruff and scalp conditions it was an easy decision to give it a try.</li>
            <li> This summer&#x27;s heat has created hair problems even for those who can still keep weekly salon appointments, so this shampoo will certainly aid in the elimination of dandruff.    </li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this product to all my friends who want relief from scalp flaking and itching.</li>
            <li> It lathers very well,rinses quickly; the shampoo leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> This thing last, it holds its quality super well!</li>
            <li> Whereas the older formula, the first line read, \\&quot;Controls flaking, scaling, and</li>
            <li> For me, it truly is pure gold; eliminating that persistent itch and irritation has really improved my quality of life.</li>
            <li> wonder if it&#x27;s really 100% organic...or only organic enough to satisfy the standards for using that label, but regardless it appears to be one of the MOST organic shampoos available on Amazon, and a better value than my previous brand, Bumble and Bumble.</li>
            <li> I have just purchased my third bottle of this shampoo and have noticed a HUGE difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> It really helps.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much difference it has made on my flakes</li>
            <li> have now used the product for 5-6 times and the results are really visible.</li>
            <li> It very help your scalp itching and dandruff.</li>
            <li> My whole family use this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Thanks for make this shampoo.</li>
            <li> it very well may, I don&#x27;t know)</li>
            <li> but it sure didn&#x27;t help me as much as I expected.  </li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this shampoo</li>
            <li> The shampoo is fantastic and I use it daily.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really helps.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair very heavy/greasy.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I realize it&#x27;s because this shampoo lacks the chemicals that produce lather, but for the price and how much I have to use it will not be sustainable hair care for me.  </li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> this really does not help with my dandruff problem at all which is the whole reason I bought it.</li>
            <li> after just one day, my skin dries up and my hair gets really oily already.</li>
            <li> Does not suds up much.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Last of all, my hair was silky smooth after.</li>
            <li> I was really fedup with my itching scalp.</li>
            <li> I shampoo with cheapo shampoo once to cleanse my hair, rinse, and then use Pura D&#x27;or straight.</li>
            <li> I really recommend it for dandruff and damaged scalp</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> I shampoo with cheapo shampoo once to cleanse my hair, rinse, and then use Pura D&#x27;or straight.</li>
            <li> I very like this shampoo and use it every time.</li>
            <li> Smells too much like patchouli, a smell that I find intolerable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from dandruff/sd/inflamed scalp since childhood and it seems as if I&#x27;ve tried absolutely every shampoo out there.</li>
            <li> My scalp had really been bothering me with the heat and humidity this summer.  </li>
            <li> i really thought that this would help my dandruff problem.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling to use anti-dandruff shampoo that really works and does not damage my hair.</li>
            <li> Although it calms anti-dandruff, it isn&#x27;t really helping for my scalp.</li>
            <li> I tried it for two weeks straight</li>
            <li> I have used a variety of organic and &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; products, but none of them really seemed to help.</li>
            <li> I really bought it for my boyfriend who has thinning hair and he loves it.</li>
            <li> It really does work.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> my hair gets to oily really fast</li>
            <li> a using this shampoo i can see that its not as oily as before and not to mention that my urge to srcatch is not as much...</li>
            <li> Very drying...</li>
            <li> My head skin became really itchy...</li>
            <li> I had used Head and Shoulders for years and it really worked to keep the dandruff away</li>
            <li> My hair is now stronger and also fuller, making styling a much easier process.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> This has helped so much.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo, when i put on my hair</li>
            <li> Thanks for</li>
            <li> He has used a lot of shampoos and none of them really helped.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> the flakes don&#x27;t show up much, but they do on her clothes.</li>
            <li> You can tell it&#x27;s the new formula because the first bullet point on the bottle now reads, \\&quot;Prevents</li>
            <li> I actually love the shampoo and it gets my hair nice and clean, but the dandruff turned into a huge problem and I had to switch back to my old shampoo for a little while to avoid scratching my head all day :/</li>
            <li> BUT... DOESN&#x27;T CLEAN DEEP AND DON&#x27;T EXPECT TOO MUCH</li>
            <li> In other words, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell the difference between using this and Johnson&#x27;s baby shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it controls it more than any other product I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> It also smells nice and natural, and it leaves his long hair soft</li>
            <li> After the first use, the dandruff disappeared right away, but it came back in about 4 days, not as much as before though.</li>
            <li> After several washes my hair feels clean and healthier.</li>
            <li> If I continue to get the same results it will be worth the higher price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found a natural solution for my itchy scalp that doesn&#x27;t hurt my hair, and long for, yet dread washing days.</li>
            <li> It make me lose less hair during the bath.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very important to stick on it, too.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, I was very pleasantly surprised as it showed results.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone wanting a higher quality natural shampoo that may help with hair growth.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and very shiny!</li>
            <li> tried another natural shampoo first</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the dispenser which allows me to control the amount of shampoo which is better than other bottles that can make a mess.</li>
            <li> WOW I can say it really works!</li>
            <li> I tried JƒÅs√∂n Dandruff Relief 2 in 1 Shampoo and Conditioner (because of the overwhelming positive reviews) with no success, so I was hesitant to try another natural product.</li>
            <li> I throughly enjoyed my experience with this not so typical scalp treatment shampoo.</li>
            <li> head and shaulders takes care of the problem for more than twice less the price</li>
            <li> After 1.5 months, I still have more than half the bottle.</li>
            <li> I really needed something that would clean my dandruff and at the same time to be natural.</li>
            <li> there some particular way of using it ?</li>
            <li> I have been having an issue with dryness and flakiness around my hairline for more than six months, which is now creeping a bit further back from my hairline.</li>
            <li> Argan oil comes from the seed of Argan oil which are mainly grown in Morocco.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> I searched spent nearly three years (and who knows how many hundreds of dollars) searching for a shampoo that didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Luckily with blonde hair</li>
            <li> Used the entire bottle too quickly to want to re-purchase.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is extremely moisturizing, which is great for frizzy hair like mine, however I am finding that it&#x27;s resulting in a little bit of product buildup.</li>
            <li> and my scalp is very sensitive, itchy and has dandruff!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes when ordering this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li> He highly recommend me to use this product to care hair.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My head always feel itchy after using this awful shampoo and gave me more and more dandruff !!!</li>
            <li> after using it for 2 weeks, it seems like my hair is a little bit more than before.</li>
            <li> I think my scalp has been slightly better since using the product but no significant improvement yet.</li>
            <li> Not very lathery, but as its is sulfate free what can you expect.</li>
            <li> &quot; you&#x27;ll find an old image still on Sears website, but this probably won&#x27;t exist for very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as shampoo goes, I really like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried pine tar, coal tar, Head &amp; Shoulders anti-itch &amp; sensitive skin; I tried products my hairdresser or my dermatologist recommended, slathered my head with a tea tree oil mixture before shampooing, and was almost ready to get the hair shaved off in desperation.</li>
            <li> Well, after a month of continual use (I normally shampoo 2-3 times a week, otherwise hair gets too frizzy), I&#x27;m throwing in the towel.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m returning to selsun blue once a week that results in a better scalp but some minor side effects of dermatitis on the face that are manageable.</li>
            <li> I normally use Pureology products, which have been helpful to improve to condition of my hair.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s happening is that the shampoo is loosening up the dandruff so after using the shampoo a few more times all dandruff will be washed away...</li>
            <li> so I need one, however if I had normal hair</li>
            <li> This is my new go to high end shampoo.</li>
            <li> It has resolved the itchiness and large flakes from the seborrheic dermatitis and leaves my curly/wavy hair soft, shiny and conditioned (no small feat for someone over 50).  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it as it maybe takes a super long time for results.</li>
            <li> And the important thing is it hasn&#x27;t been a temporary fix, unlike the other shampoos and medicines I&#x27;ve tried in the part.    </li>
            <li> I have been using this for 9 months and have noticed thicker hair, and new hair growing in.</li>
            <li> furthermore, new hair is growing in.  </li>
            <li> Pura D&#x27;or doesn&#x27;t disclose anywhere that this is a new formula.</li>
            <li> There is no \\&quot;New Formula\\&quot; header on the bottle, no news on their website, nothing.</li>
            <li> I switched to a new shampoo</li>
            <li> and i noticed a lack of new hair growth ever since i was 30.</li>
            <li> While this is not for everyone I would recommend for people who want to live a organic lifestyle.  </li>
            <li> The whole bottle is very economical plus the fact that i shampoo everyday.  </li>
            <li> It makes my shin very soft, without an oily feeling.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive, somewhat oily scalp, seborrheic dermatitis, and am allergic to sulfates.  </li>
            <li> It feels good on my scalp, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s helped my dandruff, still lots of flakes and scalp is dry.  </li>
            <li> it is all organic and natural!</li>
            <li> Pretty solid HL and dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel soft and got rid of dandruff!</li>
            <li> Small price to pay to have a healthy scalp -- and</li>
            <li> I have tried many products in the past (all were non-organic) which did not work.  </li>
            <li> so I would definitely order this and anyone else that has dandruff problem with sensitive scalp they should really check this out as it really is a life changer.</li>
            <li> I have lots of dandruff in my hair and after only using this shampoo for about a week, I have noticed that the flakes have stopped coming so fast!</li>
            <li> It did help with the dandruff, however I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s exactly made the hair shinier or look any different.  </li>
            <li> it is all organic and natural!</li>
            <li> Most shampoos for SD have sulfates and fragrances, both of which irritate me further in other ways.</li>
            <li> The smell of the shampoo is a little strong</li>
            <li> Had been looking for a good organic shampoo with mostly essential oils because other shampoos were leaving my hair very dry.</li>
            <li> We bought this recently and after just a week of using it, I noticed the &amp;#34;cradle cap&amp;#34; was pretty much resolved and after two weeks I was combing my fingers through her hair to see how it worked, and found it to be so thick, soft, and luxurious that I decided to use it myself to alternate with my own shampoo.</li>
            <li> It scalp is dandruff free and his scalp is no long dry.</li>
            <li> It can be a bit strong on the hair itself so the ends get a bit dried by it.</li>
            <li> Soap was easy but shampoo was hard, because I needed something that really fought and prevented dandruff.</li>
            <li> After using Pura D&#x27;or for these two weeks my dandruff has definitely gotten better and my head is much less itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thinking of pairing with Shea Moisture African Black Soap Conditioner (supposed to help with scalp/skin conditions also) to see if I can keep the itchies at bay for longer, while giving my hair more moisture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like I need something that will give me a quick double-tap of shampoo in my hand, but this bottle I actually need to pull the pump back up before I can pump again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various different shampoos the past few years in order to see which one works best for my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad we finally found something to prevent further dry scalp.</li>
            <li> This is very good argan Oil, I use it several times a day to keep my skin moisturized during this record cold winter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seems to help daughter&#x27;s dry scalp more than other shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I will now scope out the other products they carry and no doubt will have to gift myself more although my funds are limited as I was payed off.</li>
            <li> Inspite of trying different shampoos and natural products, nothing really worked.</li>
            <li> It is natural and works effectively -- Not to mention it smells lovely, too.</li>
            <li> and I notice I don&#x27;t need as much to make it lather unlike my last shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It does solve my dandruff problem, and I noticed that my hair became soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> We decided to try a sulfate free shampoo &amp; this cleared it up in just a few days.</li>
            <li> After ONE bottle of the shampoo, I shedding has completely stopped.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair with no frizz and in the humidity it stays soft and shinny not brittle.</li>
            <li> My friend told me about this product that she completely loves and told me I should try it.</li>
            <li> or so I saw that my hair had completely stopped falling out.</li>
            <li> It also made my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> After ONE bottle of the shampoo, I shedding has completely stopped.</li>
            <li> It smells like herbal medicine which means this is a natural one to some extent.</li>
            <li> I used it again this morning, and the itching is almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes my skin look young and smoother.</li>
            <li> I ordered this shampoo for my daughter who has extremely sensitive skin/scalp.  </li>
            <li> But, I was pleasantly surprised to have a non-itchy scalp the day after I washed my hair.</li>
            <li> It is made of all natural ingredients, which I like.  </li>
            <li> I just used it couple of times and i like so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 36 years old</li>
            <li> After researching for a natural and affordable shampoo, i found Pura d&#x27;or.</li>
            <li> but I had no redness for itchiness afterwards as I have a sensitive scalp</li>
            <li> Hair become really soft after using this.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive scalp &amp;</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s been helping out with the itching and flakes.</li>
            <li> One knock I will give is the pump action on the bottle.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be jerking off a bottle in the shower just to get some shampoo; I&#x27;m busy jerkin...</li>
            <li> I wanted a premium organic shampoo with no harsh sulfates and this is what you get with the Pura d&#x27;or shampoo.</li>
            <li> So I searched specifically for a natural anti-dandruff shampoo &amp; found this Pura D&#x27;or brand.</li>
            <li> No harsh chemicals is what does it for me.</li>
            <li> Then I tried alternating between Head and Shoulders and Pura - the days I used H&amp;S, no dandruff; the days I used Pura, White Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted this to work -</li>
            <li> The hair became really soft.</li>
            <li> At least I believe there is nothing to do better than this.</li>
            <li> I tried different products but nothing really worked...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> I can go 2 days without washing my hair which is awesome with toddler twins, but I HATE the smell.  </li>
            <li> The plain argon oil is fantastic , as well.</li>
            <li> It seems to controlling my dry scalp pretty well too.</li>
            <li> I used John Frieda Frizz easy Shampoo + conditioner for the past 3 year and added a minoxidil 5% drops solution after every shower.</li>
            <li> so it was not totally on tight.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It leaves hair fresh and clean without unnecessary chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I have tried multiple products with limited success.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little harder for me to rinse than most shampoos I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> His itchy scalp has gotten a lot better, dandruff is visibly less and all this without making his hair oily or rough!</li>
            <li> Just last week, my stylist told me I have a ton of new growth coming in.</li>
            <li> itching.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very hard to find an image of the old bottle, which is kind of... strange.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift for my husband and it really helped him take care of his dry scull.</li>
            <li> oh how long this bottle will last me on this first time purchase.</li>
            <li> It left our hair soft and shiny and her scalp looked clear.  </li>
            <li> We tried a couple of different remedies, including massaging her scalp with jojoba oil and then washing it, which really just made her teenage hair oily.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing so far that works for me !</li>
            <li> Results can be seen at the first use, but did not last very long...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a pretty dry scalp and have tried tons of different stuff to keep it in check.  </li>
            <li> Some has spoken about the pump mechanism and how it only releases a small amount of shampoo but as a guy I think it works really well to give you the right quantity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to say this is a miricle product and will have a huge impact long term, but in general stronger healthier hair leads to less loss.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, all other shampoo that I used will not make you happy after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since it has argon oil, I think it is at least making it healthier and more protected from the heat of a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have tried various other products over the counter and have not had success in 16 years.</li>
            <li> so it made my hair pretty flat, which I did not enjoy that much.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey, but worth it for me.</li>
            <li> I usually mix this product with a basic dandruff shampoo like Clear or Head&amp;Shoulders and it works well to both clean my scalp and to leave my curly hair manageable.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this out since regular dandruff shampoos didn&#x27;t seem to be helping to clear up my dandruff issues.</li>
            <li> I suffer from psoriasis and frequently get dermatitis especially after hair colors.</li>
            <li> So far it is the only product that has been working!</li>
            <li> I have 2b curly hair and use all natural products to cleanse, condition, and style, but my itchy scalp had been my constant conundrum.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was looking for a dandruff shampoo that was natural and that wouldn&#x27;t turn my hair into a big ball of frizz.</li>
            <li> The one thing I don&#x27;t like is that it costs so much per bottle but that is expected as you are paying for quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a natural shampoo that actually controls my dandruff problem.</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of different kinds of shampoos, nothing helped my sensitive head skin until I found this one.</li>
            <li> ( I don&#x27;t need to tell most people why this shampoo is just the worse)</li>
            <li> After using it for more than 3 weeks, my condition for dandruff got a lot worse.</li>
            <li> Works just as good a chemical product but without all the crazy chemicals.  </li>
            <li> He really likes this product and it definitely helped with his dry scalp and winter dandruff.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other shampoos but I was not satisfied.</li>
            <li> and I was skeptical a more natural brand would work.</li>
            <li> I expected results that were at least half as good as head and shoulders.  </li>
            <li> I have struggled for a really long time to find a shampoo that will help curb the intense itchy and pain I experience during the dry winter months.</li>
            <li> The effect begins to reveal at the first bottle, obvious less hair went off after washing my hair.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t do reviews but this product was worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all the cheaper shampoos and none of them really cut down on the dandruff.</li>
            <li> The price was a little daunting (especially for an experiment) at first, but I will buy it again without hesitation.  </li>
            <li> I thought the problem was her not getting down to her scalp well enough when she washed it, but when I closely inspected her scalp it really looked like the cradle cap she had as an infant.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this shampoo based on the other reviews here, but it definitely didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> If you are the one out there still putting all your black and dark color clothes away,(just like me before) , and you are lucky to see this shampoo and my review , because it is time to wear anything you want again ,and never worry about the \\&quot;snow\\&quot; you always make from your head again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unlike other product, which felt greasy after use, this product makes the hair very naturally cleaned.</li>
            <li> After the 2nd and 3rd wash, last a little longer, so the results are promising.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive scalp due to health issues.</li>
            <li> I can have a normal wash every night and can go out wearing black without having to brush off my shoulders every 5 minutes, this product has made such an impact on my life, just wish I found it sooner.</li>
            <li> While I was anxious/excited to use this product based on what I&#x27;d read about the product itself plus the almost all positive reviews, I was (and still am) disappointed that I feel like I&#x27;m noticing more dandruff,  </li>
            <li> I naturally have oily scalp/hair along with dandruff and need to wash my hair every other day not to mention that my hair becomes severely oily after 36 hours.</li>
            <li> The ingredients list won me over, too, as it doesn&#x27;t have the harmful chemicals of other shampoos, as far as I can tell.  </li>
            <li> My scaling, itching and sores have decreased significantly and lessen</li>
            <li> The price seams a bit high for 16 ounces but a little goes</li>
            <li> I love the smell of it and that it does not have the harsh chemicals that the other products we have used in the past have.</li>
            <li> last a really long time.</li>
            <li> use the double shampoo method, and it has made all the difference in how long the shampoo lasts.</li>
            <li> I have also realized that the bottle last quite a long time in relations to its size.</li>
            <li> use the double shampoo method, and it has made all the difference in how long the shampoo lasts.</li>
            <li> I just received my 2nd bottle and will continue to use this shampoo for as long as i can.</li>
            <li> shampoo bottle is bit low quality for the price of the shampoo but that just minor detail.  </li>
            <li> I just received my second bottle of Pura d&#x27;or and will continue to use it as long as I am seeing results!</li>
            <li> After a few months, I noticed a lot of new baby hairs growing in.</li>
            <li> I find I have to wash my hair less frequently with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> it left my hair feeling a bit dry.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for nearly 2 weeks now &amp; noticed less hair fall ..&lt;</li>
            <li> Will report back on dry scalp, with hopes it will fully eradicated.</li>
            <li> Even after my first few uses of this shampoo I noticed less shedding.</li>
            <li> Even after my first few uses of this shampoo I noticed less shedding.</li>
            <li> Completely eliminated dandruff used only 2 to 3 times a week, and a little goes a long way, so one bottle, although not inexpensive, goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo after tried several other brands, finally find one thing could save my hair.</li>
            <li> it is also very concentrated in that you only need a very small amount to fully lather your hair.</li>
            <li> The itchies come back a little after that, but in that respect, it&#x27;s on the same level as Selsun Blue.</li>
            <li> I will continue using it and hopefully give another review on the results of long term use.</li>
            <li> I was so happyÔºÅHowever, it smells strange.</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After having a life long problem with dandruff</li>
            <li> and I have had a life long problem with flakes</li>
            <li> It helped my dandruff but not completely.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know about the long term effects yet.</li>
            <li> I do however sometimes run a tiny squirt of argan oil through wet hair with my fingers, about once every 5 days or so.</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sad to say the flakes and scales are back in full force.</li>
            <li> The only scary sounding ingredients include mild surfactants both derived from coconut oil (giving the shampoo its soapy quality), and phenoxyethanol--a chemical</li>
            <li> If you have medium to long hair do yourself a favor and skip it my hair is so dry it looks damaged.  </li>
            <li> None of the other brands worked even after extensive use.</li>
            <li> I look forward to using this for a long time!</li>
            <li> , It may be a little more expensive than others but it lives up to its promise.</li>
            <li> so long my scalp hasn&#x27;t had a chance to breathe!</li>
            <li> It is different from the other shampoo I have used.</li>
            <li> The smell is not quite similar as other products and it helps me to prevent my hair loss.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this shampoo for as long as I can!</li>
            <li> I bought this item after reading other reviews that this is the only organic shampoo that works wonders on your dandruff.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily or greasy and provides some extra volume that I don&#x27;t get from other shampoos.  </li>
            <li> For years I used Head and Shoulders...and still suffered from a dry itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li> I suffered from dry, itchy, flaky scalp and seborrhiec dermatitis.</li>
            <li> I have (or now I can say had) terribly dry scalp.</li>
            <li> However it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair at all.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from dry scalp/dandruff for 15 years</li>
            <li> It had a silky texture to it even after it was dry.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel dry or brittle.</li>
            <li> it leaves scalp somehow dry.</li>
            <li> However, I have always suffered from dandruff and dry, itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> It cleans well &amp; doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair or my scalp.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son because in the winter his scalp gets really dry and flaky.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely dry hair</li>
            <li> I still use conditioner, in part because after shampooing, my hair feels dry.  </li>
            <li> Dry scalp be gone and amen to that</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s the power of belief, but I seriously feel like I stopped loosing as much hair.  </li>
            <li> I tried everything to make this \\&quot;golden\\&quot; bottle of shampoo work for me - I left it on for 2 minutes, then 5 minutes, I put it on and then quickly rinsed it out - all with the same disappointing results.</li>
            <li> So far, after using this product, I have had no dandruff and very little itchiness.  </li>
            <li> I would borrow expensive shampoos from friends and try on various different shampoos, but none of them really worked in stopping my dreaded hairfall.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The results were not great after the first wash but things improved after couple of washes.</li>
            <li> and I felt I had nothing to loose.</li>
            <li> I have been using PM Tea Tree Oil Shampoo for 10 years and have developed fairly serious dandruff and a constant itchy head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical about big claims from products, especially ones I haven&#x27;t heard of but this product did EXACTLY what it says it will, after 3 washes with this shampoo I noticed less flakes and within a week my scalp felt cooler, almost like I&#x27;ve had a layer of dry skin there</li>
            <li> For some reason makes my hair really dry, even after using moisturizing conditioner!</li>
            <li> Only been used it fro less than a month.  </li>
            <li> am actually looking to give away 3/4 of a liter of my previous shampoo which for a cheapskate like me is saying something.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so moisturizing for a shampoo and have definitely noticed less hair falling out in the shower.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo as an upgrade from the typical store brands such as head and shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have noticed less hair in the drain post shower, will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for someone with a serious case of flakes.</li>
            <li> Not only did it dry out my hair, it dried and irritated my scalp.</li>
            <li> Over the past three years I have slowly transitioned from the cheapest, most horrid Garnier products, to expensive salon brands, and now to natural and organic hair care.</li>
            <li> And you only need to use a little bit at a time.</li>
            <li> I went to a dermatologist and they told me there was little I could do as my hair loss was likely hereditary.</li>
            <li> I only get a little bit.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t over dry like other dandruff shampoos</li>
            <li> I&#x60;ve had a hard time finding a product that is all natural with no sulfates.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair greasier, itching more, and the flaking is outrageously bad.</li>
            <li> it is expensive but you definitely feel this is gentle to your hair and sculp</li>
            <li> I have tried Selsun Blue (it dried out my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying different products and wasted hundreds of dollars for those &amp;#34;miracle shampoos&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I was curious about the shampoo</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times and my flakes are gone.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely no point in keeping it.</li>
            <li> I have been loosing my hair for years and spent thousands of dollars on hair loss products, treatments, and even medication.  </li>
            <li> But finding a shampoo that worked was harder than expected.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter, who is blessed with thick blonde hair but her scalp is itchy and flaky.</li>
            <li> These other names actually don&#x27;t work even a LITTLE for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that head and shoulders makes the dermatitis on my face worse and that selsun blue has a similar, but less extreme, effect that is manageable if I use it only once a week.  </li>
            <li> so I need less of the Pura, and has made the little bottle last over 7 months!</li>
            <li> so I need less of the Pura, and has made the little bottle last over 7 months!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely strip my hair like other shampoos then leave residue behind resulting in flat weighted down hair.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately did not work for me - scalp still dry - no change in hair texture, very dissapointed</li>
            <li> I have an extremely dry scalp and after using this product just one time my scalp didn&#x27;t itch or feel tight.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read other reviews that it doesn&#x27;t lather at all</li>
            <li> like I used to with other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products before but they never showed any results.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I have a bottle to get rid of now</li>
            <li> First off, I ordered the wrong version of this organic shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I suggest this shampoo since it does to harm to hair there is a chance to decrease hair loss if the reason of hair loss is harmful materials that is used other than genetics.</li>
            <li> The reason why I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 is due to two factors.</li>
            <li> dermatologists i&#x27;ve consulted in the past have been unsuccessful to find treatment that works for my mysterious scalp issue.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even bother writing this review, other than the fact that this change has RUINED this product.</li>
            <li> Havent bought any other shampoo since</li>
            <li> My this issue I have with any other anti-dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> Due to improper maintenance and climatic conditions</li>
            <li> Pump is an added benefit when your hand are wet!</li>
            <li> LATH ER DUE</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am a believer in argan oil and am going to try other products.  </li>
            <li> doing other things - ai</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also works well on my dandruff, even when my scalp stopped responding to other products.  </li>
            <li> For the past several years, I&#x27;ve been looking for a shampoo that I can use as often as I want without irritation.  </li>
            <li> I usually wash every other day, but sometimes need a daily wash because of swimming or exercising.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was faster than what I had expected!</li>
            <li> My hair is softer, lighter-feeling, and shinier than ever after ditching conditioner and using this stuff, washing every other day or so.</li>
            <li> it looked very pink after her showers.</li>
            <li> While she is willing to following the instructions and leave it on her scalp for 2 minutes she said it was very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I will use it until it is gone but will not be buying it again unless they make it in a citrus sent, or at least something other than gross.</li>
            <li> The smell is not like other chemical shampoo, maybe less frangrance.</li>
            <li> Also, does not sud, like one would expect, which makes it hard to tell if the entire head has been covered.</li>
            <li> Just not worth the money.</li>
            <li> and I can start wearing dark shirts again without having to check all the time for flakes on my shirt.  </li>
            <li> but I had already tried them with no success.</li>
            <li> I also had thick yellow buildup and my  scalp would smell.</li>
            <li> I have struggled all my life with terrible dry scalp (dermatologist says it&#x27;s not dandruff, but some kind of psoriasis.)  </li>
            <li> It has alcohol on it the formula was changed not buying it anymore thumbs down</li>
            <li> The pump did act up, if it was tightened all the way down, the shampoo would drizzle out.  </li>
            <li> However, it does weight down my hair a bit.  </li>
            <li> I hate having harsh chemicals in my hair that are found in many of the other over the counter shampoos.</li>
            <li> So it may not completely remove other people&#x27;s psoriasis but at least it helped me reduce it.</li>
            <li> Shampoo seems to help with dry skin but not a magic worker.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this every other day for a few weeks, and have already started to see an improvement.</li>
            <li> Then I decided to not wash my hair everyday and use Pura every other day - no dice.</li>
            <li> but then I began washing my hair twice, using less shampoo each time.</li>
            <li> Less falling hair.  </li>
            <li> the roots feel stronger, and I notice my scalp gets waaay less oily during the day.</li>
            <li> I have less freeze</li>
            <li> the roots feel stronger, and I notice my scalp gets waaay less oily during the day.</li>
            <li> The hair I dropped on the sink is less than before.</li>
            <li> My scalp itches less now.</li>
            <li> I bought the shampoo less than a week ago.</li>
            <li> I get less shedding.</li>
            <li> I am in my 70s and use it daily on my face, neck and hair and no longer have to purchase expensive facial products.</li>
            <li> I have less than half the bottle remaining, if anything changes, I would update my review.</li>
            <li> After one use, my bf&#x27;s psoriasis also improved resulting in softer and less scaley skin.  </li>
            <li> and I have seen a slight change in hair loss.</li>
            <li> My scalp feels less irritated and there&#x27;s less flakes with the occasion head scratch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for one month and a half.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the extremely high ratings..</li>
            <li> I have used it few times and already noticed less itch.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using this shampoo, I noticed less hair falling out in the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a bad run in with dandruff recently and over my past week of use, I&#x27;m really noticing a difference.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo for my little brother who&#x27;s a teenager and has dandruff</li>
            <li> A little pricey at $20 per bottle.</li>
            <li> However, when I get the product, the shampoo leak out for a little bit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a shampoo that is organic and not full of harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant on the number of reviews, but the percentage of +ve reviews got me buying this shampoo.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been using it for a little over a month, so if it was going to work</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for 2 weeks and noticed that my dandruff started clearing up a little.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other benefits is that is actually less expensive than the PM and smells much cleaner and not kind of perfumey like the other.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me and completely dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> so I have used it myself a few times.</li>
            <li> This stuff made my limp hair fuller.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend was using head &amp; shoulders for years, but recently his dandruff kept getting worse.</li>
            <li> it will cure it in a few weeks if you use it every day it work faster .</li>
            <li> It takes a few days for the shampoo to take</li>
            <li> I do recommend this product for everyday use.</li>
            <li> but it also does not contain the harsh chemicals of pharmacy/OCT brands.</li>
            <li> I still have to wash my hair everyday otherwise my scalp start to itch.</li>
            <li> Have been using for a few weeks now.  </li>
            <li> Before using this product I noticed that every morning I would leave dead hair on my pillow.</li>
            <li> After just one week of using Pura d&#x27;or, I noticed that the dead hair on the pillow had stop.</li>
            <li> It feels sort of heavy on my scalp</li>
            <li> Nor does it not leave any weird residue like some organic or natural shampoos do.</li>
            <li> Anyways, I&#x27;ve tried everything from shaving my head and lotioning it to using the harsh dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li> I wanted to move away from using harsh chemicals</li>
            <li> It dried out my hair &amp; irritated both of our scalps.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel heavy.</li>
            <li> With my eyelids being involved, that was not a comfortable option for me.</li>
            <li> I noticed no more dandruff and less hair loss.</li>
            <li> My hair is hydrated and the itching I was experiencing with the previous shampoo is gone!</li>
            <li> If he doesn&#x27;t shampoo his hair for 3 days or if he uses other shampoos the dandruff starts to come back, so unfortunately he now has to depend on this product, but it does work.</li>
            <li> While it did help a lot initially, my psoriasis (on a small area on my scalp) is now approximately 50% gone.</li>
            <li> I tried three different generic/common brands of shampoos before I seriously contemplated trying a serious dandruff treatment.</li>
            <li> Too bad it costs so much.</li>
            <li> It was really gross and it felt wrong to put that in my hair.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is working yet.</li>
            <li> No more dandruff.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks, and it seems to be working well!</li>
            <li> I was in trouble with the dandruff for months!</li>
            <li> so I was skeptical about it actually working as I&#x27;ve tried them all and not to mention being organic which I&#x27;ve never used a shampoo that was organic.  </li>
            <li> I use a small squirt of a Pura D&#x27;Or conditioner on the ends after washing to keep frizzing to a minimum.</li>
            <li> I used to have a horrible hair loss for many years...</li>
            <li> No more dandruff and hair loss.</li>
            <li> So if your priority is a thicker scalp due to thin hair then this product can be for you.</li>
            <li> the smell isn&#x27;t bad at all and the bottle size is decent.</li>
            <li> After using them, and with conditioner, my hair goes back to its flaky dry self immediately after wash and dry :&#x27;(  </li>
            <li> If you have any problems with hair loss or thinning as a man I highly recommend giving this product a try you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It was thick and hard to pump.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bad dandruff since I was 6 years old, and I&#x27;ve used every product imaginable.</li>
            <li> Another complaint I had was the consistency of the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Will recommend to friend at least.</li>
            <li> I used to lose hair after each shower, I am so afraid to lose all my hair until I finally find this saver!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;He&#x27;s still using it because at least it&#x27;s not hurting his scalp</li>
            <li> , after a couple months I can say that this shampoo does not work to prevent dandruff (at least for me).</li>
            <li> Thick, gooey, and slimy.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this shampoo if you have thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Work well with thescapmaster brush for thick hair.</li>
            <li> and I noticed that around six months ago, they started slowly sliding off my head.</li>
            <li> Bought this shampoo and was a little skeptical of the claims but thought I&#x27;d try it anyway.</li>
            <li> Although I was a little skeptical about it, but after reading the reviews online I thought of giving it a try.</li>
            <li> and the price of the product is a little expensive.</li>
            <li> My dandruff got really bad recently</li>
            <li> : It is expensive for 16 fl.oz - needed to buy every few weeks.</li>
            <li> It is no good, I will never buy anymore.</li>
            <li> An area which was particularly bad, and where my hair was starting to thin, is now healing and the hair is growing in again.</li>
            <li> It produces very little lather, making it difficult to work into all your hair without using tons of shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I still have some dry patches but they aren&#x27;t as bad as they had been a month ago.</li>
            <li> I was shocked because I use another dry scalp shampoo and still couldn&#x27;t get rid of the rash.</li>
            <li> The flakiness and itchiness of my scalp has gotten SO much worse, this product has done nothing to help it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo made my dandruff so so so much worse than it was before.</li>
            <li> I used to have irritating scalp and flakes.</li>
            <li> I have thin falling hair and now its growing.  </li>
            <li> My dandruff has decreased to the point my hair is not shredding flakes when I comb my hair.</li>
            <li> Areas that was thin are also growing helathier.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Especially if you have thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My hair started thinning a few years ago and I was desperate to stop my hair loss.</li>
            <li> Seborrheic dermatitis symptoms got worse after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have naturally thin hair</li>
            <li> I hate chemicals and all that other stuff that companies put in their products.</li>
            <li> I hate to admit that I lived like this for almost half a year.</li>
            <li> and I was skeptical</li>
            <li> I have seborrheic dermatitis, not just in my scalp, but on my face too unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> you know because people tend to over rate expensive products.</li>
            <li> This is an expensive shampoo.</li>
            <li> I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical on this product</li>
            <li> When I read reviews, I was really skeptical of the smell</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product didn&#x27;t help me.</li>
            <li> I have a number of problems with my hair and scalp (unfortunately), including psoriasis, eczema, and postpartum hair loss.</li>
            <li> It is quite expensive for me to repurchase again.</li>
            <li> I did my research before ordering this product because of the price and also because I didnt want to spoil my hair with anything fake.</li>
            <li> so I was skeptical about trying something</li>
            <li> Well, it hurt to jump because it cost like $40, which was about six-eight times as expensive as Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li> Expensive, bit replaces conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> Sorry...</li>
            <li> I just randomly happened across this stuff... wasn&#x27;t even looking to buy shampoo that day,  but it caught my eye</li>
            <li> 100x easier than silly shampoo lids.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has dried my hair out terribly and caused my scalp to crack and bleed in places.</li>
            <li> what a waste of $20, very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sorry I did!  </li>
            <li> Its that bad.</li>
            <li> I suffer from really bad oily hair and after using this organic based anti dandruff shampoo helps a lot.</li>
            <li> so I figured it might be bad for my scalp as well.</li>
            <li> For some reason i dont know why it makes me have dandruff really bad..</li>
            <li> and i like the fact that it doesnt have any bad ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> So bad, I just threw it away.</li>
            <li> It smells like they tried to duplicate Aveda but failed miserably.  </li>
            <li> It make it worseeee :(</li>
            <li> Still have very bad dandruff and hair falling out</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It really helps. My wife&#x27;s hair issue is better now.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo.  Finally something that works without all the harmful chemicals!</li>
            <li> It has alcohol on it the formula was changed not buying it anymore thumbs down</li>
            <li> The item is very good, i like it. i will buy more again.</li>
            <li> I suffer from eczema and was in need of an SLS Free shampoo. The Pura d&#x27;or brand being all organic/natural ingredients was something I couldn&#x27;t pass up trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was a bit daunting yet after using it for a while, it&#x27;s well worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aroma is a bit strong at first but I quickly got used to it and actually really like it now. The scent lessens after an hour or so after you shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read other reviews that it doesn&#x27;t lather at all and I had that issue at first but then I began washing my hair twice, using less shampoo each time. The first wash removes the oil from your hair and then the second is able to penetrate and lathers better than my old SLS shampoo. The feeling on my scalp was so much better also and the after effect was amazing. My scaling, itching and sores have decreased significantly and lessen every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would recommend this shampoo to anyone that has scalp issues or problems with SLS (sulfates).</li>
            <li> as another review suggested this product when used with nizoral 1% antidandruff also available on Amazon is a good combination. You use the nizoral every 3 days and this product on the off days and the combination does an excellent job of controlling flakes. I have tried various other products over the counter and have not had success in 16 years. this combo has done well eliminating flakes!</li>
            <li> I have been using Pura d&#x27;or Anti-dandruff Shampoo for 2 months and my hair is free of dandruff. I&#x27;ve tried many other shampoos but I was not satisfied. Since i started using Pura d&#x27;or my hair is 100% free of dandruff. I would recommend it to anyone. All Pura d&#x27;or products are great and what I like best about them is that they are organic.</li>
            <li> Got this shampoo for my father who is bed bound and has a terrible problem with dandruff. It works like a charm. And you only need to use a little bit at a time. It is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Great Shampoo!  Nice smell, and one bottle last a really long time.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes when ordering this product.  Suffered from occasional flaky and itchiness , and hoped I could use this to help.  Well, after a month of continual use (I normally shampoo 2-3 times a week, otherwise hair gets too frizzy), I&#x27;m throwing in the towel.  The flakiness and itchiness of my scalp has gotten SO much worse, this product has done nothing to help it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not doing that much magic on my hair.</li>
            <li> Great product! I naturally have oily scalp/hair along with dandruff and need to wash my hair every other day not to mention that my hair becomes severely oily after 36 hours. After using this product, my hair needs to be washed after 72 hours and my dandruff itch has drastically reduced. I don&#x27;t know how much difference it has made on my flakes but it definitely helps the itch (hence the four stars). Hopefully after using it longer, the dandruff will fade as well. However, strictly speaking for the oily aspect, this is the best I have used!</li>
            <li> I&#x60;ve had a hard time finding a product that is all natural with no sulfates. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> A truly excellent experience. I tried three different generic/common brands of shampoos before I seriously contemplated trying a serious dandruff treatment. Therefore, I did some research and came across this product. The first time I tried it, I was very pleasantly surprised as it showed results. None of the other brands worked even after extensive use. Pura d&#x27;Or product was almost instantaneous. Highly recommended for someone with a serious case of flakes.</li>
            <li> Has a nice presentation, smells good but in my case It did not work as well as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Worked about a 55% reducing dandruff flakes.&lt;br /&gt;Expensive for what it claims.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product, my hair use to be full of body and thick in my 20 &amp; 30. In my 40 I realize my hair has gotten thinner and lifeless. I have been searching for shampoo product to bring my hair back to life. I saw this product on Instagram and I was skeptical But I been trying out product that cost me more money and I felt I had nothing to loose. So I tried it, Its been a week of use and my hair is shiner fuller and feels thicker. I love it and I found my shampoo for life.</li>
            <li> Well, I like the fact it&#x27;s such a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; product‚Ä¶ but, damn, I smell like a tree.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a good organic shampoo for a long time. For now, my search stops at Pura products. Perfect for my hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now used the product for 5-6 times and the results are really visible.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It really works!</li>
            <li> Smells great almost like fresh cedar, it doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair or scalp though but I love that it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li> AMAZING ORGANIC Shampoo!</li>
            <li> This shampoo made my dandruff so so so much worse than it was before. I had high hopes for this shampoo based on the other reviews here, but it definitely didn&#x27;t work for me. From the first wash I noticed the dandruff that would fall on my clothing was much greater than it had ever been before. My scalp was so flaky, my shoulders were covered in white flakes. It&#x27;s so embarrassing! I used this shampoo for about 3 weeks hoping that it would improve but it definitely didn&#x27;t. I ended up returning mine. Another complaint I had was the consistency of the shampoo. It was thick and hard to pump. The consistency was like snot. Thick, gooey, and slimy. It was really gross and it felt wrong to put that in my hair.</li>
            <li> i have used this product and must say it works big time..Better than Head &#x27;n Shoulders and it is all organic and natural! No chemicals! No side effects...so if you really care about your hair than go for it because its worth every penny u spend</li>
            <li> I love this produce. It very help your scalp itching and dandruff. My whole family use this shampoo. Our kids love it a lot. Thanks for make this shampoo. I recommend this produce</li>
            <li> Finally found something that brought relief to my flaky scalp. The results were not great after the first wash but things improved after couple of washes. The dandruff is not totally gone but hope it would be soon. The hair feel soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> I had my hopes up because of all the good reviews on here, and with the high price I figured it must contain only the purest ingredients (and it very well may, I don&#x27;t know) but it sure didn&#x27;t help me as much as I expected.  I&#x27;ve tried several shampoos to fight the flakes and itching.  I ditched the H &amp;S a couple years ago when learning about that sulfide junk or whatever it&#x27;s called that they use.  I tried the pine tar shampoos (they stink but work pretty well) I tried a Neem shampoo/conditioner I got here on Amazon, it worked about as well as this Pura d&#x27;or did, not horrible but not as good as the one I just ordered a refill of yesterday by just naturals.  I&#x27;ve been using the just naturals vinegar rinse for dandruff and that stuff works AWESOME, regardless of the shampoo/conditioner I use it with... Their shampoo/conditioner isn&#x27;t perfect, which is why I&#x27;ve been trying a couple other brands, but now I know that I&#x27;m just wasting money and time and I&#x27;m going back to JN.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, that&#x27;s my real-life 2 cents using pura d&#x27;or shampoo + their conditioner for about a month now.  Won&#x27;t buy again.  Actually I&#x27;ll sell my half-used bottles to anyone who does want to try it!</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this shampoo and I notice I don&#x27;t need as much to make it lather unlike my last shampoo.  Also like that it comes with a pump so it saves on over usage.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is fantastic and I use it daily. It lathers very well,rinses quickly; the shampoo leaves my hair soft and manageable. This is the go to shampoo if you want to get rid of your dandruff! I recommend this product over all the anti-dandruff shampoo brands out there.</li>
            <li> I have seborrheic dermatitis, not just in my scalp, but on my face too unfortunately.  I&#x27;ve noticed that head and shoulders makes the dermatitis on my face worse and that selsun blue has a similar, but less extreme, effect that is manageable if I use it only once a week.  I thought I&#x27;d try this as an alternative to control my dandruff in the hopes that I wouldn&#x27;t have any facial dermatitis issues with it.  I&#x27;ve tried it 5 times now, every 2 nights.  It feels good on my scalp, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s helped my dandruff, still lots of flakes and scalp is dry.  Also, it has exacerbated the dermatitis(perhaps I&#x27;m using it too often?) on my face so I&#x27;ll be discontinuing using it from now on.  I&#x27;m returning to selsun blue once a week that results in a better scalp but some minor side effects of dermatitis on the face that are manageable.</li>
            <li> I find I have to wash my hair less frequently with this shampoo.  I can go 2 days without washing my hair which is awesome with toddler twins, but I HATE the smell.  I asked my husband to get a second opinion and he said that it smells like antiseptic.  It smells like they tried to duplicate Aveda but failed miserably.  I will use it until it is gone but will not be buying it again unless they make it in a citrus sent, or at least something other than gross.</li>
            <li> Really good dandruff shampoo with the benefit of argon oil</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Of course it worked for majority of people except me. Still have very bad dandruff and hair falling out</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the BEST dandruff shampoo in the world.  For years I used Head and Shoulders...and still suffered from a dry itchy scalp.  From the very first use I could feel and see a huge difference in my hair and scalp.  I am so thankful for this product!  I am no longer scratching my head...and I love how clean and fresh this leaves my hair.</li>
            <li> It is simple... This shampoo really helps. I really needed something that would clean my dandruff and at the same time to be natural. It is organic which makes it good for your health...no chemicals. The nature takes care for you.</li>
            <li> I suffer from seborrheic dermatitis and had used another shampoo for many years.  I read some reviews about this shampoo and thought  I would try it!  I&#x27;m so sorry I did!  This shampoo has dried my hair out terribly and caused my scalp to crack and bleed in places.</li>
            <li> Great product and LOVE that it&#x27;s \\&quot;green.\\&quot;  Well worth the purchase to rid yourself of dandruff issues.  This summer&#x27;s heat has created hair problems even for those who can still keep weekly salon appointments, so this shampoo will certainly aid in the elimination of dandruff.    GREAT PRICE  -Compared to high-end European products  -Saves on constant grocery store visits for less effective products  -Established salons probably won&#x27;t sell you anything comparable for a lower price.  It&#x27;s too easy to mark-up their own products!    PRODUCT LINE  -A full line of beauty products  -Organic and good for the whole family  -No need to look for fine print.  It works!</li>
            <li> Works great and fast shippers</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;Pura\\&quot; shampoo really does what it says! It&#x27;s the first product ever to work for me!! I used to have irritating scalp and flakes. After around 4 days of continual usage, irritation is gone and the flakes, i&#x27;d say, are reduced to minimum. it has a very refreshing smell too!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 months now and just purchased my 2nd bottle. This product really changed the texture of my hair! My hair feels so soft since using it and I love how this product is all natural. I have noticed a huge decrease in how quickly my hair gets oily and decrease in my itchy scalp. I look forward to using this for a long time!</li>
            <li> Leaves hair very heavy/greasy.</li>
            <li> No improvement.  Also, does not sud, like one would expect, which makes it hard to tell if the entire head has been covered.</li>
            <li> Great Product, Great Service</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!  The pump did act up, if it was tightened all the way down, the shampoo would drizzle out.  I just adjusted it so it was not totally on tight.  The shampoo was nice!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it. Hope it works</li>
            <li> I suffered from dry, itchy, flaky scalp and seborrhiec dermatitis. After two uses, this product has soothed my sores and irritation and made my scalp flake-free. I highly recommend this product. Update: I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now and I&#x27;m sad to say the flakes and scales are back in full force. Still great on hair though.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  It leaves my hair clean and I don&#x27;t get an itchy head like I used to with other shampoos.</li>
            <li> Smells good.. Helps alleviate dandruff but didnt eliminate...</li>
            <li> For some reason makes my hair really dry, even after using moisturizing conditioner!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but this stuff is awesome! My hair is cleaner than it ever has been after a wash!</li>
            <li> Organic and magic? I was skeptical about the extremely high ratings.. you know because people tend to over rate expensive products. Let&#x27;s not lie. This is an expensive shampoo. Is it worth it? Hell yes!  I have (or now I can say had) terribly dry scalp. In class, people stare at me. Its that bad. And my flakes are huge and some are so fine they stick out and make my hair look like its just filled with white dust. Disgusting. I hate to admit that I lived like this for almost half a year. I have tried Selsun Blue (it dried out my hair even the moisturizer one) and Head and Shoulders ( I don&#x27;t need to tell most people why this shampoo is just the worse) These other names actually don&#x27;t work even a LITTLE for me. After using them, and with conditioner, my hair goes back to its flaky dry self immediately after wash and dry :&#x27;(  Now about this product, I purchased it, used it ONCE... Done. My scalp healed itself like magic. And just to see how powerful this stuff is I didn&#x27;t use anything on my hair for 3 days and I still see nothing but a healthy scalp.. So, I&#x27;m never going back. And the fragrance of this shampoo is just wonderful. If you know what tea tree oil smells like, yeah that pretty much is the idea. 5 stars :)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me and completely dried out my hair. If you have medium to long hair do yourself a favor and skip it my hair is so dry it looks damaged.  However,  my husband kept it because it did work for him.</li>
            <li> Excellent results for both my husband&#x27;s and my fine hair.  Leaves the scalp very clean, is gentle and provides body for our hair type.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Awesome shampoo...At first it doesn&#x27;t seem to work but after two weeks it really works!!!! Everyone&#x27;s hair is different, keep that in mind!</li>
            <li> It is overpriced and doesn&#x27;t work.  I bought this stuff because I wanted to get away from head and shoulders and be more natural.  This stuff was supposed to do that.  Instead I think that it contributed to my dandruff.  For the price that I paid I expected results that were at least half as good as head and shoulders.  I won&#x27;t purchase again.  Plus I don&#x27;t like the smell of patchouli.</li>
            <li> After 1 use my partner went from out of control dandruff to zero, I swear. If he doesn&#x27;t shampoo his hair for 3 days or if he uses other shampoos the dandruff starts to come back, so unfortunately he now has to depend on this product, but it does work. It also smells nice and natural, and it leaves his long hair soft so he doesn&#x27;t have to use conditioner.</li>
            <li> Pro: It prevents my daughter&#x27;s dranruff issue&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It is expensive for 16 fl.oz - needed to buy every few weeks.</li>
            <li> I was concerned at first that even though it says it&#x27;s sulfate free it still lathers quite a bit. However it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair at all. It seems to controlling my dry scalp pretty well too. It still gets a little flakey in extreme weather but for the most part it works great!</li>
            <li> Lathers well, decent scent, gets hair clean and seems to have helped with some scalp issues I was having.</li>
            <li> I Love the way it Works! Thanks</li>
            <li> This works miracle.  Less falling hair.  I never doubted it would work basing on the reviews.  I have thin falling hair and now its growing.  Only been used it fro less than a month.  The whole bottle is very economical plus the fact that i shampoo everyday.  Thnak you!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this shampoo and was a little skeptical of the claims but thought I&#x27;d try it anyway. I am now a believer after using it for a month. It actually works. I&#x27;ve used all the cheaper shampoos and none of them really cut down on the dandruff. This one does. I no longer have those embarrassing white flakes on my shoulders and back., It may be a little more expensive than others but it lives up to its promise. I&#x27;ll be using this from now on.</li>
            <li> I suffer from really bad oily hair and after using this organic based anti dandruff shampoo helps a lot. My dandruff has decreased to the point my hair is not shredding flakes when I comb my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing shampoo I have ever tried! It makes your hair beautiful and looks as if it had been washed in a salon! My hair is so much easier to straighten and blow dry and sits much better for much longer! I will definitely be buying this again! Oh and it smells nice too.</li>
            <li> I straighten and use a lot of product on my hair. Also I spend a lot of time blow drying. I&#x27;ve searched and have used a lot of har shampoo and conditioners and this shampoo is one of my favorites. The Argan Oil is an amazing moisturizer for your hair and at this price you can&#x27;t beat it! Definitely a recommended buy.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this shampoo if you have thick hair.  It produces very little lather, making it difficult to work into all your hair without using tons of shampoo.  After washing and drying my hair I&#x27;m finding greasy spots that I guess didn&#x27;t get enough shampoo.  I realize it&#x27;s because this shampoo lacks the chemicals that produce lather, but for the price and how much I have to use it will not be sustainable hair care for me.  After one week of use dandruff control seems slightly better than other tea tree shampoos I&#x27;ve tried, if the price was lower it might be worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been using PM Tea Tree Oil Shampoo for 10 years and have developed fairly serious dandruff and a constant itchy head. I have tried alternating leading brand dandruff shampoos but to no avail. I bought this shampoo two weeks ago to see if it was the Sodium Lauryl Sulfate and Sodium Laureth Sulfate that are ingredient #2 &amp; 3 in the PM shampoo. I had recently switched to toothpaste without those ingredients and it has solved a lot of oral issues I was having so I figured it might be bad for my scalp as well. After using Pura D&#x27;or for these two weeks my dandruff has definitely gotten better and my head is much less itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other benefits is that is actually less expensive than the PM and smells much cleaner and not kind of perfumey like the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am actually looking to give away 3/4 of a liter of my previous shampoo which for a cheapskate like me is saying something.</li>
            <li> This is the first product that 100% got rid of my dandruff. I have suffered from dry scalp/dandruff for 15 years and now I don&#x27;t have to be embarrassed of my hair in public anymore. I have tried other products before but they never showed any results. Thank you so much Pura D&#x27;or!!</li>
            <li> Like it! It is the second time to buy it. Will continue using it.</li>
            <li> works good but smells like medicine to me, not unpleasant but definitely medicinal</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo. Eliminated my dandruff. Makes my scalp feel clean. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> Although I love the idea, and it does leave my hair feeling nice this really does not help with my dandruff problem at all which is the whole reason I bought it. Just not worth the money.</li>
            <li> it does relieve the itching and flaking on the first day, but because everything is organic, it isnt as aggressive as it probably should be. after just one day, my skin dries up and my hair gets really oily already. great smell and bottle, but i wouldnt use it again as a solution.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is working yet. Does not suds up much. Smell is not too good but not bad. I don&#x27;t see any significant results yet after using it for three months.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical on this product but I decided to try it anyway. I could not be happier. I used this shampoo for almost 4 weeks now, and my hair had begun thinning and it looks  fuller and filled. For me its working, i might considering buying another 1 soon! Great!</li>
            <li> I have had dandruff since I was a kid and have tried head and shoulders, selsum blue, etc and even with 2 washes a day still had flakes, With pura dor I can have a normal wash every night and can go out wearing black without having to brush off my shoulders every 5 minutes, this product has made such an impact on my life, just wish I found it sooner.</li>
            <li> So far so good!  My husband noticed an immediate improvement on his dandruff which had been plaguing him forever. There were no longer any big flakes of dandruff and almost NO dandruff fell when he scratched his head vigorously to demonstrate. He is looking forward to washing his hair a second time and hoping for NO dandruff at all :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay at relieving itch, but didn&#x27;t get hair very clean - looked like it was greasy or had a residue.</li>
            <li> I really like it. It does solve my dandruff problem, and I noticed that my hair became soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who is dealing with an itchy, scaly head (and gobs of dandruff) caused by her allergies. She claims that it burns some. While she is willing to following the instructions and leave it on her scalp for 2 minutes she said it was very uncomfortable. After about 4-5 uses with no improvement I had her stop using it. It also seemed to inflame her scalp...it looked very pink after her showers. On the other hand, I have a bottle to get rid of now so I have used it myself a few times. It did not burn me at all. I assume it bothered her because of the condition her scalp was already in. Im not crazy about it though....it left my hair feeling a bit dry. The smell is strong, yes, and sticks around for hours and hours and hours. But I didn&#x27;t find it offensive....just kind of a minty clean smell. Im glad I got it on special.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product and its conditioner for over two weeks. All I noticed was an increase in dandruff flakes (even tho they are no smaller) and and increase in hair fall. Even on the car seat headrest there would be dandruff after getting up which is embarrassing. I gave it a two star tho because it smells nice and supposedly &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it as it maybe takes a super long time for results.</li>
            <li> First off, I love that this shampoo is organic. I hate having harsh chemicals in my hair that are found in many of the other over the counter shampoos. Second, the smell was amazing. I was pretty surprised by how good this shampoo smelled for being an organic product. Last of all, my hair was silky smooth after. This is my new go to high end shampoo.</li>
            <li> As I grew older, I had more and more problems with dandruff and dry scalp. I&#x27;ve been trying different products and wasted hundreds of dollars for those &amp;#34;miracle shampoos&amp;#34;. I was advised by a friend &amp;#34;to go organic&amp;#34;. I laughed. Two months later i was searching for an organic shampoo as I was fed up with testing out unproven products. I ended up buying Pura d&#x27;or. No problems ever since, I just hope the manufacturer never runs out of supplies.</li>
            <li> I was really fedup with my itching scalp. Inspite of trying different shampoos and natural products, nothing really worked. Then, a friend of mine suggested me to try Pura d‚Äôor shampoo. Although I was a little skeptical about it, but after reading the reviews online I thought of giving it a try. I used it for a week and could notice a lot of changes in my hair. The itching had reduced considerably and my hair really looked clean and shiny. Moreover, as it is an organic product so there are no chances of having any side-effects too. I would certainly recommend this product to all my friends who want relief from scalp flaking and itching.</li>
            <li> I found the shampoo to be the best of all dandruff and itchy scalp treatments compared to what I use daily: Paul Mitchell tea tree and head and shoulders soothing dandruff shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to anyone who desires to have a itch free head, it works. Smells great too.</li>
            <li> Our favorite shampoo. Smells fabulous. Leaves hair feeling squeaky clean, but not dried or frizzy. Too bad it costs so much.</li>
            <li> This stuff made my limp hair fuller. So far I love it.</li>
            <li> After years of using shelf brand anti dandruff shampoo, I&#x27;ve finally found one that works! And it leaves my scalp in better condition than before washing. After using the shampoo my head feels refreshed and the best part is the scent is not unpleasant or overpowering.</li>
            <li> unfortunately did not work for me - scalp still dry - no change in hair texture, very dissapointed</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo for my little brother who&#x27;s a teenager and has dandruff and it does help. It can be a bit strong on the hair itself so the ends get a bit dried by it. It&#x27;s not the most gentle product if you have fine dry hair but it does get rid of the itchy scalp and dandruff,. It feels natural and has a strong tea tree oil smell which I love.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical about big claims from products, especially ones I haven&#x27;t heard of but this product did EXACTLY what it says it will, after 3 washes with this shampoo I noticed less flakes and within a week my scalp felt cooler, almost like I&#x27;ve had a layer of dry skin there so long my scalp hasn&#x27;t had a chance to breathe! Since then my hair even looks more alive, try this product, its a good price and it really does work!</li>
            <li> Great Shampoo does what it advertises and will be buying again,shipping was a little slow but other than that great buy! :)</li>
            <li> This is an incredible product, all natural, including many natural products that benefit the scalp. Pura d&#x27;or organic shampoo smells great, and the size of bottle makes it cost efficient.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend was using head &amp; shoulders for years, but recently his dandruff kept getting worse. We decided to try a sulfate free shampoo &amp; this cleared it up in just a few days.</li>
            <li> Firstly, I don&#x27;t have thinning hair. But I do shed quite a bit. More so in recent years, so I decided to do something about it. I found Pura D&#x27;or and read all the good reviews about it, and decided to give it a try. Even after my first few uses of this shampoo I noticed less shedding. After ONE bottle of the shampoo, I shedding has completely stopped. I notice my hair is much more full, soft and flows in the wind. the roots feel stronger, and I notice my scalp gets waaay less oily during the day. The DHT blocker formula is awesome and keeps your hair growing strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the double shampoo method, and it has made all the difference in how long the shampoo lasts. I shampoo with cheapo shampoo once to cleanse my hair, rinse, and then use Pura D&#x27;or straight. I find this makes it so I need less of the Pura, and has made the little bottle last over 7 months!</li>
            <li> DOESN&#x27;T SMELL ALL THAT GOOD, BUT I THINK IT WORKS.</li>
            <li> I honestly saw value in this product and it did make my hair better.</li>
            <li> Great product with a great price tag, will definitely purchase again in the near future.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling great</li>
            <li> Leave it on for 2 minutes, wash. You can definitely feel the peppermint oil refresh your scalp, and the smell of lavender and thyme is delightful. Only use organic ingredients (but I don&#x27;t see a certified organic stamp on the back of the bottle) A little pricey at $20 per bottle. I&#x27;ll have to think about reordering. It depends oh how long this bottle will last me on this first time purchase.</li>
            <li> Hair feels great afterwards! Best dandruff shampoo that I have tried thus far.</li>
            <li> First off, I ordered the wrong version of this organic shampoo.  The bottles looked the same, I wanted the one which promotes&lt;br /&gt;hair growth.  I love that one, this anti-dandruff  shampoo doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft.</li>
            <li> One of the best products ive ever used. Pura d&#x27;or, it beyond the best brand. I will never use another brand.</li>
            <li> For some reason i dont know why it makes me have dandruff really bad..i do not have any dandruff before but now i have,flaky and itchy.i have been using it for more than a month along with the consitioner but it doesnt do any good to my hair. I hope &amp;#34;Pura d or&amp;#34;can answer me why this is happening..i give 1 star instead of nothing just because i know somehow it has organic content but it doesnt give any good to my hair..</li>
            <li> I heard a lot of hype about this shampoo and all the reviewers on here seemed to rave about it, so I gave it a try. This shampoo can make your hair so smooth but not greasy at all. Excellent! This product leaves my hair with no frizz and in the humidity it stays soft and shinny not brittle. I love it!!</li>
            <li> One of the best shampoos I used , I did not know that I have dandruff until I used Pura d&#x27;or Anti-dandruff I really recommend it for dandruff and damaged scalp it will cure it in a few weeks if you use it every day it work faster .</li>
            <li> This product is great. It helped my scalp.</li>
            <li> My friend told me about this product that she completely loves and told me I should try it. It&#x27;s been two weeks since I tried the shampoo and so far I am very happy with it. I have less freeze and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Smelled kinda nice though</li>
            <li> Very good shampoo. Feels great on the hair. I like it is organic and a big bottle! It smells good and does not make my hair nor my skin dry.</li>
            <li> It is no good, I will never buy anymore.</li>
            <li> This product is good, I like the smell of this product. After using this product, my hair seems smoother, lighter, and fuller that cover the spot. I really love this product.</li>
            <li> Pretty solid HL and dandruff shampoo. I usually mix this product with a basic dandruff shampoo like Clear or Head&amp;Shoulders and it works well to both clean my scalp and to leave my curly hair manageable. I have also realized that the bottle last quite a long time in relations to its size. Some has spoken about the pump mechanism and how it only releases a small amount of shampoo but as a guy I think it works really well to give you the right quantity. I wash every other day and have noticed good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will buy again.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff! Love it!</li>
            <li> Great item. My wife loves it. It helps increase volume but u need to keep using. Doesn&#x27;t work instantly.</li>
            <li> Before this product, i&#x27;ve been using products with chemicals and that weren&#x27;t treating my hair the way i wanted it to be treated. But after this product, im loving my hair!</li>
            <li> I suffer from psoriasis and frequently get dermatitis especially after hair colors.Since I have been using this shampoo my dermatitis episodes are rare and my scalp is healthier and free of dandruff. I recommend this shampoo to anyone suffering from this conditions. Great product performance!</li>
            <li> The shampoo did an okay job at relieving the itchy and flakiness of my scalp.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel soft and got rid of dandruff! Works as advertise. Love the product!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do much for me. not big fan of the smell either. I would say - just get either a tea-tree or peppermint essential oil and add it to you shampoo. Will probably be more effective.</li>
            <li> It takes a few days for the shampoo to take it&#x27;s full effect, but after about a week or so I saw that my hair had completely stopped falling out. WONDERFUL PRODUCT, would recommend to any middle aged woman with hair problems. It also made my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Firstly, I don&#x27;t have thinning hair. But I do shed quite a bit. More so in recent years, so I decided to do something about it. I found Pura D&#x27;or and read all the good reviews about it, and decided to give it a try. Even after my first few uses of this shampoo I noticed less shedding. After ONE bottle of the shampoo, I shedding has completely stopped. I notice my hair is much more full, soft and flows in the wind. the roots feel stronger, and I notice my scalp gets waaay less oily during the day. The DHT blocker formula is awesome and keeps your hair growing strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the double shampoo method, and it has made all the difference in how long the shampoo lasts. I shampoo with cheapo shampoo once to cleanse my hair, rinse, and then use Pura D&#x27;or straight. I find this makes it so I need less of the Pura, and has made the little bottle last over 7 months!</li>
            <li> controls itching than others , very good attempt!</li>
            <li> This product is quite good. It is different from the other shampoo I have used. It smells natural and did pretty good cleaning job. I do noticed some difference every morning in the bathroom. The hair I dropped on the sink is less than before. The scalp felt very comfortable and soothing after use. Unlike other product, which felt greasy after use, this product makes the hair very naturally cleaned. And for me, 3 times per weeks are perhaps enough to see a difference. I do recommend this product for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I just used it for the first time and to my surprise I immediately noticed a difference in the way my hair felt.  It had a silky texture to it even after it was dry.  I was really impressed.  I will continue using it and hopefully give another review on the results of long term use.</li>
            <li> Before I used this shampoo, a lot hair will drop when I clean my hair. But when I used this shampoo, almost no hair droped off. I was so happyÔºÅHowever, it smells strange.</li>
            <li> I very like this shampoo and use it every time. It smells good and makes my hair feel good.  its worth trying as its a nice shampoo.</li>
            <li> for the last few weeks i have been using \\&quot;Premium Organic Shampoo\\&quot;.i am happy with this product because it cleared my hair well.it performs better than  \\&quot;Head &#x27;n Shoulders\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product recently. It is one of the best shampoo that I have ever used. It gives a volume to hair. I feel very comfortable with this feeling. I can not comment on effect of hair loss for this product but it does not contain harmful material that harms to hair like known brands. It is fully organic and it affected my choice. I suggest this shampoo since it does to harm to hair there is a chance to decrease hair loss if the reason of hair loss is harmful materials that is used other than genetics.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great shampoo. Used it twice and I could see the difference in hair texture. It&#x27;s also helping me get rid of dandruff. It smells good. When I read reviews, I was really skeptical of the smell but it&#x27;s not bad at all. Definitely my new favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> Great product, smells great and feels tingly and light on my scalp. Not very lathery, but as its is sulfate free what can you expect. Great for rejuvenating hair after trying not to wash for a couple of days. I will be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo. It worked for me. This is really a nice shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 9 months and have noticed thicker hair, and new hair growing in. I love it.</li>
            <li> I notice increased hair growth since I started using this product. Areas that was thin are also growing helathier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks now and it seems pretty good.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clean your hair. Just leaves an oily residue.</li>
            <li> Smells great but more importantly works well as an anti dandruff shampoo. Is not quite as effective as say Selsun but it also does not contain the harsh chemicals of pharmacy/OCT brands. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> very good shampoo is my second bottle</li>
            <li> What a difference 4 weeks make. Amazing all natural-organic shampoo. Saved my decreasing hairline and hair texture. Must try!</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift for my husband and it really helped him take care of his dry scull.</li>
            <li> Great product noticed a difference after a couple if day&#x27;s. great product and as described. the smell isn&#x27;t bad at all and the bottle size is decent. will definitely continue using it :)</li>
            <li> This product is really amazing. Smells like some hair oil and i can see results right away. This shampoo is perfect for those having hair loss problem. Im 100% satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> the smell of this product is good, I like the smell. and it also the organic shampoo, it will be heath. However, when I get the product, the shampoo leak out for a little bit. and the price of the product is a little expensive. But everything is good.</li>
            <li> I have used it few times and already noticed less itch. No artificial perfume smell to it either!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is really good. It smells like herbal medicine which means this is a natural one to some extent. If you do some scalp massage when you use it, it works better. Anyway, it&#x27;s a good shampoo for me.</li>
            <li> THIS SHAMPOO IS THE BOMB!!!  My problem is finally under control.  No more dandruff.  Before I switched to this product, my scalp was irritated and hot, my hair was falling out and the dandruff was out of control.  I love it!  My only fear is that they will stop making it.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t listen to reviews about it not lathering.  It lathers plenty on the second wash.  And the complaints about the cost, well a bottle lasts about 3 months or so.  Small price to pay to have a healthy scalp -- and furthermore, new hair is growing in.  I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Have been using this shampoo for 2 weeks now and I feel the difference. My scalp itches less now.</li>
            <li> Love this product I bought it for myself for dandruff and to prevent hair loss. I noticed no more dandruff and less hair loss. My fianc√©e started using it as well and noticed his hair grew faster, thicker and fuller. It&#x27;s a little pricey but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Smells too much like patchouli, a smell that I find intolerable. I used it once and then threw it away.</li>
            <li> The absolute best shampoo I have ever tried!  It got rid of my dandruff!!!!!!!  I have tried many products in the past (all were non-organic) which did not work.  When I tried this organic shampoo I felt a difference on the first wash.  It keeps my hair free of dandruff and also makes it very soft!  I have also seen my hair grow more!</li>
            <li> I heard this shampoo from my friend.I think it would be great.  BTW,I would keep update.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks, and it seems to be working well!</li>
            <li> I heard of it through a popular website, and I&#x27;m glad that I finally find an organic shampoo which can prevent hair loss. I really hate to lost volumes of hair, and hope this product can do it job as promised!</li>
            <li> I have tried many products to treat dandruff and they only work for one or two days...this shampoo has constant results and it has being workinh</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t do reviews but this product was worth it. I had severe itching and flaking in the scalp area. I also had thick yellow buildup and my  scalp would smell. This shampoo was worth a try. It definitely relieved the itching to nothing in a matter of close to 8-10 washes. I waited to write my review to see if it would be effective or not. I would definitely recommend this product for those who want to avoid chemicals and keep it organic.</li>
            <li> I throughly enjoyed my experience with this not so typical scalp treatment shampoo. The smell is Devine and the results are nothing short of amazing!! It&#x27;s my go to product now always.</li>
            <li> This product does a great job keeping my daughter&#x27;s seborrheic dermatitis under control.  I love the smell of it and that it does not have the harsh chemicals that the other products we have used in the past have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from dandruff/sd/inflamed scalp since childhood and it seems as if I&#x27;ve tried absolutely every shampoo out there. The rare ones that offer some results usually dry my fine, wavy, color-treated, frizzy hair to no end. This shampoo yields results from the first use. Any inflamed patches on my scalp were soothed, and I noticed a difference in the amount of flakes immediately. The reason why I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 is due to two factors. The first is the price. (I&#x27;ve used this shampoo a total of 4 times and 1/3 of the bottle is gone. At $20 a bottle, it&#x27;ll get pricey). This shampoo is extremely moisturizing, which is great for frizzy hair like mine, however I am finding that it&#x27;s resulting in a little bit of product buildup. So if you do have oily or fine hair, you might want to take this into consideration before trying.</li>
            <li> Very bad and the texture was strange my dandruff became more and ichy</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot. It keeps my hair from falling out, and to me its worth price. I don&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Could see the difference in just one wash. Awesome product. I use it every third day (twice a week).</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo once and my hair was incredibly shiny once it dried. That is not what I purchased it for, but everyone who saw my hair noticed. My scalp had really been bothering me with the heat and humidity this summer.  I used it again this morning, and the itching is almost completely gone.  My scalp feels clean and like it is healing.  The shampoo smells like the ingredients listed; sort of minty and gender neutral.  I leave it on my scalp for longer than two minutes and t lathers well, especially since it does not have SLS.  I will definitely buy more when this bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> the shampoo is helping me at this time, but i suffer from SPORADIC severe scalp issue, that my scalp may develop resistance to many types of anti dandruff shampoo. dermatologists i&#x27;ve consulted in the past have been unsuccessful to find treatment that works for my mysterious scalp issue. some prescribed treatment may work for a time, but then will go back to square one, one day. i have given up seeing dermatologists with their prescriptions, since some of the basic anti dandruff have similar result in my case.</li>
            <li> This shampoo actually works for the most part.  I did not want to use something not organic (although this is not certified organic) and I was skeptical a more natural brand would work. Ive been using it for three weeks now and it made an immediate difference.  I would say 80% better.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this out since regular dandruff shampoos didn&#x27;t seem to be helping to clear up my dandruff issues. The smell is nice and I noticed fewer flakes, but it has not completely solved my dandruff problem. It does leave the hair feeling clean and not heavy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great--- smells like ginger.</li>
            <li> The smell is not quite similar as other products and it helps me to prevent my hair loss.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this shampoo after reading the reviews. i really thought that this would help my dandruff problem. I have been using for quite some time now, but I don&#x27;t see any changes. I love how my hair feels, but I still have the dandruff problem. Unfortunately, this product didn&#x27;t help me.</li>
            <li> I have a number of problems with my hair and scalp (unfortunately), including psoriasis, eczema, and postpartum hair loss. I normally use Pureology products, which have been helpful to improve to condition of my hair. I was still, however, looking for a product to improve the condition of my scalp. I&#x27;ve used this every other day for a few weeks, and have already started to see an improvement. My issues were getting to a point where I was even embarrassed to go to a hair stylist, but now I&#x27;m not. I&#x27;ll continue using this product.</li>
            <li> Dont know why it is not working on my hair..I feel the itching has increased and dandruff too.&lt;br /&gt;Is there some particular way of using it ?</li>
            <li> I was in trouble with the dandruff for months! and I was looking for all kinds of treatments everywhere and tried so many different \\&quot;Anti-dandruff\\&quot; shampoo. Sadly, all other shampoo that I used will not make you happy after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was keep looking for the anti-dandruff shampoo, until I met this one! Man! this thing works! and the most important part is: This thing last, it holds its quality super well! This is the only thing so far that works for me ! and I am going to purchase the 3rd one, 4th one...... I think this is the only shampoo I will use for the rest of my life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me guys! If you are the one out there still putting all your black and dark color clothes away,(just like me before) , and you are lucky to see this shampoo and my review , because it is time to wear anything you want again ,and never worry about the \\&quot;snow\\&quot; you always make from your head again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing more to say! Just buy it! This is the finally stop for your dandruff problem!</li>
            <li> This product was MUCH better several months ago. Recently they have changed their formula, however. You can tell it&#x27;s the new formula because the first bullet point on the bottle now reads, \\&quot;Prevents Premature Gray Hair.\\&quot; Whereas the older formula, the first line read, \\&quot;Controls flaking, scaling, and itching.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very hard to find an image of the old bottle, which is kind of... strange. But if you do a google image search for \\&quot;Pura d&#x27;or dandruff shampoo\\&quot; you&#x27;ll find an old image still on Sears website, but this probably won&#x27;t exist for very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let&#x27;s cut to the chase. Pura D&#x27;or doesn&#x27;t disclose anywhere that this is a new formula. There is no \\&quot;New Formula\\&quot; header on the bottle, no news on their website, nothing. Just the alteration of that first bullet point. I wouldn&#x27;t even bother writing this review, other than the fact that this change has RUINED this product. It leaves my hair greasier, itching more, and the flaking is outrageously bad. In other words, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell the difference between using this and Johnson&#x27;s baby shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL,DR: Any reviews prior to August 2012 (I think this is around the date that the formula change was made), CANNOT BE TRUSTED. Those review are out of date. If you wrote one of those reviews, I suggest going back to your review and doing an update on it.</li>
            <li> I have struggled all my life with terrible dry scalp (dermatologist says it&#x27;s not dandruff, but some kind of psoriasis.)  This shampoo is soothing, smells good, and seems to work better than anything I&#x27;ve used before.  That said, I don&#x27;t think any shampoo is worth $49 per bottle.</li>
            <li> This is very good argan Oil, I use it several times a day to keep my skin moisturized during this record cold winter.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin look young and smoother.</li>
            <li> it is expensive but you definitely feel this is gentle to your hair and sculp</li>
            <li> So far so good. I bought the shampoo less than a week ago. After several washes my hair feels clean and healthier. The smell of the shampoo is a little strong but overall it is a pleasing sent. The price seams a bit high for 16 ounces but a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Especially if you have thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;I cant comment on the hair regrowth properties for obvious reasons.  With any hair growy products only time can tell. I would recommend to anyone wanting a higher quality natural shampoo that may help with hair growth.</li>
            <li> Began using this product 6 months ago to treat hairloss. Used in conjunction with other products and am very satisfied. Havent bought any other shampoo since</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a shampoo that is organic and not full of harsh chemicals. I found Pura d&#x27;or organic shampoo and decided to give it a try. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months now, and I feel my hair is more healthy. It feels thicker and more healthy. I get less shedding. It doesn&#x27;t feel dry or brittle. Needless to say I love this product, and I will continue to be a regular customer going forward.</li>
            <li> Product is amazing, I used to use Nioxin until I tried Pura dor and was sold! It is a superior product and will never go back to using Nioxin again. If you have any problems with hair loss or thinning as a man I highly recommend giving this product a try you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for nearly 2 weeks now &amp; noticed less hair fall ..&lt;br /&gt;Lathers well .. Overall great product</li>
            <li> It did get my hair soft and smooth. The smell is not like other chemical shampoo, maybe less frangrance. Since I am just trying to protect from further bald and taking biotin. It seems working as subsidiarity. Will recommend to friend at least.</li>
            <li> I have been having an issue with dryness and flakiness around my hairline for more than six months, which is now creeping a bit further back from my hairline. After trying to treat it at home I searched for a long time before deciding to buy a different organic shampoo and lotion which I used for over 12 weeks (November to February) and barely saw a reduction in my symptoms. I decided to look for a shampoo and conditioner instead of the soap and lotion that I used only along my hairline. I have had Pura D&#x27;or Argan Oil Premium Organic Shampoo for a month and the dryness and flakiness have already been tamed! An area which was particularly bad, and where my hair was starting to thin, is now healing and the hair is growing in again. I still have some dry patches but they aren&#x27;t as bad as they had been a month ago. I will continue using the shampoo until I need to buy more and update my review then. So far it is the only product that has been working!</li>
            <li> I have been struggling to use anti-dandruff shampoo that really works and does not damage my hair. I found Pura d‚Äôor Anti-dandruff and I am happy with the results. My hair looks healthier. I still have to wash my hair everyday otherwise my scalp start to itch. My this issue I have with any other anti-dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> I like the shampoo but the pump does not work, this is the second bottle I have received were the pump does not work.</li>
            <li> Although it calms anti-dandruff, it isn&#x27;t really helping for my scalp. It does clean my hair pretty well but it also doesn&#x27;t foam as good as I expected. It is quite expensive for me to repurchase again. I wouldn&#x27;t say its the worst shampoo ever but it certainly isn&#x27;t the best as well.</li>
            <li> After having a life long problem with dandruff I was pleasantly surprised to find a significant improvement after the first use. I was also pleased to find my hair shiny and with greater body. If I continue to get the same results it will be worth the higher price.</li>
            <li> So fresh and not hair loss first time</li>
            <li> I was able to tell the difference after just 1 week. My hair is hydrated and the itching I was experiencing with the previous shampoo is gone!</li>
            <li> Have been using for a few weeks now.  Overall I have noticed a big difference in the amount of hair loss.  I&#x27;m not going to say this is a miricle product and will have a huge impact long term, but in general stronger healthier hair leads to less loss.  Pretty satisfied with the results so far.</li>
            <li> It seems really work! after using it for 2 weeks, it seems like my hair is a little bit more than before.</li>
            <li> Shampoo is working as advertised!</li>
            <li> Had been looking for a good organic shampoo with mostly essential oils because other shampoos were leaving my hair very dry. Finally tried Pura D&#x27;Or am very happy with the results after a month of use. Leaves my hair feeling clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I used to love this shampoo, but my latest bottle leaves my hair looking almost as greasy as it was before I washed it.  I switched to a new shampoo and I haven&#x27;t had the same issue.</li>
            <li> Good, it seems very soft,</li>
            <li> Work well with thescapmaster brush for thick hair.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner.  I use it with Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo.</li>
            <li> When it comes to hair loss prevention shampoo I am always scared of how this would leave my hair. I used John Frieda Frizz easy Shampoo + conditioner for the past 3 year and added a minoxidil 5% drops solution after every shower. The result for my hair was sticky, I felt drowsy in the mornings and happened to experience shortness of breath: no more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this bottle just to give a try to all the good reviews on amazon. I know that Argan Oil is really good for the hair so I said why not. It is the 3rd morning I am using this shampoo and my hair looks and feels stronger. I used the conditioner after the shampoo the first time, although I realized that it is not necessary, my hair are just great with the shampoo only! So what is happening now is that I am using 1 product instead of 3! Hopefully this will prevent the hair loss as supposed, I will update this review in a month and see what happens!</li>
            <li> I ordered this shampoo for my daughter who has extremely sensitive skin/scalp.  I wanted something that she could use daily.  I was curious about the shampoo so I tried it myself.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  It left our hair soft and shiny and her scalp looked clear.  Great find!  A number of people commeted about loving the smell.  I don&#x27;t love it.  In fact, that is the only reason that I gave 4 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Due to improper maintenance and climatic conditions dandruff itches the scalp and makes worry also a working person in a magnificient  healthy conditioner product  manufacturing Industry. Every body wants to be free from dandruff and happy. The product anti dandruff mentioned here is better than Head&#x27;n sholders and it is all organic and  natural. Gnerally chemicals are added in most of the hair conditioners for silky and smooth and attractive hair. But this shampoo  has no chemicals and sife effects. Best of the product  with afforable price.  [[ASIN:B002GCDR3C Anti-Dandruff organic,Shampoo by Dr.Nona]]</li>
            <li> I have 2b curly hair and use all natural products to cleanse, condition, and style, but my itchy scalp had been my constant conundrum. The only product that worked was Selsun Blue, but all those sulfates and chemicals I knew I was putting in my hair every time I washed it made me cringe... I tried JƒÅs√∂n Dandruff Relief 2 in 1 Shampoo and Conditioner (because of the overwhelming positive reviews) with no success, so I was hesitant to try another natural product. But, I was pleasantly surprised to have a non-itchy scalp the day after I washed my hair. The itchies come back a little after that, but in that respect, it&#x27;s on the same level as Selsun Blue. I&#x27;ll pick the more natural of the two, thank you. I&#x27;m so glad I found a natural solution for my itchy scalp that doesn&#x27;t hurt my hair, and long for, yet dread washing days. Thinking of pairing with Shea Moisture African Black Soap Conditioner (supposed to help with scalp/skin conditions also) to see if I can keep the itchies at bay for longer, while giving my hair more moisture.</li>
            <li> AMAZING shampoo totally going to buy it again, its so gentle and make my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I tried it for two weeks straight and it did minimize the itching and dandruff a bit, but it did not entirely get ride of my dandruff problem.  The smell is very herbal and I am fine with that, but some people may not like it.  It is made of all natural ingredients, which I like.  However, it does weight down my hair a bit.  I have very straight hair so it made my hair pretty flat, which I did not enjoy that much.  I am going to continue using it for awhile and see if it will work better.  Just remember to leave it in your hair for about 2-3 minutes.  It works better when it has been in the scalp for awhile.</li>
            <li> Product not as effective as I was hoping but maybe I need to use it more consistently</li>
            <li> I just used it couple of times and i like so far.It smells great and i like the fact that it doesnt have any bad ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> I have struggled for a really long time to find a shampoo that will help curb the intense itchy and pain I experience during the dry winter months. After some research, I decided to try this one. It seems to have just the right blend of tea tree oil to keep the pain and itchy at bay. I have used a variety of organic and &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; products, but none of them really seemed to help. I am really glad I found this one. It smells great and lathers well too.</li>
            <li> I like the shampoo as shampoo, but it did nothing for dandruff or hair loss.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo! Really like how there&#x27;s no SLS or any harsh chemicals. Leaves your hair shiny with more volume. Great product!!</li>
            <li> Its a really good shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;It smells good, and more important, it makes my hair smooth.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves hair fresh and clean without unnecessary chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;I think I will continue to use this bottle of shampoo!</li>
            <li> We love the smell !!! It feels smooth and nourishing</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo after tried several other brands, finally find one thing could save my hair. I used to lose hair after each shower, I am so afraid to lose all my hair until I finally find this saver!! The effect begins to reveal at the first bottle, obvious less hair went off after washing my hair. I will definitely continue use this one.</li>
            <li> Results can be seen at the first use, but did not last very long... After the first use, the dandruff disappeared right away, but it came back in about 4 days, not as much as before though. After the 2nd and 3rd wash, last a little longer, so the results are promising. Like the scent and organic nature, the scalp does not feel sting and itchy after the wash. May not get rid of dandruff permanently, but still a good and safe shampoo product.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping. It is natural and works effectively -- Not to mention it smells lovely, too. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t go back to another shampoo ever again. I&#x27;m 36 years old and i noticed a lack of new hair growth ever since i was 30. After researching for a natural and affordable shampoo, i found Pura d&#x27;or. i&#x27;ve been using this product for close to a year now. I&#x27;ve noticed a huge change in my scalp and new hair growth, mainly on the front part of my hair line where i used to part my hair for so many years. Also, the amount of time one bottle can last for is great! I just received my 2nd bottle and will continue to use this shampoo for as long as i can.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful! I am in my 70s and use it daily on my face, neck and hair and no longer have to purchase expensive facial products. I also use it on my body, especially on my elbows, hands and around my cuticles.It makes my shin very soft, without an oily feeling. Thank you for Pura d&#x27;or!</li>
            <li> Shampoo has a good smell and it works well.</li>
            <li> Although this product is not for me (I can&#x27;t stand the smell of patchouli), my daughter is happy with the results; mainly that her scalp doesn&#x27;t get irritated or flaky after use as it does with most other products. We are a hyper-sensitive family with many allergies and it is nice to have an organic product like Pura d&#x27;or as an option.</li>
            <li> Fragrant &amp; scalp soothing. Shampoo has a nice texture &amp; is not &amp;#34;runny&amp;#34;. Pump is an added benefit when your hand are wet!</li>
            <li> Smells nice, lathers great, but I do need something stronger now and then - but this is a great most days shampoo because it is gentle on the hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I love argon because I don&#x27;t like washing my hair that often and it keeps it from drying out. It also keeps from itching. And my hair stays healthier for so much longer-I don&#x27;t have to cut it as often because the ends don&#x27;t split nearly as quickly since purchasing this !</li>
            <li> Great product! Noticed results within a week. Before using this product I noticed that every morning I would leave dead hair on my pillow. After just one week of using Pura d&#x27;or, I noticed that the dead hair on the pillow had stop.</li>
            <li> ITCHINESS GONE, GENTLE ENOUGH FOR EVERYDAY USE, BUT... DOESN&#x27;T CLEAN DEEP AND DON&#x27;T EXPECT TOO MUCH LATH ER DUE TO THE LACK OF SULFATES.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift recently from my girlfriend and I have had a life long problem with flakes so I was skeptical about it actually working as I&#x27;ve tried them all and not to mention being organic which I&#x27;ve never used a shampoo that was organic.  I&#x27;m happy to report that my flakes are gone, all gone, after a week of usage and I can start wearing dark shirts again without having to check all the time for flakes on my shirt.  Not only did it make my flakes go away but I had no redness for itchiness afterwards as I have a sensitive scalp so I would definitely order this and anyone else that has dandruff problem with sensitive scalp they should really check this out as it really is a life changer.</li>
            <li> I got this as the second bottle for my dad.&lt;br /&gt;It is great for preventing loss of hair BUT it does not help regrowth of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;For sure, After the first bottle amount of my dad&#x27;s hair seems same.&lt;br /&gt;BUT it leaves scalp somehow dry. so I had to get some scalp massage oil as well.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise this is a great product!</li>
            <li> I only used this product for a week, and I can tell the difference on my scalp and hair. It&#x27;s gentle!&lt;br /&gt;I love it must try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had horrible psoriasis on an area on my scalp for years now. I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of shampoos and medicines. Some of them made it better for a couple of days but the problem always came back quickly.    Well, I&#x27;ve been trying this shampoo for a month now. Don&#x27;t expect instant results but I&#x27;m happy to report that for me it is having amazing results (it took a couple of weeks before I noticed improvements). The psoriasis is about 70% gone now and I see improvements every week. And the important thing is it hasn&#x27;t been a temporary fix, unlike the other shampoos and medicines I&#x27;ve tried in the part.    UPDATE: I&#x27;ve used this for a number of months now. While it did help a lot initially, my psoriasis (on a small area on my scalp) is now approximately 50% gone. So it may not completely remove other people&#x27;s psoriasis but at least it helped me reduce it. Changed the review to 4 stars - still worth buying/trying in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have allergic reactions to most shampoos and styling products. I love this shampoo it has solved my problem and leaves my hair full and manageable.</li>
            <li> Its a good shampoo..but overpriced in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I ordered this shampoo based on all the reviews, but it didnt work for me. This shampoo feels good, doesnt give that chemical feel like with commercial shampoos. Giving 3 stars since it did not do what it says, had no effect on my dandruff. But it left my hair feeling healthier and shiny. I plan to switch from my current brand to the regular shampoo from this company. Would not try the anti-dandruff shampoo again. I have less than half the bottle remaining, if anything changes, I would update my review.</li>
            <li> It is really helpful, nice product.</li>
            <li> JMJ  I don&#x27;t like fragrances, but the lovely scent of this won me over, maybe because it smells so natural.  I would call it a &amp;#34;potpourri&amp;#34; scent, and it&#x27;s great for men and women.  The scent is not a lingering fragrance.  The ingredients list won me over, too, as it doesn&#x27;t have the harmful chemicals of other shampoos, as far as I can tell.  It does help with dandruff, and it has been gentle and safe for thinning, graying and brittle hair.  It softens the hair and gives great shine.  I am glad I found this gentle but powerfully cleansing product.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is awesome!! I bought it off groupon on a whim and am an extremely happy customer. It thickens your hair and my hair has grown faster than ever. I really bought it for my boyfriend who has thinning hair and he loves it. People were giving him complements as soon as he started using it, so I started to use it too. It really does work. The best product I&#x27;ve used in a while....and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them.</li>
            <li> Hair become really soft after using this. Like the smell.</li>
            <li> So far I can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s good or not, maybe after one month using.</li>
            <li> It smelled good and works very well to keep dandruff away.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell very much, hope it will works!</li>
            <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s so moisturizing for a shampoo and have definitely noticed less hair falling out in the shower. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> My hair started thinning a few years ago and I was desperate to stop my hair loss. I tried Rogaine for Women, but it made my hair feel greasy and it made my scalp itch. I went to a dermatologist and they told me there was little I could do as my hair loss was likely hereditary. I came across this shampoo during a google search for &amp;#34;hair loss products&amp;#34; and decided to give it a try. I have just purchased my third bottle of this shampoo and have noticed a HUGE difference in my hair. After a few weeks of using this shampoo, I noticed less hair falling out in the shower. After a few months, I noticed a lot of new baby hairs growing in. Just last week, my stylist told me I have a ton of new growth coming in. I will continue to use this shampoo for as long as I can!</li>
            <li> I love this product and I think the Argan oil is great for my scalp</li>
            <li> very good product, it works amazing on my hair</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was looking for a dandruff shampoo that was natural and that wouldn&#x27;t turn my hair into a big ball of frizz. No such luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice and does give a good lather, which is why it got two stars, but I won&#x27;t be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> It really deals with dandruff perfectly, but it makes my hair too dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love this shampoo.  It has helped the flaking and itching, but my hair doesn&#x27;t have the texture and shine that I like after a nice shampoo and for that reason I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lathers nicely without using a handful of shampoo but it&#x27;s a little harder for me to rinse than most shampoos I&#x27;ve used.  It feels sort of heavy on my scalp and I rinse and rinse before I feel like I have it all out, and still I don&#x27;t get that squeaky clean feeling that I like.  My hair is very fine, so if yours is normal, maybe it&#x27;ll leave your hair looking better than mine.  I&#x27;ve been using it about 4 months, so that&#x27;s a good trial, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a believer in argan oil and am going to try other products.  Will let you know what I think.</li>
            <li> I bought this item after reading other reviews that this is the only organic shampoo that works wonders on your dandruff. I was a little hesitant on the number of reviews, but the percentage of +ve reviews got me buying this shampoo. After using it for more than 3 weeks, my condition for dandruff got a lot worse. Irritation and dandruff returned as soon as I finish my head bath and the situation left me with embarassment. If you are looking for a shampoo with anti-dandruff capabilities, this is a No No!!. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is based on the fact that it is organic and based on the doubt that may be it did not work only for the type of dandruff I was affected with. P.S. I shifted to Nizoral after this and found it to be more effective.</li>
            <li> This smells great. It helped my dandruff but not completely. I have been using this product for about a month. Hopefully with some more time my dandruff will completely go away.</li>
            <li> I came back for more. I think this is a great shampoo, it cleans well and doesnt dry out my hair. Nor does it not leave any weird residue like some organic or natural shampoos do. Best of all (and this is why I was originally attracted to it) it does not irritate my scalp - I have sensitive scalp &amp; this product does not bother me and I will continue to buy this shampoo:)</li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;ve been trying different hair products.  I bought this with a conditioner from the same company and I really like it.  I&#x27;m really going all organic in my life and this is one my first steps.  Works just as good a chemical product but without all the crazy chemicals.  While this is not for everyone I would recommend for people who want to live a organic lifestyle.  I&#x27;m on my first bottle and will update how it ends.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent of the product and absolutely love the ingredients. One thing that I was impressed with was the lather as sometimes with all natural shampoos you can&#x27;t get much of a lather. Leaves my hair soft and very shiny! The one thing I don&#x27;t like is that it costs so much per bottle but that is expected as you are paying for quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is very effective.  I&#x27;ve had bad dandruff since I was 6 years old, and I&#x27;ve used every product imaginable. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times and my flakes are gone.  It also has a great minty scent.  The best part is that this company doesn&#x27;t do animal testing, love that.</li>
            <li> Always had dandruff problems since puberty decided to enter my life and take a dookie on my scalp. It&#x27;s not bad in the warm weather, but when it winter comes around, I can make it snow from my head - yes I know, it&#x27;s gross, shut up. Anyways, I&#x27;ve tried everything from shaving my head and lotioning it to using the harsh dandruff shampoos. I wanted to move away from using harsh chemicals and I wanted to try this. So far it&#x27;s been helping out with the itching and flakes. One knock I will give is the pump action on the bottle. It&#x27;s not like I need something that will give me a quick double-tap of shampoo in my hand, but this bottle I actually need to pull the pump back up before I can pump again. I can&#x27;t be jerking off a bottle in the shower just to get some shampoo; I&#x27;m busy jerkin...err...doing other things - ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that. If they can work on the pump or even put it in the squeeze bottle it would&#x27;ve gotten five stars.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo for my borhter who lives in China. He told me it works well.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo as an upgrade from the typical store brands such as head and shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very very happy. Smells great and my hair feels better than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been using Pura d&#x27;or thinning hair shampoo for several years now and love it. However, I have always suffered from dandruff and dry, itchy scalp. When I recently discovered that Pura d&#x27;or makes a premium organic shampoo made for dandruff and scalp conditions it was an easy decision to give it a try. I&#x27;ve been using it about every three days or so for several weeks now and so far am very pleased. It only takes one squirt from the pump and it lathers up nicely. I let it sit on my scalp while I shower to allow the ingredients to work. Sure, it is a bit pricey compared to many of the &amp;#34;off the shelf&amp;#34; products that can be purchased just about anywhere, but, I&#x27;ve always believed that you get what you pay for. I wanted a premium organic shampoo with no harsh sulfates and this is what you get with the Pura d&#x27;or shampoo. I only wish that I had known about  this shampoo sooner.</li>
            <li> My husband used to use T-Gel to help control his psoriasis &amp; dandruff, but when he learned that T-Gel contains known carcinogens, he decided he wanted to try something natural.&lt;br /&gt;We tried another natural shampoo first (I tried it too), but it did not work well. It dried out my hair &amp; irritated both of our scalps. So I searched specifically for a natural anti-dandruff shampoo &amp; found this Pura D&#x27;or brand. As far as shampoo goes, I really like it. It cleans well &amp; doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair or my scalp. But, as for anti-dandruff it&#x27;s not working so well for my husband. He&#x27;s been using it for a little over a month, so if it was going to work I would expect to see better results by now.&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;s still using it because at least it&#x27;s not hurting his scalp &amp; he&#x27;s not worried about added chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably continue to use this shampoo since I like it &amp; I&#x27;m not battling dandruff. My husband, though, is looking for something else.</li>
            <li> I used this in place of Head and Shoulders to avoid using non organic products and chemicals.  I actually love the shampoo and it gets my hair nice and clean, but the dandruff turned into a huge problem and I had to switch back to my old shampoo for a little while to avoid scratching my head all day :/ wish it worked a little better!</li>
            <li> my hair gets to oily really fast even thought ive just taken a shower.. a using this shampoo i can see that its not as oily as before and not to mention that my urge to srcatch is not as much... overall its great product will buy again!!</li>
            <li> I have searched everywhere in stores and online to find the best organic shampoos. I hate chemicals and all that other stuff that companies put in their products. I stumbled upon this company and I have loved their hair products! I have lots of dandruff in my hair and after only using this shampoo for about a week, I have noticed that the flakes have stopped coming so fast! Love that it has no chemicals, all natural, and it smells great too. Definitely would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product works for me. Use daily and has cleared up my problems. Will purchase again</li>
            <li> This product has worked wonders on my husbands hair. It scalp is dandruff free and his scalp is no long dry. This is a great product and i love that it is organic.</li>
            <li> Good product, wish the bottle was a bit bigger!!!!</li>
            <li> Very drying... hair felt like straw. So bad, I just threw it away. Absolutely no point in keeping it. Since then, I have found Aesop, which is amazing. http://www.amazon.com/Aesop-14779904444-Calming-Itchy%252c-200ml-6-8oz/dp/B00ARHYL9M/ref&#x3D;sr_1_6?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1455413281&amp;sr&#x3D;1-6&amp;keywords&#x3D;aesop</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this shampoo -- very fresh and clean.  Doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily or greasy and provides some extra volume that I don&#x27;t get from other shampoos.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend it and I&#x27;d consider buying it again.</li>
            <li> As far as natural shampoos go, this Pura d&#x27;or anti-dandruff shampoo is amazing.  It lathers really well when most natural products don&#x27;t, and it leaves my hair shiny and silky.  And you don&#x27;t even need a conditioner, not even a vinegar rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also works well on my dandruff, even when my scalp stopped responding to other products.  My dandruff got really bad recently and not even heads and shoulders could get it under control.  So I was really surprised when this all-natural shampoo lowered my dandruff significantly when chemical based products couldn&#x27;t.  After one use, my bf&#x27;s psoriasis also improved resulting in softer and less scaley skin.  With more uses I&#x27;m sure his scalp will be even more improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy to have finally found this product which has everything that I&#x27;m looking for (all-natural, good lather, dandruff control).  I hope they never change this products formula.</li>
            <li> Seems to help daughter&#x27;s dry scalp more than other shampoos.  Needs to be used with conditioner.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son because in the winter his scalp gets really dry and flaky.  He really likes this product and it definitely helped with his dry scalp and winter dandruff.  Highly recommend and will buy again.</li>
            <li> No Sulfates. No Parabens. No DEA. No harsh chemicals is what does it for me. I enjoy the feeling knowing this product is safe to use and good for a head of hair. I am pleased with the dispenser which allows me to control the amount of shampoo which is better than other bottles that can make a mess. Overall, a great product, only down fall is that it does not smell the greatest, but if you use the conditioner that will offset that.</li>
            <li> Makes my scalp and hair feel and look great , what else is there !</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a natural shampoo that actually controls my dandruff problem. I did my research before ordering this product because of the price and also because I didnt want to spoil my hair with anything fake. Based on my research, Argan oil is one of the rarest and healthiest oil on earth that can be used from head to toe without any side effects. Argan oil comes from the seed of Argan oil which are mainly grown in Morocco. After using this product, my dandruff was controlled on a scale of 9 out of 10. The reason I dont give a full 10 is because it does not cure the problem but it controls it more than any other product I have ever tried. 99% of the ingredients are driven from natural products, except phenoxyethanol which is a mild preservative that is used in many cosmetic products. My point is this thing works as it says on the label!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product. It did not work for me at all. I tried to use it twice. Seborrheic dermatitis symptoms got worse after using this shampoo. My head skin became really itchy... Worst shampoo for Seborrheic dermatitis I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various different shampoos the past few years in order to see which one works best for my hair. After stumbling onto this beauty of a product and experiencing the magic that is Pura d&#x27;or anti-dandruff shampoo it quickly made it to my top 10 favorite shampoos ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may take some time getting use to but a lot of dandruff will begin to show up upon first using the shampoo, but don&#x27;t be alarmed. What&#x27;s happening is that the shampoo is loosening up the dandruff so after using the shampoo a few more times all dandruff will be washed away...say bye bye to white flakes on your shirt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part about using this product is that if you want to wash your hair everyday, you can!</li>
            <li> I had problems with  flaking of scalp and hair loss after showering for many years. After being recommended to use this shampoo by a friend I&#x27;ve bought this product a month ago. I must say I am loving so far. flaking has been minimized to point of non-existence.  This Shampoo also controls hair loss, which was great for me. I am now using organic products which is the way a to go. I highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li> So my yuppie friends in the UK got me spooked about SLS and Parabens so I decided to go \\&quot;all-natural\\&quot; with my soaps and shampoos. Soap was easy but shampoo was hard, because I needed something that really fought and prevented dandruff. I had used Head and Shoulders for years and it really worked to keep the dandruff away so I was skeptical about trying something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across Pura d&#x27;or shampoos and I was impressed by its natural ingredients. When I saw they had a anti-dandruff version I jumped. Well, it hurt to jump because it cost like $40, which was about six-eight times as expensive as Head and Shoulders. But, hey, if I wanted to be \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; and dandruff-free I had better pay up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, after a couple months I can say that this shampoo does not work to prevent dandruff (at least for me). Not only did it dry out my hair, it dried and irritated my scalp. I was flaking like a blizzard on the second day I used it. I tried everything to make this \\&quot;golden\\&quot; bottle of shampoo work for me - I left it on for 2 minutes, then 5 minutes, I put it on and then quickly rinsed it out - all with the same disappointing results. Then I decided to not wash my hair everyday and use Pura every other day - no dice. Then I tried alternating between Head and Shoulders and Pura - the days I used H&amp;S, no dandruff; the days I used Pura, White Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted this to work - oh, well - I guess I&#x27;ll try something else or just take my chances using H&amp;S forever...</li>
            <li> Love how this shampoo leaves my hair feeling so soft. It has a great scent and I have seen a slight change in hair loss.</li>
            <li> Shampoo seems to help with dry skin but not a magic worker.  shampoo bottle is bit low quality for the price of the shampoo but that just minor detail.  Overall good shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive, somewhat oily scalp, seborrheic dermatitis, and am allergic to sulfates.  For the past several years, I&#x27;ve been looking for a shampoo that I can use as often as I want without irritation.  I&#x27;ve tried pine tar, coal tar, Head &amp; Shoulders anti-itch &amp; sensitive skin; I tried products my hairdresser or my dermatologist recommended, slathered my head with a tea tree oil mixture before shampooing, and was almost ready to get the hair shaved off in desperation. Finally, this is the one!  It has resolved the itchiness and large flakes from the seborrheic dermatitis and leaves my curly/wavy hair soft, shiny and conditioned (no small feat for someone over 50).  I usually wash every other day, but sometimes need a daily wash because of swimming or exercising.  No problem.  Expect the low suds you would get with any sulfate-free shampoo.  I use a small squirt of a Pura D&#x27;Or conditioner on the ends after washing to keep frizzing to a minimum. The price was a little daunting (especially for an experiment) at first, but I will buy it again without hesitation.  For me, it truly is pure gold; eliminating that persistent itch and irritation has really improved my quality of life.</li>
            <li> An awesome product, that leaves your hair very fresh and clean with out all the unnecessary chemicals .</li>
            <li> This is my first review on Amazon and I felt that I just had to say something about this wonderful thing, only because its so different from everything else out there. This is the only shampoo that I have bought that has left a tangible difference in my hair. I have naturally thin hair and I noticed that around six months ago, they started slowly sliding off my head. That&#x27;s when I decided to plunge into the world of higher quality shampoos. I would borrow expensive shampoos from friends and try on various different shampoos, but none of them really worked in stopping my dreaded hairfall.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works like a charm. Three days after I started using this, my hairfall was reduced drastically and in about 2 weeks, I had zero hairfall. My hair is now stronger and also fuller, making styling a much easier process.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to anyone, regardless of hair type. I am planning on getting another bottle of the gold version of this shampoo as well!</li>
            <li> This a good product. For a while I was looking for an effective organic anti dandruff shampoo. This shampoo works greats and I can feel the difference after two uses. I&#x27;d recommend this product to who has chronic dandruff problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year now. I have been loosing my hair for years and spent thousands of dollars on hair loss products, treatments, and even medication.  I can gladly report that my hair loss has virtually stopped. I have not regrown but what I have left has remained. My hair looks healthier and thicker. Very happy with the results.  it is also very concentrated in that you only need a very small amount to fully lather your hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I have a very sensitive scalp due to health issues. This has helped so much. I do wish there was a conditioner to go with it. I have extremely dry hair so I need one, however if I had normal hair I don&#x27;t think that I would need a conditioner.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing, it&#x27;s very light and refreshing.  This has helped my dandruff reduce drastically.  I&#x27;m so happy that my husband finally found something to prevent further hair loss that I was experiencing.  Pura d&#x27;or has helped strengthen my hair and keep it smooth.</li>

            <li> Really easy to get lots of foamy. Like the smell. The hair became really soft.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo. It&#x27;s a perfect choice for hair loss treatment.</li>
            <li> Shipping was faster than what I had expected! I started using it right away, and I can honestly say that it truly does it&#x27;s job. I love it I will definitely be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> I received it very fast.. I was hear a lot of this product and I saw good reviews on it.. I wish to get the benefit from it.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo, when i put on my hair a felt really soft  and easy to mashable  so I will definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Awesome shampoo. I love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for 1 week and have noticed a significant improvement in my dandruff and scaliness of my scalp. I have noticed an increase in itching in the area with the most severe scales but there are none and I am hoping this is the area healing process.</li>
            <li> My brother is hair specialist . He highly recommend me to use this product to care hair. I almost one year use this product and I feel happy. At least I believe there is nothing to do better than this. so I would say yes, do it and be care your hair by this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Smells very healthy and my hair looks better after using it.</li>
            <li> It works! It make me lose less hair during the bath.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very important to stick on it, too.</li>
            <li> The best of best, i will never change my Shampoo again, Finally i have found the one.. Thanks for great product.‚ù§Ô∏èüôå</li>
            <li> I have had issues with dandruff and an itchy scalp all my life and I have tried multiple products with limited success.  So far, after using this product, I have had no dandruff and very little itchiness.  I will continue to use this for as long as it keeps my scalp healthy and flake free.</li>
            <li> I have used it for about 3 months with good results.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. It smells very good but is not overbearing. It keeps me dandruff free completely granted I only get a little bit. I would purchase this product again. I love that it is organic yet unlike many organic products this one leaves me feeling clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good shampoo. I can see a difference and I have had it for two weeks now. The fact that its organic is even better as too many chemicals do more harm then good.</li>
            <li> Pura d&#x27;or anti dandruff shampoo is unlike any anti dandruff shampoo I have used before. The quality compared to it&#x27;s competitors is unmatched. I&#x27;ve had a bad run in with dandruff recently and over my past week of use, I&#x27;m really noticing a difference. My scalp feels less irritated and there&#x27;s less flakes with the occasion head scratch. I&#x27;ll have to update this review over the next month of extended use, but for now I&#x27;d give Pura d&#x27;or Anti-dandruff shampoo a big thumbs up. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my brother who has a lot of dandruff and itchy scalp. He has used a lot of shampoos and none of them really helped. After using this shampoo twice, he is already seeing the difference. His itchy scalp has gotten a lot better, dandruff is visibly less and all this without making his hair oily or rough! So over all happy I gave this a try!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell very much, but I love that its organic and ir helped a lot with mi scalp problem!</li>
            <li> WOW I can say it really works! I used to have a horrible hair loss for many years... and my scalp is very sensitive, itchy and has dandruff! I tried different products but nothing really worked... My cousin use Pura D&#x27;or shampoo for hair loss for couple years and she is so happy with it ! She told me to try this brand and since I tried it once I fall in love! Just after a few weeks using this shampoo once a two three days my hair looks much healthier and thicker. No more dandruff and hair loss. I would continue using this shampoo. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I had used a lot of non-organic shampoos(head and shoulders, Dove) and they were able to control dandruff but I was losing hair at the same time. I decided to give this organic shampoo and conditioner a shot. It does what it states: helps controls dandruff . Hair feels light and smooth after shower. Tip: Coconut oil after drying the air helps keeping dandruff away till next shower.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo . Will leave video review and comparison too pura d ot gold&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;video comparison&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;tyniKrNDwm4&amp;lc&#x3D;z12pxvsqwqvic1jrw04cc13aztumyfrjyos0k</li>
            <li> While I was anxious/excited to use this product based on what I&#x27;d read about the product itself plus the almost all positive reviews, I was (and still am) disappointed that I feel like I&#x27;m noticing more dandruff,  much more than before I started using the product almost three weeks ago now.  Some reviews also mentioned eliminating a conditioner in their routine.  I wish it felt that simple.  I still use conditioner, in part because after shampooing, my hair feels dry.  Anyone else feel like they started experiencing more danfruff?</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for last 2 months. My Dandruff is in control and hair is smooth. I would recommend this product to anyone having dandruff issues and would like to use a product that has no harmful chemicals</li>
            <li> Son&#x27;s hair has never been softer. Reduced dandruff in one use, but not fully. Will report back on dry scalp, with hopes it will fully eradicated. Expensive, bit replaces conditioner as well. The plain argon oil is fantastic , as well.</li>
            <li> Wow this shampoo is utterly amazing even after the first use. I have an extremely dry scalp and after using this product just one time my scalp didn&#x27;t itch or feel tight. The rash on my head went away just after using it once! I was shocked because I use another dry scalp shampoo and still couldn&#x27;t get rid of the rash. My hairdresser wanted me to buy a product from their salon but I had already tried them with no success. I am so pleased and hooked right from the start. The price is worth the results. Dry scalp be gone and amen to that</li>
            <li> Product seems to do exactly what it says. It did help with the dandruff, however I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s exactly made the hair shinier or look any different.  Since it has argon oil, I think it is at least making it healthier and more protected from the heat of a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I bought this product due to the amazing reviews in how it controls dandruff... I have to say, it did not work at all in me, use it every day for a month or so now and im still at the same point where i started... Smells good, feels good, no results... Sorry... Good luck...</li>
            <li> Great solution for dandruff. I tried a lot of different kinds of shampoos, nothing helped my sensitive head skin until I found this one.</li>
            <li> It make it worseeee :( My head always feel itchy after using this awful shampoo and gave me more and more dandruff !!! I am very dissatisfied !!! I wish i can give no star for this product !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pura d&#x27;or for about 4.5 months now with minoxidil. My hair has been thinning for about 7 years and this is the first time I&#x27;ve attempted to do something about it. It&#x27;s been working great! I&#x27;m now starting to see regrowth and thickening of my existing hair. I just received my second bottle of Pura d&#x27;or and will continue to use it as long as I am seeing results!</li>
            <li> Completely eliminated dandruff used only 2 to 3 times a week, and a little goes a long way, so one bottle, although not inexpensive, goes a very long way. Entirely satisfied. Tom R MD</li>
            <li> Amazing product i felt the diffrence on the first wash. It smells great too! I would definetly recommend it for thicker fuller hair.</li>
            <li> if you are looking for a shampoo to fight dandruff look elsewhere. have been using this shampoo for almost a month and i think i am getting more dandruff than before. head and shaulders takes care of the problem for more than twice less the price but i wanted to get something organic so i was willing to spend more. what a waste of $20, very disappointed!</li>
            <li> It improves my hair problem</li>
            <li> this is good, i have been using for 1 mouth. i get some hair back which is great.</li>
            <li> recommed this shampooÔºåreally wellÔºÅ</li>
            <li> Received the uplift product very quickly which made me quite happy.  I had been using another product with so-so results and searched for something that would draw me towards trying it. Thus far I love the way it smooths on my neck and lower skin. I use it sparingly on places of my face as well. Very satisfied thus far and feel in my bones and premenition this will be the product of choice from here on out. I will now scope out the other products they carry and no doubt will have to gift myself more although my funds are limited as I was payed off. Thank you for your great product and follow up. Happy holidays!!</li>
            <li> Smells good. And hope it would perform good in protecting hair.</li>
            <li> I first saw this shampoo on Groupon and decided to try it out. Pretty good stuff! Light scent and light formula. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel heavy. I have noticed less hair in the drain post shower, will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> i have used this product and must say it works big time..Better than Head &#x27;n Shoulders and it is all organic and natural! No chemicals! No side effects...so if you really care about your hair than go for it because its worth every penny u spend. I would like introducing it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks so I don&#x27;t know about the long term effects yet. Currently it does look like my hair is thicker but I still have issues with an itchy scalp. So if your priority is a thicker scalp due to thin hair then this product can be for you. But if you need a shampoo that helps prevent an itchy scalp then this shampoo may not be the solution for you. I will continue using it to and update my review if the product has any changes to my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for 2 weeks and noticed that my dandruff started clearing up a little. Also i noticed lesser hair in the shower (hair used to fall a lot) . Hope it continues to improve my hair condition.will keep updating. This is my first review on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having a severe itching problem with my scalp. Found this shampoo on Amazon and have been using it for a week. I think my scalp has been slightly better since using the product but no significant improvement yet. I will keep using the product and update the review if it gets better. The shampoo smells great and seems to be working well.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!  It doesn&#x27;t completely strip my hair like other shampoos then leave residue behind resulting in flat weighted down hair.  My scalp feels great no itch or scales.  Be aware that your hair will not feel silky after rinsing but don&#x27;t worry it will still comb out just fine.  I use just a dab of conditioner on my ends and my hair feels great!</li>
            <li> I searched spent nearly three years (and who knows how many hundreds of dollars) searching for a shampoo that didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I have had scaling and itching on my scalp, eyelids, cheeks, and neck. No one (doctors included) could help me, except for prescribing corticosteroids. With my eyelids being involved, that was not a comfortable option for me. I finally figured out (after about 2 years) that it was likely seborrheic detmatitis. But finding a shampoo that worked was harder than expected. Most shampoos for SD have sulfates and fragrances, both of which irritate me further in other ways. And they all left my hair feeling gross. **This shampoo has been so amazing** I am so glad I found it. It clears my skin, doesn&#x27;t cause the tingly irritation, and no itchiness. My hair feels great, and it smells good, too. I still have to find a conditioner to fill our the package, but this has been an answer to prayer for me. It has worked better than anything else I have tried. Definitely worth the cost!! I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I just randomly happened across this stuff... wasn&#x27;t even looking to buy shampoo that day,  but it caught my eye so I tried it; tried it and loved it.  I&#x27;ve got a pretty dry scalp and have tried tons of different stuff to keep it in check.  this stuff works wonders!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for one month and a half. Over the past three years I have slowly transitioned from the cheapest, most horrid Garnier products, to expensive salon brands, and now to natural and organic hair care. This shampoo is the best in my experience so far. When I switched to this organic product I also decided to stop using conditioner, suddenly realizing that it&#x27;s probably just a greasy money-waster. My hair is softer, lighter-feeling, and shinier than ever after ditching conditioner and using this stuff, washing every other day or so. I do however sometimes run a tiny squirt of argan oil through wet hair with my fingers, about once every 5 days or so. It&#x27;s all the conditioner I need in conjunction with this argan oil-containing shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if it&#x27;s really 100% organic...or only organic enough to satisfy the standards for using that label, but regardless it appears to be one of the MOST organic shampoos available on Amazon, and a better value than my previous brand, Bumble and Bumble. The only scary sounding ingredients include mild surfactants both derived from coconut oil (giving the shampoo its soapy quality), and phenoxyethanol--a chemical preservative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I love the pump bottle. Why don&#x27;t all shampoos use a pump? 100x easier than silly shampoo lids. After 1.5 months, I still have more than half the bottle.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and seems to calm my scalp. Doesn&#x27;t over dry like other dandruff shampoos and it&#x27;s natural. I avoid any processed ingredients or things in made in labs. I believe it will be safe to use this everyday.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several brands and this one has worked best so far. I&#x27;m just reluctant to say it&#x27;s best since the itch sometimes returns.</li>
            <li> We love this stuff! I bought this for my teenage daughter, who is blessed with thick blonde hair but her scalp is itchy and flaky. Luckily with blonde hair the flakes don&#x27;t show up much, but they do on her clothes. I thought the problem was her not getting down to her scalp well enough when she washed it, but when I closely inspected her scalp it really looked like the cradle cap she had as an infant. We tried a couple of different remedies, including massaging her scalp with jojoba oil and then washing it, which really just made her teenage hair oily. Most dandruff shampoos that seem to work at all didn&#x27;t smell very good and were more chemical-ly than I wanted for her. We bought this recently and after just a week of using it, I noticed the &amp;#34;cradle cap&amp;#34; was pretty much resolved and after two weeks I was combing my fingers through her hair to see how it worked, and found it to be so thick, soft, and luxurious that I decided to use it myself to alternate with my own shampoo. I love that it&#x27;s natural, it&#x27;s sulfate-free, and it smells lovely! But most of all I love that it works so well. Being sulfate free it doesn&#x27;t lather up as well as most drugstore brands, but it really gets your hair clean, and her scalp has hardly any flaking at all anymore. I&#x27;ve never seen her hair look this good - I hope they don&#x27;t ever stop making this formula!</li>
            <li> One of the best finds IMO. Maybe it&#x27;s the power of belief, but I seriously feel like I stopped loosing as much hair.  A little pricey, but worth it for me. You don&#x27;t have to use very much of it either.  Only shampoo I use from now on.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells great and leaves my hair feeling fresh.  You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of product so it lasts a long time</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife. She really liked it. The hair looks nice and silky.</li>
            <li> Good ingredients, but need A LOT of product to make a decent lather. If you have medium-long hair, you need to pump so many times to get enough shampoo. Used the entire bottle too quickly to want to re-purchase.</li>
