            <li>She loves me that much more now.</li>
            <li>The price was even better...</li>

            <li>My wife&#x27;s favorite.  </li>
            <li>My favorite for decades.</li>
            <li>Her and I were satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Opium for years and love it</li>
            <li>love this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Wifes favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>She love it</li>
            <li>My wife loves this scent, and I love it on her.  </li>
            <li>Love this perfume.</li>
            <li>love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sure that was just for packaging</li>
            <li>Have used Opium for over 25 years and love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I WILL SURELY RECOMMEND THIS OPIU</li>
            <li>My signature scent since it launched, many, many years ago.  </li>
            <li>This perfume has been my favorite for many years.  </li>
            <li>&#x27;it&#x27; is her favorite [P.S. Our cat loves it when my wife &#x27;wears&#x27; it]</li>
            <li>For perfume one uses regulary, one couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s skin has its own unique chemistry</li>
            <li>Lasts almost 6 hours on my skin, which is pretty good in my book, and lasts even longer when sprayed on top of the matching body moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Given to my daughter  for Christmas, no complaint, happy with the product..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a warm, spicy scent that is as perfect as hot cocoa during the holidays.</li>
            <li>But if other people commit to you about how wonderful the perfume is you are wearing - take notice - and if many compliments come in - stick with that one.  </li>
            <li>I received my order in perfect condition and have absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li>This is the same great product at a better price.  </li>
            <li>The changes have still maintained the strong musk and eastern undertones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that this is a darker scent than most that I own, very masculine</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t expect it to be like the original one, you will be fine :)</li>
            <li>A cheap knock off of the original smells better than this</li>
            <li>Shame on Yves St Laurent for doing this to its loyal wearers!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased &amp; highly recommend this company.</li>
            <li>everyone wants to know what it is she has own.,</li>
            <li>cheap aftermarket knock off</li>
            <li>The perfume was a great gift for several friends.  </li>
            <li>i love the perfume and it is much more reasonable on line</li>
            <li>this will give several ladies a smell good feel for many months.</li>
            <li>A real 5 STAR  company !!!</li>
            <li>This product is not an original perfume from Yves Saint Lauren, this perfume did not meet my expectation.</li>
            <li>DO NOT BUY if you like the original.</li>
            <li>For my wife&#x27;s last birthday, she told me she was out of her favorite cologne, Opium for Women, so I jumped on-line and went to Ebay, Dillards, Macy&#x27;s, and finally Amazon where I found the best price of all those I compared.</li>
            <li>I am never disappointed.</li>
            <li>Smells nothing like the original.  </li>
            <li>Why didn&#x27;t they keep the original and name this one &amp;#34;Almost Opium?.  </li>
            <li>&#x27;Have used Opium almost since it was first introduced and still love it.  </li>
            <li>It was $60 for 3 Fl.oz as compared to $90 elsewhere but all in original packaging and sealed (I was worried it may be</li>
            <li>This is nothing like the original Opium.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably not as popular as some of the new fragrances</li>
            <li>Seems to be different, but still pleasant.</li>
            <li>This was a gift -- she wears it everyday and has for many years -- very nice.</li>
            <li>Wearing Opium, makes me feel so feminine and special.</li>
            <li>My wife has loved Opium over the years but this product does not have the same odor or intensity.</li>
            <li>My wife absolutely LOVED this as a birthday present.</li>
            <li>do I really need to say how lovely it is…..</li>
            <li>But use it sparingly it can get overwhelming if you spritz too much.  </li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li>My wife loved it and it beat the local prices a lot !!</li>
            <li>Spicy fragrance especially nice for those special nights or to warm up a cold winter night.</li>
            <li>If possible, probably the best thing to do is buy it at your local department store.</li>
            <li>And now with the great price I don&#x27;t have to save it for special occasions anymore and can afford to wear it everyday.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>and last night he told me i smelled so sexy!  </li>
            <li>I was a little apprehensive when I got this since I used to love the original and had heard the new wasn&#x27;t as good...</li>
            <li>but, it is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>If you buy this product on line buy it from the manufacturer because if you don&#x27;t like it they told me they would make it right.</li>
            <li>It was the right price at the right time.</li>
            <li>Nice aroma and lasts quite a while for toilet water.</li>
            <li>Wow this one she rely love that smell of fragrance and the price and fast shipping</li>
            <li>This arrived quickly and was so much cheaper than going to one of the stores in the mall to purchase.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the same as the old one but its still a good fragrance.</li>
            <li>wife likes it very much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only one I use any more.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, it will do, but its not the same at all.</li>
            <li>the same why change a winning formula.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite, I wear it daily!</li>
            <li>It is the only perfume that I have received so many compliments on</li>
            <li>This was my signature scent for years from the time it first came out.  </li>
            <li>Is the comment I got the first time I wore it.  </li>
            <li>Only perfume I have used for many years.</li>
            <li>this is not the first time I have gotten Opium Spray.  </li>

            <li>I love Opium as it is not overwhelmingly strong but a nice, soft fragrance.</li>
            <li>This has been my signature fragrance since it was released in the 70&#x27;s, but usually is too expensive, found this at a good price; good value, love this one.</li>
            <li>Classic, sexy and highly addictive.  </li>
            <li>My wife loves it - an easy Christmas present.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe that I was able to buy my perfume for $60 when normally the only place I could buy it is Younkers for $90!</li>
            <li>I was very pleased and will definitely order perfume from Amazon again, especially if it is through Discount Perfumes.</li>
            <li>A sweet scented perfume that brought a big smile to my fiancee</li>
            <li>It smells good to me, and I&#x27;m just a normal all American male.  </li>
            <li>It is a classic in my opinion!</li>
            <li>Very high scented .</li>
            <li>The delivery was very speedy.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s much sweeter</li>
            <li>I have worn it for years, and have never tired of it.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This is not something that I know much about.  </li>

            <li>(Too bad I couldn&#x27;t get more compliments on how good I looked, but, I will accept the smelly compliments.)  </li>
            <li>This most recent purchase was not the same .There was no smell on the skin at all.</li>
            <li>Arrived promptly as promised&amp;#62; Highly recommend</li>
            <li>The price is getting so high.</li>
            <li>love the new bottle and the little neck piece that keeps it from spraying accidentally.  </li>
            <li>I have been wearing Opium for 30 years, the new version (which if you ask anyone at the YSL counter NEVER happened -</li>
            <li>I have worn Opium for 30 years and just purchased the new version.  </li>
            <li>till I got the new formula.  </li>
            <li>I still don&#x27;t understand what the gripe is about the new formula.</li>
            <li>My wife loves this so it gets 5 stars price is very reasonable compared to local stores ,she has used it for years.</li>
            <li>Came on time and my wife was very surprised.  </li>
            <li>I usually get it in a cologne or Eau de Toilette, since that is much more affordable for me, I prefer it in a spray also.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll see if I can find a foreign knock-off of the original.</li>
            <li>She wanted some for Christmas and it was 20- 30 dollars higher at the local stores.</li>
            <li>Not the same fragrance and doesn&#x27;t last as long but still my favorite</li>
            <li>Oh, and the seller, what a great person to deal with, this is the second time I&#x27;ve bought from her, and needless to say...</li>
            <li>I am now 57 years old.  </li>
            <li>Obviously old bottle of brew.</li>
            <li>Old school fragrance that will have EVERYONE you walk by, turning their head to follow your scent.  </li>
            <li>This was an order placed by a 92 yr old gentlemen for his 90 yr old wife for Valentines Day.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to the person who knew what to do and he never &amp;#34; left me hanging like a dangling</li>
            <li>My husband used to say he didn&#x27;t like it, so the last bottle I bought (before this one) was shortly after we married in 1990.  </li>
            <li>My wife has worn the original Opium for over 20 years but this new formula is different and smells cheap and lousy.  </li>
            <li>I have been wearing this fragrance for over 20 years, since the new bottle has been introduced the scent is not the same, unless my bottle was mislabeled.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t smell good bad very not safity with  these two bottles.</li>
            <li>I have heard the manufacturers can no longer receive supply of a certain ingredient that came from a faraway country whose borders have been closed.</li>
            <li>but she&#x27;s worth it-she tells me that a few times a year.</li>
            <li>It is a shame you pay that much money for something that seems to be watered down.  </li>

            <li> but i&#x27;m keeping it on there for my own prevention of clumsiness.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy when the formula changed but am now ok with it - primarily since I have no choice.  </li>
            <li> I personally LOVE this too and the price is fantastic to anywhere in my area!!</li>

            <li> She loves me that much more now.</li>
            <li> The price was even better...</li>

            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite.  </li>
            <li> My favorite for decades.</li>
            <li> Her and I were satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Opium for years and love it</li>
            <li> love this fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Wifes favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> She love it</li>
            <li> My wife loves this scent, and I love it on her.  </li>
            <li> Love this perfume.</li>
            <li> love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sure that was just for packaging</li>
            <li> Have used Opium for over 25 years and love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I WILL SURELY RECOMMEND THIS OPIU</li>
            <li> My signature scent since it launched, many, many years ago.  </li>
            <li> This perfume has been my favorite for many years.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;it&#x27; is her favorite [P.S. Our cat loves it when my wife &#x27;wears&#x27; it]</li>
            <li> For perfume one uses regulary, one couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin has its own unique chemistry</li>
            <li> Lasts almost 6 hours on my skin, which is pretty good in my book, and lasts even longer when sprayed on top of the matching body moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Given to my daughter  for Christmas, no complaint, happy with the product..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a warm, spicy scent that is as perfect as hot cocoa during the holidays.</li>
            <li> But if other people commit to you about how wonderful the perfume is you are wearing - take notice - and if many compliments come in - stick with that one.  </li>
            <li> I received my order in perfect condition and have absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li> This is the same great product at a better price.  </li>
            <li> The changes have still maintained the strong musk and eastern undertones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that this is a darker scent than most that I own, very masculine</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t expect it to be like the original one, you will be fine :)</li>
            <li> A cheap knock off of the original smells better than this</li>
            <li> Shame on Yves St Laurent for doing this to its loyal wearers!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased &amp; highly recommend this company.</li>
            <li> everyone wants to know what it is she has own.,</li>
            <li> cheap aftermarket knock off</li>
            <li> The perfume was a great gift for several friends.  </li>
            <li> i love the perfume and it is much more reasonable on line</li>
            <li> this will give several ladies a smell good feel for many months.</li>
            <li> A real 5 STAR  company !!!</li>
            <li> This product is not an original perfume from Yves Saint Lauren, this perfume did not meet my expectation.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY if you like the original.</li>
            <li> For my wife&#x27;s last birthday, she told me she was out of her favorite cologne, Opium for Women, so I jumped on-line and went to Ebay, Dillards, Macy&#x27;s, and finally Amazon where I found the best price of all those I compared.</li>
            <li> I am never disappointed.</li>
            <li> Smells nothing like the original.  </li>
            <li> Why didn&#x27;t they keep the original and name this one &amp;#34;Almost Opium?.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;Have used Opium almost since it was first introduced and still love it.  </li>
            <li> It was $60 for 3 Fl.oz as compared to $90 elsewhere but all in original packaging and sealed (I was worried it may be</li>
            <li> This is nothing like the original Opium.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably not as popular as some of the new fragrances</li>
            <li> Seems to be different, but still pleasant.</li>
            <li> This was a gift -- she wears it everyday and has for many years -- very nice.</li>
            <li> Wearing Opium, makes me feel so feminine and special.</li>
            <li> My wife has loved Opium over the years but this product does not have the same odor or intensity.</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely LOVED this as a birthday present.</li>
            <li> do I really need to say how lovely it is…..</li>
            <li> But use it sparingly it can get overwhelming if you spritz too much.  </li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li> My wife loved it and it beat the local prices a lot !!</li>
            <li> Spicy fragrance especially nice for those special nights or to warm up a cold winter night.</li>
            <li> If possible, probably the best thing to do is buy it at your local department store.</li>
            <li> And now with the great price I don&#x27;t have to save it for special occasions anymore and can afford to wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> and last night he told me i smelled so sexy!  </li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive when I got this since I used to love the original and had heard the new wasn&#x27;t as good...</li>
            <li> but, it is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> If you buy this product on line buy it from the manufacturer because if you don&#x27;t like it they told me they would make it right.</li>
            <li> It was the right price at the right time.</li>
            <li> Nice aroma and lasts quite a while for toilet water.</li>
            <li> Wow this one she rely love that smell of fragrance and the price and fast shipping</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly and was so much cheaper than going to one of the stores in the mall to purchase.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the same as the old one but its still a good fragrance.</li>
            <li> wife likes it very much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only one I use any more.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, it will do, but its not the same at all.</li>
            <li> the same why change a winning formula.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite, I wear it daily!</li>
            <li> It is the only perfume that I have received so many compliments on</li>
            <li> This was my signature scent for years from the time it first came out.  </li>
            <li> Is the comment I got the first time I wore it.  </li>
            <li> Only perfume I have used for many years.</li>
            <li> this is not the first time I have gotten Opium Spray.  </li>
            <li> exactly what I ordered.  </li>
            <li> Opium is my favorite perfume, and I received exactly what I ordered in a very short period of time.  </li>
            <li> The Opium Perfume Spray Bottles are exactly what I wanted..</li>
            <li> Opium Perfume&#x27;s my favorite scent above all others .</li>
            <li> Item exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li> I love Opium as it is not overwhelmingly strong but a nice, soft fragrance.</li>
            <li> This has been my signature fragrance since it was released in the 70&#x27;s, but usually is too expensive, found this at a good price; good value, love this one.</li>
            <li> Classic, sexy and highly addictive.  </li>
            <li> My wife loves it - an easy Christmas present.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that I was able to buy my perfume for $60 when normally the only place I could buy it is Younkers for $90!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased and will definitely order perfume from Amazon again, especially if it is through Discount Perfumes.</li>
            <li> A sweet scented perfume that brought a big smile to my fiancee</li>
            <li> It smells good to me, and I&#x27;m just a normal all American male.  </li>
            <li> It is a classic in my opinion!</li>
            <li> Very high scented .</li>
            <li> The delivery was very speedy.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> but it did - look it up) has been diluted in strength and spicy intense &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; that it used to have.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much sweeter</li>
            <li> I have worn it for years, and have never tired of it.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> This is not something that I know much about.  </li>
            <li> Was shipped and received in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> she uses it in the correct manner and really gets a lot of use out of it.</li>
            <li> She really likes it and the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> And much much cheaper that you can find in any store.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift knowing it will be appreciated</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Item was shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks to a person who knew what to do when the Opium Perfume was delivered to my home..only to find 2 Spray Bottles of Opium eau de Toilette had been delivered.  </li>
            <li> Very prompt shipping.  </li>
            <li> She only wears one other perfume and she loved this.</li>
            <li> Not only did I get the latest newly designed bottle of Opium for Women, but I saved enough money to buy my wife a dozen of her favorite yellow roses.</li>
            <li> I want the original scent back</li>
            <li> Classic scent that is very sensual.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance and it does die down to a nice long lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what the doctor ordered to cheer my old worry bones up.  </li>
            <li> (Too bad I couldn&#x27;t get more compliments on how good I looked, but, I will accept the smelly compliments.)  </li>
            <li> This most recent purchase was not the same .There was no smell on the skin at all.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly as promised&amp;#62; Highly recommend</li>
            <li> The price is getting so high.</li>
            <li> love the new bottle and the little neck piece that keeps it from spraying accidentally.  </li>
            <li> I have been wearing Opium for 30 years, the new version (which if you ask anyone at the YSL counter NEVER happened -</li>
            <li> I have worn Opium for 30 years and just purchased the new version.  </li>
            <li> till I got the new formula.  </li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t understand what the gripe is about the new formula.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this so it gets 5 stars price is very reasonable compared to local stores ,she has used it for years.</li>
            <li> Came on time and my wife was very surprised.  </li>
            <li> I usually get it in a cologne or Eau de Toilette, since that is much more affordable for me, I prefer it in a spray also.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll see if I can find a foreign knock-off of the original.</li>
            <li> She wanted some for Christmas and it was 20- 30 dollars higher at the local stores.</li>
            <li> Not the same fragrance and doesn&#x27;t last as long but still my favorite</li>
            <li> Oh, and the seller, what a great person to deal with, this is the second time I&#x27;ve bought from her, and needless to say...</li>
            <li> I am now 57 years old.  </li>
            <li> Obviously old bottle of brew.</li>
            <li> Old school fragrance that will have EVERYONE you walk by, turning their head to follow your scent.  </li>
            <li> This was an order placed by a 92 yr old gentlemen for his 90 yr old wife for Valentines Day.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to the person who knew what to do and he never &amp;#34; left me hanging like a dangling</li>
            <li> My husband used to say he didn&#x27;t like it, so the last bottle I bought (before this one) was shortly after we married in 1990.  </li>
            <li> My wife has worn the original Opium for over 20 years but this new formula is different and smells cheap and lousy.  </li>
            <li> I have been wearing this fragrance for over 20 years, since the new bottle has been introduced the scent is not the same, unless my bottle was mislabeled.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t smell good bad very not safity with  these two bottles.</li>
            <li> I have heard the manufacturers can no longer receive supply of a certain ingredient that came from a faraway country whose borders have been closed.</li>
            <li> but she&#x27;s worth it-she tells me that a few times a year.</li>
            <li> It is a shame you pay that much money for something that seems to be watered down.  </li>
            <li> My wife uses very little and it goes a long way and really lasts .</li>
            <li> Scent lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using Opium for maybe as long as it&#x27;s been around.</li>
            <li> The fragrance lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Long story short.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The other day I was stopped outside by a woman asking... &amp;#34;WHAT are you wearing?</li>
            <li> A hard to find classic.  </li>
            <li> NOT real Opium...</li>
            <li> It was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> Spicy with a peppery under tone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try to find someone to give it to, but I&#x27;ll certainly never wear it again.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was a foreign knock-off or something.  </li>
            <li> and she has never mentioned noticing the formula change I have read other reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li> I have tried other Eau de Toilette Sprays</li>
            <li> The eau de toilette and perfume have different formulas, and I think reviewers found that confusing.  </li>
            <li> smells nothing like the real Opium, my wife and i think it smells like a cheep drug store fake.</li>
            <li> To me it is just a lighter version of the original which isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing. &#x27;</li>
            <li> It is a little costly</li>
            <li> poured it down the sink!  </li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t smell anything like it has in the past.  </li>
            <li> I wish the procuct came in a small travel size.</li>
            <li> NOT Satisfied at all.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I am very unhappy with this new Opium formulation.  </li>
            <li> An absolute necessity during cold nights!</li>
            <li> I was very angry and sad about the purchase and would like to have my money back as soon as possible</li>
            <li> It has hardly any smell to it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Opium for at least 20 years now.  </li>
            <li> I have worn Opium Eau de  toilette for at least 18 years.  </li>
            <li> I have been wearing Opium toilette since the late 70&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I was afraid to order product online, especially reading some reviews from people who said the fragrance has changed.  </li>
            <li> I mean YEARS.  </li>
            <li> I waited for a ridiculous length of time.</li>
            <li> No more trips to Mexico to purchase the product at the Ueta!!</li>
            <li> Not happy with Adams Senior Speedline.</li>
            <li> Sorry YSL.</li>
            <li> This product is identical in every way with the packaging and contents delivered at expensive department stores.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely addicted to Opium this winter!</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> Opium is my fragance of choice, however, it is quite expensive at the department store.  </li>
            <li> Hate fragrances that knock everybody over in a room for hours.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is beyond awful now</li>
            <li> Terrible, just terrible.  </li>
            <li> but it is the worst smell ever!  </li>
            <li> It is HORRIBLE!  </li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Wow this one she rely love that smell of fragrance and the price and fast shipping I recommended this perfume to my girlfriend.</li>
            <li> Smells very good. The bottle is a bit different from before. It also affects the fragrance just a bit. Scent lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> This is the only fragrance I will let my wife use. Love the fragrance and it does die down to a nice long lasting fragrance. Hate fragrances that knock everybody over in a room for hours.</li>
            <li> This product is not an original perfume from Yves Saint Lauren, this perfume did not meet my expectation.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly as promised&amp;#62; Highly recommend</li>
            <li> A sweet scented perfume that brought a big smile to my fiancee</li>
            <li> I love this scent--so does my husband.  It is wonderful &amp; I&#x27;m very picky about colognes.  The packaging was excellent &amp; it arrived on time.  Will definitely keep ordering it.  Price was good too.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good quality case.  It is a gift and can&#x27;t be used until Christmas is the reason I rated 4 star.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this fragrance for over 20 years, since the new bottle has been introduced the scent is not the same, unless my bottle was mislabeled.  I used to love this, but now I will always make them give me a tester before I buy</li>
            <li> I love Opium and I found this to be a site for the best price/value for the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was even delivered to my door!! No more trips to Mexico to purchase the product at the Ueta!!</li>
            <li> great tings happen when she uses it. one if not the best perfumes on the market. everyone wants to know what it is she has own.,</li>
            <li> perfect and the price was amazing. The delivery was very speedy. Great product.</li>
            <li> Excellent perfume .My wife likes it very much</li>
            <li> The other day I was stopped outside by a woman asking... &amp;#34;WHAT are you wearing? It smells so good!&amp;#34;  I told her.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price. Thanks</li>
            <li> NOT real Opium...cheap aftermarket knock off</li>
            <li> This is the best perfume that I have ever worn.  It&#x27;s the only one I use any more.  Love it.</li>
            <li> My wife has loved Opium over the years but this product does not have the same odor or intensity. Maybe the perfume is better? If you buy this product on line buy it from the manufacturer because if you don&#x27;t like it they told me they would make it right. However it is more expensive. If possible, probably the best thing to do is buy it at your local department store. You can&#x27;t return it on line but you can locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be helpful if Amazon were to explain up front that perfumes can&#x27;t be returned and why!</li>
            <li> I have worn Opium for years, but the fragrance seems to be different. I think Yves Saint Laurent has changed the formula, or maybe I&#x27;m just so used to the scent after all these years..</li>
            <li> It really was opium not a copy its great my mother loves it and it was delivered on time the price is extremely good</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Opium for 30 years, the new version (which if you ask anyone at the YSL counter NEVER happened - but it did - look it up) has been diluted in strength and spicy intense &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; that it used to have.  I also buy the mini&#x27;s which seem to be much more potent for some reason.  It&#x27;s okay, it will do, but its not the same at all.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. Best quality perfume, I strongly recommend, you won&#x27;t regret. 5 stars for YSL...</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful fragrance! It was a great price on Amazon. I would recommend it to anyone who likes very good perfume and doesn&#x27;t want to pay retail prices at the mall.</li>
            <li> Gift for sister-in-law for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Excelent product, excelent price !!</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I am very unhappy with this new Opium formulation.  We had no idea that it had changed.  My wife has worn the original Opium for over 20 years but this new formula is different and smells cheap and lousy.  DO NOT BUY if you like the original.</li>
            <li> For my wife&#x27;s last birthday, she told me she was out of her favorite cologne, Opium for Women, so I jumped on-line and went to Ebay, Dillards, Macy&#x27;s, and finally Amazon where I found the best price of all those I compared. One thing about buying from Amazon you know you will get the product you asked for and not some knockoff, shipped to you in a milk carton. Not only did I get the latest newly designed bottle of Opium for Women, but I saved enough money to buy my wife a dozen of her favorite yellow roses. Oh, and the seller, what a great person to deal with, this is the second time I&#x27;ve bought from her, and needless to say...\\&quot;I will be back\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Easy purchase!! Simple, Thank You!!</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely LOVED this as a birthday present. She only wears one other perfume and she loved this. Great buy for 3oz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this scent for over 20 years and it isn&#x27;t&#x27;t the same why change a winning formula. It&#x27;s much sweeter&lt;br /&gt;Now. I want the original scent back</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly and was so much cheaper than going to one of the stores in the mall to purchase.  I love Opium and have used it for years.  This was an excellent purchase with fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite, I wear it daily!</li>
            <li> Already reviewed this.  Nice aroma and lasts quite a while for toilet water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Opium for at least 20 years now.  It&#x27;s probably not as popular as some of the new fragrances but I get lots of complements whenever I wear it (which is daily!)</li>
            <li> I have used Opium for years -- I mean YEARS.  It is the only perfume that I have received so many compliments on I could not count them all.  Everyone&#x27;s skin has its own unique chemistry so one perfume that works for one may not work for another.  But if other people commit to you about how wonderful the perfume is you are wearing - take notice - and if many compliments come in - stick with that one.  I received my order in perfect condition and have absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li> This was my signature scent for years from the time it first came out.  I stopped using it for some reason, but decided to try it again.  After about 25 years, my preferences have changed and I find this much too heavy now.  I&#x27;ll try to find someone to give it to, but I&#x27;ll certainly never wear it again.  Sorry YSL.</li>
            <li> Always get compliments when I where it.</li>
            <li> OPIUM by Yves Saint Laurent is one of my favorite perfumes. I usually get it in a cologne or Eau de Toilette, since that is much more affordable for me, I prefer it in a spray also.</li>
            <li> OMG they have changed this formulation!  It is beyond awful now, it doesn&#x27;t smell anything like it has in the past.  A cheap knock off of the original smells better than this, why oh why did it have to change?  I have been wearing this for 30 years and now have to find an alternative.  Terrible, just terrible.  Shame on Yves St Laurent for doing this to its loyal wearers!</li>
            <li> All I ever wear.  Always get comments on how good I smell.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume! A mixture of musk &amp; flowers make an amazing scent ! I also like that the bottle always gives you the perfect spray of this wonderful perfume.</li>
            <li> My wife likes it, I don&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> It was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> This has been my signature fragrance since it was released in the 70&#x27;s, but usually is too expensive, found this at a good price; good value, love this one.</li>
            <li> My favorite fregrance of all time and the It has earthy flavors to it If you like flowers this isn&#x27;t the fregrance for you.. the price was great!</li>
            <li> My wife has been using Opium for maybe as long as it&#x27;s been around. It is my favorite scent on her, and she gets compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> I love Opium. I have worn it for years, and have never tired of it. Wearing Opium, makes me feel so feminine and special.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE. CHRISTMAS GIFT TO MY MOM.......HER FAVORITE.  HAS BEEN USINF OPIUM FOR YEARS AND I PURCHASE EVERY YEAR AT CHRISTMAS.</li>
            <li> do I really need to say how lovely it is….. I know it for about 40 years --- I am never disappointed. Hildegard Kleiser</li>
            <li> I started using opium in the 7th grade.  I am now 57 years old.  I only wear opium. The price is getting so high.</li>
            <li> I have been using this opium product since the 70&#x27;s...This most recent purchase was not the same .There was no smell on the skin at all. I was very angry and sad about the purchase and would like to have my money back as soon as possible so I can buy it somewhere else!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this as my signature fragrance for many, many years. I receive compliments all the time on how nice it smells. I love Opium as it is not overwhelmingly strong but a nice, soft fragrance. I gladly recommend it to others!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter has been wearing this perfume for years and years.  It was the right price at the right time.</li>
            <li> I bought this at the request of a friend and she died before she could use it, Someone else has it now.</li>
            <li> is how my husband likes it....and he does!  But use it sparingly it can get overwhelming if you spritz too much.  I like to spray a tissue and then dab a bit on my pulse points.  Then I tuck the tissue in a drawer, it will perfume my clothing a bit that way.</li>
            <li> I love Opium and I love the price I get here on Amazon Prime.  I have worn Opium for over 30 years and finding it at a great price, when I need it is the best!</li>
            <li> Could not have satisfied my wife&#x27;s superior satisfaction !!!!!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this so it gets 5 stars price is very reasonable compared to local stores ,she has used it for years.</li>
            <li> I just love this fragrance!! I wear it jusfor me!!&lt;br /&gt;I have worn it forever, like 30 - 35 years and still receive compliments today...</li>
            <li> The product came in perfect conditions.</li>
            <li> This is another great product from Yves Saint Laurent, really worth the money and always gets a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite fragrance for years and is as good as ever.&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers claim that the formula has changed. The eau de toilette and perfume have different formulas, and I think reviewers found that confusing.  I wish the procuct came in a small travel size.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what they did to Opium but it is the worst smell ever!  I have worn Opium for 30 years and just purchased the new version.  \\&quot;What is that smell?\\&quot;  Is the comment I got the first time I wore it.  It is HORRIBLE!  It smells nothing like the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I poured it down the sink!  YSL should be ashamed to put their brand on this stench.</li>
            <li> I went to Egypt in &#x27;85 as a Marine.  They have malls that are just perfume stores there (perfume was invented there).  While there I searched for that perfect perfume for my then girlfriend.  I went store to store smell testing till one stood out and it was Opium.  I&#x27;ve purchased it ever since till I got the new formula.  I thought it was a foreign knock-off or something.  Smells nothing like the original.  Why didn&#x27;t they keep the original and name this one &amp;#34;Almost Opium?.  I think I&#x27;ll see if I can find a foreign knock-off of the original.</li>
            <li> It has hardly any smell to it.  It is a shame you pay that much money for something that seems to be watered down.  After several attempts of trying it I am going to see baout returning it.  NOT Satisfied at all.</li>
            <li> This has been her favorite cologne for years and she has never mentioned noticing the formula change I have read other reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li> The famous perfume at a good price. This product is identical in every way with the packaging and contents delivered at expensive department stores.</li>
            <li> This was a gift -- she wears it everyday and has for many years -- very nice. She loves it! Thanks</li>
            <li> Very high scented . My wife uses very little and it goes a long way and really lasts . A great buy</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. Obviously old bottle of brew. Lost its smell and Amazon won&#x27;t take back. Buyer beware on discounted fragrances.</li>
            <li> been wearing this perfume for years.  i always have compliments of &amp;#34;how good i smell&amp;#34; so i guess i wont be changing anytime soon</li>
            <li> It smells good to me, and I&#x27;m just a normal all American male.  This is not something that I know much about.  I was told to get this and she was very happy. Period.</li>
            <li> &#x27;Have used Opium almost since it was first introduced and still love it.  I wasn&#x27;t happy when the formula changed but am now ok with it - primarily since I have no choice.  To me it is just a lighter version of the original which isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing. &#x27;Received it promptly and in perfect condition as I do all Amazon purchases.</li>
            <li> Always a favorite, Opium is my signature fragrance.</li>
            <li> Classic, sexy and highly addictive.  Old school fragrance that will have EVERYONE you walk by, turning their head to follow your scent.  So glad I purchased Opium.  Was shipped and received in a very timely manner. Very happy about my decision.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn it for years. Love it.  Spicy with a peppery under tone.</li>
            <li> Good seller, My sister loved it.</li>
            <li> Have used this before, well pleased.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. Doesn&#x27;t ware anything else. Pricey, but she&#x27;s worth it-she tells me that a few times a year.</li>
            <li> My mother loved this perfume!!</li>
            <li> got the product intact and at a good price  i love the perfume and it is much more reasonable on line</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this cologne for over 30 years and I still get compliments on it.  It&#x27;s my signature scent.</li>
            <li> My only brand of perfume</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  I get compliments almost every time I wear it!</li>
            <li> Mostly good. Not happy with Adams Senior Speedline. Lost 72 dollars when I sold them.</li>
            <li> My job is to deal with clients and as always i got compliments,some had asked the brand of perfume im using.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfum that my wife wears. She is very beautiful, and when she  wears Opium, she owns the room!</li>
            <li> excellent product.  My wife truly enjoys it she uses it in the correct manner and really gets a lot of use out of it.</li>
            <li> smells nothing like the real Opium, my wife and i think it smells like a cheep drug store fake. Beware buyers!!</li>
            <li> Always love my opium.</li>
            <li> This was an order placed by a 92 yr old gentlemen for his 90 yr old wife for Valentines Day.  All aspects of the purchase and delivery went well and she received the purchase on Valentines Day!</li>
            <li> My mother was so happy when she got this. She loves this perfume. I was so happy it came so fast and I was able to get it to IL ontime for the holiday.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the product and great service I received. A real 5 STAR  company !!! I will be doing more business with them !</li>
            <li> She loves me that much more now.</li>
            <li> Only perfume I have used for many years.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell any better than this!</li>
            <li> Not the same fragrance and doesn&#x27;t last as long but still my favorite</li>
            <li> My favorite! Good price as well...</li>
            <li> The perfume was a great gift for several friends.  The price was even better...this will give several ladies a smell good feel for many months.</li>
            <li> I have worn Opium for close to 35 years and love it.  It does not matter whether it is daytime or nighttime, as some say.  It is good anytime.</li>
            <li> This made me happy when my lady sprays it on so.....I&#x27;m happy. LOL.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it - an easy Christmas present.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s all time favorite. I always make sure She is well supplied with this wonderful fragrance. I love Opium on Her.</li>
            <li> No, I think not!!!  LOL  This is exactly what the doctor ordered to cheer my old worry bones up.  I love this product.  The smell is so relaxing and I get many compliments saying how great I smell.  (Too bad I couldn&#x27;t get more compliments on how good I looked, but, I will accept the smelly compliments.)  It is a little costly but, it is well worth the money.  I love it!!!!  Matter of fact this is not the first time I have gotten Opium Spray.  I have tried other Eau de Toilette Sprays and I always come back to this one.  If you are thinking about not getting this product because of the price, STOP.......you will not be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> Got this as a Chirstmas Gif for my wife . She really likes it and the price was reasonable. The fragrance lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Best price I could find this for.  My wife loves it. She wanted some for Christmas and it was 20- 30 dollars higher at the local stores.</li>
            <li> A happy wife is a happy husband!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume. Great aroma without being overpowering. And my boyfriend loves it too. Makes me feel sexy</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive when I got this since I used to love the original and had heard the new wasn&#x27;t as good...But it is still a good fragrance. It&#x27;s not the same as the old one but its still a good fragrance. The changes have still maintained the strong musk and eastern undertones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t expect it to be like the original one, you will be fine :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has one of the best prices and that has helped with my rating too ! It was $60 for 3 Fl.oz as compared to $90 elsewhere but all in original packaging and sealed (I was worried it may be a tester).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a good buy for the price!</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I was looking for! And much much cheaper that you can find in any store. I actually bought this for my moms birthday and will be getting another for my aunts birthday.</li>
            <li> This is nothing like the original Opium.  I have heard the manufacturers can no longer receive supply of a certain ingredient that came from a faraway country whose borders have been closed.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely addicted to Opium this winter! It&#x27;s such a warm, spicy scent that is as perfect as hot cocoa during the holidays. An absolute necessity during cold nights! I love that this is a darker scent than most that I own, very masculine and it could definitely pass as unisex. Lasts almost 6 hours on my skin, which is pretty good in my book, and lasts even longer when sprayed on top of the matching body moisturizer. I&#x27;m a huge fan of Opium and would recommend it to all!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that I was able to buy my perfume for $60 when normally the only place I could buy it is Younkers for $90! In the future I&#x27;ll check online before I buy local. Sorry.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite.  It came rapidly and well packed.  No negatives noted.  Bought as a gift knowing it will be appreciated</li>
            <li> Almost brings back memories of the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s, but not quite the same fragrance.  Seems to be different, but still pleasant.</li>
            <li> A hard to find classic.  My favorite for decades.</li>
            <li> My mom loved her gift that I got for her. This is her favorite perfume!! Her and I were satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Opium for years and love it and this is the best price around.&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have worn Opium Eau de  toilette for at least 18 years.  It is my very favorite perfume.  I always get wonderful compliments on this perfume.  It is a classic in my opinion!</li>
            <li> Received as advertised and earlier than promised.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite.  It out does time.  love this fragrance.  Looking forward to another year of smelling great.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase. A happy Wife is good news for me!!! This would be good news for you too!!! THANKS</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t understand what the gripe is about the new formula. I wouldn&#x27;t have even smelled the difference and still don&#x27;t. I have been wearing Opium toilette since the late 70&#x27;s and I&#x27;m still getting compliments no matter which formula it is.</li>
            <li> This is the same great product at a better price.  Came on time and my wife was very surprised.  Good deal!</li>
            <li> Wifes favorite perfume. She love it</li>
            <li> My wife loves this scent, and I love it on her.  We find the best prices, and prompt delivery from Amazon and it&#x27;s suppliers.  Never have had a problem.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this on-line and in the stores and couldn&#x27;t believe the difference in the price on amazon. It is my perfume of choice and will order it again. And now with the great price I don&#x27;t have to save it for special occasions anymore and can afford to wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> A gift given to a dear friend.  I personally LOVE this too and the price is fantastic to anywhere in my area!!</li>
            <li> Wife likes this a lot one of her favorite,  smells good to.</li>
            <li> This was the best buy I have ever seen on the internet.  Perfect condition and exactly what I ordered.  I appreciate a&lt;br /&gt;great buy and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Given to my daughter  for Christmas, no complaint, happy with the product..</li>
            <li> Very happy with the purchases and delivery!&lt;br /&gt;B. Sweeney</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t smell good bad very not safity with  these two bottles. Had to go buy it a retail...no happy.....</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. Smells wonderful!!  Item was shipped fast.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to order product online, especially reading some reviews from people who said the fragrance has changed.  I have one scarf from 1980s that still has the scent on it, and the scent hasn&#x27;t changed at all.  My husband used to say he didn&#x27;t like it, so the last bottle I bought (before this one) was shortly after we married in 1990.  but i missed it and wanted it so i got it for myself now that i&#x27;m 50.  and last night he told me i smelled so sexy!  oooooo!  love it!&lt;br /&gt;and love the new bottle and the little neck piece that keeps it from spraying accidentally.  i&#x27;m sure that was just for packaging but i&#x27;m keeping it on there for my own prevention of clumsiness.</li>
            <li> Nice size gift for a good price.</li>
            <li> Have used Opium for over 25 years and love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This order, from Amazon, was byfar the best deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Planning on making another order soon (so I have backup of my cologne).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> I WILL SURELY RECOMMEND THIS OPIU PARFUME TO ANY OF MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY BECAUSE IT SMELL REALLY GOOD AND IT LAST LONGER.</li>
            <li> My signature scent since it launched, many, many years ago.  Never disappoints.  Get compliments always. Love it!</li>
            <li> llegó en perfecto estado y rapidisimo!! se recomienda el producto me encanta! excelente proveedor muy buena compra! mejor imposible. &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> Classic scent that is very sensual. Spicy fragrance especially nice for those special nights or to warm up a cold winter night.</li>
            <li> SIEMPRE ES GRATO ESTE PERFUME</li>
            <li> This perfume has been my favorite for many years.  Just a spritz leaves you smelling wonderful all day.  This has proven to be one of my favorites for years!!</li>
            <li> Opium is my fragance of choice, however, it is quite expensive at the department store.  I was glad to find it at a discounted price!</li>
            <li> Opium is my favorite perfume, and I received exactly what I ordered in a very short period of time.  I was very pleased and will definitely order perfume from Amazon again, especially if it is through Discount Perfumes.</li>
            <li> Opium is my favorite scent!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased &amp; highly recommend this company.</li>
            <li> My wife loved it and it beat the local prices a lot !! :o)</li>
            <li> Gift for wife and &#x27;it&#x27; is her favorite [P.S. Our cat loves it when my wife &#x27;wears&#x27; it]</li>
            <li> Thanks to a person who knew what to do when the Opium Perfume was delivered to my home..only to find 2 Spray Bottles of Opium eau de Toilette had been delivered.  This Was NOT what I&#x27;d ordered. Long story short.&lt;br /&gt;  After filing a separate claim for each bottle of the Toilette...sending both bottles to California..had insured the package, (paid for a signature card from the recipient )...I waited for a ridiculous length of time. .and Thankfully found a Customer Rep. who helped me through the&lt;br /&gt;intanglement my situation had become.&lt;br /&gt;  I am happy to say that the 2 payments I&#x27;d made for the Opium Toilette Spray had been returned to my bank. Thanks to the person who knew what to do and he never &amp;#34; left me hanging like a dangling participle.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;  The Opium Perfume Spray Bottles are exactly what I wanted.. And they arrived without a hitch!&lt;br /&gt;  Opium Perfume&#x27;s my favorite scent above all others . I&#x27;m very happy to have the dilemma settled, and I&#x27;m enjoying my perfume every day!&lt;br /&gt;  Grateful to the Dedicated Customer Representitive ...who kept his word, and followed through to the culmination of this confusion.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks from a Happy Woman :-)&lt;br /&gt; Denver, Colorado&lt;br /&gt;Deborah A. Conway</li>
            <li> Wife loved, recommended</li>
            <li> Very prompt shipping.  Item exactly as promised.  And I did not have to leave my house.  For perfume one uses regulary, one couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this fragrance for 35 years exclusively and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
