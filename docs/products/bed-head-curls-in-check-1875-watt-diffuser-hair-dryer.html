            <li>THIS DRYER IS THE BEST I&#x27;ve used for my very curly hair.</li>
            <li>It kind of hurts our heads.</li>
            <li>This is truly the BEST blow dryer for naturally curly headed gals!!!</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Funky wild color and works great on my curls!</li>
            <li>My natural curls look their best.</li>
            <li>Best blow dryer ever for my wild curls.</li>
            <li>I have spiral-curly hair and this by far is the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li>Love this, keeps my curls nice and not frizzes out.</li>
            <li>Awesome for naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this diffuser.</li>
            <li>However, I would prefer to have the teeth longer and better way to cup the hair so to speak.</li>
            <li>This has made my curly hair more manageable.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this product:)</li>
            <li>Curly girls, you&#x27;re hair will love this.</li>
            <li>Favorite buy from Amazon, ever.</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Was hoping this could replace my hair dryer &amp; diffuser combo and assumed it would be more compact.</li>
            <li>I do wish the prongs of the diffuser were a more flexible or softer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight perfect for people who use diffuser only.</li>
            <li>That can&#x27;t be safe.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try an appliance that was just a hairdryer with an attachment, but just a diffuser, specifically built for curly hair.  </li>
            <li>the cool button is a nice feature.</li>
            <li>I find it&#x27;s always best to air dry.</li>
            <li>Also, not having the dryer permanently attached to a wall means I can get into more comfortable positions while drying my hair.</li>
            <li>Also, not having the dryer permanently attached to a wall means I can get into more comfortable positions while drying my hair.</li>
            <li>(I notice none of the photos provided really give a good view of the design of the fingers...)  </li>
            <li>ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s lightweight and has really good airflow that you can adjust (with that fingered attachment) if you don&#x27;t want as much as the head delivers on</li>
            <li>I have extremely curly hair and this dryer is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>First, I think it does a great job and dries my hair very fast.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m a 2c/3a with fine hair)</li>
            <li>Received quickly!</li>
            <li>do really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>The fingers are great for my short hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Firstly, in person, it looks/feels like cheaply made plastic.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad compared to what I&#x27;ve experienced at the hands of a regular hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Dries my fine curly hair quickly.</li>
            <li>Loves it and it can blow cool air too.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t as good as using a regular dryer and diffuser at all.</li>
            <li>I use it on the cool setting as to minimize heat damage.</li>
            <li>I think the diffuser needs to be smaller and curved more to better fit the shape of a person&#x27;s head.  </li>
            <li>I used to have to live the house with wet hair and hope for the best - not anymore!</li>
            <li>Makes my hair curly and dries it quickly.</li>
            <li>I think this would work better for women with short curly hair more than anything.</li>
            <li>The design is both clever and cute.</li>
            <li>It is adequate.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly without &amp;#34;drying out&amp;#34; my hair.</li>
            <li>At the same time, the &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; setting became so incredibly hot that the coils inside glowed bright orange.  </li>
            <li>Easy to manipulate and gently dries the hair.</li>
            <li>Powerful yet gently on my curls and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has three heat settings: cool, warm, and hot, which are independent of the airflow speed, as well as having a cool shot button.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has three heat settings: cool, warm, and hot, which are independent of the airflow speed, as well as having a cool shot button.</li>
            <li>Both dryers have negative ionic technology, which makes them preferable to the free hairdryers at hotels, the gym, and my therapy pool, as I always notice much more frizz when I use those dryers than when I use my own.</li>
            <li>has three heat settings, three pressure settings, and a cool shot, but as I said, I couldn&#x27;t even use the hot setting.  </li>
            <li>This one is light enough and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>and they were very helpful and agreed to send return labels and give me a full refund.</li>
            <li>It’s a little more than I’d like, considering I have fibromyalgia, and I don’t need any help making my arms and shoulders ache, but it’s still better than getting hypothermia, pneumonia, or bronchitis.</li>

            <li>It really dries my hair quickly without blowing it around.  </li>
            <li>Easy to handle and not heavy.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get really hot.</li>
            <li>This is my first diffuser dryer</li>
            <li>Makes washing my hair more often possible.</li>
            <li>is that with the short diffuser fingers, it is easy to hold the dryer to your head/scalp, and that may provide better volume for those with SHORT, curly hair.</li>
            <li>BUT, this morning, I used it on the medium heat setting, as usual, it started smoking, the coils inside turned bright orange and sparks flew out.</li>
            <li>To be honest, although it did dry my hair much faster than a regular hair dryer with a diffuser and my curls looked good, I noticed almost from the beginning that my hair wasn&#x27;t shiny anymore and appeared to be VERY dry on the ends, like it was being damaged.</li>
            <li>Nice hair dryer, I don&#x27;t have to flip my head upside down to use it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heat in this isn&#x27;t as hot as I would like it to be, compared to my normal hair dryer that gets really hot.</li>
            <li>As I have only one working hand, this diffuser is easy for me to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy enough to snap on the diffuser head</li>
            <li>the Conair, the Curlipops allows you to position the diffuser the way you want to, and for me that’s so that there aren’t large gaps between the dryer fan and your hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a fine dryer, and I use it occasionally when I&#x27;m in a hurry, but for curly hair</li>
            <li>I actually love how this dryer performs but it looses its motor and heat too quickly, had to send back to the manufacturer within 4 months already once and doing the same thing again</li>
            <li>Thanks again</li>
            <li>I had not changed any products(I only use an alcohol free mousse), so had to come to the conclusion that it was this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I really like the price.</li>
            <li>I was still too chicken to try it with pixiecurling, but used the method Jessica McGuinty (of Jessicurl) uses in her hair drying video &amp;#60;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;cyyOypbTHI0&amp;#62;, and it worked great!</li>
            <li>A real diffuser does not blow your hair; it heats your hair.  </li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t have much &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34; to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is so much easier than putting attachments on another hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I really dislike this dryer.  </li>
            <li>I really need an appliance like this, and really wanted this one to work, but I do not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>Finally....a diffuser that I like as much as the one that died on me about a decade</li>
            <li>It also produced a bad burning smell on the hot mode, and the warm wasn&#x27;t warm</li>
            <li>but I am sticking to my normal hair dryer with diffuser attachment!</li>
            <li>The speed and heat settings make it super easy to tame the frizz.</li>
            <li>The circular motion blew all of my curls out (think if it like a fan you use to cool your house), and I don&#x27;t have that happen on my regular blow dryer.</li>
            <li>&amp; it gives me big full curls.</li>
            <li>I have low density, fine, naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>For those that may say perhaps it was this particular dryer, I tested another Curlipops dryer in the Ulta store and it also had the burning smell.</li>
            <li>I don’t use high speed because it disorganizes my curls.</li>
            <li>I don’t use high speed because it disorganizes my curls.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>At 6 weeks it stopped working completely!!</li>
            <li>I’m also unlikely to use hot, but it’s nice to have the option of finishing with cool air without having to hold the cool shot button down for an extended period of time.</li>

            <li>I found it so much easier and less fuzzier to apply product and let the hair dry on its own than to stand and let this dryer do its thing.</li>
            <li>first used it on the Low setting with Cool air, but one of the biggest problems I found was that if I put it on the Warm, or heaven&#x27;s forbid Hot setting, it immediately smelled like it was burning badly.</li>
            <li>I will say this is the first and last diffuser I will ever buy.</li>
            <li>The Conair has Hi, Off, and Lo, along with a cool shot button, so airspeed and heat, or lack thereof, are connected to each other, and I score another one for the Curlipops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>For those who don’t know, this is a method of drying curly hair, developed by someone who goes by “pixiecurl” on naturallycurly.com, in which you scrunch your hair into the bowl of a dryer’s diffuser with the dryer off, turn it on and dry that section of hair, then turn it off before repositioning the dryer: because the dryer isn’t on when you do the scrunching, curls stay better defined, but another factor is that your hair isn’t being pushed away by airflow when you’re positioning the dryer, only possibly an issue with a pancake style dryer.</li>
            <li>Both still weigh less than my mother’s non-ionic, folding, travel dryer, which I used once while I was moving her, then abandoned due to the abundant halo of frizz it created.</li>

            <li>I also did not like how the air circulated in circles compared to the air coming out of a regular hair dryer in a straight motion.</li>
            <li>dryers are listed as having the same weight, according to Amazon, though that’s really the shipping weight.</li>

            <li>I wanted to use it when I travel, but it is much too big to put in a suitcase.  </li>
            <li>direct toward your head.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little loud but worth it!</li>
            <li>Even when I put it back down to Cool and pushed it to the High air setting, it still smelled like it was burning.</li>
            <li>I had to diffuse my hair on low, and this wasn&#x27;t hot enough.</li>
            <li>Also, the low power was too low and the high power was too high.</li>
            <li>I have both straight and curly hair (blow dryer + round brush, straight.</li>
            <li>I will say, that my natural curls are not very tight, and my goal when diffusing my hair is to help maintain my curls with a low heat...</li>
            <li>My hair is now fine, loose to tight curls.</li>
            <li>It has plenty of power and dries well, but I had to return mine as it was so loud that it left my ears ringing.</li>
            <li>Hold for as long as you need, then turn the dryer off before moving to a new section.</li>
            <li>My hair dries quicker this this dryer, but it is not super hot.</li>
            <li>Any time this dryer is not full of hair and right up next to your scalp, it&#x27;s making a frizz mess.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>It was bigger than I expected and heavier than expected but it works better than the diffuser that came with my other dryer.</li>
            <li>It may be that I have a heightened sense of safety awareness, after working in health care for 38 years, but the Conair’s clipping on in a way that kept the gaps as wide as possible didn’t give me a whole lot of confidence that it would work well for “pixiecurling.”</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier to use than the conventional blow dryer with the diffuser attachment.</li>
            <li>While I normally air dry, I started using a diffuser last Fall.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 29 year old female who&#x27;s had long, curly hair all my life.</li>
            <li>I can now dry my curley hair in 10 minutes (on high) vs waiting two hours for my hair to air dry.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; setting then had as much power as the low setting had previously when it was working properly.  </li>
            <li>This diffuser does blow hair around a bit more than a traditional diffuser (for example, the old school ones w/ the black foam-like material), but this doesn&#x27;t bother me since my curls are uneven in texture and lend themselves to a beach-y, messy type of look.  </li>

            <li> ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s lightweight and has really good airflow that you can adjust (with that fingered attachment) if you don&#x27;t want as much as the head delivers on</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair and this dryer is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li> First, I think it does a great job and dries my hair very fast.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m a 2c/3a with fine hair)</li>
            <li> Received quickly!</li>
            <li> do really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> The fingers are great for my short hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Firstly, in person, it looks/feels like cheaply made plastic.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not bad compared to what I&#x27;ve experienced at the hands of a regular hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Dries my fine curly hair quickly.</li>
            <li> Loves it and it can blow cool air too.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as good as using a regular dryer and diffuser at all.</li>
            <li> I use it on the cool setting as to minimize heat damage.</li>
            <li> I think the diffuser needs to be smaller and curved more to better fit the shape of a person&#x27;s head.  </li>
            <li> I used to have to live the house with wet hair and hope for the best - not anymore!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair curly and dries it quickly.</li>
            <li> I think this would work better for women with short curly hair more than anything.</li>
            <li> The design is both clever and cute.</li>
            <li> It is adequate.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly without &amp;#34;drying out&amp;#34; my hair.</li>
            <li> At the same time, the &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; setting became so incredibly hot that the coils inside glowed bright orange.  </li>
            <li> Easy to manipulate and gently dries the hair.</li>
            <li> Powerful yet gently on my curls and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has three heat settings: cool, warm, and hot, which are independent of the airflow speed, as well as having a cool shot button.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has three heat settings: cool, warm, and hot, which are independent of the airflow speed, as well as having a cool shot button.</li>
            <li> Both dryers have negative ionic technology, which makes them preferable to the free hairdryers at hotels, the gym, and my therapy pool, as I always notice much more frizz when I use those dryers than when I use my own.</li>
            <li> has three heat settings, three pressure settings, and a cool shot, but as I said, I couldn&#x27;t even use the hot setting.  </li>
            <li> This one is light enough and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> and they were very helpful and agreed to send return labels and give me a full refund.</li>
            <li> It’s a little more than I’d like, considering I have fibromyalgia, and I don’t need any help making my arms and shoulders ache, but it’s still better than getting hypothermia, pneumonia, or bronchitis.</li>
            <li> It’s a little more than I’d like, considering I have fibromyalgia, and I don’t need any help making my arms and shoulders ache, but it’s still better than getting hypothermia, pneumonia, or bronchitis.</li>
            <li> It really dries my hair quickly without blowing it around.  </li>
            <li> Easy to handle and not heavy.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get really hot.</li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser dryer</li>
            <li> Makes washing my hair more often possible.</li>
            <li> is that with the short diffuser fingers, it is easy to hold the dryer to your head/scalp, and that may provide better volume for those with SHORT, curly hair.</li>
            <li> BUT, this morning, I used it on the medium heat setting, as usual, it started smoking, the coils inside turned bright orange and sparks flew out.</li>
            <li> To be honest, although it did dry my hair much faster than a regular hair dryer with a diffuser and my curls looked good, I noticed almost from the beginning that my hair wasn&#x27;t shiny anymore and appeared to be VERY dry on the ends, like it was being damaged.</li>
            <li> Nice hair dryer, I don&#x27;t have to flip my head upside down to use it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heat in this isn&#x27;t as hot as I would like it to be, compared to my normal hair dryer that gets really hot.</li>
            <li> As I have only one working hand, this diffuser is easy for me to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy enough to snap on the diffuser head</li>
            <li> the Conair, the Curlipops allows you to position the diffuser the way you want to, and for me that’s so that there aren’t large gaps between the dryer fan and your hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a fine dryer, and I use it occasionally when I&#x27;m in a hurry, but for curly hair</li>
            <li> I actually love how this dryer performs but it looses its motor and heat too quickly, had to send back to the manufacturer within 4 months already once and doing the same thing again</li>
            <li> Thanks again</li>
            <li> I had not changed any products(I only use an alcohol free mousse), so had to come to the conclusion that it was this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I really like the price.</li>
            <li> I was still too chicken to try it with pixiecurling, but used the method Jessica McGuinty (of Jessicurl) uses in her hair drying video &amp;#60;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;cyyOypbTHI0&amp;#62;, and it worked great!</li>
            <li> A real diffuser does not blow your hair; it heats your hair.  </li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t have much &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34; to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is so much easier than putting attachments on another hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I really dislike this dryer.  </li>
            <li> I really need an appliance like this, and really wanted this one to work, but I do not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Finally....a diffuser that I like as much as the one that died on me about a decade</li>
            <li> It also produced a bad burning smell on the hot mode, and the warm wasn&#x27;t warm</li>
            <li> but I am sticking to my normal hair dryer with diffuser attachment!</li>
            <li> The speed and heat settings make it super easy to tame the frizz.</li>
            <li> The circular motion blew all of my curls out (think if it like a fan you use to cool your house), and I don&#x27;t have that happen on my regular blow dryer.</li>
            <li> &amp; it gives me big full curls.</li>
            <li> I have low density, fine, naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> For those that may say perhaps it was this particular dryer, I tested another Curlipops dryer in the Ulta store and it also had the burning smell.</li>
            <li> I don’t use high speed because it disorganizes my curls.</li>
            <li> I don’t use high speed because it disorganizes my curls.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> At 6 weeks it stopped working completely!!</li>
            <li> I’m also unlikely to use hot, but it’s nice to have the option of finishing with cool air without having to hold the cool shot button down for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li> I’m also unlikely to use hot, but it’s nice to have the option of finishing with cool air without having to hold the cool shot button down for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li> I found it so much easier and less fuzzier to apply product and let the hair dry on its own than to stand and let this dryer do its thing.</li>
            <li> first used it on the Low setting with Cool air, but one of the biggest problems I found was that if I put it on the Warm, or heaven&#x27;s forbid Hot setting, it immediately smelled like it was burning badly.</li>
            <li> I will say this is the first and last diffuser I will ever buy.</li>
            <li> The Conair has Hi, Off, and Lo, along with a cool shot button, so airspeed and heat, or lack thereof, are connected to each other, and I score another one for the Curlipops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> For those who don’t know, this is a method of drying curly hair, developed by someone who goes by “pixiecurl” on naturallycurly.com, in which you scrunch your hair into the bowl of a dryer’s diffuser with the dryer off, turn it on and dry that section of hair, then turn it off before repositioning the dryer: because the dryer isn’t on when you do the scrunching, curls stay better defined, but another factor is that your hair isn’t being pushed away by airflow when you’re positioning the dryer, only possibly an issue with a pancake style dryer.</li>
            <li> Both still weigh less than my mother’s non-ionic, folding, travel dryer, which I used once while I was moving her, then abandoned due to the abundant halo of frizz it created.</li>

            <li> I also did not like how the air circulated in circles compared to the air coming out of a regular hair dryer in a straight motion.</li>
            <li> dryers are listed as having the same weight, according to Amazon, though that’s really the shipping weight.</li>
            <li> dryers are listed as having the same weight, according to Amazon, though that’s really the shipping weight.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use it when I travel, but it is much too big to put in a suitcase.  </li>
            <li> direct toward your head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little loud but worth it!</li>
            <li> Even when I put it back down to Cool and pushed it to the High air setting, it still smelled like it was burning.</li>
            <li> I had to diffuse my hair on low, and this wasn&#x27;t hot enough.</li>
            <li> Also, the low power was too low and the high power was too high.</li>
            <li> I have both straight and curly hair (blow dryer + round brush, straight.</li>
            <li> I will say, that my natural curls are not very tight, and my goal when diffusing my hair is to help maintain my curls with a low heat...</li>
            <li> My hair is now fine, loose to tight curls.</li>
            <li> It has plenty of power and dries well, but I had to return mine as it was so loud that it left my ears ringing.</li>
            <li> Hold for as long as you need, then turn the dryer off before moving to a new section.</li>
            <li> My hair dries quicker this this dryer, but it is not super hot.</li>
            <li> Any time this dryer is not full of hair and right up next to your scalp, it&#x27;s making a frizz mess.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> It was bigger than I expected and heavier than expected but it works better than the diffuser that came with my other dryer.</li>
            <li> It may be that I have a heightened sense of safety awareness, after working in health care for 38 years, but the Conair’s clipping on in a way that kept the gaps as wide as possible didn’t give me a whole lot of confidence that it would work well for “pixiecurling.”</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier to use than the conventional blow dryer with the diffuser attachment.</li>
            <li> While I normally air dry, I started using a diffuser last Fall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 29 year old female who&#x27;s had long, curly hair all my life.</li>
            <li> I can now dry my curley hair in 10 minutes (on high) vs waiting two hours for my hair to air dry.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; setting then had as much power as the low setting had previously when it was working properly.  </li>
            <li> This diffuser does blow hair around a bit more than a traditional diffuser (for example, the old school ones w/ the black foam-like material), but this doesn&#x27;t bother me since my curls are uneven in texture and lend themselves to a beach-y, messy type of look.  </li>
            <li> After drying 75% of the way, stop and clip up your roots to avoid flat head.</li>
            <li> Somehow my wavy curls end up being too smooshed flat against my head, then sticking out toward the ends.  </li>
            <li> I have medium to long hair and every once in a while it would pull my hair out from the back side of the dryer.</li>
            <li> Only reason I gave it 4 stars &amp; not 5 is because it&#x27;s larger &amp; heavier than I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but so far my hair comes out curlier than i want or need.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not hot enough or concentrated enough to make my hair do what I want for that type of style.</li>
            <li> NOT good for straight hair!</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money on my end.</li>
            <li> Others have said their long hair has gotten stuck in it &amp; that hasn&#x27;t been  the case for me.</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair 3b.</li>
            <li> This did not cut it at all.. Not hot enough, and the way that the air circulated blew my curls out.</li>
            <li> I have to use a traditional dryer if I am doing something other than just being curly.</li>
            <li> However I&#x27;m not going to stand there with this thing stuck to my head to try to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t dry your hair all the way (</li>
            <li> The shape of it allows you to shape your air while you dry it.</li>
            <li> so I could blow dry parts of my hair out.</li>
            <li> I DRY MY HAIR SECTION AT A TIME BY HOLDING THE DRYER CLOSE TO THE SCALP, AND SQUISHING THE HAIR INTO THE DIFFUSER.</li>
            <li> AFTER ABOUT 6 minutes my hair is completely dry.</li>
            <li> It took no time to dry my medium length hair.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely NOT recommend it for people with medium to long hair.</li>
            <li> Not high quality at all.</li>
            <li> I find that the hair next to my scalp is still a little damp and susceptible to flatness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I went ahead and order this because occasionally I need to get my hair dried quicker.</li>
            <li> (I can&#x27;t imagine why you&#x27;d want to use this wide headed dryer without the diffuser).</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that because I have long hair it takes forever!</li>
            <li> Although it’s a little difficult to attach initially, the diffuser works really well, and</li>
            <li> or if it includes other diffusers like this as well...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Normally the fingers are so long that it is impossible to get the heat close enough to my hair to not take forever to dry.  </li>
            <li> I returned it after a few tries.</li>
            <li> I have short curly hair that is both course &amp; thick.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t return it because the 1 month return window is closed!!  </li>
            <li> I typically will wash my hair before bed and sleep on on it.</li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t give reviews, but I have to with this product.</li>
            <li> After six weeks the &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; setting was just a slight puff of wind.  </li>
            <li> This is NOT a true diffuser.</li>
            <li> Not only does it take way less time to dry my hair this way when I&#x27;m in a hurry, but it makes my hair voluminous and wavy instead of flat and oily and curly in all the wrong places!</li>
            <li> Might cause frizz for tight curls, though.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m using this product I can automatically deduct at least an hour to get my hair completely dry.</li>
            <li> It makes me a little nervous</li>
            <li> A little curl spray &amp; diffuser, curly), so I&#x27;ve owned tons of blow dryers.</li>
            <li> I had noticed a slight burning smell on other days but just thought that maybe a piece of random hair had gotten in the back and was burning</li>
            <li> I have a natural hair and it dried my hair without disturbing the curl pattern.  </li>
            <li> Secondly, I bought this dyer 6 weeks ago and it&#x27;s already broken.</li>
            <li> But I decided I&#x27;d give it at least 2 tries.</li>
            <li> look year &#x27;round.</li>
            <li> And it is not clunky or hard to stow away in a small drawer, unlike conventional dryers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whine: the Conair has it in spades, and the Curlipops has very little.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whine: the Conair has it in spades, and the Curlipops has very little.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is just this product</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this is almost just as bulky and doesn&#x27;t distribute enough heat to curl/scrunch my hair WHILE simultaneously drying.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve been better off letting my hair air-dry, which is a horrible look for me.</li>
            <li> It was just a disappointment overall.  </li>
            <li> Not only did it make my hair horribly fuzzy and frizzy, but it took forever to dry because it wasn&#x27;t focused.  </li>
            <li> (I hated those long fingers when I had long hair, and I still hate them now that I have short [not even to my chin] hair!)  </li>
            <li> It was lightweight as promised, but smelled terrible &amp;#34;burnt&amp;#34; from the first use until about 1 month out.</li>
            <li> Controls not great.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I will be returning it today.</li>
            <li> The size of the blow dryer plus the diffuser, made it awkward and tiring to use.</li>
            <li> Once I turned it on, it was awkward to hold/</li>
            <li> This was ridiculously disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I NEVER HAVE A BAD HAIR DAY ANYMORE.</li>
            <li> Disappointed - thought it would work on my hair...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now completely worthless.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Loves it and it can blow cool air too. Very easy to use. Thanks again</li>
            <li> I had a hair drier similar to this one that died after years of use--also ionic. So I used my husbands thinking &amp;#34;oh well it is just a hair drier&amp;#34; but I ended up losing my curls and also a ton of my hair! I got this about 3 weeks ago and using it several times a week it took about 2 weeks to have my burls back and my hair is starting to return! What a difference a proper hair drier makes! Who knew!!!</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a diffuser, and I never bought one before... I will say this is the first and last diffuser I will ever buy. I&#x27;ll stick with a regular hair dryer with a diffuser on the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heat in this isn&#x27;t as hot as I would like it to be, compared to my normal hair dryer that gets really hot. I had to diffuse my hair on low, and this wasn&#x27;t hot enough. Also, the low power was too low and the high power was too high. I also did not like how the air circulated in circles compared to the air coming out of a regular hair dryer in a straight motion.

            <li> Good for curly, wavy hair. Controls not great. Doesn&#x27;t get really hot. Adds volume.</li>
            <li> If I had written this review yesterday, I would have been singing the praises of this diffuser dryer...BUT, this morning, I used it on the medium heat setting, as usual, it started smoking, the coils inside turned bright orange and sparks flew out. I had noticed a slight burning smell on other days but just thought that maybe a piece of random hair had gotten in the back and was burning but this morning was very different from that. To be honest, although it did dry my hair much faster than a regular hair dryer with a diffuser and my curls looked good, I noticed almost from the beginning that my hair wasn&#x27;t shiny anymore and appeared to be VERY dry on the ends, like it was being damaged. I had not changed any products(I only use an alcohol free mousse), so had to come to the conclusion that it was this hair dryer. Of course, yesterday was the last day that I could have returned it, having had it a month. I called Amazon and explained the situation and they were very helpful and agreed to send return labels and give me a full refund.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this diffuser.</li>
            <li> It works well. Makes my hair curly and dries it quickly. It makes me a little nervous bc I have long hair and I am scared that it will get sucked into the backside of the dryer.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair, this diffuser is perfect for getting curls to look defined without the frizz.</li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser dryer so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect.  I absolutely love it!  I have a natural hair and it dried my hair without disturbing the curl pattern.  I really like the price.</li>
            <li> Finally. I can look good on vacation. Absolutely perfect tool.</li>
            <li> Funky wild color and works great on my curls!</li>
            <li> Happy to say this diffuser works great! I can now dry my curley hair in 10 minutes (on high) vs waiting two hours for my hair to air dry. Makes washing my hair more often possible.</li>

I found it so much easier and less fuzzier to apply product and let the hair dry on its own than to stand and let this dryer do its thing. A complete waste of money on my end.</li>

            <li> I have both straight and curly hair (blow dryer + round brush, straight. A little curl spray &amp; diffuser, curly), so I&#x27;ve owned tons of blow dryers. This diffuser is great. I diffuse with my hair upside-down &amp; it gives me big full curls. Others have said their long hair has gotten stuck in it &amp; that hasn&#x27;t been  the case for me. Only reason I gave it 4 stars &amp; not 5 is because it&#x27;s larger &amp; heavier than I expected.</li>
            <li> For curly hair, this works great!</li>
            <li> The needles were not log enough.  I RETURNED IT</li>
            <li> I have low density, fine, naturally curly hair. While I normally air dry, I started using a diffuser last Fall. The size of the blow dryer plus the diffuser, made it awkward and tiring to use. I bought this with the hope it would be easier to use. It is!  It&#x27;s so much easier to use than the conventional blow dryer with the diffuser attachment. Love it!</li>
            <li> I’m better impressed with the Curlipops Diffuser Dryer than I was with my deceased Conair Curl Fusion Ionic Ceramic Styler Hair Dryer (next to current generation) which the Curlipops is replacing for me. Both dryers have negative ionic technology, which makes them preferable to the free hairdryers at hotels, the gym, and my therapy pool, as I always notice much more frizz when I use those dryers than when I use my own. So, in that regard, they’re both preferable IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the Conair, the Curlipops allows you to position the diffuser the way you want to, and for me that’s so that there aren’t large gaps between the dryer fan and your hair. It may be that I have a heightened sense of safety awareness, after working in health care for 38 years, but the Conair’s clipping on in a way that kept the gaps as wide as possible didn’t give me a whole lot of confidence that it would work well for “pixiecurling.” For those who don’t know, this is a method of drying curly hair, developed by someone who goes by “pixiecurl” on naturallycurly.com, in which you scrunch your hair into the bowl of a dryer’s diffuser with the dryer off, turn it on and dry that section of hair, then turn it off before repositioning the dryer: because the dryer isn’t on when you do the scrunching, curls stay better defined, but another factor is that your hair isn’t being pushed away by airflow when you’re positioning the dryer, only possibly an issue with a pancake style dryer. I was still too chicken to try it with pixiecurling, but used the method Jessica McGuinty (of Jessicurl) uses in her hair drying video &amp;#60;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;cyyOypbTHI0&amp;#62;, and it worked great! My hair dried a lot faster, curled really well, and I had no problems with frizz as it finished drying. Although it’s a little difficult to attach initially, the diffuser works really well, and that’s no biggie since I have no reason to keep removing and reattaching it, it just resides on the dryer. So one for Curlipops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has three heat settings: cool, warm, and hot, which are independent of the airflow speed, as well as having a cool shot button. I don’t use high speed because it disorganizes my curls. I’m also unlikely to use hot, but it’s nice to have the option of finishing with cool air without having to hold the cool shot button down for an extended period of time. The Conair has Hi, Off, and Lo, along with a cool shot button, so airspeed and heat, or lack thereof, are connected to each other, and I score another one for the Curlipops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whine: the Conair has it in spades, and the Curlipops has very little. So I give this one to the Curlipops too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both dryers are listed as having the same weight, according to Amazon, though that’s really the shipping weight. It’s a little more than I’d like, considering I have fibromyalgia, and I don’t need any help making my arms and shoulders ache, but it’s still better than getting hypothermia, pneumonia, or bronchitis. Also, not having the dryer permanently attached to a wall means I can get into more comfortable positions while drying my hair. Both still weigh less than my mother’s non-ionic, folding, travel dryer, which I used once while I was moving her, then abandoned due to the abundant halo of frizz it created. So score one for both pancake dryers. However, neither one has dual voltage, and the Curlipops’s instructions specifically state it should not be used with a voltage converter, so it would not be a possible choice for travel outside of North America.Curlipops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has three heat settings: cool, warm, and hot, which are independent of the airflow speed, as well as having a cool shot button.

            <li> Disappointed - thought it would work on my hair...but made my curly hair straight...with the diffuser!</li>
            <li> I sent it back. I felt like my hair was going to get sucked into the fan. I gave it 3 stars because if I had short hair it wouldn&#x27;t have been a problem.</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair 3b. I bought this dyer thinking it would work wonders on my hair. First, I think it does a great job and dries my hair very fast. However, I would prefer to have the teeth longer and better way to cup the hair so to speak. My hair gets caught in the back and ends up with tge burning hair smell. Secondly, I bought this dyer 6 weeks ago and it&#x27;s already broken. Amazon is amazing and agreed to refund my money. I think this would work better for women with short curly hair more than anything.</li>
            <li> This has made my curly hair more manageable.  As I have only one working hand, this diffuser is easy for me to use.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Nice hair dryer, I don&#x27;t have to flip my head upside down to use it.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a learning curve with this dryer. What I&#x27;ve learned:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Don&#x27;t dry your hair all the way (if it&#x27;s curly) The frizz will erase all the work you just did.&lt;br /&gt;2. Place your hair cradled in the dryers teeth and THEN turn it on. Hold for as long as you need, then turn the dryer off before moving to a new section. Any time this dryer is not full of hair and right up next to your scalp, it&#x27;s making a frizz mess.&lt;br /&gt;3. After drying 75% of the way, stop and clip up your roots to avoid flat head. I find that the hair next to my scalp is still a little damp and susceptible to flatness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a fine dryer, and I use it occasionally when I&#x27;m in a hurry, but for curly hair (I&#x27;m a 2c/3a with fine hair) I find it&#x27;s always best to air dry.</li>
            <li> Tended to make my hair frizz instead of curl</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair and this dryer is perfect for me.  It&#x27;s a little loud but worth it!</li>
            <li> This is NOT a true diffuser. A real diffuser does not blow your hair; it heats your hair.  This blows your hair like a regular blow dryer. I returned it after a few tries.</li>
            <li> Dries my fine curly hair quickly. Good price, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the curlipopos for about a month with good result.  Easy to manipulate and gently dries the hair.</li>
            <li> This is truly the BEST blow dryer for naturally curly headed gals!!! Powerful yet gently on my curls and easy to use.  LOVE this product:)</li>
            <li> Curly girls, you&#x27;re hair will love this. Gives my curls volume without frizz. My hair dries quicker this this dryer, but it is not super hot. The shape of it allows you to shape your air while you dry it. If you have curly hair, get this now! I do wish it had some sort of attachment that was similar to a concentrator so I could blow dry parts of my hair out. You can take off the diffuser attachment but it&#x27;s not hot enough or concentrated enough to make my hair do what I want for that type of style. I have to use a traditional dryer if I am doing something other than just being curly.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with mattress.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I have NEVER owned just a diffuser. I&#x27;ve always used diffuser attachments on my blowdryers. I went ahead and order this because occasionally I need to get my hair dried quicker. I typically will wash my hair before bed and sleep on on it. I find that gives me the best curls and I don&#x27;t have a ton of product in my hair. But occasionally I need it done during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a cross between type 3A and 3B hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do really enjoy this product. I use it on the cool setting as to minimize heat damage. My only complaint is that because I have long hair it takes forever! If I&#x27;m using this product I can automatically deduct at least an hour to get my hair completely dry. It just doesn&#x27;t have much &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34; to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont notice anymore frizz control or body than I did with my dryer and diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely will still be ordering an actual dryer with my diffuser attachment.</li>
            <li> This thing is a miracle worker. My curls have never look bigger and bouncier!</li>
            <li> I actually love how this dryer performs but it looses its motor and heat too quickly, had to send back to the manufacturer within 4 months already once and doing the same thing again</li>
            <li> I love it!  My natural curls look their best.</li>
            <li> Best blow dryer ever for my wild curls. I used to have to live the house with wet hair and hope for the best - not anymore! The speed and heat settings make it super easy to tame the frizz.</li>
            <li> I have spiral-curly hair and this by far is the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever bought. The design is both clever and cute. And it is not clunky or hard to stow away in a small drawer, unlike conventional dryers. Favorite buy from Amazon, ever.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.  It is so much easier than putting attachments on another hair dryer.  I thought from the picture, though, that the dryer would be much smaller than it is.  I wanted to use it when I travel, but it is much too big to put in a suitcase.  If the company would make a smaller travel diffuser dryer, I would buy it in a heart beat!</li>
            <li> I have short curly hair that is both course &amp; thick. Was hoping this could replace my hair dryer &amp; diffuser combo and assumed it would be more compact. Unfortunately, this is almost just as bulky and doesn&#x27;t distribute enough heat to curl/scrunch my hair WHILE simultaneously drying. I would&#x27;ve been better off letting my hair air-dry, which is a horrible look for me. In the process of sending this back.</li>
            <li> It was bigger than I expected and heavier than expected but it works better than the diffuser that came with my other dryer.</li>
            <li> Love this, keeps my curls nice and not frizzes out.</li>
            <li> THIS DRYER IS THE BEST I&#x27;ve used for my very curly hair. I DRY MY HAIR SECTION AT A TIME BY HOLDING THE DRYER CLOSE TO THE SCALP, AND SQUISHING THE HAIR INTO THE DIFFUSER. AFTER ABOUT 6 minutes my hair is completely dry. THEN I MASSAGE MY SCALP BUT I NEVER PUT MY HANDS THROUGH THE ENDS. IT IS CALLED THE PIXIE METHOD OF DRYING. I NEVER HAVE A BAD HAIR DAY ANYMORE.</li>
            <li> Meh, it just doesn&#x27;t work that well for me.  I think the diffuser needs to be smaller and curved more to better fit the shape of a person&#x27;s head.  Somehow my wavy curls end up being too smooshed flat against my head, then sticking out toward the ends.  Not a fan, wish i hadn&#x27;t tossed the box.</li>
            <li> It is adequate. I do wish the prongs of the diffuser were a more flexible or softer. It kind of hurts our heads.</li>
            <li> I like it the cool button is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for curly hair. The difuser piece gets popped in when you receive it and it does not fall out! Its there to stay. I love this product!</li>
            <li> Never thought the blow dryer made a big difference....always thought it was the styling products...guess again,this will be the only blow dryer i will ever use or buy again.... awesome for curly hair.</li>
            <li> THIS ISTHE BEST  DRYER I HAVE EVER USED</li>
            <li> Love it! It&#x27;s lightweight perfect for people who use diffuser only. It took no time to dry my medium length hair.</li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t give reviews, but I have to with this product. It was lightweight as promised, but smelled terrible &amp;#34;burnt&amp;#34; from the first use until about 1 month out. I have medium to long hair and every once in a while it would pull my hair out from the back side of the dryer. &amp;#34;OUCH&amp;#34;!!  At 6 weeks it stopped working completely!! Can&#x27;t return it because the 1 month return window is closed!!  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> Great for drying hair!</li>
            <li> I love this dryer! I like that it has multiple heat and speed settings. It&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li> Awesome for naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> This is the only diffuser of this variety I&#x27;ve ever found that has short \\&quot;fingers\\&quot;.  Normally the fingers are so long that it is impossible to get the heat close enough to my hair to not take forever to dry.  (I hated those long fingers when I had long hair, and I still hate them now that I have short [not even to my chin] hair!)  This diffuser does blow hair around a bit more than a traditional diffuser (for example, the old school ones w/ the black foam-like material), but this doesn&#x27;t bother me since my curls are uneven in texture and lend themselves to a beach-y, messy type of look.  Might cause frizz for tight curls, though.</li>
            <li> Have never used a diffuser before so have nothing to compare it with.  This one is light enough and easy to handle.  It really dries my hair quickly without blowing it around.  The fingers are great for my short hair.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved it.  Until it quit working.  After six weeks the &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; setting was just a slight puff of wind.  The &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; setting then had as much power as the low setting had previously when it was working properly.  At the same time, the &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; setting became so incredibly hot that the coils inside glowed bright orange.  So I started using the &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; setting.  It&#x27;s now completely worthless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 29 year old female who&#x27;s had long, curly hair all my life. My hair is now fine, loose to tight curls. I have tried my fair share of curly-hair-specific products. My friend and I saw the Curlipops dryer months ago and thought it looked very cute, and was a great idea for curly hair, in theory, but we weren&#x27;t sure how effective it would be. Last week I decided to give in and try it. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, in person, it looks/feels like cheaply made plastic. Not high quality at all. But I decided I&#x27;d give it at least 2 tries. It&#x27;s easy enough to snap on the diffuser head (I can&#x27;t imagine why you&#x27;d want to use this wide headed dryer without the diffuser). NOT good for straight hair! Once I turned it on, it was awkward to hold/direct toward your head. It is not a &amp;#34;cone&amp;#34; shaped diffuser, so your hair has no where to gather in the cup. My hair just fell away from it, it wasn&#x27;t staying in/on the diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first used it on the Low setting with Cool air, but one of the biggest problems I found was that if I put it on the Warm, or heaven&#x27;s forbid Hot setting, it immediately smelled like it was burning badly. Even when I put it back down to Cool and pushed it to the High air setting, it still smelled like it was burning. That can&#x27;t be safe. For those that may say perhaps it was this particular dryer, I tested another Curlipops dryer in the Ulta store and it also had the burning smell. I thought it was just because it was a display model...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only Pro I have for it is that with the short diffuser fingers, it is easy to hold the dryer to your head/scalp, and that may provide better volume for those with SHORT, curly hair. I would absolutely NOT recommend it for people with medium to long hair. Unfortunately, I will be returning it today.</li>
            <li> It has plenty of power and dries well, but I had to return mine as it was so loud that it left my ears ringing.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is wonderful!</li>
            <li> I love this! Not only does it take way less time to dry my hair this way when I&#x27;m in a hurry, but it makes my hair voluminous and wavy instead of flat and oily and curly in all the wrong places! There&#x27;s a bit of frizz but it&#x27;s not bad compared to what I&#x27;ve experienced at the hands of a regular hair dryer. Amazing product for a curly haired girl!</li>
            <li> I did not buy this via Amazon, but in an Ulta store.  I really dislike this dryer.  I was very excited to try an appliance that was just a hairdryer with an attachment, but just a diffuser, specifically built for curly hair.  This was ridiculously disappointing.  It&#x27;s like the person who designed the &amp;#34;finger&amp;#34; attachment had no idea what it was actually supposed to do.  The fingers are pointy shapes that are open all the way except the last quarter inch, where you need the warmer air to come out. (I notice none of the photos provided really give a good view of the design of the fingers...)  As a result, it lets out all the air closer to the actual appliance, and doesn&#x27;t focus it-- it blows the hair around and breaks the curls.  Not only did it make my hair horribly fuzzy and frizzy, but it took forever to dry because it wasn&#x27;t focused.  It also produced a bad burning smell on the hot mode, and the warm wasn&#x27;t warm enough.&lt;br /&gt;It looks good on the surface in that has three heat settings, three pressure settings, and a cool shot, but as I said, I couldn&#x27;t even use the hot setting.  It was just a disappointment overall.  I really need an appliance like this, and really wanted this one to work, but I do not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly without &amp;#34;drying out&amp;#34; my hair. Easy to handle and not heavy.</li>
            <li> Finally....a diffuser that I like as much as the one that died on me about a decade ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s lightweight and has really good airflow that you can adjust (with that fingered attachment) if you don&#x27;t want as much as the head delivers on low speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can once again get my preferred air-dry in the Summer breeze look year &#x27;round.</li>
            <li> Great!  Received quickly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but so far my hair comes out curlier than i want or need.  I haven&#x27;t tried to use it without the finger.</li>
