            <li>but it does kind of bug me every time I look at them.</li>

            <li>I think this is one of the most affordable and durable hair dryer i&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>I love the 3 heat levels as well as the cooling button.  </li>
            <li>This is the second Conair 204P hair dryer that I&#x27;ve owned, and it is truly the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad to have found it, as it came out in stores a number of years ago.  </li>
            <li>This dryer makes my hair shine and gives it a lot of body AND supports one of my favorite charities.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer.</li>
            <li>and I love the cooling air nozzle.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with this dryer; I don&#x27;t see the need for anything fancier than this.</li>
            <li>and I use it and love it...</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>Also the attachment me piece limits the heat air flow forcing you to detach for more heat.</li>
            <li>It could have been better for the price.</li>
            <li>But with this dryer my hair is shinny and healthy looking</li>
            <li>Love this hair dryer and Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>It provides a nice heat and it even has a lint collector that can be taken off to clean</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight and fits in my hand very comfortably.</li>
            <li>My daughter was thrilled that I was able to find the exact hairdryer she wanted without leaving the house,</li>
            <li>I like that the filter easily comes out</li>
            <li>settings, dries hair very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Strong blow dryer.</li>
            <li>It does not have a warm just hot</li>
            <li>The perfect pink dryer!!</li>
            <li>She said this is the best dryer she has ever had,dries her hair in half the time.</li>
            <li>it works fine..</li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>but otherwise it is fine.</li>
            <li>and it works fine again.</li>
            <li>Super hairdryer!  </li>
            <li>, I love the color of the hairdryer and how quickly it dries my hair</li>
            <li>It dries it quickly and gives it a more styled looked.</li>
            <li>It overheats quickly if it is on \\&quot;high\\&quot; for more than a minute, even though I have cleaned the dust screen, and it shuts off.</li>
            <li>this one is light and feels like cheap plastic</li>
            <li>thinking it might be cheap</li>
            <li>This thing is fantastic.</li>
            <li>anyways, the color is really pretty, probably my favorite feature of the product.</li>
            <li>Totally worth your money!</li>
            <li>but it has a cool air option which is huge.</li>
            <li>it feels so cheap and its super noisy.</li>
            <li>All in all, does what it is supposed to do in a quick and comfortable fashion.</li>
            <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned it doesn&#x27;t get much better than that!</li>
            <li>its easy to use and light weight and doesnt get too hot and fry my hair.</li>
            <li>a great budget hairdryer and its also pink.</li>
            <li>There are 3 settings and a Cool Shot button.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very happy with my purchase because I didn&#x27;t really need much and did not want to spend over 20 dollars for a hair dryer.    </li>
            <li>glad I got this product and it shipped fast.</li>
            <li>It will pop the circuit and I let it cool a bit and then hit the reset</li>
            <li>Not bad, because I don&#x27;t have time to shop at the brick and mortar.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves the color (I bought it for her to use), and now she will dry her own hair!  </li>
            <li>Pretty color and easy to hold and style with.</li>
            <li>Gives a lot of power, so your hair dries quickly.</li>
            <li>but it did get hot!</li>
            <li>Nice price and its a nice soft pink, looks great and feels great, that I want to wash and dry my hair everyday!!</li>
            <li>it doesnt make too much noise &amp; is relatively light in weight.  </li>
            <li>ths is one amazing dryer for low price.</li>
            <li>and I love that a portion of the proceeds go to such an important cause.</li>
            <li>I love this hairdryer, but for some people, they may not be completely ecstatic with the settings of this hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>, it does not work any better than my old non-ionic hair dryer.</li>
            <li>cool shot button is very helpful.</li>
            <li>Its quiet, easy to handle and work with!</li>
            <li>Super fast drying capacity...</li>
            <li>My Daughter really loved the hair dryer and she particularly wanted the pink one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>is very good for thck n thin hair boht.</li>
            <li>I was planning to get in the first place.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get too hot to damage your hair...</li>
            <li>that in itself is enough to love.</li>
            <li>color is pretty.</li>
            <li>i think i would feel more positively about it if it had an infuser... that would definitely make this a 4.5 star product.</li>
            <li>This Conair hair dryer performs as great as my last one did and its pink!</li>
            <li>then most hairdryers I have owned except that it does automatically shut off if you use it too long.</li>
            <li>I have naturally straight hair, fine but lots of it, and it took me more than 10 min to blow my short style dry.</li>
            <li>- First of all, it came in it&#x27;s original packaging, but it looked like it had been opened before - multiple times.</li>
            <li>For $20, this hair dryer is pretty decent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: So a few months later and this hairdryer has turned out to be not so great after all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it about 6 months now and it works very well.</li>
            <li>and I just really love the pink.</li>
            <li>Dries my hair fast.  </li>
            <li>This hair dryer dries hair extremely fast.  </li>
            <li>shes very upset with this item</li>
            <li>makes your life this much easier.</li>
            <li>i love thats its pink and</li>
            <li>Very helpful for styling the hair.  </li>
            <li>Very durable.  </li>
            <li>It works alot better then I expected.</li>
            <li>I really like this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s pink and for breast cancer, the reason I bought it.</li>
            <li>I bought a different dryer for primary use now.</li>
            <li>I really got this because it supports breast cancer</li>
            <li>As for the features of the blowdryer, it&#x27;s your basic dryer with a cool button.  </li>
            <li>This dryer was very cheap but not cheap made.</li>
            <li>It now only takes me 10 minutes to dry my hair (after its air dried for a while but still) and gotta love aa product that supports such a good cause.</li>
            <li>She was excited to see the pink</li>
            <li>Not brand new in my opinion.</li>
            <li>WIth this hairdryer, you cannot really control the temperature of the air, only how intense the air flows from the dryer.  </li>
            <li>The color is pretty much exactly as it looks in the picture, definetly pink.</li>
            <li>Had the exact same one and after 7 years it started to spark inside</li>
            <li>The pink is more a mix of pink with some lilac.</li>
            <li>THIS IS BY FAR</li>
            <li>I was surprised with the quality-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too loud.</li>
            <li>The cord is much too short.</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace my (extremely) old dryer.</li>
            <li>Needed a pretty blowdryer in order to get my toddler to let me near her to dry her hair!  </li>
            <li>Even on high it feels like its on low.</li>
            <li>plus I seen a much better pink color at walmart for half the price.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight, has a long cord and works really well.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that bothered me is that its not the color I expected it to be, I love pink and</li>
            <li>It was a little heavy, but worked nicely.</li>
            <li>She LOVES the pink color, it isn&#x27;t too loud and it works really fast....</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice anything better or worse</li>
            <li>it takes her 3 times longer to dry her hair and her old conair dryed is 4 years old.</li>
            <li>and it takes about 5-10 minutes total to thoroughly dry my whole head.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t have as much force, or power as my other one did.</li>
            <li>The heat temperature is hot but not hot enought for african american hair.</li>
            <li>It is small, yet powerful.  </li>
            <li>Its brand new, just as expected.</li>
            <li>Bought this hair dryer to entice my three year old to let me dry her hair.</li>
            <li>That one was at least quick.</li>
            <li>Once detached, the heat is way to close to the hair which causes damage and still do not dry african american hair.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> ths is one amazing dryer for low price.</li>
            <li> and I love that a portion of the proceeds go to such an important cause.</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer, but for some people, they may not be completely ecstatic with the settings of this hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> , it does not work any better than my old non-ionic hair dryer.</li>
            <li> cool shot button is very helpful.</li>
            <li> Its quiet, easy to handle and work with!</li>
            <li> Super fast drying capacity...</li>
            <li> My Daughter really loved the hair dryer and she particularly wanted the pink one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> is very good for thck n thin hair boht.</li>
            <li> I was planning to get in the first place.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get too hot to damage your hair...</li>
            <li> that in itself is enough to love.</li>
            <li> color is pretty.</li>
            <li> i think i would feel more positively about it if it had an infuser... that would definitely make this a 4.5 star product.</li>
            <li> This Conair hair dryer performs as great as my last one did and its pink!</li>
            <li> then most hairdryers I have owned except that it does automatically shut off if you use it too long.</li>
            <li> I have naturally straight hair, fine but lots of it, and it took me more than 10 min to blow my short style dry.</li>
            <li> - First of all, it came in it&#x27;s original packaging, but it looked like it had been opened before - multiple times.</li>
            <li> For $20, this hair dryer is pretty decent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: So a few months later and this hairdryer has turned out to be not so great after all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it about 6 months now and it works very well.</li>
            <li> and I just really love the pink.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair fast.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer dries hair extremely fast.  </li>
            <li> shes very upset with this item</li>
            <li> makes your life this much easier.</li>
            <li> i love thats its pink and</li>
            <li> Very helpful for styling the hair.  </li>
            <li> Very durable.  </li>
            <li> It works alot better then I expected.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s pink and for breast cancer, the reason I bought it.</li>
            <li> I bought a different dryer for primary use now.</li>
            <li> I really got this because it supports breast cancer</li>
            <li> As for the features of the blowdryer, it&#x27;s your basic dryer with a cool button.  </li>
            <li> This dryer was very cheap but not cheap made.</li>
            <li> It now only takes me 10 minutes to dry my hair (after its air dried for a while but still) and gotta love aa product that supports such a good cause.</li>
            <li> She was excited to see the pink</li>
            <li> Not brand new in my opinion.</li>
            <li> WIth this hairdryer, you cannot really control the temperature of the air, only how intense the air flows from the dryer.  </li>
            <li> The color is pretty much exactly as it looks in the picture, definetly pink.</li>
            <li> Had the exact same one and after 7 years it started to spark inside</li>
            <li> The pink is more a mix of pink with some lilac.</li>
            <li> THIS IS BY FAR</li>
            <li> I was surprised with the quality-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too loud.</li>
            <li> The cord is much too short.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my (extremely) old dryer.</li>
            <li> Needed a pretty blowdryer in order to get my toddler to let me near her to dry her hair!  </li>
            <li> Even on high it feels like its on low.</li>
            <li> plus I seen a much better pink color at walmart for half the price.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight, has a long cord and works really well.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that bothered me is that its not the color I expected it to be, I love pink and</li>
            <li> It was a little heavy, but worked nicely.</li>
            <li> She LOVES the pink color, it isn&#x27;t too loud and it works really fast....</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anything better or worse</li>
            <li> it takes her 3 times longer to dry her hair and her old conair dryed is 4 years old.</li>
            <li> and it takes about 5-10 minutes total to thoroughly dry my whole head.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t have as much force, or power as my other one did.</li>
            <li> The heat temperature is hot but not hot enought for african american hair.</li>
            <li> It is small, yet powerful.  </li>
            <li> Its brand new, just as expected.</li>
            <li> Bought this hair dryer to entice my three year old to let me dry her hair.</li>
            <li> That one was at least quick.</li>
            <li> Once detached, the heat is way to close to the hair which causes damage and still do not dry african american hair.</li>
            <li> In the end my hair looked so shaggy and messy that I honestly told my hair dresser to step up her game or else.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and this hair dryer dries it quickly and has a pop off back to remove lint!</li>
            <li> I definetly recommend this to anyone willing to dry their hair within a few feet of the outlet they plug it into!</li>
            <li> the chord is long enough.  </li>
            <li> The cord is long enough and it has a 3 speed dial.</li>
            <li> I use it several times a week and am hoping this one lasts just as long.</li>
            <li> To be safe it should not be used on children or babies unless on the lowest setting possible and utilizing the cold shot toggle.    </li>
            <li> The cord is on the short side, i&#x27;d say maybe 4-5 feet long when stretched.</li>
            <li> After being without a blow dryer for a long time i decided to by this one.</li>
            <li> (my hair is long and it takes about 15 minutes to blow dry my hair).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it was just the hair dryer i received, but if the box had been opened before, they would have known there was something wrong with it!</li>
            <li> and that is that it doesn&#x27;t match the Conair Power of Pink flat iron.</li>
            <li> I don&#x60;t even want to imagine that with long hair!</li>
            <li> i think it takes longer to dry my hair though</li>
            <li> took like 5 minutes to dry my hair</li>
            <li> and when I told her we were going to dry her hair like a princess she got way into it.  </li>
            <li> After using this hair dryer for six months I finally got so fed up with it that I broke down and got myself a BaByliss.</li>
            <li> but i think its been past 30 days ill add more once this is resolved hopefully.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is not too loud, it has both Cold &amp; Hot air blower</li>
            <li> It keeps burning my hair occasionally, a problem I never had with the previous dryers.</li>
            <li> a little big for her</li>
            <li> she loves anything that is pink and has the Breast Cancer logo.</li>
            <li> So i bought this pink edition dryer for my wife with the pink straightner</li>
            <li> What I like about this product: it is pink</li>
            <li> With the Conair the cord is too short, I do not like the angle of the handle, it&#x60;s so heavy</li>
            <li> Besides, it&#x27;s pink</li>
            <li> I have thick and long hair and by using this dryer, it only takes me about 10 mins to blow dry it.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as it probably should, don&#x27;t get me wrong though it still works and will dry your hair</li>
            <li> , that could mean my old dryer was stronger or maybe my hair is just longer now.</li>
            <li> then i either straighten my hair  with my flat iron or add a little leave in conditioner spray to wear it curly.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed any of the purported \\&quot;ionic shine\\&quot; that it boasts, but eh, I&#x27;ve never really seen that from other dryers either.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Other than that side note</li>
            <li> Yea and does not get your hair frizzy like the other hair dryers.</li>
            <li> Not like a drill machine like the other dryers I have had.</li>
            <li> I have small hands and this is lightweight enough it doesnt tire my hands...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pink!</li>
            <li> my shoulder lenght hair is completely dry in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I dry my hair (long, thick, curly) in sections</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve notice that my drying time is cut by half, and its pink!</li>
            <li> I WILL NEVER KNOW WHY, NOT WORTH IT</li>
            <li> It dries my hair, and i have noticed a lot less frizzies and fly-aways since i started using it.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and tends to get frizzy after I blow dry it.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair that takes a while to dry this would not be the hairdryer for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a little heavy, but you get used to it after a while.</li>
            <li> Little heavy if you want to carry it while you travel..</li>
            <li> Its pink too!!!</li>
            <li> its bit heavy.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I ordinarily don&#x27;t give two hoots about this sort of thing</li>
            <li> not great nor horrible, its okay.</li>
            <li> but sais but the dryer sucks.</li>
            <li> do have one petty complaint</li>
            <li> and it is thick and holds water...</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair</li>
            <li> Seriously, whats up with that???</li>
            <li> My hair does get a little frizzy after this, but it is not as bad as with other hair dryers.</li>
            <li> Amazon got it to me overnight when mine died, so I only went 1 day with bad hair.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no diffuser and few heat settings, sadly, but works.</li>
            <li> The conair hair dryer is not good for course hair.</li>
            <li> THE WORSE HAIR DRYER I HAVE EVER</li>
            <li> I repeatedly bumped myself on the head with it, it&#x60;s noisy, though I wonder why because there is little air flow, and, worst of all</li>
            <li> The dryer has a \\&quot;cold shot\\&quot; option to toggle off the heat element.</li>
            <li> However it does offer the cold shot toggle which you can press and hold for cold.    </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hate it.</li>
            <li> I hate substitutions</li>
            <li> But went out to get another and hated it.</li>
            <li> its just awful</li>
            <li> Very annoying.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this. I&#x27;ve had it about 6 months now and it works very well. I like that the filter easily comes out and I just really love the pink. Good product.</li>
            <li> - First of all, it came in it&#x27;s original packaging, but it looked like it had been opened before - multiple times. I was sceptical, but I plugged it in and tried it out. It was a little heavy, but worked nicely. Though I didn&#x27;t like that you can&#x27;t change the heat settings. Just how fast/slow the air blows. Then i got a closer look, and noticed the side had a brown discoloration. It looked like someone had used it and burned the side. Not brand new in my opinion. I&#x27;m sure it was just the hair dryer i received, but if the box had been opened before, they would have known there was something wrong with it! I returned it the day i got it and got the hairdryer I was planning to get in the first place.</li>
            <li> I have thick and long hair and by using this dryer, it only takes me about 10 mins to blow dry it.  I love this hair dryer.  Also I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than 2 years now. I think this is one of the most affordable and durable hair dryer i&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> For $20, this hair dryer is pretty decent. it doesnt make too much noise &amp; is relatively light in weight.  the chord is long enough.  i think it takes longer to dry my hair though, that could mean my old dryer was stronger or maybe my hair is just longer now. anyways, the color is really pretty, probably my favorite feature of the product. i wouldn&#x27;t not reccommed this product- its not great nor horrible, its okay. i think i would feel more positively about it if it had an infuser... that would definitely make this a 4.5 star product.</li>
            <li> great dryer, works well.  Lots of heat and volume when I need it, nice cooling button.  Dries my hair fast.  Amazon got it to me overnight when mine died, so I only went 1 day with bad hair.  Not bad, because I don&#x27;t have time to shop at the brick and mortar.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter who is in nursing school. she loves anything that is pink and has the Breast Cancer logo. She said this is the best dryer she has ever had,dries her hair in half the time. She said she loves it,and that it is a great dryer.</li>
            <li> Super hairdryer!  This hair dryer dries hair extremely fast.  I love the 3 heat levels as well as the cooling button.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Bought this hair dryer to entice my three year old to let me dry her hair. It worked! She LOVES the pink color, it isn&#x27;t too loud and it works really fast.... It&#x27;s perfect! The fact that we get to support breast cancer research is an added bonus.     I&#x27;ve personally used it as well and it is a great dryer. Would definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> This is the second Conair 204P hair dryer that I&#x27;ve owned, and it is truly the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve seen.  It is small, yet powerful.  In addition, it is quiet!  I am so glad to have found it, as it came out in stores a number of years ago.  I feel especially pleased that a portion of my purchase goes to Breast Cancer Awareness.  Thank you, Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very attractive and useful hair dryer.  Use it daily, has different temp. settings, dries hair very quickly. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> So i bought this pink edition dryer for my wife with the pink straightner the straightner is great she sais but sais but the dryer sucks. it takes her 3 times longer to dry her hair and her old conair dryed is 4 years old. this one is light and feels like cheap plastic but thats not even that big of a deal its that theres not enpught blow drying power. shes very upset with this item and i am with conair its like throwing money in the trash. im going to try to return it but i think its been past 30 days ill add more once this is resolved hopefully.</li>
            <li> I continue to be impressed by the service and products. My daughter was thrilled that I was able to find the exact hairdryer she wanted without leaving the house,</li>
            <li> Very nice hairdryer. It is a little heavy, but you get used to it after a while. Gives a lot of power, so your hair dries quickly. Concentrator is included, so it helps prevent frizz. My hair does get a little frizzy after this, but it is not as bad as with other hair dryers. There are 3 settings and a Cool Shot button.</li>
            <li> Great Dryer. I dry my hair (long, thick, curly) in sections and it takes about 5-10 minutes total to thoroughly dry my whole head.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed any of the purported \\&quot;ionic shine\\&quot; that it boasts, but eh, I&#x27;ve never really seen that from other dryers either.&lt;br /&gt;I do have one petty complaint and that is that it doesn&#x27;t match the Conair Power of Pink flat iron. The two shades are totally different. Seriously, whats up with that??? Honestly, I ordinarily don&#x27;t give two hoots about this sort of thing but it does kind of bug me every time I look at them.</li>
            <li> Great dryer for the price and I love that a portion of the proceeds go to such an important cause.</li>
            <li> THIS IS BY FAR THE WORSE HAIR DRYER I HAVE EVER OWNED. Even on high it feels like its on low. it feels so cheap and its super noisy. if your looking for a good quality hair dryer skip this one. its just awful i ended up returning it</li>
            <li> What I like about this product: it is pink, the power pressure was just about perfect, and $1.00 for every dryer sold goes to the Breast Cancer Foundation. The dryer has a \\&quot;cold shot\\&quot; option to toggle off the heat element. Comes with a removable filter and concentrator attachment.    Con: You technically cannot change the heat setting. Although it says that it has a three heat/speed settings the lowest heat is the lowest pressure, highest heat is the highest pressure. However it does offer the cold shot toggle which you can press and hold for cold.    I would recommend this product. This is a very easy to use hair dryer but it did get hot! To be safe it should not be used on children or babies unless on the lowest setting possible and utilizing the cold shot toggle.    Overall, I am very happy with my purchase because I didn&#x27;t really need much and did not want to spend over 20 dollars for a hair dryer.    I was surprised with the quality- thinking it might be cheap but it really is a nice hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer, but for some people, they may not be completely ecstatic with the settings of this hairdryer.  WIth this hairdryer, you cannot really control the temperature of the air, only how intense the air flows from the dryer.  The only way to change the temperature of the air is to press the blue button on the hair dryer to make the air cooler.  Other than that side note, I love the color of the hairdryer and how quickly it dries my hair (my hair is long and it takes about 15 minutes to blow dry my hair).</li>
            <li> This dryer makes my hair shine and gives it a lot of body AND supports one of my favorite charities.</li>
            <li> Good price...It doesn&#x27;t get too hot to damage your hair...Super fast drying capacity...&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know changing the hair dryer makes your life this much easier.</li>
            <li> i have curly hair. After being without a blow dryer for a long time i decided to by this one. i love thats its pink and a donation is made for each one sold but it also is the best blow dryer ever. i use the medium setting and my shoulder lenght hair is completely dry in just a few minutes. then i either straighten my hair  with my flat iron or add a little leave in conditioner spray to wear it curly. its easy to use and light weight and doesnt get too hot and fry my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer. I don&#x27;t know what else you would want in a dryer. It dries hair! The cord is long enough and it has a 3 speed dial. Also, I like the fact that $1 goes to Cancer Research.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair, and i have noticed a lot less frizzies and fly-aways since i started using it. The cord is on the short side, i&#x27;d say maybe 4-5 feet long when stretched. The color is pretty much exactly as it looks in the picture, definetly pink. The cool air function is very nice to have. It&#x27;s light weight and fits in my hand very comfortably. It&#x27;s not too loud. All in all, does what it is supposed to do in a quick and comfortable fashion. I definetly recommend this to anyone willing to dry their hair within a few feet of the outlet they plug it into!</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully! Perfect air pressure and I love the cooling air nozzle. Very helpful for styling the hair.  Little heavy if you want to carry it while you travel.. but I would recommend this one over anything else.Very durable.  Its pink too!!! Totally worth your money! Yea and does not get your hair frizzy like the other hair dryers. Also the noise is close to nothing. Not like a drill machine like the other dryers I have had.</li>
            <li> I ordered my hair dryer for one day shipping;I received have used it and give it 5 stars... it works fine..no issues..I have small hands and this is lightweight enough it doesnt tire my hands... took like 5 minutes to dry my hair and it is thick and holds water... for $20 this is perfect!</li>
            <li> After using this hair dryer for six months I finally got so fed up with it that I broke down and got myself a BaByliss. With the Conair the cord is too short, I do not like the angle of the handle, it&#x60;s so heavy I repeatedly bumped myself on the head with it, it&#x60;s noisy, though I wonder why because there is little air flow, and, worst of all, it does not work any better than my old non-ionic hair dryer. That one was at least quick. I have naturally straight hair, fine but lots of it, and it took me more than 10 min to blow my short style dry. I don&#x60;t even want to imagine that with long hair! In the end my hair looked so shaggy and messy that I honestly told my hair dresser to step up her game or else. Only when I recently visited my parents and used my mom&#x60;s hair dryer I realized that the cause for my chaotic mop was this hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and Conair donates only ONE dollar from the sale of each hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this dryer; I don&#x27;t see the need for anything fancier than this. Besides, it&#x27;s pink so that gives it triple bonus points in my book.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer at the BX once I graduated basic training. I love it! I have really thick hair and I&#x27;ve notice that my drying time is cut by half, and its pink!</li>
            <li> Bought this item and didnt use it for another two or three weeks after purchase, but when i did!!! OMG I totally love it! Nice price and its a nice soft pink, looks great and feels great, that I want to wash and dry my hair everyday!! Its quiet, easy to handle and work with! Totally love it!!</li>
            <li> This dryer works great! It provides a nice heat and it even has a lint collector that can be taken off to clean</li>
            <li> The perfect pink dryer!! I love it! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I never received it. But went out to get another and hated it. It does not have a warm just hot so I burnt my hair and my childrens to the point my hair is damaged in front. I do not like this product at all. Besides the color I would never let anyone use this product.</li>
            <li> The pink is more a mix of pink with some lilac. The cord is much too short. There&#x27;s no diffuser and few heat settings, sadly, but works.</li>
            <li> This dryer was very cheap but not cheap made. It works alot better then I expected.Very good buy. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> a great budget hairdryer and its also pink. that in itself is enough to love. glad I got this product and it shipped fast.</li>
            <li> My Daughter really loved the hair dryer and she particularly wanted the pink one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is not too loud, it has both Cold &amp; Hot air blower</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my (extremely) old dryer. This thing is fantastic. It now only takes me 10 minutes to dry my hair (after its air dried for a while but still) and gotta love aa product that supports such a good cause.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer.  It is lightweight, has a long cord and works really well.  It has a \\&quot;cool\\&quot; button, which is a nice feature for styling your hair.  My daughter loves the color (I bought it for her to use), and now she will dry her own hair!  I also like that part of the sale price goes to fight breast cancer.</li>
            <li> Needed a pretty blowdryer in order to get my toddler to let me near her to dry her hair!  She was excited to see the pink and when I told her we were going to dry her hair like a princess she got way into it.  As for the features of the blowdryer, it&#x27;s your basic dryer with a cool button.  Works great and don&#x27;t foresee any problems with it. Nice to support a good cause with $1.</li>
            <li> It works fine. It is a bit big and you cannot fold it. I have had it for longer than 2 years and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with its working.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and this hair dryer dries it quickly and has a pop off back to remove lint!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pink! like hello kitty! I like it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for the price but will order one with s but more blowing power</li>
            <li> Strong blow dryer. Had the exact same one and after 7 years it started to spark inside so I decided it was time for another one.  I use it several times a week and am hoping this one lasts just as long.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s pink and for breast cancer, the reason I bought it. It gets the job done but it doesn&#x27;t have as much force, or power as my other one did. But I still use it!</li>
            <li> Works like it should, has the parts it should have,  and the direction were there. My puppy  and I use it and love it...</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for.  CONS:Cord is short. Not a lot of power.   PROS:Inexpensive. Lightweight.  Don&#x27;t love it. Don&#x27;t hate it.</li>
            <li> ths is one amazing dryer for low price. its bit heavy. but best for twice a week use after hairwash. color is pretty. is very good for thck n thin hair boht. cool shot button is very helpful. speed settings and heat settings ar great too</li>
            <li> The conair hair dryer is not good for course hair. The heat temperature is hot but not hot enought for african american hair. Also the attachment me piece limits the heat air flow forcing you to detach for more heat. Once detached, the heat is way to close to the hair which causes damage and still do not dry african american hair.</li>
            <li> bought for my toddler. a little big for her but it has a cool air option which is huge. we like it</li>
            <li> Must have got a dud but ours died!</li>
            <li> Pretty color and easy to hold and style with.</li>
            <li> THIS DRYER JUST STOPPED WORKING ONE DAY.  I GUESS I WILL NEVER KNOW WHY, NOT WORTH IT AT ALL URGH</li>
            <li> It could have been better for the price. It keeps burning my hair occasionally, a problem I never had with the previous dryers. I dont like it for that reason but otherwise it is fine. I bought a different dryer for primary use now. This is just for emergency use.</li>
            <li> I really got this because it supports breast cancer but it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as it probably should, don&#x27;t get me wrong though it still works and will dry your hair I&#x27;m just saying I&#x27;ve used hotter ones. The only thing that bothered me is that its not the color I expected it to be, I love pink and plus I seen a much better pink color at walmart for half the price. Just go to the store for one...</li>
            <li> This has to be the best hair dryer I have ever used. My hair is thick and tends to get frizzy after I blow dry it. But with this dryer my hair is shinny and healthy looking rather then looking like I stuck my finger in a electric socket. It dries it quickly and gives it a more styled looked. Love this hair dryer and Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This Conair hair dryer performs as great as my last one did and its pink! As far as I&#x27;m concerned it doesn&#x27;t get much better than that!</li>
            <li> ordered a Hello Kitty hair dryer and this was sent to me.  I hate substitutions and I don&#x27;t think they should be allowed.  I want only the item I ordered!</li>
            <li> It is what it is for a $20 hairdryer. I didn&#x27;t notice anything better or worse then most hairdryers I have owned except that it does automatically shut off if you use it too long. I guess it overheats? It will pop the circuit and I let it cool a bit and then hit the reset and it works fine again. If you have thick hair that takes a while to dry this would not be the hairdryer for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: So a few months later and this hairdryer has turned out to be not so great after all. It overheats quickly if it is on \\&quot;high\\&quot; for more than a minute, even though I have cleaned the dust screen, and it shuts off. Very annoying.</li>
            <li> Its brand new, just as expected. Works perfectly! It fits all of the descriptions of when I purchased this product!</li>
            <li> Love it it dries my hair beautifully</li>
