            <li>, flawless covering</li>
            <li>( MMAndLshow) \\&quot;best of cosmoprof 2012</li>
            <li>It takes probably 1-2 minutes to have a flawless face.</li>
            <li>Absolutely wonderful product.</li>
            <li>I had used this with another company which I was a makeup artist for and it worked great!</li>
            <li>LOVE&#x27;t!!!</li>
            <li>Great shipping time.</li>
            <li>Great description.</li>
            <li>love it!!</li>
            <li>The make up looks awesome and its so easy to use.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect it to be so good.</li>
            <li>It is quite good.</li>
            <li>and I have good control.</li>
            <li>I wish it had of worked color wise for me</li>
            <li>Fantastic item!!</li>
            <li>but I wish you could create a pod with your own liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>Now I have to purchase the suitable air pod to fix in this to get started.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love my system!</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>So I tried many liquids or creams but all turn orange within 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>So...my mom bought this on QVC, and I was able to try it out.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is great for in home use...but kind of tricky if you are a make-up artist and have clients that have various skin tones.</li>
            <li>so easy to use; I am sold.</li>
            <li>so the application is extremely light</li>
            <li>Temptu Airbrush takes a little practice to apply, but with light layering you get excellent coverage and a smooth finish which keeps the original color.</li>
            <li>It is super easy to use and the coverage is light weight yet full.</li>
            <li>I just bought and used it for the first time!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try</li>
            <li>best kept secret.</li>
            <li>It is worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Also using less foundation because you&#x27;re applying it where you need it most, rather than needing to use more all over.  </li>
            <li>This is the first product I have ever decided to rate.</li>
            <li>I LOVe this, and actually just bought one myself off ebay.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I only have to apply make up once, lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>Up to age 55, I used Bare Escentuals foundation powders with good success; but with aging, portions of my face became too dry for powder while some remain oily.</li>
            <li>Took me less than 2 minutes to get full foundation and it looks good and natural.</li>
            <li>flawless easy to use comes with blush and base.</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>I really like the system.</li>
            <li>You have to really shake it and shake it to get the foundation to come out.</li>
            <li>I like how it sprays and the makeup covers very well.</li>
            <li>Discovered how to solve the occasional drying of the product via a very useful video on YouTube.</li>
            <li>I am so surprised.  </li>
            <li>Makeup did not stay on, and did not look natural at all.</li>
            <li>natural looking ad covers well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit tacky-feeling at first while it&#x27;s wet</li>
            <li>I only have a touch of mild rosacea, and a bit of uneven pigment.</li>

            <li> This is the first product I have ever decided to rate. I am so surprised.  I didn&#x27;t expect it to be so good. I&#x27;m a college student, a bit of a perfectionist and impatient. This thing works wonders. Took me less than 2 minutes to get full foundation and it looks good and natural. This is only with 2 uses. I will update later.</li>
            <li> I bought this airbrush gun to be used on my wedding day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was very simple to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned however, you will require lots of different pods to create different looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great for in home use...but kind of tricky if you are a make-up artist and have clients that have various skin tones.</li>
            <li> I bought my machine several years ago at sephora. It is quite good. Even though I Favour mac or iMan when it comes to powder or foundation. I found temptu to be equally nice,&lt;br /&gt;No streak, flawless covering though the use of the machine takes some getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;I love it. Discovered how to solve the occasional drying of the product via a very useful video on YouTube.( MMAndLshow) \\&quot;best of cosmoprof 2012 footage\\&quot;. It&#x27;s worth a try</li>
            <li> I love, love, love my system! I was afraid I would mess up my make up. It is super easy to use and the coverage is light weight yet full.I have never worn foundation before now do to the heavy feel of make up TEMPTU has solved that problem for me.</li>
            <li> Makeup did not stay on, and did not look natural at all. Very disappointed in this product</li>
            <li> This company is terribly shady. I recived broken pieces in the new set then was made to wait and wait and wait and wait.... for the replacement. The make up is gross, too! Returning and trying someone else!!</li>
            <li> Up to age 55, I used Bare Escentuals foundation powders with good success; but with aging, portions of my face became too dry for powder while some remain oily. So I tried many liquids or creams but all turn orange within 20 minutes. (reaction to oils, sebum, ph, humid locale, whatever). Temptu Airbrush takes a little practice to apply, but with light layering you get excellent coverage and a smooth finish which keeps the original color. I can even dance and sweat and it stays.I turn the dial down even lower than they specify so the application is extremely light and I have good control. Be patient to learn your color choice(s). I use Sand on my nose and cheeks to cover redness then Beige for contouring. Yes, it takes 2 Airpods, but they last me about 6 months.</li>
            <li> So...my mom bought this on QVC, and I was able to try it out. I only have a touch of mild rosacea, and a bit of uneven pigment. I&#x27;m not a fan of heavy face makeup and lemme tell you...this product is amaze-balls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You basically swirl your wrist in a small circle going over your face...the air blows and you can feel it . Let it dry for a sec and set it with powder, and voila! It takes probably 1-2 minutes to have a flawless face. It&#x27;s a bit tacky-feeling at first while it&#x27;s wet and then you set it with powder (i use a loose finishing powder) and it stays all day. I LOVe this, and actually just bought one myself off ebay. It&#x27;s a must have. I will never go back to liquid foundation cake-face ever again.</li>
            <li> Everything I wanted. Thank you. Great shipping time. Absolutely wonderful product. Especially for a make up artist. Great description. Thanks again.</li>
            <li> Christmas gift to my daughter but I feel its a bit pricey for what it is.  Refills are overpriced also.</li>
            <li> best kept secret. shhh tell Everyone. love it!! flawless easy to use comes with blush and base. so easy to use; I am sold. I will never go back to sponges amd finger applying makeup. this make up last 24 hour in 98° weather. tested it out</li>
            <li> Second one I&#x27;ve owned.  Airbrushing keeps your skin from getting blemishes because you&#x27;re reducing the amount of contact with skin.  Also using less foundation because you&#x27;re applying it where you need it most, rather than needing to use more all over.  I really like the system.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I only have to apply make up once, lasts all day.  Covers age spots and big improvement on winkles</li>
            <li> The system did not come with refillable air pods making it useless. Empty pods are not available on their site. Don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> natural looking ad covers well</li>
            <li> I bought mine a couple years ago at sephora. It is worth the investment. The make up looks awesome and its so easy to use.</li>
            <li> It clogged up daily. You have to really shake it and shake it to get the foundation to come out.</li>
            <li> I could not use this as I don&#x27;t have even a sample make or foundation to use in this. I didn&#x27;t know that the machine itself will be coming without any sample to use. Now I have to purchase the suitable air pod to fix in this to get started.</li>
            <li> I had used this with another company which I was a makeup artist for and it worked great! I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a smaller version of it or if I got a bad one but this system is horrible! I went to a clients house to apply the foundation and I felt embarrassed that it did not even apply any foundation mind you I just bought and used it for the first time! So disappointed!</li>
            <li> This works well. I like how it sprays and the makeup covers very well. I received the item on time.</li>
            <li> I have asked to return my Temptu air brush do to the fact that I cannot buy pods with a dark enough paint. I use this for my scalp for thinning hair. I have not received any response about how they wish for me to return it to get my money back. There is nothing wrong with the machine. I wish it had of worked color wise for me</li>
            <li> The machine was broken but the person I order it from sent me some free product. Thank goodness my husband know how to fix the machine it was a 14 cents part.</li>
            <li> Fantastic item!! LOVE&#x27;t!!!</li>
            <li> This did not work - does not distribute make up evenly! terrible!!</li>
            <li> I love this but I wish you could create a pod with your own liquid foundation. I can&#x27;t seem to match one to my skin color.  Even  if I blend two of them.</li>
