            <li>The hair stylists all said that they have had many complaints.</li>
            <li>This used to be my favorite hair gel....</li>
            <li>This a great product; I&#x27;ve been using it for many years now and have tried different brands</li>

            <li>SAME GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>It arrived quicker than originally stated and also came with some Paul Mitchell free samples.</li>
            <li>They had such a good product before.</li>
            <li>and gel comes back to life good stuff</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly with no problems.</li>
            <li>Thank you for the quick shipment of hair gel.</li>
            <li>This styling gel works great on my thin, baby fine hair to keep it looking full and manageable!  </li>
            <li>wrote and called KMS to complain (I never do that, and rarely do I write reviews).  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for a number of years and was only able to buy it from hairstylist.</li>
            <li>Exactly what was pictured and the descriptions of product.</li>
            <li>So, the odor is definitely different but not horrible.  </li>
            <li>As I age, my hair is thinning, so my hair needs more volume, and this product definitely delivers!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>this is the exact product that we buy for twice as much.  </li>
            <li>have very fine, soft hair and if I do not use a good firm gel my hair looses all of its body and is flat by noon.  </li>
            <li>Have used this for years and was here to buy a 2 pack of the large size.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have sooner, I used get one of these 25.3oz bottles at the salon for very close what this two pack sells for here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really holds all day with no flakes.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than at a salon by a lot.  </li>
            <li>When I saw the product available in larger quantities I bought these two plastic bottles.  </li>
            <li>Thanks...  [...</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Product really does work but is rather sticky to work with.</li>
            <li>Thanks again for the heads up.</li>
            <li>I was able to find a supplier with 2 of the old bottles left and grabbed them in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Weird!!!  Lets hope they change it back to the original fragrance.</li>
            <li>The product is great overall as it was in the past.</li>
            <li>this one does not hold as well as the old one, so I switched to Eufora Solidifi Firm Hold Gel and love it!</li>
            <li>This Vendor has just made me a new customer! ..  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclaimer: this has nothing to do with this particular seller.</li>
            <li>used to buy KMS at my normal hair salon, but when they stopped carrying it I decided to check Amazon.  </li>
            <li>so I am wondering if the odor is coming off of the new packaging/bottle.  </li>
            <li>I saw a review stating new formula.</li>
            <li>The smells similar to the old formula but much much stronger and has a pungent tinge to it.</li>
            <li>just to be clear, I was reviewing the old product (which is great).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like the old KMS gel....</li>
            <li>I have tried so many gel products that just do not hold well, and leave your hair flat after a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Just like another reviewer said, this new formula is NOT the same as the old one, even though KMS claims otherwise.  </li>
            <li>I almost didn&#x27;t buy this, i have been using KMS since the early - mid 90&#x27;s...</li>

            <li> The product is exactly what I expected but at a lower price--I have used this product in the past and like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!  </li>
            <li> After the hair begans to dry, it is not sticky though</li>
            <li> wet it</li>
            <li> Look carefully.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years, buying smaller sizes at my hair stylist&#x27;s salon.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the reviews on the bad smell of the new &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; gel.</li>
            <li> I smelled several different bottles in the store, all have the same new AWFUL odor.  </li>
            <li> I at first thought it was just the one I bought online, but I went to the salons and the new formula has a disgusting smell to it.</li>
            <li> It smells so strong and horrible in my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it on my thick hair for 10+ years.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed they would change the smell of the new one.  </li>
            <li> Just not great customer service.</li>
            <li> I will not buy the new KMS gel, it&#x27;s horrible.  </li>
            <li> New Formula Smells Horrible!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and was unable to find it in salons nearby anymore.</li>
            <li> It no longer stinks.  </li>
            <li> Do not buy this, it is an intolerable bad smell!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have always used the KMS brand hair gel. When my local Salon decided not to carry it, I went to Amazon.com to look for the product.  I was impressed with the price and speed of service.  This Vendor has just made me a new customer! ..  just to be clear, I was reviewing the old product (which is great).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated Apr 2012:  I bought this again thinking it was the same product.  IT&#x27;S NOT !!!  I returned it and waiting on a refund.  I will not buy the new KMS gel, it&#x27;s horrible.  I am disappointed they would change the smell of the new one.  They had such a good product before.</li>
            <li> I have been using KMS HairStay Styling Gel for about 3 years now.  I have tried so many gel products that just do not hold well, and leave your hair flat after a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine, soft hair and if I do not use a good firm gel my hair looses all of its body and is flat by noon.  That is never a problem with KMS California gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to buy KMS at my normal hair salon, but when they stopped carrying it I decided to check Amazon.  I wish I would have sooner, I used get one of these 25.3oz bottles at the salon for very close what this two pack sells for here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great value, and a great product.</li>
            <li> BEST GEL in the Business!</li>
            <li> Best Gel on the market.</li>
            <li> love this execellent product! leaves no flakes and holds all day. product arrived on time. would order from same vendor again.</li>
            <li> this is the best gel money can buy  it leaves no flakes ur hair always looks shiny n health    wet it and gel comes back to life good stuff</li>
            <li> My favorite gel. Really holds all day with no flakes.</li>
            <li> this is the exact product that we buy for twice as much.  The product arrived amazingly fast and was half the price!  Will definitely buy from this seller in the future.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a number of years and was only able to buy it from hairstylist. Great to see it at amazon.</li>
            <li> Great hair gel. Doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
            <li> Just like another reviewer said, this new formula is NOT the same as the old one, even though KMS claims otherwise.  I smelled several different bottles in the store, all have the same new AWFUL odor.  I was able to find a supplier with 2 of the old bottles left and grabbed them in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote and called KMS to complain (I never do that, and rarely do I write reviews).  They did not seem to care one bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until they fix this, stay away from this product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: this has nothing to do with this particular seller.</li>
            <li> Great gel, been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was pictured and the descriptions of product.</li>
            <li> Have been using kms hair gel for 35 year so yes it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> Have used this product before and it is the best!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years as it&#x27;s the best combination of hold strength and no fragrance I could find.</li>
            <li> KMS HairStay keeps your hair in place without making it look like it&#x27;s been plastered to your head.  Best gel I have tried.</li>
            <li> The product is KMS.  Much cheaper than at a salon by a lot.  Look carefully.  I found this same sale for even cheaper than what I paid, $36.</li>
            <li> Very good product that I have used for over 20 years.  So, the odor is definitely different but not horrible.  KMS states they did not change the formula so I am wondering if the odor is coming off of the new packaging/bottle.  The plastic bottle smells like the hair styling gel and I cannot get the smell off my hands even with multiple washings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weird!!!  Lets hope they change it back to the original fragrance.</li>
            <li> Great price.  Awesome product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this gel!  They have changed the smell since 2012.  It is now a very pleasant and acceptable smell.  I like it.  It no longer stinks.  The product is great overall as it was in the past. I&#x27;ve been using it on my thick hair for 10+ years.  Yes, at one point it did stink, but I think they heard us and changed the fragrance.  It&#x27;s awesome AGAIN!</li>
            <li> The only product hubby will use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a KMS user for years and will hope its around a lot more.  Great product, holds well, and smells good.&lt;br /&gt;Very, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years, buying smaller sizes at my hair stylist&#x27;s salon. When I saw the product available in larger quantities I bought these two plastic bottles.  Arrived quickly with no problems. Have plenty now...</li>
            <li> This review is not a reflection of the seller. KMS must have reformulated the product. It smells so strong and horrible in my hair. The smell also lingered on my hands after multiple hand washings. The smells similar to the old formula but much much stronger and has a pungent tinge to it. I will be returning this to Amazon and will have to find another option.</li>
            <li> This styling gel works great on my thin, baby fine hair to keep it looking full and manageable!  Have been using it for years! As I age, my hair is thinning, so my hair needs more volume, and this product definitely delivers!</li>
            <li> This a great product; I&#x27;ve been using it for many years now and have tried different brands but nothing is compareble to it.</li>
            <li> I saw a review stating new formula. I almost didn&#x27;t buy this, i have been using KMS since the early - mid 90&#x27;s... I got it and the smell was the 1st thing I check and compared it to the product i had. 5 people all smelled it and noone could tell the difference. SAME GREAT PRODUCT. Thanks...  [...</li>
            <li> The product is exactly what I expected but at a lower price--I have used this product in the past and like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!  Randy</li>
            <li> New Formula Smells Horrible!!! I at first thought it was just the one I bought online, but I went to the salons and the new formula has a disgusting smell to it. The hair stylists all said that they have had many complaints. Why would KMS change something that was working soo well??? I&#x27;ve been using this gel for 15 years. Do not buy this, it is an intolerable bad smell!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product,arrived quickly.  Thanks</li>
            <li> This used to be my favorite hair gel....and then they changed the formula.  It&#x27;s not like the old KMS gel....this one does not hold as well as the old one, so I switched to Eufora Solidifi Firm Hold Gel and love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great hair gel that had good holding power while not drying out hair.  It washes out of hair easily</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and was unable to find it in salons nearby anymore. It&#x27;s nice to find it online anytime I need it for a good price. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the quick shipment of hair gel. It arrived quicker than originally stated and also came with some Paul Mitchell free samples. Always love FREE!! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> When I received the product there was only one bottle in the package that was supposed to have two. It took a lot of time and effort to get the second bottle that I paid for. The product is great. Just not great customer service.</li>
            <li> Product really does work but is rather sticky to work with. After the hair begans to dry, it is not sticky though</li>
            <li> Thanks for the reviews on the bad smell of the new &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; gel. Have used this for years and was here to buy a 2 pack of the large size. Thanks again for the heads up.</li>
