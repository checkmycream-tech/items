            <li>The result was amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this on my own hair and my 2 girls&#x27; hair for over a year!</li>
            <li>Good for the protein maybe</li>
            <li>I do know that everyone I know that uses the product, love it and have beautiful hair.</li>
            <li>And it makes my curls look amazing if I feel like wearing my hair curly.  </li>
            <li>I liked the end results</li>
            <li>It has kept my hair conditioned, healthy, &amp; growing at a good rate without breaking off.&lt;br</li>

            <li>The Liquid Keratin was okay.</li>
            <li>I can NEVER leave them in for more than 2 days.</li>

            <li>&quot; my daughter&#x27;s hair to make it more manageable.</li>
            <li>so I plan to do the treatment one more time just to finish up all the product</li>
            <li>I am now used to the application process of this product and I love the results.</li>
            <li>better help manage your curls and breakage.</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>let me tell you, in just one treatment it will surely soften your hair up.</li>
            <li>I love afros.</li>
            <li>my hair is shine but the color is change is more darkness</li>
            <li>as the instructions over time the more you use it, the better your curls will be more defined.</li>
            <li>DO NOT USE KERATIN BOLD OR KERATIN 60 DAY ON TOP OF A CHEMICAL RELAXER!</li>
            <li>I loved the results but the price really hurt.</li>
            <li>So I thought ok I&#x27;ll super loosen it with an &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; relaxer.</li>
            <li>They look great and keep well, but my daughter HATES the process and her tender headedness makes for a sore scalp and headaches immediately afterward even though I make sure the braids are loose.</li>
            <li>This product gets rid of the frizz leaving my hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>They look great the 1st day, but afterward, begin to get fuzzy and dreadlock despite using satin head coverings at night being properly moisturized.</li>
            <li>I had to stop using this when I became light headed.</li>
            <li>Any kind  of moisture your hair was no longer straight.</li>
            <li>but we do keep our scalp and hair lightly moisturized with hair oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looked great at first since my goal was not straight hair but a more relaxed texture and more manageable hair.</li>
            <li>After spraying the Leave-in treatment that came with the kit, I added a curl enhancing leave in from another hair brand and enjoyed my first ever wash and go.</li>
            <li>The more chemicals used on the hair, the more the hair is stripped of it&#x27;s natural elasticity.</li>
            <li>The more chemicals used on the hair, the more the hair is stripped of it&#x27;s natural elasticity.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be purchasing more products real soon.</li>
            <li>I do not relax my hair and have found that Liquid Keratin gets it as straight (and shiny and healthy) as it can be.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve suggested this product to many of my friends and all of them are very grateful.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who wishes to cut their morning routine in half and have great looking hair done at your own house.</li>
            <li>I put a mild relaxer in her hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, Keratin Bold doesn&#x27;t straighten the hair like a chemical relaxer.</li>
            <li>that being said, it works like a charm on curly hair (the Keratin Bold).</li>
            <li>In my 1 year of being natural I&#x27;ve never been able to wear a wash and go.</li>
            <li>After all the hardwork my hair did look nice, but only for one day.</li>
            <li>hope others experience the success that we have.</li>
            <li>I cannot wait until my own hair grows out enough for me to try it.</li>
            <li>live in dry Arizona and have not ever experienced breakage or dryness from this method.</li>
            <li>During the first application, amazing, once you rinse out, back to frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but my hair was still easy to manage and very soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is gorgeous after it is straightened, but after time it frizzed even though I live in a low humidity climate.</li>
            <li>Over the years I&#x27;ve tried multiple different products, some were great, some did not deliver promised results.</li>
            <li>After about 2 years or so of doing this (every 6 months), it eventually straightened her hair straight - and then it fell out!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve just purchased this item and will amend my review after my first use (probably after the first 48 hours).</li>

            <li>I only have to use it if i choose, every 6 months or more.</li>
            <li>Lastly, don&#x27;t trust Dominican hairstylists that claim it&#x27;s safe to let them use keratin in lieu of a relaxer for touch ups.</li>

            <li>Yes it did work at first.</li>
            <li>Of course my hair looked nice the first day; I spent hours applying the product, blow drying my hair, and straightening my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be prepared to apply the product more often if you sweat in your scalp or wash it regularly.</li>
            <li>And it says in the instructions that you blow dry/flat iron after the first application</li>
            <li>Just to reiterate, even if products claim to be safe to use with other chemicals, doesn&#x27;t make it true.</li>
            <li>Just to reiterate, even if products claim to be safe to use with other chemicals, doesn&#x27;t make it true.</li>
            <li>easy to apply and no bad smells as other Keratin treatments.</li>
            <li>I like the product, my hair is easy to manage and it holds up well in various weather conditions.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t pay attention to this much.</li>
            <li>It doesnt get real wavy until I add</li>
            <li>I highly recommend purchasing this item, you will not fregret it!</li>
            <li>It tames frizz and detangles and gives you a natural shine and soft appeal to your hair that lasts for a long long time after many many washes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have successfully washed, blow dried, and flat iron my hair and walked out of my bathroom with a salon quality treatment.</li>
            <li>My hair is very coarse and kinky.maybe the next application will make my hair a lot more straighter.</li>
            <li>They are highly concentrated.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have natural kinky curly hair that I like to where straight from time to time.</li>
            <li>This is only a styling aide that is a cheaper and less effective version of the Brazilian Blowout (which uses Formaldehyde or 1 of its derivatives) and relaxers (sodium/calcium hydroxide, \\&quot;thio\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish this line of products smelled little bit better, but that&#x27;s easily fixed.</li>
            <li>I now depend on this product to help manage my natural hair and if they decide to discontinue, I will be up a creek without a paddle!</li>
            <li>I now depend on this product to help manage my natural hair and if they decide to discontinue, I will be up a creek without a paddle!</li>
            <li>As soon as I washed my hair, it looked no different from when I first started the product.</li>
            <li>My hair is silky smooth and shiny, and it cut my blow drying/straightening time in half in the mornings.</li>
            <li>/&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;After doing a lot of research and even testing a few other at home keratin treatments, I am convinced this liquid Keratin Bold treatment is as good as it will get for my natural African American hair.</li>
            <li>This product won&#x27;t straighten your hair but it will become extremely manageable, very soft and super shiny.</li>
            <li>And in the event you would like to straighten your hair (via a flat iron), you will be left with straight frizz free hair that WILL revert back to its natural state once washed.</li>
            <li>And in the event you would like to straighten your hair (via a flat iron), you will be left with straight frizz free hair that WILL revert back to its natural state once washed.</li>
            <li>I only left the mild relaxer in her hair for 5-10 minutes, and used it with a mixture of oils and conditioners to lessen the effect.</li>
            <li>My hair was soft.</li>
            <li>a mom of an African-American young daughter with 4C hair.</li>
            <li>my hair was straighter and softer, but the two day process can be an inconvenience if you have a busy schedule.</li>
            <li>your natural hair</li>
            <li>in it&#x27;s natural state).</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t receive the Bold formula for dark hair, as advertised.</li>
            <li>As a 4c African American with natural hair, when I first flat ironed my hair after the product I could not believe how straight and shiny it made my hair.</li>
            <li>The flat iron does the straightening (the CHI original flat iron is the only one I use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The key is to infuse the solution into the hair through the use of high heat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Secondly, if you have extremely tight hair, Keratin Bold may not reduce the texture of your hair.</li>
            <li>I waited exactly 48 hours before washing the Keratin treatment out of my hair and to my amazement, I had very loose 4a curls.</li>
            <li>A large bottle of Pureology shampoo, conditioner,  &amp; deep conditioner should last you a year.</li>
            <li>So basically it does live up to the hype and only lasted a month for my hair type.</li>
            <li>humidity barely affects it.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Been using the Liquid Keratin Products for a few years now, &amp; I was pleased when they added the kit for Black Hair.</li>
            <li>After the treatment I completely have no need for a flat iron anymore.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African American and natural.</li>
            <li>Third wash three weeks later, my hair was pretty much back to its normal state with a few curls here and there.</li>
            <li>The only downfall is the smell but that goes away after a few days and is worth the results.</li>
            <li>So no less than a week later i trim my hair and am hoping my hair will grown back the 2 inches i just lost.</li>
            <li>I loved mine for at least a short time, but it was hard for me to</li>
            <li>Since her hair is completely natural now (all the relaxed bits broke off years ago), thick, healthy and fiercely strong, I don&#x27;t foresee any adverse effects due to dry, damaged, brittle, thin or chemically treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s meant for super tight hair that CANT be straightened without chemicals, at least not on the first round, but it may very well straighten it after repeated use.</li>

            <li> I now depend on this product to help manage my natural hair and if they decide to discontinue, I will be up a creek without a paddle!</li>

            <li> As soon as I washed my hair, it looked no different from when I first started the product.</li>
            <li> My hair is silky smooth and shiny, and it cut my blow drying/straightening time in half in the mornings.</li>
            <li> /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;After doing a lot of research and even testing a few other at home keratin treatments, I am convinced this liquid Keratin Bold treatment is as good as it will get for my natural African American hair.</li>
            <li> This product won&#x27;t straighten your hair but it will become extremely manageable, very soft and super shiny.</li>
            <li> And in the event you would like to straighten your hair (via a flat iron), you will be left with straight frizz free hair that WILL revert back to its natural state once washed.</li>

            <li> I only left the mild relaxer in her hair for 5-10 minutes, and used it with a mixture of oils and conditioners to lessen the effect.</li>
            <li> My hair was soft.</li>
            <li> a mom of an African-American young daughter with 4C hair.</li>
            <li> my hair was straighter and softer, but the two day process can be an inconvenience if you have a busy schedule.</li>

            <li> in it&#x27;s natural state).</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t receive the Bold formula for dark hair, as advertised.</li>
            <li> As a 4c African American with natural hair, when I first flat ironed my hair after the product I could not believe how straight and shiny it made my hair.</li>
            <li> The flat iron does the straightening (the CHI original flat iron is the only one I use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The key is to infuse the solution into the hair through the use of high heat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, if you have extremely tight hair, Keratin Bold may not reduce the texture of your hair.</li>
            <li> I waited exactly 48 hours before washing the Keratin treatment out of my hair and to my amazement, I had very loose 4a curls.</li>
            <li> A large bottle of Pureology shampoo, conditioner,  &amp; deep conditioner should last you a year.</li>
            <li> So basically it does live up to the hype and only lasted a month for my hair type.</li>
            <li> humidity barely affects it.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Been using the Liquid Keratin Products for a few years now, &amp; I was pleased when they added the kit for Black Hair.</li>
            <li> After the treatment I completely have no need for a flat iron anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American and natural.</li>
            <li> Third wash three weeks later, my hair was pretty much back to its normal state with a few curls here and there.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is the smell but that goes away after a few days and is worth the results.</li>
            <li> So no less than a week later i trim my hair and am hoping my hair will grown back the 2 inches i just lost.</li>
            <li> I loved mine for at least a short time, but it was hard for me to</li>
            <li> Since her hair is completely natural now (all the relaxed bits broke off years ago), thick, healthy and fiercely strong, I don&#x27;t foresee any adverse effects due to dry, damaged, brittle, thin or chemically treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s meant for super tight hair that CANT be straightened without chemicals, at least not on the first round, but it may very well straighten it after repeated use.</li>

            <li> I get my hair wet, it barely even waves up.</li>
            <li> We are African American with thick and super tight curly hair</li>
            <li> A friend of mine suggested trying the at home treatment, I was very skeptical of doing this because I don&#x27;t really trust myself with my own hair, and my results usually leaves me with thick roots and not so straight hair.</li>
            <li> If you cant blow dry or flat iron</li>
            <li> leave it for 30 minutes, and then blow dry and flat iron.  </li>
            <li> The common misconception of a keratin treatment is that people think it will make your hair straight.</li>
            <li> Also, I can straighten my hair without chemicals so this product lasts long for</li>
            <li> This product was a complete waste of time and money and it has damaged my hair.</li>
            <li> The amount of time it takes to do these styles coupled with my other numerous and demanding responsibilities at home doesn&#x27;t make it feasible for me to continue these stylings at that rate.</li>

            <li> I really do not want to flat iron my hair every month</li>
            <li> I still had to blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now looking for a Keratin treatment that will give me the same results but last at least 2 (possibly 3)</li>
            <li> in that came with the kit, my curl pattern was not as loose</li>
            <li> Actually I have not used the product yet because  my hair was so damaged from previous abuse, I had to cut it down low and go natrual for awhile.</li>
            <li> The treatment did nothing, I expected straighter hair, but got dry hair instead.</li>
            <li> They are expensive, but 100% worth it.</li>
            <li> It may seem time consuming to some, but nothing like the time and money spent in the salon.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser was shocked how easy it was to blow dry my hair!</li>
            <li> So my hair was really long and due to my tight curls, would take like 2 hours plus to straighten.</li>
            <li> No strong fumes after flat ironed my hair and no build up and residue.</li>
            <li> The only reason I tried it is because I am having a hard time finding the others in the stores.</li>
            <li> This is totally false, what it does is improves the natural texture of your hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is as course as you can get with black hair.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> The product may work well on caucasian hair but not so well on black hair.  </li>

            <li> After doing a little research, I&#x27;ve noticed a lot of treatments contain formaldehyde which is a chemical I would rather not put into my hair.</li>
            <li> I still have a little frizz, but</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Amazing product! I&#x27;m African American and natural. This product gets rid of the frizz leaving my hair shiny and smooth. This is the healthiest my hair has been in years! I&#x27;ll never put a relaxer in my hair EVER again!!!</li>
            <li> The Liquid Keratin was okay. My hair was soft.My hair is very coarse and kinky.maybe the next application will make my hair a lot more straighter.I&#x27;ll be purchasing more products real soon.Thanx</li>
            <li> For all of you 1 Star reviewers that complain of unstraightened hair, the directions are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Wash&lt;br /&gt;2) Saturate with solution&lt;br /&gt;3) Blow dry&lt;br /&gt;4) Flat iron&lt;br /&gt;5) Wait 48 hours&lt;br /&gt;6) Wash&lt;br /&gt;7) Condition&lt;br /&gt;8) Apply leave-in conditioner&lt;br /&gt;9) Blow dry&lt;br /&gt;10)Flat iron&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no magical solution in this kit that relaxes, smooths, straightens hair upon contact. The key is to infuse the solution into the hair through the use of high heat. The infusion is what, temporarily, reduces any curl or frizziness. It doesn&#x27;t eliminate it. This is only a styling aide that is a cheaper and less effective version of the Brazilian Blowout (which uses Formaldehyde or 1 of its derivatives) and relaxers (sodium/calcium hydroxide, \\&quot;thio\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a mom of an African-American young daughter with 4C hair. Out of desperation (she&#x27;s \\&quot;tenderheaded\\&quot;, 7am work start time, other small children, LOTS of house chores, etc.) I put a mild relaxer in her hair. BIG mistake! It looked great at first since my goal was not straight hair but a more relaxed texture and more manageable hair. I only left the mild relaxer in her hair for 5-10 minutes, and used it with a mixture of oils and conditioners to lessen the effect. After about 2 years or so of doing this (every 6 months), it eventually straightened her hair straight - and then it fell out! In patches. I then vowed never again to use permanent chemicals in her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that, I turned to braids. They look great and keep well, but my daughter HATES the process and her tender headedness makes for a sore scalp and headaches immediately afterward even though I make sure the braids are loose. I have to give her Tylenol or Ibuprofen afterwards. I&#x27;ve decided to give those a break for now too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I&#x27;ve tried twists, twist outs, cornrows and other natural styles. They look great the 1st day, but afterward, begin to get fuzzy and dreadlock despite using satin head coverings at night being properly moisturized. I can NEVER leave them in for more than 2 days. The last time I did that, her hair was well on its way to permanently dreading after 5 days. The amount of time it takes to do these styles coupled with my other numerous and demanding responsibilities at home doesn&#x27;t make it feasible for me to continue these stylings at that rate. I need something that lasts weekly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now I&#x27;ve decided to \\&quot;heat train\\&quot; my daughter&#x27;s hair to make it more manageable. I&#x27;ve pressed and flat ironed her hair before and she&#x27;s not much of a fan of that either, but at least it doesn&#x27;t make her head/scalp sore afterwards. Also, her heat styled hair lasts for a week at a time in good condition! I&#x27;ve read just about everything on keratin treatments and this seems about the safest, and easiest, thing I can find for use on a child to aide in my heat styling. Since her hair is completely natural now (all the relaxed bits broke off years ago), thick, healthy and fiercely strong, I don&#x27;t foresee any adverse effects due to dry, damaged, brittle, thin or chemically treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve just purchased this item and will amend my review after my first use (probably after the first 48 hours). I plan to use it the 1st weekend after I receive it. Wish me luck! ☺ng properly moisturized. I can NEVER leave them in for more than 2 days.

            <li> I had to stop using this when I became light headed. Not sure what happened maybe I was hungry. The process was too tedious, might as well go to the salon.</li>
            <li> I liked the end results my hair was straighter and softer, but the two day process can be an inconvenience if you have a busy schedule.</li>
            <li> I brought this product because I read about it on another hair blog when I desperately looking for a solution to my coarse, unmanageable 4c hair. I relax my hair, but because i exercise 3x a week and sweat in my scalp, i have just been wearing a ponytail. I tried this product 3 weeks after a relaxer and I did not notice any improvement whatsoever. Worst yet, my hair breakage was even more noticeable than before, like 2 in breaks all over the floor. So no less than a week later i trim my hair and am hoping my hair will grown back the 2 inches i just lost. If you are looking for something to &amp;#34;defy your DNA&amp;#34; and have truly have 4c hair, i recommended to just stick to what u kno.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I waited a month before reviewing this product. I want to start off by saying that this product does actually work. As a 4c African American with natural hair, when I first flat ironed my hair after the product I could not believe how straight and shiny it made my hair. I followed the directions to a T. I waited exactly 48 hours before washing the Keratin treatment out of my hair and to my amazement, I had very loose 4a curls. After spraying the Leave-in treatment that came with the kit, I added a curl enhancing leave in from another hair brand and enjoyed my first ever wash and go. In my 1 year of being natural I&#x27;ve never been able to wear a wash and go. The treatment also reduced my breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here are my overall results:&lt;br /&gt;After my second wash a week later using the shampoo, conditioner and leave-in that came with the kit, my curl pattern was not as loose but my hair was still easy to manage and very soft. Third wash three weeks later, my hair was pretty much back to its normal state with a few curls here and there. And forth wash four weeks later it was obvious I needed to redo the treatment to get the effects of the Keratin treatment again. So basically it does live up to the hype and only lasted a month for my hair type. I really do not want to flat iron my hair every month so I plan to do the treatment one more time just to finish up all the product but I don&#x27;t think I will repurchase. I&#x27;m now looking for a Keratin treatment that will give me the same results but last at least 2 (possibly 3) months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;After doing a lot of research and even testing a few other at home keratin treatments, I am convinced this liquid Keratin Bold treatment is as good as it will get for my natural African American hair. After doing a little research, I&#x27;ve noticed a lot of treatments contain formaldehyde which is a chemical I would rather not put into my hair. I am now used to the application process of this product and I love the results. I now depend on this product to help manage my natural hair and if they decide to discontinue, I will be up a creek without a paddle! Like others have commented, this is not meant to relax/straighten your hair but better help manage your curls and breakage.

            <li> DO NOT USE KERATIN BOLD OR KERATIN 60 DAY ON TOP OF A CHEMICAL RELAXER! One review indicates that you can use it in conjunction with a chemical relaxer. If you do, hair will BREAK! I know I did it once and I waited 6 months after application to do it. Stupidly, at this time (early 2010) I didnt know how to finesse my hair with the flat iron. So my hair was really long and due to my tight curls, would take like 2 hours plus to straighten. So I thought ok I&#x27;ll super loosen it with an &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; relaxer. WRONG! Big mistake. If you dye, bleach and relax your hair adding a keratin straightener (including Brazilian and dont get me started on that stuff even with like .001 formaldehyde, during the application it irritated me giving me a burning sensation in my nose and throat at the salon in 2009) will result in hair breakage over a period of time. Even if you just relax but dont dye your hair, why take such risks?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, if you have extremely tight hair, Keratin Bold may not reduce the texture of your hair. This product works to loosen the curl and reduce frizz. The flat iron does the straightening (the CHI original flat iron is the only one I use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, Keratin Bold doesn&#x27;t straighten the hair like a chemical relaxer. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s meant for super tight hair that CANT be straightened without chemicals, at least not on the first round, but it may very well straighten it after repeated use. If you cant blow dry or flat iron your natural hair this may be too weak of a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, it works like a charm on curly hair (the Keratin Bold). I love it. It washes out so its not permanent. I only have to use it if i choose, every 6 months or more. Also, I can straighten my hair without chemicals so this product lasts long for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the 60 day (non-bold) I HATED IT. Organic smell my a**. I couldn&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; nasty smell out for weeks. Every time I washed my hair, I had to smell it again and my pillow cases stunk. The smell lingered. I HATE IT! I dont recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my experience. I don&#x27;t begrudge anyone who doesn&#x27;t agree. Yet, Keratin Bold works great. If you&#x27;re unsure, buy the product and have a stylist do it for you. Just to reiterate, even if products claim to be safe to use with other chemicals, doesn&#x27;t make it true. The more chemicals used on the hair, the more the hair is stripped of it&#x27;s natural elasticity. I totally get and understand the frustration. Lastly, don&#x27;t trust Dominican hairstylists that claim it&#x27;s safe to let them use keratin in lieu of a relaxer for touch ups. It&#x27;s totally two different products.in and my pillow cases stunk. The smell lingered. I HATE IT! I dont recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my experience.

            <li> This product was a complete waste of time and money and it has damaged my hair. The treatment did nothing, I expected straighter hair, but got dry hair instead. I left it in for 52 hours. When I washed it out strands of my hair fell out. I didn&#x27;t pay attention to this much. When I applied the Leave-In, my hair broke! Pieces of my hair fell out in bundles as i applied the leave in and combed my hair out with a shower comb.  I would not recommend this for for anyone.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Been using the Liquid Keratin Products for a few years now, &amp; I was pleased when they added the kit for Black Hair. I used to have a real tight afro. My hair is as course as you can get with black hair.&lt;br /&gt;And let me tell you, in just one treatment it will surely soften your hair up. Now after a couple of years of using it my hair doesnt even curl like it did before. Its no longer nappy. Dont get me wrong I love afros. I loved mine for at least a short time, but it was hard for me to manage.&lt;br /&gt;Now my hair is wavy when I wash it.&lt;br /&gt;And humidity barely affects it.&lt;br /&gt;When I get my hair wet, it barely even waves up. It doesnt get real wavy until I add shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Love this product. It has kept my hair conditioned, healthy, &amp; growing at a good rate without breaking off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Id like to add though that I also use Pureology products. They are expensive, but 100% worth it. A large bottle of Pureology shampoo, conditioner,  &amp; deep conditioner should last you a year. They are highly concentrated.&lt;br /&gt;I use Pureology when I am not treating my hair with the Liquid Keratin products.</li>
            <li> I like the product, my hair is easy to manage and it holds up well in various weather conditions. I would recommend it to others. No, complaints!!</li>
            <li> This is the best product for women of color. I have tried several different keratin treatments and this one seems to be the only one  that actually works.love it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or your money! Yes it did work at first. After all the hardwork my hair did look nice, but only for one day. I followed the directions, I waited 48 hours to wash my hair. As soon as I washed my hair, it looked no different from when I first started the product. Of course my hair looked nice the first day; I spent hours applying the product, blow drying my hair, and straightening my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Oh yea, this stuff stinks! It smelled terrible while I was straightening my hair, I even had to open the bathroom window because of the smell. The shampoo and conditioner smells gross too.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.  I&#x27;ve previously have used 2 other keratin treatments and this is the worse one. The only reason I tried it is because I am having a hard time finding the others in the stores.</li>
            <li> During the first application, amazing, once you rinse out, back to frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First Application:&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to apply and no bad smells as other Keratin treatments. No strong fumes after flat ironed my hair and no build up and residue. I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I tried a Keratin treatment last summer in a salon and paid over $200 bucks for it.... I loved the results but the price really hurt. A friend of mine suggested trying the at home treatment, I was very skeptical of doing this because I don&#x27;t really trust myself with my own hair, and my results usually leaves me with thick roots and not so straight hair. For starters, I should probably mention that I am an African American female who stopped relaxing my hair about three years ago. I wish I would have discovered this product then as it would have definitely helped with the transition. The common misconception of a keratin treatment is that people think it will make your hair straight. This is totally false, what it does is improves the natural texture of your hair. It tames frizz and detangles and gives you a natural shine and soft appeal to your hair that lasts for a long long time after many many washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have successfully washed, blow dried, and flat iron my hair and walked out of my bathroom with a salon quality treatment. I highly recommend purchasing this item, you will not fregret it!</li>
            <li> I like this produt my hair is shine but the color is change is more darkness but I like the product</li>
            <li> I think this is just another scam to make money. I still had to blow dry my hair. Still had to straighten my hair. Had to wait before I could&lt;br /&gt;wash it. Any kind  of moisture your hair was no longer straight.Good for the protein maybe but that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I&#x27;ve been using this on my own hair and my 2 girls&#x27; hair for over a year! We are African American with thick and super tight curly hair (afro-ish in it&#x27;s natural state). It works and our hair gets straighter and softer with each use! The only downfall is the smell but that goes away after a few days and is worth the results. I follow instructions up to a point. I found that the product lasts longer when I do not wash in 48 hours as the instructions prescribe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We live in dry Arizona and have not ever experienced breakage or dryness from this method. Be prepared to apply the product more often if you sweat in your scalp or wash it regularly. We don&#x27;t need to wash our hair that often but we do keep our scalp and hair lightly moisturized with hair oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope others experience the success that we have. It may seem time consuming to some, but nothing like the time and money spent in the salon.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing!  People that are giving it bad reviews are not reading the information about the product or the directions.  It doesn&#x27;t straighten your hair, it is not a relaxer.  If you need a relaxer on your hair, then this can be used in addition to that, not as a substitute.  And it says in the instructions that you blow dry/flat iron after the first application, you don&#x27;t just leave it on and then rinse it out days later. That doesn&#x27;t even make any sense.  I do not relax my hair and have found that Liquid Keratin gets it as straight (and shiny and healthy) as it can be. And it makes my curls look amazing if I feel like wearing my hair curly.  You do not use the conditioner or the leave-in during the initial treatment.  You just wash thoroughly with the shampoo and then put the treatment in, leave it for 30 minutes, and then blow dry and flat iron.  Follow the directions and do a little reading before leaving bad reviews.</li>
            <li> The product may work well on caucasian hair but not so well on black hair.  Lot of hype but no results.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t receive the Bold formula for dark hair, as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have thick shoulder length wavy/curly hair, however, I straighten it every day, and that leaves my hair dry and dull looking. Over the years I&#x27;ve tried multiple different products, some were great, some did not deliver promised results. I saw this item on sale on one of my shopping websites, and decided to give it a try. The result was amazing! My hair is silky smooth and shiny, and it cut my blow drying/straightening time in half in the mornings. After the treatment I completely have no need for a flat iron anymore. Even in Caribbean tropical humidity my hair did not get frizzy. My hairdresser was shocked how easy it was to blow dry my hair! The treatment definitely lasts longer than 30 days. I only do it every 2.5 - 3 months. The kit lasted me two times. I wish this line of products smelled little bit better, but that&#x27;s easily fixed. I&#x27;ve suggested this product to many of my friends and all of them are very grateful. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wishes to cut their morning routine in half and have great looking hair done at your own house.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says. I have natural kinky curly hair that I like to where straight from time to time. My hair is gorgeous after it is straightened, but after time it frizzed even though I live in a low humidity climate. This product won&#x27;t straighten your hair but it will become extremely manageable, very soft and super shiny. I still have a little frizz, but as the instructions over time the more you use it, the better your curls will be more defined. I rated it 4 stars because I will continue to use this product for maximum results.</li>
            <li> Actually I have not used the product yet because  my hair was so damaged from previous abuse, I had to cut it down low and go natrual for awhile. I do know that everyone I know that uses the product, love it and have beautiful hair. I cannot wait until my own hair grows out enough for me to try it.</li>
