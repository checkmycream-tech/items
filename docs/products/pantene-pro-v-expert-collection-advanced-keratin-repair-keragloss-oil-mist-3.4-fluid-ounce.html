            <li>and she liked it.</li>
            <li>Its one of a kind - nothing comes close to it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the results; my thirsty hair soaks up the moisture and looks noticeably shinier, healthier and more controlled as a result.</li>
            <li>I find the most effective application method for me is to spray some in my hands and then massage it into my damp hair.  </li>
            <li>I would have liked to have seen if it would have been able to control and add luster to that</li>
            <li>very light mist</li>
            <li>The smell is sort of coconuty and the oil feels very light on the hands.</li>

            <li>The 5 exotic oils are from argan (a desert plant from Morocco),  safflower, olive, sesame and jojoba plants or seeds.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair or scalp oily or greasy and keeps my hair mostly tangle-free throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it every time I wash my hair and noticed that my hair feels softer with every use and is a lot healthier and shinier looking.</li>
            <li>I found this product to be just ok.</li>
            <li>, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I do love it.  </li>
            <li>more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does make it look shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>I have MUCH better items that i have used--&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li>The smell is okay -- reminds me of that &amp;#34;Mink&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Review of: Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection Advanced + Keratin Repair Keragloss Oil Mist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for my wife through Vine in exchange for an honest review.  </li>
            <li>that is absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love the softness and that is tames my frizzy strands.</li>
            <li>People compliment her on how healthy and shiny my hair looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I sprayed a bit more to the point where I resort to spraying it onto my hands and running my fingers through her hair.  </li>
            <li>our love affair must remain on an indefinite hiatus.ately deliver on neither claim.  </li>
            <li>our love affair must remain on an indefinite hiatus.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to use this product, but the fragrance irritates my asthma.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always up for trying a new hair product, and I love Pantene, so I was happy to give this product a try.  </li>
            <li>Best advice is, if you have fine hair, use this product sparingly on the ends only.</li>
            <li>It sprays a fine mist, which keeps most overuse under control.</li>
            <li>Best of all, the scent of the Keragloss mist is divine -- a lovely perfume with slightly musky undertones.</li>
            <li>The smell is quite strong.</li>
            <li>I suspect if you had a strong perfume or deodorant that it might clash with the scent</li>
            <li>Sniff a sample if you can before you buy if you don&#x27;t like strong smells.  </li>
            <li>love Pantene products and have used many; this is the first one I&#x27;ve tried that has a downside.</li>
            <li>I was able to return this product, with a full refuld and a free return shipping label.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product claims shine and repair and doesn&#x27;t accurately deliver on neither claim.  </li>
            <li>it reminded me of the cheap spray applicators one buys to travel with.</li>
            <li>By way of disclosure, I received a free sample of this product for evaluation purposes.  </li>
            <li>This repair oil does help smooth it out and restore luster.  </li>
            <li>Coming them out lightly with a hair pick made them frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection Advanced+</li>
            <li>but Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection Advanced Keratin Keragloss Oil didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>When this product became available to review</li>
            <li>I love hair that shines and looks healthy whether worn straight or curly.</li>
            <li>This oil mist is probably the best product I&#x27;ve tried so far, and I generally buy salon products.  </li>
            <li>The scent of Pantene repair mist oil isnâ€™t too strong and dissipates fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>The oil mist lives up to its name -- it&#x27;s a gentle puff of fine mist that doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down, and is especially ideal for use before you use heat-styling products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Instead, I was delighted to find that this mist is incredibly light, yet instantly imparts a gorgeous shine, and the almost palpable feeling that you&#x27;re truly nourishing your hair.  </li>
            <li>sure if I will be adding this product to my general hair care, but I am enjoying using it every once in a while.</li>
            <li>Good enough for me.  </li>
            <li>For shine, a light spray after drying followed by a pat down do great for the rest of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My first impression was how fine the mist is.  </li>
            <li>This Keratin oil spray made my hair super shiny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first four ingredients are cyclopentasiloxane (a silicone to stop the hair breaking), dimethicone (also known as polydimethylsiloxane, a silicone oil that makes hair slippery), lauryl alcohol (an emollient to smooth and soothe) and Fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This item is sprayed into the consumer&#x27;s hair which was very appealing to me for those morning where I didn&#x27;t want to &#x27;physically&#x27; get my hands</li>
            <li>it works best on the ends of your hair to hide damage or reduce further damage like split ends, the spray is a fine mist so don&#x27;t be hestitant to spray and spray some more - it also works terrific the next day to spray on the ends and use your hair dryer to style.</li>
            <li>My hair looks shinier and less fly away when I use it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;May be useful to others but not to me.</li>
            <li>Gives your hair a healthy and natural shine.  </li>
            <li>Just as a refresher right before I go out.  </li>
            <li>Right off the bat</li>
            <li>/&gt;For fine normal or oily hair use one or two sprays for shine or for styling once dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeper</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells, the way it sprays in a fine, even mist, the way it makes my hair smooth and shiny with just a little blow-drying.</li>
            <li>and she constantly needs to be reminded to go very easy on the spray.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was a huge mistake because my hair kind of separated into clumps and looked oily (while wet!).  </li>
            <li>The product comes in a pump dispenser that makes it easy to direct the spray where you want it.  </li>
            <li>I prefer flowery, strong French perfumes to fruity smells, however it&#x27;s not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>not all of it goes exactly where you want it to go.</li>
            <li>Keratin Repair Keragloss Oil Mist is a lovely product for anyone wanting to add extra shine and conditioning to their hair.  </li>
            <li>I currently have bleach blonde hair that I often color in bright colors.  </li>
            <li>I was really curious to try the Pantene Pro-V Advanced+ Keratin Repair Keragloss Oil Mist, and admit that I was expecting some kind of spray version of the standard \\&quot;hot oil\\&quot; treatments from ages ago.</li>
            <li>With my type of hair I usually need a fair amount of product  and use both hands and the shape of the bottle and spray mechanism get slippery easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As one reviewer stated, this product does have silicone in it even though it&#x27;s largely fruit oils (argan, sesame, jojoba, safflower and olive).  </li>
            <li>Most of the time products like this leave my hair oily looking (despite the lack of use of any product has my hair looking dry!)</li>
            <li>She has very bleached an processed hair and even though she uses good products, I still get the occasional dry, fried feeling.</li>
            <li>It does add a nice shine, and I think it does make my hair a little smoother and easier to manage.&lt;br /&gt;Another</li>
            <li>It feels gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>I have really frizzy hair</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s greasy and stringy all day, and not with one of my gentle shampoos</li>
            <li>/&gt;But I WILL keep using it, and hope that my love affair with the stuff ends by the time this bottle is empty.</li>
            <li>A touch too much will make hair look oily and unwashed.</li>
            <li>My hair never got greasy like others reported, no matter how much I put in it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used silicone hair products before, and I really like them because my hair does tend to be frizzy.  </li>
            <li>Even though I like what they do for my hair, I don&#x27;t use them all that often just for that reason (plus the fact that my hair has to be washed again so much</li>
            <li>,I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>We did not notice any shine and after a whole week there didn&#x27;t appear to be any keratin repair.  </li>
            <li>This spray is nice for shine on dried hair.  </li>
            <li>Works good with thick hair.  </li>
            <li>and it was more oily than other shine sprays.</li>
            <li>its the first time I try keragloss Oil from Pantene after blowing out my hair looks beautifull and a soft shine (it depends how much you spray on)</li>
            <li>I make sure that it&#x27;s evenly distributed and then let my hair dry naturally</li>
            <li>wish I had had Pantene&#x27;s Pro-V Expert Collection Advanced+ Keratin Keragloss Oil when I was trying to manage my long brittle hair.</li>
            <li>Suggest you spray it lightly on hair when still damp and then blow dry.</li>
            <li>We go through Organix Moroccan Argan Oil rather quickly and have found that our local drugstore has stopped carrying this particular item.  </li>
            <li>High to lower price points</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>My hair feels silky and soft and very shiny.  </li>
            <li>bottle clearly states to not spray much and try to avoid over spraying the roots of the hair.  </li>
            <li>worth the money since a bottle will last quite a while.</li>
            <li>There was a nice beachy/coconut scent at least.  </li>
            <li>I use this product every other day or so to smooth down fly aways and tame the frizz .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ever since she started using this and other products in the line her hair feels soft and strong.</li>
            <li>I have long, coarse, thick, curly hair and have tried many of these types of  shine/spray products and some deliver better than others.</li>
            <li>I now have short hair (I cut it myself, finally) and this works well for me as a last minute addition to make the appearance of my hair look more finished and glossy.  </li>
            <li>we love to death even though they&#x27;re not very good for us</li>
            <li>The bottle size is substantial -- you easily get enough mist for several months even with daily use.</li>
            <li>But once it dried, it was fine.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a HUGE way.</li>
            <li>smell of the product is a little heavier than I&#x27;d like, and the scent isn&#x27;t my favorite (I&#x27;d rather that it smell like regular Pantene conditioner), but it&#x27;s not bad.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But then the next day, I absolutely have to wash my hair again or else</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve shared this with my 13 year old daughter</li>
            <li>Even my husband and young son noticed that it made my hair shinier.  </li>
            <li>It smells good on the outset, but I found it to have a weird off-putting under smell.</li>
            <li>I used this on damp hair and made sure not to spray too much, but after about half an hour my hair turned into this tangled mess, like I hadn&#x27;t combed it after waking up.</li>
            <li>short, it works as advertised and smells pleasant, but it&#x27;s a little messy.</li>
            <li>I am not sure this is an appropriate product for me hair, so I probably will not purchase it in the future.</li>
            <li>No stickiness or oiliness, just smooth, slick skin.  </li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s how it makes your hair feel:  Smooth and slick.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure exactly how much punch it has, and I wouldn&#x27;t use it alone to shape my hair in any way, but that is not its function.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>She said she wasn&#x27;t expecting a whole lot from this product based on the low price, but it definitely delivers.</li>
            <li>review said she had long hair and only used 3 squirts of this product, so that is what I tried the first time</li>
            <li>Be prepared to have a little bit of oil on surfaces in your restroom or vanity, especially if you&#x27;re using it during dry winter conditions when static electricity and cling are at their peak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have fine, thick hair with some frizz.  </li>
            <li>for the packaging itself, I did not care for the shape of the bottle or the spray applicator, which seemed rather cheap and delivered just a short, small &amp;#34;puff&amp;#34; of spray...</li>
            <li>only drawback is that the pump action spray bottle creates quite a cloud of oil mist, and</li>
            <li>If you spray it on your hand, you barely even feel it.  </li>
            <li>Instead, it left my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I used about 4 light sprays on my thick, medium length hair.  </li>
            <li>One note of caution, however- don&#x27;t overuse it (as I&#x27;m prone to do with other products that haven&#x27;t worked as well) as it doesn&#x27;t take much of this product to get the job done.</li>
            <li>So many product I&#x27;ve tried required the hair to be wet or at least damp</li>
            <li>But if I don&#x27;t comb it out when it&#x27;s wet, I probably do look a bit like Hermione (if only I had THAT much</li>
            <li>it, my hair gets a little straighter and stays straight longer.  </li>
            <li>For me, this Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection Advanced+ Keratin Repair Keragloss Oil is one of those things (don&#x27;t you hate it when products have huge names like that?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> People compliment her on how healthy and shiny my hair looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I sprayed a bit more to the point where I resort to spraying it onto my hands and running my fingers through her hair.  </li>

            <li> our love affair must remain on an indefinite hiatus.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to use this product, but the fragrance irritates my asthma.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always up for trying a new hair product, and I love Pantene, so I was happy to give this product a try.  </li>
            <li> Best advice is, if you have fine hair, use this product sparingly on the ends only.</li>
            <li> It sprays a fine mist, which keeps most overuse under control.</li>
            <li> Best of all, the scent of the Keragloss mist is divine -- a lovely perfume with slightly musky undertones.</li>
            <li> The smell is quite strong.</li>
            <li> I suspect if you had a strong perfume or deodorant that it might clash with the scent</li>
            <li> Sniff a sample if you can before you buy if you don&#x27;t like strong smells.  </li>
            <li> love Pantene products and have used many; this is the first one I&#x27;ve tried that has a downside.</li>
            <li> I was able to return this product, with a full refuld and a free return shipping label.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product claims shine and repair and doesn&#x27;t accurately deliver on neither claim.  </li>
            <li> it reminded me of the cheap spray applicators one buys to travel with.</li>
            <li> By way of disclosure, I received a free sample of this product for evaluation purposes.  </li>
            <li> This repair oil does help smooth it out and restore luster.  </li>
            <li> Coming them out lightly with a hair pick made them frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection Advanced+</li>
            <li> but Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection Advanced Keratin Keragloss Oil didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> When this product became available to review</li>
            <li> I love hair that shines and looks healthy whether worn straight or curly.</li>
            <li> This oil mist is probably the best product I&#x27;ve tried so far, and I generally buy salon products.  </li>
            <li> The scent of Pantene repair mist oil isnâ€™t too strong and dissipates fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> The oil mist lives up to its name -- it&#x27;s a gentle puff of fine mist that doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down, and is especially ideal for use before you use heat-styling products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Instead, I was delighted to find that this mist is incredibly light, yet instantly imparts a gorgeous shine, and the almost palpable feeling that you&#x27;re truly nourishing your hair.  </li>
            <li> sure if I will be adding this product to my general hair care, but I am enjoying using it every once in a while.</li>
            <li> Good enough for me.  </li>
            <li> For shine, a light spray after drying followed by a pat down do great for the rest of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My first impression was how fine the mist is.  </li>
            <li> This Keratin oil spray made my hair super shiny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first four ingredients are cyclopentasiloxane (a silicone to stop the hair breaking), dimethicone (also known as polydimethylsiloxane, a silicone oil that makes hair slippery), lauryl alcohol (an emollient to smooth and soothe) and Fragrance.  </li>
            <li> This item is sprayed into the consumer&#x27;s hair which was very appealing to me for those morning where I didn&#x27;t want to &#x27;physically&#x27; get my hands</li>
            <li> it works best on the ends of your hair to hide damage or reduce further damage like split ends, the spray is a fine mist so don&#x27;t be hestitant to spray and spray some more - it also works terrific the next day to spray on the ends and use your hair dryer to style.</li>
            <li> My hair looks shinier and less fly away when I use it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;May be useful to others but not to me.</li>
            <li> Gives your hair a healthy and natural shine.  </li>
            <li> Just as a refresher right before I go out.  </li>
            <li> Right off the bat</li>
            <li> /&gt;For fine normal or oily hair use one or two sprays for shine or for styling once dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeper</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells, the way it sprays in a fine, even mist, the way it makes my hair smooth and shiny with just a little blow-drying.</li>
            <li> and she constantly needs to be reminded to go very easy on the spray.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was a huge mistake because my hair kind of separated into clumps and looked oily (while wet!).  </li>
            <li> The product comes in a pump dispenser that makes it easy to direct the spray where you want it.  </li>
            <li> I prefer flowery, strong French perfumes to fruity smells, however it&#x27;s not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> not all of it goes exactly where you want it to go.</li>
            <li> Keratin Repair Keragloss Oil Mist is a lovely product for anyone wanting to add extra shine and conditioning to their hair.  </li>
            <li> I currently have bleach blonde hair that I often color in bright colors.  </li>
            <li> I was really curious to try the Pantene Pro-V Advanced+ Keratin Repair Keragloss Oil Mist, and admit that I was expecting some kind of spray version of the standard \\&quot;hot oil\\&quot; treatments from ages ago.</li>
            <li> With my type of hair I usually need a fair amount of product  and use both hands and the shape of the bottle and spray mechanism get slippery easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As one reviewer stated, this product does have silicone in it even though it&#x27;s largely fruit oils (argan, sesame, jojoba, safflower and olive).  </li>
            <li> Most of the time products like this leave my hair oily looking (despite the lack of use of any product has my hair looking dry!)</li>
            <li> She has very bleached an processed hair and even though she uses good products, I still get the occasional dry, fried feeling.</li>
            <li> It does add a nice shine, and I think it does make my hair a little smoother and easier to manage.&lt;br /&gt;Another</li>
            <li> It feels gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> I have really frizzy hair</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s greasy and stringy all day, and not with one of my gentle shampoos</li>
            <li> /&gt;But I WILL keep using it, and hope that my love affair with the stuff ends by the time this bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> A touch too much will make hair look oily and unwashed.</li>
            <li> My hair never got greasy like others reported, no matter how much I put in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used silicone hair products before, and I really like them because my hair does tend to be frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Even though I like what they do for my hair, I don&#x27;t use them all that often just for that reason (plus the fact that my hair has to be washed again so much</li>
            <li> ,I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> We did not notice any shine and after a whole week there didn&#x27;t appear to be any keratin repair.  </li>
            <li> This spray is nice for shine on dried hair.  </li>
            <li> Works good with thick hair.  </li>
            <li> and it was more oily than other shine sprays.</li>
            <li> its the first time I try keragloss Oil from Pantene after blowing out my hair looks beautifull and a soft shine (it depends how much you spray on)</li>
            <li> I make sure that it&#x27;s evenly distributed and then let my hair dry naturally</li>
            <li> wish I had had Pantene&#x27;s Pro-V Expert Collection Advanced+ Keratin Keragloss Oil when I was trying to manage my long brittle hair.</li>
            <li> Suggest you spray it lightly on hair when still damp and then blow dry.</li>
            <li> We go through Organix Moroccan Argan Oil rather quickly and have found that our local drugstore has stopped carrying this particular item.  </li>
            <li> High to lower price points</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My hair feels silky and soft and very shiny.  </li>
            <li> bottle clearly states to not spray much and try to avoid over spraying the roots of the hair.  </li>
            <li> worth the money since a bottle will last quite a while.</li>
            <li> There was a nice beachy/coconut scent at least.  </li>
            <li> I use this product every other day or so to smooth down fly aways and tame the frizz .&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ever since she started using this and other products in the line her hair feels soft and strong.</li>
            <li> I have long, coarse, thick, curly hair and have tried many of these types of  shine/spray products and some deliver better than others.</li>
            <li> I now have short hair (I cut it myself, finally) and this works well for me as a last minute addition to make the appearance of my hair look more finished and glossy.  </li>
            <li> we love to death even though they&#x27;re not very good for us</li>
            <li> The bottle size is substantial -- you easily get enough mist for several months even with daily use.</li>
            <li> But once it dried, it was fine.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a HUGE way.</li>
            <li> smell of the product is a little heavier than I&#x27;d like, and the scent isn&#x27;t my favorite (I&#x27;d rather that it smell like regular Pantene conditioner), but it&#x27;s not bad.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But then the next day, I absolutely have to wash my hair again or else</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shared this with my 13 year old daughter</li>
            <li> Even my husband and young son noticed that it made my hair shinier.  </li>
            <li> It smells good on the outset, but I found it to have a weird off-putting under smell.</li>
            <li> I used this on damp hair and made sure not to spray too much, but after about half an hour my hair turned into this tangled mess, like I hadn&#x27;t combed it after waking up.</li>
            <li> short, it works as advertised and smells pleasant, but it&#x27;s a little messy.</li>
            <li> I am not sure this is an appropriate product for me hair, so I probably will not purchase it in the future.</li>
            <li> No stickiness or oiliness, just smooth, slick skin.  </li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s how it makes your hair feel:  Smooth and slick.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure exactly how much punch it has, and I wouldn&#x27;t use it alone to shape my hair in any way, but that is not its function.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> She said she wasn&#x27;t expecting a whole lot from this product based on the low price, but it definitely delivers.</li>
            <li> review said she had long hair and only used 3 squirts of this product, so that is what I tried the first time</li>
            <li> Be prepared to have a little bit of oil on surfaces in your restroom or vanity, especially if you&#x27;re using it during dry winter conditions when static electricity and cling are at their peak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have fine, thick hair with some frizz.  </li>
            <li> for the packaging itself, I did not care for the shape of the bottle or the spray applicator, which seemed rather cheap and delivered just a short, small &amp;#34;puff&amp;#34; of spray...</li>
            <li> only drawback is that the pump action spray bottle creates quite a cloud of oil mist, and</li>
            <li> If you spray it on your hand, you barely even feel it.  </li>
            <li> Instead, it left my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I used about 4 light sprays on my thick, medium length hair.  </li>
            <li> One note of caution, however- don&#x27;t overuse it (as I&#x27;m prone to do with other products that haven&#x27;t worked as well) as it doesn&#x27;t take much of this product to get the job done.</li>
            <li> So many product I&#x27;ve tried required the hair to be wet or at least damp</li>
            <li> But if I don&#x27;t comb it out when it&#x27;s wet, I probably do look a bit like Hermione (if only I had THAT much</li>
            <li> it, my hair gets a little straighter and stays straight longer.  </li>
            <li> For me, this Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection Advanced+ Keratin Repair Keragloss Oil is one of those things (don&#x27;t you hate it when products have huge names like that?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference when I use it when my hair is wet, especially compared with my other hair serums.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has a thick, curly dry mane, while my youngest has average thickness while being pretty straight.  </li>
            <li> A few sprays on damp hair gets them ready to blow dry or air</li>
            <li> The amount you get will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> On days that I flat iron</li>
            <li> I have dryish, middle-aged, naturally 70% gray but color treated hair that is very thick, very coarse, and very wavy (bordering on curly), and long.  </li>
            <li> fact, i am not sure WHY this got such high reviews...</li>
            <li> liquid is a slightly orange-tinged, clear oil.</li>
            <li> the keragloss oil &amp;#34;outshines&amp;#34; all of the other more expensive products</li>
            <li> (even my daughter has been commenting lately that I have \\&quot;such soft hair,\\&quot; and she doesn&#x27;t know I&#x27;m doing anything different</li>
            <li> I have long, permed hair</li>
            <li> (I too have long hair).</li>
            <li> This was the end of my relationship with Pantene for a long while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this both on dry hair after styling and on wet hair if I&#x27;m just pulling it back into a bun or braids.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely buy this again and get rid of my other sprays.  </li>
            <li> My experience is so different from every other review, though, that I wonder if I got a defective bottle?</li>
            <li> In the past, these kind of hair glossers/oil have always made my thin, limp, semi wavy/frizzy hair greasy and look like I haven&#x27;t shampooed in a month.  </li>
            <li> I have coarse hair that can get dry, due to styling and coloring.  </li>
            <li> On dry hair, then brushed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve started using the spray on my dry hair too.  </li>
            <li> if you have (like me) dry hair or a dry scalp, then this product is helpful with regard to moisturing your hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li> Another thing I like about the product is it can be used on dry hair.  </li>
            <li> This product leaves hair so shiny after your blow dry</li>
            <li> I had my daughter&#x27;s dry curly mane in mind and the review of the product will be based on my experience with her hair</li>
            <li> Personally all Pantene products have always dulled and dried out our different types of hair.  </li>
            <li> wife and older daughter have thick hair that can become a bit unruly in dry winter weather.  </li>
            <li> It is long, about midway down my back with curls.  </li>
            <li> Because I don&#x27;t have time to shampoo every single morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally I tried putting a ton in my damp hair just as a test, but again, no difference except my hair got &amp;#34;bed head&amp;#34; about half an hour later.</li>
            <li> and you can use it on wet or dry hair</li>
            <li> but it seems glossier when you blow dry your tresses after applying it to wet hair.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use it when my hair is wet and sometimes when it is dry.</li>
            <li> I tried this product on a finished style, on dry hair, and on wet hair that was then blow-dried.</li>
            <li> Long ago I gave up on Pantene products because I found them to be harsh on different hair types in our household.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You only need a little spray, unless you want a greasy look to your hair.</li>
            <li> and it tames it with only a few sprays.</li>
            <li> I used the spray on wet hair before blow drying.</li>
            <li> but I was careful to use it sparingly.  </li>
            <li> hair is just below shoulder length, color treated, thick with some natural wave.</li>
            <li> I am African-American, and have thick natural hair.</li>
            <li> Though not a strong fragrance by any means, but enough to cause me to stop using.  </li>
            <li> it definitely does make my hair look glossier without weighing it down or making it limp.  </li>
            <li> One word of caution â€“ a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This bottle lasts forever because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and somewhat coarse, and I do notice my hair has a smoother appearance after I brush this through my hair (when dry).</li>
            <li> out the other product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We have both types in our home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For thick coarse post menopause curly neck length hair</li>
            <li> daughter has very thick and curly hair that feels dry from the constant use of gel at that time.  </li>
            <li> I tried it on dry hair just on my ends, which curled up tighter than usual and &amp;#34;chunked&amp;#34; together.</li>
            <li> I figured it would be a slightly \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; product that would have to be used in severe moderation so that it didn&#x27;t weigh down your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On ends to make them less frizzy</li>
            <li> My hair feels less frizzy and its not as tangled.  </li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s hair is long, thick, curly in some places, and color treated.  </li>
            <li> , the first time I used it, I went a little crazy and put probably 10 pumps in my hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But silicone anti-frizz treatments tend to be very heavy, so they must be applied carefully.  </li>
            <li> For my type of hair, it provided temporary shine but little else.</li>
            <li> The mister seems to put out so little that</li>
            <li> On damp hair, then dried with a hair dryer</li>
            <li> Combines quite a few oils in its formula.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise it did nothing but make me have to put my hair in a ponytail a few times.</li>
            <li> I have short, thin, wavy hair and it does improve the look.</li>
            <li> I personally have thin wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> My already limp hair had a greasy appearance.  </li>
            <li> Almost nothing can tame my frizzies.  </li>
            <li> She applies a small amount (a few pumps) into her hair after showering.  </li>
            <li> It is a small bottle and needs to be squeezed onto your palm which makes it messy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously contemplating getting rid of that box of other leave-in hair products, and sticking solely with this one.</li>
            <li> If they come up with an unscented version, I will be anxious to purchase.  </li>
            <li> It probably doesn&#x27;t help that I don&#x27;t usually blow-dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> applied the product to my thin hair and did so with much less spray-gusto than my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me at all, and after reading reviews, I think it&#x27;s just not very good for thick hair</li>
            <li> It has been hard for me to get in the habit of using this product.</li>
            <li> (my hair is very long, but also very thin, with a medium texture).  </li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> but it was just too heavy for my thin hair.  </li>
            <li> The instructions on this bottle say to use sparingly, and boy do they mean it.  </li>
            <li> pay a lot for it--so not too mad, but wasted money is wasted money</li>
            <li> and we feel bad about our choices the next day.</li>
            <li> The scent is faint and fades after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Maybe heat or cold affected the active ingredients in it, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact her hair felt dirty even though she was washing it everyday.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s difficult to described the Fragrance -</li>
            <li> I am sorry Pantene but</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I found all three recommended ways to use it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. On damp hair, then dried with a hair dryer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. On dry hair, then brushed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. On ends to make them less frizzy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only need a little spray, unless you want a greasy look to your hair. It can be used instead of serum to keep hair from flying away and getting frizzy. It says it lasts for 48 hours and I verified that not only was my hair still shiny after that time, but the fragrance was evident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s difficult to described the Fragrance - but it&#x27;s foodie rather than flowery, smelling a bit like a cinnamon bun or pumpkin pie with fruity overtones. The smell is quite strong. I prefer flowery, strong French perfumes to fruity smells, however it&#x27;s not unpleasant. I suspect if you had a strong perfume or deodorant that it might clash with the scent - so for some people an unscented version might be nice. As I get used to the smell it seems more pleasant. Sniff a sample if you can before you buy if you don&#x27;t like strong smells.  So I&#x27;ll give it a 4 instead of a 5 for the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first four ingredients are cyclopentasiloxane (a silicone to stop the hair breaking), dimethicone (also known as polydimethylsiloxane, a silicone oil that makes hair slippery), lauryl alcohol (an emollient to smooth and soothe) and Fragrance.  The 5 exotic oils are from argan (a desert plant from Morocco),  safflower, olive, sesame and jojoba plants or seeds. A final ingredient is panthenol that binds to hair and seals it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The liquid is a slightly orange-tinged, clear oil. It feels gentle on the skin. My hair tends to frizz and fly away, so I like the Keragloss Oil as it tames my mane.</li>
            <li> I was really curious to try the Pantene Pro-V Advanced+ Keratin Repair Keragloss Oil Mist, and admit that I was expecting some kind of spray version of the standard \\&quot;hot oil\\&quot; treatments from ages ago. I figured it would be a slightly \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; product that would have to be used in severe moderation so that it didn&#x27;t weigh down your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, I was delighted to find that this mist is incredibly light, yet instantly imparts a gorgeous shine, and the almost palpable feeling that you&#x27;re truly nourishing your hair.  The oil mist lives up to its name -- it&#x27;s a gentle puff of fine mist that doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down, and is especially ideal for use before you use heat-styling products. When I did so, I ended up with perfect styling, and a soft added shine (plus the feeling of strong, healthy heat-styled hair -- no dryness or heat damage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d enthusiastically recommend the Keragloss Oil Mist, especially to those whose hair needs an ongoing, daily boost of strength, nourishment and shine.  The bottle size is substantial -- you easily get enough mist for several months even with daily use. Best of all, the scent of the Keragloss mist is divine -- a lovely perfume with slightly musky undertones.</li>
            <li> The spray definitely does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I have really frizzy hair and it tames it with only a few sprays. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair or scalp oily or greasy and keeps my hair mostly tangle-free throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it every time I wash my hair and noticed that my hair feels softer with every use and is a lot healthier and shinier looking. A must have product that is great for both summer and winter!</li>
            <li> I found this product to be just ok. I have long, coarse, thick, curly hair and have tried many of these types of  shine/spray products and some deliver better than others. For my type of hair, it provided temporary shine but little else. In a short while, dullness set in. Unfortunately as with many products it is a matter of trial and error, and your results may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the packaging itself, I did not care for the shape of the bottle or the spray applicator, which seemed rather cheap and delivered just a short, small &amp;#34;puff&amp;#34; of spray...it reminded me of the cheap spray applicators one buys to travel with. With my type of hair I usually need a fair amount of product  and use both hands and the shape of the bottle and spray mechanism get slippery easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May be useful to others but not to me.</li>
            <li> Well, I suppose we all have things (or people) we love to death even though they&#x27;re not very good for us and we feel bad about our choices the next day. For me, this Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection Advanced+ Keratin Repair Keragloss Oil is one of those things (don&#x27;t you hate it when products have huge names like that?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I love this stuff. I love the way it smells, the way it sprays in a fine, even mist, the way it makes my hair smooth and shiny with just a little blow-drying. But then the next day, I absolutely have to wash my hair again or else it&#x27;s greasy and stringy all day, and not with one of my gentle shampoos either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I WILL keep using it, and hope that my love affair with the stuff ends by the time this bottle is empty. Because I don&#x27;t have time to shampoo every single morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Pantene products and have used many; this is the first one I&#x27;ve tried that has a downside. Maybe women with curlier or thicker hair would not have the same problem.</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant to try this. In the past, these kind of hair glossers/oil have always made my thin, limp, semi wavy/frizzy hair greasy and look like I haven&#x27;t shampooed in a month.  I currently have bleach blonde hair that I often color in bright colors.  I use this product every other day or so to smooth down fly aways and tame the frizz .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very light and has a pleasant smell.  I use this both on dry hair after styling and on wet hair if I&#x27;m just pulling it back into a bun or braids.  As one reviewer stated, this product does have silicone in it even though it&#x27;s largely fruit oils (argan, sesame, jojoba, safflower and olive).  To avoid buildup, use a clarifying conditioner once a week.</li>
            <li> In my experience, this lightweight, pleasantly scented oil spray lives up to its promises.  When used judiciously (which I recommend) it definitely does make my hair look glossier without weighing it down or making it limp.  I find the most effective application method for me is to spray some in my hands and then massage it into my damp hair.  I make sure that it&#x27;s evenly distributed and then let my hair dry naturally which enhances my curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the results; my thirsty hair soaks up the moisture and looks noticeably shinier, healthier and more controlled as a result.</li>
            <li> Do you want shiny and beautiful hair? I&#x27;ve tried everything out there. High to lower price points and this is the line that is the best ever.</li>
            <li> I have coarse hair that can get dry, due to styling and coloring.  Often, I use various serums and oils to control frizz or flyaways.  The instructions on this bottle say to use sparingly, and boy do they mean it.  I used about 4 light sprays on my thick, medium length hair.  It felt greasy for about a week afterward, even with daily washing.  I am not sure this is an appropriate product for me hair, so I probably will not purchase it in the future.</li>
            <li> I do love it.  My hair feels silky and soft and very shiny.  Also, I love the scent!  I think its vanilla and something else? I used the spray on wet hair before blow drying. My hair feels less frizzy and its not as tangled.  I have thick wavy hair.  I would definitely buy this again and get rid of my other sprays.  I do use a conditioner after shampooing but still need to use a spray to make my hair more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve started using the spray on my dry hair too.  Just as a refresher right before I go out.  It does make it look shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> This Keratin oil spray made my hair super shiny. It didn&#x27;t actually repair anything, but it kept my damaged ends unnoticeable. A little goes a HUGE way. I&#x27;ve shared this with my 13 year old daughter and she constantly needs to be reminded to go very easy on the spray. A touch too much will make hair look oily and unwashed. It sprays a fine mist, which keeps most overuse under control. Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> By way of disclosure, I received a free sample of this product for evaluation purposes.  I have tried to be objective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and older daughter have thick hair that can become a bit unruly in dry winter weather.  This repair oil does help smooth it out and restore luster.  It smells pleasant, too.  A few sprays on damp hair gets them ready to blow dry or air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is that the pump action spray bottle creates quite a cloud of oil mist, and not all of it goes exactly where you want it to go. Be prepared to have a little bit of oil on surfaces in your restroom or vanity, especially if you&#x27;re using it during dry winter conditions when static electricity and cling are at their peak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, it works as advertised and smells pleasant, but it&#x27;s a little messy.</li>
            <li> if you have (like me) dry hair or a dry scalp, then this product is helpful with regard to moisturing your hair and scalp.  Gives your hair a healthy and natural shine.  Helps to control your hair like hair spray, but without the chemicals.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have MUCH better items that i have used--&lt;br /&gt;in fact, i am not sure WHY this got such high reviews...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i will not be buying it again,&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t seem to do ANYTHING for the hair,&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t add shine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t tell WHAT it does or what it is SUPPOSED to do&lt;br /&gt;save your money and get look around for another product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t pay a lot for it--so not too mad, but wasted money is wasted money</li>
            <li> This has a nice fragrance.  Works good with thick hair.  Can be used sparingly.  The amount you get will last a long time.  Combines quite a few oils in its formula.  Quality product at a good price.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me at all, and after reading reviews, I think it&#x27;s just not very good for thick hair like I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is just below shoulder length, color treated, thick with some natural wave. I used this on damp hair and made sure not to spray too much, but after about half an hour my hair turned into this tangled mess, like I hadn&#x27;t combed it after waking up. It stayed that way all day and almost seemed like the hair lotion I used wasn&#x27;t doing its job, like this spray &amp;#34;canceled&amp;#34; out the other product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tried it on dry hair just on my ends, which curled up tighter than usual and &amp;#34;chunked&amp;#34; together. Coming them out lightly with a hair pick made them frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally I tried putting a ton in my damp hair just as a test, but again, no difference except my hair got &amp;#34;bed head&amp;#34; about half an hour later. My hair never got greasy like others reported, no matter how much I put in it. But it never had any shine, no smoothing effects and no frizz control either. The smell is okay -- reminds me of that &amp;#34;Mink&amp;#34; hair spray from the 1980s. Otherwise it did nothing but make me have to put my hair in a ponytail a few times. I just can&#x27;t use this again. My experience is so different from every other review, though, that I wonder if I got a defective bottle? Maybe heat or cold affected the active ingredients in it, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> While this product does contain various oils, it does not contain keratin.  It smells good on the outset, but I found it to have a weird off-putting under smell. I am African-American, and have thick natural hair. This spray did nothing noticeabe to my hair, and did not give it a sheen.  Amazon, however, is the GREATEST !!! I was able to return this product, with a full refuld and a free return shipping label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS AMAZON !!!</li>
            <li> Great product that keep the frizziness at bay without looking greasy and unwashed. I have long, permed hair and it&#x27;s perfect for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the money since a bottle will last quite a while.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thick hair with some frizz.  It is long, about midway down my back with curls.  The scent of Pantene repair mist oil isnâ€™t too strong and dissipates fairly quickly.  The product comes in a pump dispenser that makes it easy to direct the spray where you want it.  One word of caution â€“ a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair didn&#x27;t feel any heavier with the oil mist but I was careful to use it sparingly.  It did make my hair look shinier without it looking oily.  Another thing I like about the product is it can be used on dry hair.  So many product I&#x27;ve tried required the hair to be wet or at least damp so this was an added plus!</li>
            <li> Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection Advanced+ Keratin Repair Keragloss Oil Mist is a lovely product for anyone wanting to add extra shine and conditioning to their hair.  I was very excited to use this product, but the fragrance irritates my asthma.  Though not a strong fragrance by any means, but enough to cause me to stop using.  If they come up with an unscented version, I will be anxious to purchase.  Don&#x27;t go by my review alone; try it yourself and you may be very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I have used it once and it was more oily than other shine sprays. Suggest you spray it lightly on hair when still damp and then blow dry.</li>
            <li> Review of: Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection Advanced + Keratin Repair Keragloss Oil Mist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for my wife through Vine in exchange for an honest review.  This product is a hair glosser designed to protect hair. The ingredients are Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Lauryl, Alcohol, Fragrance, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Carthamus Tinctorius, (Safflower) Seed Oil, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Panthenol.  The oil mist is bronze in color.  My wife&#x27;s hair is long, thick, curly in some places, and color treated.  She said that she needed this oil.  She applies a small amount (a few pumps) into her hair after showering.  She then brushes the product through her hair and towel dries and then blow dries it.  She claims that she loves it as it manages frizz, protects color treatment, and leaves her hair lustrous yet manageable.  Good enough for me.  Five stars without reservation.</li>
            <li> This spray is nice for shine on dried hair.  I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference when I use it when my hair is wet, especially compared with my other hair serums.  My hair is thick and somewhat coarse, and I do notice my hair has a smoother appearance after I brush this through my hair (when dry).</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t oily, but softens hair and gives it a bit of extra lustre. My fiancee likes the results and the scent, and I can confirm both counts as well!</li>
            <li> I now have short hair (I cut it myself, finally) and this works well for me as a last minute addition to make the appearance of my hair look more finished and glossy.  I am not sure exactly how much punch it has, and I wouldn&#x27;t use it alone to shape my hair in any way, but that is not its function.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had had Pantene&#x27;s Pro-V Expert Collection Advanced+ Keratin Keragloss Oil when I was trying to manage my long brittle hair. I would have liked to have seen if it would have been able to control and add luster to that hairstyle.&lt;br /&gt;Usually when I give up and cut my hair, I end up growing it back out, so perhaps we shall see if this product is still working as well by the time my hair is a bit longer!&lt;br /&gt;thanks,&lt;br /&gt;jean</li>
            <li> We have both types in our home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For thick coarse post menopause curly neck length hair it works best on the ends of your hair to hide damage or reduce further damage like split ends, the spray is a fine mist so don&#x27;t be hestitant to spray and spray some more - it also works terrific the next day to spray on the ends and use your hair dryer to style. For shine, a light spray after drying followed by a pat down do great for the rest of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For fine normal or oily hair use one or two sprays for shine or for styling once dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeper</li>
            <li> Pantene has done it again, this will make your hair so shiny!</li>
            <li> I have literally dozens of hair products that I have bought to try to control my frizzy hair.  I have dryish, middle-aged, naturally 70% gray but color treated hair that is very thick, very coarse, and very wavy (bordering on curly), and long.  Almost nothing can tame my frizzies.  This oil mist is probably the best product I&#x27;ve tried so far, and I generally buy salon products.  Even my husband and young son noticed that it made my hair shinier.  And best of all, it does an amazingly good job of controlling the frizz.  I use about 5 sprays on my hair, and my hair stays noticeably smoother through humid days and even the next day.  On days that I flat iron it, my hair gets a little straighter and stays straight longer.  As an added bonus, it smells amazing.  I&#x27;m seriously contemplating getting rid of that box of other leave-in hair products, and sticking solely with this one.</li>
            <li> Pantene Pro-V Expert Keratin Repair helps to maintain and nourish hair.  The sprayer works great and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> This product leaves hair so shiny after your blow dry that is absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> KILLS THE FRIZZIES!  SMELLS NICE, TOO!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used silicone hair products before, and I really like them because my hair does tend to be frizzy.  Part of that now comes from dyeing, but I&#x27;ve just always had, as a rather tactless high-school teacher told me, \\&quot;witch hair.\\&quot;  It probably doesn&#x27;t help that I don&#x27;t usually blow-dry my hair.  But if I don&#x27;t comb it out when it&#x27;s wet, I probably do look a bit like Hermione (if only I had THAT much hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But silicone anti-frizz treatments tend to be very heavy, so they must be applied carefully.  Even though I like what they do for my hair, I don&#x27;t use them all that often just for that reason (plus the fact that my hair has to be washed again so much sooner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;m always up for trying a new hair product, and I love Pantene, so I was happy to give this product a try.  My first impression was how fine the mist is.  If you spray it on your hand, you barely even feel it.  Rub your hands together, and in an instant, it&#x27;s gone.  No stickiness or oiliness, just smooth, slick skin.  And that&#x27;s how it makes your hair feel:  Smooth and slick.  The mister seems to put out so little that, the first time I used it, I went a little crazy and put probably 10 pumps in my hair.  At first I thought it was a huge mistake because my hair kind of separated into clumps and looked oily (while wet!).  But once it dried, it was fine.  And yeah, it felt great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I use maybe four or five pumps each time (my hair is very long, but also very thin, with a medium texture).  I think my hair starts looking like it needs to be washed maybe about 25% sooner than when I don&#x27;t use this glosser.  But in the meantime, I have especially nice hair (even my daughter has been commenting lately that I have \\&quot;such soft hair,\\&quot; and she doesn&#x27;t know I&#x27;m doing anything different lately).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the product is a little heavier than I&#x27;d like, and the scent isn&#x27;t my favorite (I&#x27;d rather that it smell like regular Pantene conditioner), but it&#x27;s not bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be getting this again.</li>
            <li> Most of the time products like this leave my hair oily looking (despite the lack of use of any product has my hair looking dry!) but Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection Advanced Keratin Keragloss Oil didn&#x27;t. Instead, it left my hair soft and shiny. I plan to keep using this product! One note of caution, however- don&#x27;t overuse it (as I&#x27;m prone to do with other products that haven&#x27;t worked as well) as it doesn&#x27;t take much of this product to get the job done.</li>
            <li> This bottle lasts forever because a little goes a long way. It moisturizes and adds shine and you can use it on wet or dry hair but it seems glossier when you blow dry your tresses after applying it to wet hair. The scent is faint and fades after a few minutes. I would buy this again but a bottle will easily last 6 months or longer and I have shoulder length hair. I love the softness and that is tames my frizzy strands.</li>
            <li> great shine without making my fine hair look greasy. very light mist</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy so I didn&#x27;t use this and know nothing about it. But I got it for my girlfriend and she liked it. She said she wasn&#x27;t expecting a whole lot from this product based on the low price, but it definitely delivers. She has very bleached an processed hair and even though she uses good products, I still get the occasional dry, fried feeling. Ever since she started using this and other products in the line her hair feels soft and strong. People compliment her on how healthy and shiny my hair looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There, no you have a review of this. Admittedly it&#x27;s second hand, but I hope you can believe me.</li>
            <li> It has been hard for me to get in the habit of using this product. I&#x27;ve been trying it out for weeks on and off. It seems to be best when I put it on my hands and then run it through my hair. Sometimes I use it when my hair is wet and sometimes when it is dry. The smell is sort of coconuty and the oil feels very light on the hands. I don&#x27;t feel like I must wash my hands after I apply it. My hair looks shinier and less fly away when I use it. I wash my hair almost every day so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about how it looks on day two, but have not noticed a problem. I have short, thin, wavy hair and it does improve the look. Thus, I should get in the habit of using it every day.</li>
            <li> its the first time I try keragloss Oil from Pantene after blowing out my hair looks beautifull and a soft shine (it depends how much you spray on) my hair looks and feels great.this is another prime product for me,I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> I tried this product on a finished style, on dry hair, and on wet hair that was then blow-dried. It does add a nice shine, and I think it does make my hair a little smoother and easier to manage.&lt;br /&gt;Another review said she had long hair and only used 3 squirts of this product, so that is what I tried the first time (I too have long hair). 3 squirts was not enough for me. I up&#x27;d it to 7 and then 10. I think 7 was probably enough.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if I will be adding this product to my general hair care, but I am enjoying using it every once in a while.</li>
            <li> Long ago I gave up on Pantene products because I found them to be harsh on different hair types in our household.  I personally have thin wavy hair.  My daughter has a thick, curly dry mane, while my youngest has average thickness while being pretty straight.  When this product became available to review I had my daughter&#x27;s dry curly mane in mind and the review of the product will be based on my experience with her hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has very thick and curly hair that feels dry from the constant use of gel at that time.  We go through Organix Moroccan Argan Oil rather quickly and have found that our local drugstore has stopped carrying this particular item.  It is a small bottle and needs to be squeezed onto your palm which makes it messy.  This item is sprayed into the consumer&#x27;s hair which was very appealing to me for those morning where I didn&#x27;t want to &#x27;physically&#x27; get my hands dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle clearly states to not spray much and try to avoid over spraying the roots of the hair.  A couple of sprays later and it didn&#x27;t even begin to penetrate.  I sprayed a bit more to the point where I resort to spraying it onto my hands and running my fingers through her hair.  There was a nice beachy/coconut scent at least.  We did not notice any shine and after a whole week there didn&#x27;t appear to be any keratin repair.  As a matter of fact her hair felt dirty even though she was washing it everyday.  We had to apply a clarifying treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the product to my thin hair and did so with much less spray-gusto than my daughter&#x27;s hair.  Right off the bat I saw a noticeable shine but it was just too heavy for my thin hair.  My already limp hair had a greasy appearance.  This was the end of my relationship with Pantene for a long while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not recommend this over-priced product.  Personally all Pantene products have always dulled and dried out our different types of hair.  This product claims shine and repair and doesn&#x27;t accurately deliver on neither claim.  I am sorry Pantene but our love affair must remain on an indefinite hiatus.ately deliver on neither claim.  I am sorry Pantene but our love affair must remain on an indefinite hiatus.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. Its one of a kind - nothing comes close to it. I love hair that shines and looks healthy whether worn straight or curly. Best advice is, if you have fine hair, use this product sparingly on the ends only. Otherwise hair starts looking oily. But for unbeatable shine (and it repairs while it shines) the keragloss oil &amp;#34;outshines&amp;#34; all of the other more expensive products and I have tried them all. (redken, kerastase, lee stanford, tony and guy etc, etc)</li>
            <li> Best product ever for your hair I love it!</li>
