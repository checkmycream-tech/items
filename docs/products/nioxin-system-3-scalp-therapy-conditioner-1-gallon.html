            <li>I love this conditioner and am glad to be able to get it in the gallon size!</li>
            <li>When I switched to amazon I got much more of a deal   for the price.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the price &amp; having a gallon on hand.</li>
            <li>and I can tell that my hair has transformed into healthy hair.  </li>
            <li>It cleans all the follicles of the hair, and keeps it healthy, and it stops thinning and falling out.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Buying in the large container is a good savings</li>
            <li>The conditioner is fine.  </li>
            <li>the best hair care there is my hair has gotten so much stronger and healthur and its actually growing my hair</li>
            <li>Because I use so much more of the conditioner than the shampoo, being able to buy a good quantity is useful and brings the price down.</li>
            <li>Leaves the scalp feeling refreshed and smells clean.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the product and will definitely purchase it again when needed.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased a gallon that was &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I have a large family and this is just what I need to save money.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Saved a REAL lot of money over store price.</li>
            <li>I bought a 6.3 oz bottle retail for almost as much as this gallon cost</li>
            <li>and it was completely sealed and is the real deal.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s thin and fine - Nioxin is easy on my color and helps my hair seem stronger and thicker.</li>
            <li>I can use the large jug to refill into smaller ones for the two bathrooms with showers.</li>
            <li>and I use it for my sensitive scalp.  </li>
            <li>It was full and not watered down.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product from this vendor as compared to local beauty supply stores!</li>

            <li> This Is the product that I used way before Amazon.   When I switched to amazon I got much more of a deal   for the price.  Thanks Amazon !!!!!!!!!!    Randall V Hall    comadude.com  \\&quot;A Ten Year Journey\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Love the smell. It was full and not watered down. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product! You can feel the tingling sensation when applied</li>
            <li> Love the product.  Price is excellent</li>
            <li> Love this product!! Works wonders.  Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I color my hair, it&#x27;s thin and fine - Nioxin is easy on my color and helps my hair seem stronger and thicker.</li>
            <li> Best products available for strengthening hair!</li>
            <li> I have a large family and this is just what I need to save money. I can use the large jug to refill into smaller ones for the two bathrooms with showers. This product is amazing and it keeps dandruff at bay. Thank you for the quick shipping and excellent product.</li>
            <li> Everything fulfilled as described.</li>
            <li> It works well on a person with a thin hair.</li>
            <li> the best hair care there is my hair has gotten so much stronger and healthur and its actually growing my hair never grows becasue i straighten it all the time.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is fine.  I seem to be allergic to regular shampoos and conditioners,  My head does not itch and my hair does not fall out when usihg Nioxin.  However, I had, again, thought I was purchasing shampoo and was annoyed to find I had ordered conditioner.  The description on these is poor.  They should use the words shampoo and conditioner in the heading.</li>
            <li> Great product is affordable in this size. No more trips for re-supply.</li>
            <li> This is a outstanding product and the price is excellent. I highly recommend this product from this vendor as compared to local beauty supply stores!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using nioxin cleanser for at least 9 years.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased a gallon that was &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34;.  It is NOT pure Nioxin cleanser.  It has some additive that smells awful.  I&#x27;ll never buy from this company again!</li>
            <li> Love the price &amp; having a gallon on hand.</li>
            <li> this is a great product.  my hair dresser recommended that I buy it.  I&#x27;ve been using for over 3 years and I can tell that my hair has transformed into healthy hair.  You must buy the shampoo with this and the leave in treatment.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner and am glad to be able to get it in the gallon size!</li>
            <li> Just as described....&lt;br /&gt;Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> You need to leave this conditioner on your scalp for 3-5 minutes.  You can feel it working...feels like a peppermint tingle.  I shut off the shower and wait the 5 minutes.  It cleans all the follicles of the hair, and keeps it healthy, and it stops thinning and falling out.  Best product out there for keeping hair healthy...and just keeping hair!!!</li>
            <li> Takes a long time but has helped my hair a lot</li>
            <li> Great product.  Will order again</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Great price.</li>

            <li> great hair care prodct</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product and will definitely purchase it again when needed.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. My daughter uses it for her eczema and I use it for my sensitive scalp.  Leaves the scalp feeling refreshed and smells clean.</li>
            <li> Saved a REAL lot of money over store price. I bought a 6.3 oz bottle retail for almost as much as this gallon cost</li>
