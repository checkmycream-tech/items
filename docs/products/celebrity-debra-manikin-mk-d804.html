            <li>My daughter needed this for her cosmetology class and has found this to be wonderful to work on ~  Seller is great ~ super fast ship!  </li>
            <li>Great mannequin to practice on, I will absolutely order more !!</li>
            <li>i would have liked it better if it hadnt.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s good quality hair and it manages really well , they sent me off !!!</li>
            <li>I was also very pleased with how quickly I received it!  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly !!</li>
            <li>Daughter likes very much; she likes it, the wife &amp; I love it !!</li>
            <li>This item arrived in good shape and quickly.  </li>
            <li>Loved it and is the exact replicate of my class mannequins!</li>
            <li>The hair on this manikin was actually in better condition than my school ones---which cost me more.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, be advised there are painted catch lights in her eyes, and when I blackened those in to better judge my lighting, I found the plane of the eyes to be somewhat downward.  </li>
            <li>I am able to braided without worrying that it will fall out</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll deff be getting another one soon. :)</li>
            <li>and she curls perfectly where synthetic hair would burn and turn white at the ends.</li>
            <li>I just wish they&#x27;d talk more, they are quite introverted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>love lining my yard with these.</li>
            <li>Everything was okay.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t have many nits in it like the ones you get in school.</li>
            <li>The doll needs more hair she was almost bald .</li>
            <li>Her hair was way better than the Tina doll.  </li>
            <li>This mannequin was way better than the ones provided at my school (and cheaper).</li>
            <li>More on the pricier range</li>
            <li>but I still love Debra.</li>
            <li>She does freak a lot of people out as she sits at the top of my closet.</li>
            <li>My daughter has been able to do lots of designs.</li>
            <li>I brought to the college today and we found even more Lice and Knits.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased since I was very nervous about ordering one offline.</li>
            <li>The hair is amazing, 100% REAL HAIR!</li>
            <li>Will work just fine.</li>
            <li>The hair quality is good, very soft.</li>
            <li>According to my Granddaughter, the thickness of the hair was just right, she was able to practice several hair cuts, sectioned beautifully and also held a finger wave</li>
            <li>This means that you don&#x27;t get accurate renditions of catch lights in the eyes.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic cosmetology manikin.</li>
            <li>The skin tones and contours have been helpful as I work with various lighting setups and I have been generally happy with this item.  </li>
            <li>So real looking and hair is really nice.</li>
            <li>But she&#x27;s a cheap mannequin head, so you can&#x27;t expect the world.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like the picture , you can curl the hair is pretty good</li>
            <li>While not fitting perfectly on my mannequin stand, it still has been a blessing to have at school and work with since I bought it, and the price, tax, shipping, and</li>
            <li>It was longer and felt more like real hair.</li>
            <li>My school uses Pivot Point mannequin heads, and their mannequins are full sized.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t consider myself all that fast, but I was able to get through each 10 minute portion of the chemical applications on time with Debra.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend :)</li>
            <li>Like being at the first day of school again!</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 12-yr-old niece who is great with up-doos but few people who have any desire to have their hair done.</li>
            <li>overall it is nice.</li>
            <li>But overall the hair is nice.</li>
            <li>This did look wierd for a Christmas present, but my granddaughter was thrilled beyond words.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful product, came way earlier than expected and was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Although I wish the stand it was supposed to come with had the right parts</li>
            <li>I think it a right price for the right product.</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s very disturbed!  </li>
            <li>Overall satisfied with the product for the price.</li>
            <li>Hair was in the link that it was promised and it&#x27;s pretty thick.&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li>The length of hair is exactly what i need.</li>
            <li>The only con for this product is the hair falls out more than the synthetic doll heads.</li>
            <li>Received it on time and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>This mannequin is exactly what I ordered and came in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>This product was exactly as described and came on time.</li>
            <li>With the first cut to level out all the wispy ends, it will be a 7&amp;#34; doll.</li>
            <li>Every once in a while I have to do a cholesterol treatment to soften the haor from the bleaching I did, but other than that, she&#x27;s still as good as new.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and exactly like what comes in cosmetology kit</li>
            <li>The hair was more like 16&#x27; long.</li>
            <li>I need the 21&amp;#34; to practice hairstyle so I need the hair more long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for practicing cutting, braiding and some styling.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my pre-teen daughter for Christmas because she is really into doing hair.  </li>
            <li>Debra doesn&#x27;t run away, and I really like that about her.    </li>
            <li>The product quality was fantastic for the price as the beauty stores are double that!  </li>
            <li>It arrived fast.</li>
            <li>However the hair is very briytle and it begins rather qyickly too get a \\&quot;sharp\\&quot; feeling about it.</li>
            <li>it really keeps me company and breaks up the silence.</li>
            <li>I gave 1 star because the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Not as nice as some of the others I&#x27;ve used so far harder to part and hair wasn&#x27;t sewn in as well</li>
            <li>Thick &amp; good quality hair.</li>
            <li>Other then that I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>First off this was the most I&#x27;ve ever paid for a manikin head , When I received this manikin it was infested with dead Lice &amp; knits</li>
            <li>Hair is nice and a little thin at the ends but good for stateboard</li>
            <li>but for learning basic braiding not a bad deal.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t purchased this but wanted to let people know the complaints about lice is a normal thing on mannequins</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re dead but most mannequins have them.</li>
            <li>She has had it for over 6 months &amp; still does a lot of new hairstyles on it.</li>
            <li>First, drench them in blood, but leave enough of the face showing.</li>
            <li>it if very soft and thick at the top</li>
            <li>this is not really a 21\\&quot; hair length, thats a lie, its really around 12\\&quot; and 13\\&quot; inches, i really feel cheated</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised with the quality of this mannequin head.  </li>
            <li>Natural hair to wash and style.  </li>
            <li>I bought this mannequin head for my 11 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>Debra is very similar to the mannequins I received in cosmetology school, which cost twice as much.</li>
            <li>Hair is soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>The hair feels quite natural</li>
            <li>I have only used it to learn french knots, right now.  </li>
            <li>I love putting a few of these in my car on long road trips.</li>
            <li>I still cannot do a ten minute application with my Pivot Point Heads, since they are larger and have higher density</li>
            <li>Just right for curling, perms, and other state board exam tasks.</li>
            <li>We used these exact mannequins at cos school, and there was absolutely no difference in product quality between the ones the school provided and this one.</li>
            <li>Remember, practice makes perfect and manikins won&#x27;t yell at you for a bad haircut!</li>
            <li>Bought two of these as gifts for young  girls and two as gifts for a a relative preparing for her test.  </li>
            <li>This apparently is the recommend head to buy to practice on.</li>
            <li>Purchased for 12 yr old daughter who has Cosmo aspirations and since kids are still out of school for Xmas/New Year, she has &amp;#34;dolled up&amp;#34; the Debra mannequin daily, even had &amp;#34;appointments&amp;#34; set up!!!</li>
            <li>I was told its 100% human hair and when I wet it for the first time, it got all tangled and feels wiry.</li>
            <li>Good for cutting.</li>
            <li>Good for practice cutting bobs and for foiling.  </li>
            <li>Good for any hair services, such as color, highlighting, cutting, braiding, up-do.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this doll for those who wants doll with thick hair.</li>

            <li> My school uses Pivot Point mannequin heads, and their mannequins are full sized.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider myself all that fast, but I was able to get through each 10 minute portion of the chemical applications on time with Debra.</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend :)</li>
            <li> Like being at the first day of school again!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 12-yr-old niece who is great with up-doos but few people who have any desire to have their hair done.</li>
            <li> overall it is nice.</li>
            <li> But overall the hair is nice.</li>
            <li> This did look wierd for a Christmas present, but my granddaughter was thrilled beyond words.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful product, came way earlier than expected and was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Although I wish the stand it was supposed to come with had the right parts</li>
            <li> I think it a right price for the right product.</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s very disturbed!  </li>
            <li> Overall satisfied with the product for the price.</li>
            <li> Hair was in the link that it was promised and it&#x27;s pretty thick.&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> The length of hair is exactly what i need.</li>
            <li> The only con for this product is the hair falls out more than the synthetic doll heads.</li>
            <li> Received it on time and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This mannequin is exactly what I ordered and came in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as described and came on time.</li>
            <li> With the first cut to level out all the wispy ends, it will be a 7&amp;#34; doll.</li>
            <li> Every once in a while I have to do a cholesterol treatment to soften the haor from the bleaching I did, but other than that, she&#x27;s still as good as new.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and exactly like what comes in cosmetology kit</li>
            <li> The hair was more like 16&#x27; long.</li>
            <li> I need the 21&amp;#34; to practice hairstyle so I need the hair more long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for practicing cutting, braiding and some styling.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my pre-teen daughter for Christmas because she is really into doing hair.  </li>
            <li> Debra doesn&#x27;t run away, and I really like that about her.    </li>
            <li> The product quality was fantastic for the price as the beauty stores are double that!  </li>
            <li> It arrived fast.</li>
            <li> However the hair is very briytle and it begins rather qyickly too get a \\&quot;sharp\\&quot; feeling about it.</li>
            <li> it really keeps me company and breaks up the silence.</li>
            <li> I gave 1 star because the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Not as nice as some of the others I&#x27;ve used so far harder to part and hair wasn&#x27;t sewn in as well</li>
            <li> Thick &amp; good quality hair.</li>
            <li> Other then that I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> First off this was the most I&#x27;ve ever paid for a manikin head , When I received this manikin it was infested with dead Lice &amp; knits</li>
            <li> Hair is nice and a little thin at the ends but good for stateboard</li>
            <li> but for learning basic braiding not a bad deal.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t purchased this but wanted to let people know the complaints about lice is a normal thing on mannequins</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re dead but most mannequins have them.</li>
            <li> She has had it for over 6 months &amp; still does a lot of new hairstyles on it.</li>
            <li> First, drench them in blood, but leave enough of the face showing.</li>
            <li> it if very soft and thick at the top</li>
            <li> this is not really a 21\\&quot; hair length, thats a lie, its really around 12\\&quot; and 13\\&quot; inches, i really feel cheated</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised with the quality of this mannequin head.  </li>
            <li> Natural hair to wash and style.  </li>
            <li> I bought this mannequin head for my 11 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> Debra is very similar to the mannequins I received in cosmetology school, which cost twice as much.</li>
            <li> Hair is soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> The hair feels quite natural</li>
            <li> I have only used it to learn french knots, right now.  </li>
            <li> I love putting a few of these in my car on long road trips.</li>
            <li> I still cannot do a ten minute application with my Pivot Point Heads, since they are larger and have higher density</li>
            <li> Just right for curling, perms, and other state board exam tasks.</li>
            <li> We used these exact mannequins at cos school, and there was absolutely no difference in product quality between the ones the school provided and this one.</li>
            <li> Remember, practice makes perfect and manikins won&#x27;t yell at you for a bad haircut!</li>
            <li> Bought two of these as gifts for young  girls and two as gifts for a a relative preparing for her test.  </li>
            <li> This apparently is the recommend head to buy to practice on.</li>
            <li> Purchased for 12 yr old daughter who has Cosmo aspirations and since kids are still out of school for Xmas/New Year, she has &amp;#34;dolled up&amp;#34; the Debra mannequin daily, even had &amp;#34;appointments&amp;#34; set up!!!</li>
            <li> I was told its 100% human hair and when I wet it for the first time, it got all tangled and feels wiry.</li>
            <li> Good for cutting.</li>
            <li> Good for practice cutting bobs and for foiling.  </li>
            <li> Good for any hair services, such as color, highlighting, cutting, braiding, up-do.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this doll for those who wants doll with thick hair.</li>
            <li> The only negative would be that my English Setter is absolutely FREAKED OUT by it!  </li>
            <li> but it is long enough for me to do my three hair cuts--long layered, stack, and a clipper cut.</li>
            <li> and I needed a long, human hair mannequin to practice my piggyback perms and updos on for project grades at school.</li>
            <li> After school I bought 1 more for my up-do and hair cutting practice.</li>
            <li> let my license lapse for too long.</li>
            <li> long .</li>
            <li> There were about 20 strands of hair that was that long .</li>
            <li> The wasnt as long as i thought it would be, but it served my purpose.</li>
            <li> long.  </li>
            <li> My two complaints are that there are a lot of little short hairs sewed in, so for perfecting perm rolling, up-do&#x27;s, roller sets, or anything that requires smoothing it is added work like adding papers when rolling a perm.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, just a little advice to test takers, when rolling a perm, you&#x27;ll notice w/ this head, that hairs will poke out as your rolling, the solution for me was just to cut only ONE quad in the front a couple inches (preferably layered).</li>
            <li> (actually earlier than expected!!!)  </li>
            <li> After using the mannequin head for a few weeks, I can give you my initial thoughts.  </li>
            <li> Second, stick them on a pole stuck firmly in the ground.</li>
            <li> Its not super long</li>
            <li> my family members often run the other way when they see me with my camera and lights.  </li>
            <li> will purchase another vettwe quality hair where i can do other styles..</li>
            <li> Looks like the picture but has some gray hairs and some little white things that look like dead eggs.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, if you just want to practice hair shaping or the like, I will say that Debra&#x27;s hair has less density than other mannequins.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is where the maker placed their logo.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend buying this manikin head at all not worth it.</li>
            <li> they go down to 37$</li>
            <li> I thaught that the 21&amp;#34; was from the neck down not from the forehead.</li>
            <li> I would recommeded it to other cosmetology students!</li>
            <li> I had few other once</li>
            <li> There were gray hairs in the hair mix (not ideal for a young girl)</li>
            <li> the only other thing is that the hair is really thin at the bottom.</li>
            <li> I pulled them out as they were not infested hairs, but it was still a little yucky that the nits were there to begin with.</li>
            <li> but the hair is to uneven and fried to do that.</li>
            <li> After a few times it became stained by the make-up.  </li>
            <li> When I received this mannequin head there was a few lice nits attached to pieces of hair in the front section of the head.  </li>
            <li> I bought this a few years ago when I was planning on going to cosmetology school.</li>
            <li> It was thin and in so man different lengths.</li>
            <li> A minor thing but irritating none the less.</li>
            <li> My second is the ends are very thin and tapered so even after as much of a trim as I could without disqualifying her for boards, she is still very thin and wispy at the bottom.</li>
            <li> But for boards having a thin mannequin means less hassle sectioning and less to have to work with, if thats what your buying her for.</li>
            <li> Not sure what it is</li>
            <li> But supper small head</li>
            <li> I hate seeing her name right below the chin.</li>
            <li> My ony csomplaint is that the hair is a little thin on the ends.</li>
            <li> 4 stars out of 5 at least.</li>
            <li> But hair is thin and uneven</li>
            <li> /&gt;You get what you pay for, and these heads are usually very expensive for the quality hair that they offer, seeing as how this is only 40+ dollars</li>
            <li> quality of this product was pretty bad, when I recieved package it had lint all over her hair, the quality of her hair is horrible, stringy, uneven and definitely not 21 inches.</li>
            <li> I just wish they were a tad less expensive</li>
            <li> not good hairs i lost money with this mannequin</li>
            <li> Her hair is not too thick and not too thin.</li>
            <li> I hate that I could not find one the same price and hair length that had darker skin, she is quite pale!</li>
            <li> It was much less expensive than other versions I have seen, but I was disappointed in the quality.  </li>
            <li> you get tired of their personality, you can use them for lawn decorations:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The seller described this product poorly, I would not have bought this item if I knew this was what I was getting.</li>
            <li> She has even been used to sneak up behind people and caused some screams.</li>
            <li> Product review said 10-15 inch hair around the head, false.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try driving in the HOV 2+ lane though, as cops look for these and will pull you over for illegal use of the HOV lane.</li>
            <li> She also sheds hair like crazy.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not so bad that we have to return the item.  </li>
            <li> I almost hate to cut all the hair off.</li>
            <li> Man this thing be so life like it scares the crap out of me every time I walk into the room</li>
            <li> Even my instructor said this was the worst hair she had seen on a manikin head.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Like being at the first day of school again! great head to practice for retaking my state boards after 15 years let my license lapse for too long.</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised with the quality of this mannequin head.  It is better than the ones from my beauty school, and the price was very fair.  I was also very pleased with how quickly I received it!  The only negative would be that my English Setter is absolutely FREAKED OUT by it!  She thinks it&#x27;s a person without a body and she&#x27;s very disturbed!  LOL!&lt;br /&gt;I would order this again.</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick.  Hair is beautiful.  I have only used it to learn french knots, right now.  Haven&#x27;t cut or colored, yet.  Can&#x27;t wait to use it fully.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic cosmetology manikin. It&#x27;s perfect for practicing cutting, braiding and some styling. Remember, practice makes perfect and manikins won&#x27;t yell at you for a bad haircut!</li>
            <li> This item arrived in good shape and quickly.  Looks like the picture but has some gray hairs and some little white things that look like dead eggs.  Not sure what it is but it&#x27;s not so bad that we have to return the item.  Overall satisfied with the product for the price.</li>
            <li> this is not really a 21\\&quot; hair length, thats a lie, its really around 12\\&quot; and 13\\&quot; inches, i really feel cheated and i wouldnt recommend this for anything</li>
            <li> I recently purchased some studio lighting and needed a model to practice on. My family runs when they see me get a camera, so I got Debra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;skin&#x27; tone is very appropriate for photography practice and the hair used is excellent. My only complaint is where the maker placed their logo. I hate seeing her name right below the chin. A minor thing but irritating none the less.</li>
            <li> I like this one served the purpose!</li>
            <li> its not 100 % human hair , its sentetic</li>
            <li> I am a student at The Staunton School of Cosmetology. I needed a manikin to do three hair cuts at a job interview. I didn&#x27;t want to use my school ones for state board. The hair on this manikin was actually in better condition than my school ones---which cost me more. Its not super long but it is long enough for me to do my three hair cuts--long layered, stack, and a clipper cut. I almost hate to cut all the hair off. I&#x27;m very pleased since I was very nervous about ordering one offline.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my pre-teen daughter for Christmas because she is really into doing hair.  It was much less expensive than other versions I have seen, but I was disappointed in the quality.  There were gray hairs in the hair mix (not ideal for a young girl), it did not come with a clamp stand (as depicted), and the hair smells like it is burning when a curling iron is used.</li>
            <li> I was told its 100% human hair and when I wet it for the first time, it got all tangled and feels wiry. I don&#x27;t even like to use it. It is difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> My daughter needed this for her cosmetology class and has found this to be wonderful to work on ~  Seller is great ~ super fast ship!  Highly recommend :)</li>
            <li> my only 2 complaints are... it had some gray hairs in it. i would have liked it better if it hadnt. the only other thing is that the hair is really thin at the bottom. it if very soft and thick at the top but the oppisite at the bottom. overall it is nice.</li>
            <li> Like the MusicMan, I purchased this for use in working with photographic lighting setups.  Like MusicMan my family members often run the other way when they see me with my camera and lights.  Debra doesn&#x27;t run away, and I really like that about her.    After using the mannequin head for a few weeks, I can give you my initial thoughts.  The skin tones and contours have been helpful as I work with various lighting setups and I have been generally happy with this item.  HOWEVER, be advised there are painted catch lights in her eyes, and when I blackened those in to better judge my lighting, I found the plane of the eyes to be somewhat downward.  This means that you don&#x27;t get accurate renditions of catch lights in the eyes.  Now this is not marketed as a photography mannequin, but that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m not giving this a 5 star rating.     Still, considering the price and compact size, I&#x27;m still very happy to have this tool in my studio.</li>
            <li> not good hairs i lost money with this mannequin i dont know i will get money back</li>
            <li> Very nice hair. Just that it felt like it took forever to arrive. But overall the hair is nice. I gave 4 star because I had to purchase the clamp separately n the delivery time. It holds well to heat too.</li>
            <li> Have ordered this product before from this company.  They are wonderful to order from.  The product arrived in great condition and on time!  (actually earlier than expected!!!)  Will re order from them again.  The product quality was fantastic for the price as the beauty stores are double that!  Thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t find this price on the open market.  Natural hair to wash and style.  Great item. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Bought two of these as gifts for young  girls and two as gifts for a a relative preparing for her test.  So real looking and hair is really nice. This apparently is the recommend head to buy to practice on.</li>
            <li> This did look wierd for a Christmas present, but my granddaughter was thrilled beyond words.  She creates hair designs every day.  Her babysitters even like to play with it!  It was a perfect gift for her.</li>
            <li> Purchased for 12 yr old daughter who has Cosmo aspirations and since kids are still out of school for Xmas/New Year, she has &amp;#34;dolled up&amp;#34; the Debra mannequin daily, even had &amp;#34;appointments&amp;#34; set up!!! Debra holds curls, takes the heat of styling accessories and is just what we hoped for!!! Daughter likes very much; she likes it, the wife &amp; I love it !! 4 stars out of 5 at least. When daughter&#x27;s happy, the house is happy!!!</li>
            <li> Good product and service</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves it. She says &amp;#34;its the perfect Cosmo head. It does everything I need it to do. Hair is perfect length.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Not human hair but it was a gift and they recipient loved it. So I&#x27;ll give it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S HELPING ME LEARN HOW TO DO SEW INS</li>
            <li> A great manikin to take to state board, great for 90 degree cuts and state board perms, thermals and relaxers.</li>
            <li> For the price I got this item I was really really happy.  Hair was in the link that it was promised and it&#x27;s pretty thick.&lt;br /&gt;Hair was not chargeable. I am able to braided without worrying that it will fall out</li>
            <li> Not 21 inches at all !!!! But it&#x27;s good quality hair and it manages really well , they sent me off !!!</li>
            <li> Perfect for stateboard!  It arrived fast. The length of hair is exactly what i need. I decided that i would order another one for practice.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, came way earlier than expected and was exactly as advertised. I used her for State Boards without a hitch (and passed too!) We used these exact mannequins at cos school, and there was absolutely no difference in product quality between the ones the school provided and this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this mannequin head for my 11 year old daughter. She loves to practice hairstyles on her dolls. She loves the size of the head and length of hair. The only con for this product is the hair falls out more than the synthetic doll heads.</li>
            <li> omg, this is my 3rd dollhead for cosmetology courses. She&#x27;s perfect. I&#x27;ve cut her, dyed her three times, bleached her twice, and she&#x27;s still good! Every once in a while I have to do a cholesterol treatment to soften the haor from the bleaching I did, but other than that, she&#x27;s still as good as new. I&#x27;ll deff be getting another one soon. :)</li>
            <li> Just like the one I received in school for state board practice. Good for cutting. Nice buy and good quality.</li>
            <li> This mannequin is PERFECT for those looking for a mannequin suitable for state board exams. Her hair is not too thick and not too thin. Just right for curling, perms, and other state board exam tasks. I cut her hair into a 90 with no problem. And you can&#x27;t beat the price! Debra is very similar to the mannequins I received in cosmetology school, which cost twice as much. Very pleased with this mannequin.</li>
            <li> Very good quality hair. Cuts very nicely. Hair is soft to the touch. Works great for cosmetology class purposes :)</li>
            <li> Received it on time and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and delivery!</li>
            <li> quality of this product was pretty bad, when I recieved package it had lint all over her hair, the quality of her hair is horrible, stringy, uneven and definitely not 21 inches. i would recommend product to some one in beautyschool.however, i bought thios product to practice braids but the hair is to uneven and fried to do that.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly like the picture , you can curl the hair is pretty good</li>
            <li> The hair is great quality. I received the same mannequin head from my bookstore at school and the hair was stringy and I had to cut off 6&amp;#34; just to roll a perm. I only had to trim the hair.</li>
            <li> Came in perfect condition, and had the original boxing. Loved it and is the exact replicate of my class mannequins! It&#x27;s also an awesome bang for the buck because it comes with a full head of hair! LOVE!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and in good condition.  Good for practice cutting bobs and for foiling.  Purchased for graduated cut demo.  Will work just fine.</li>
            <li> Great hair to work with...</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my Grandaughter to practice on for her state board exam.  According to my Granddaughter, the thickness of the hair was just right, she was able to practice several hair cuts, sectioned beautifully and also held a finger wave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a cosmetoloy student and I needed a long, human hair mannequin to practice my piggyback perms and updos on for project grades at school. While not fitting perfectly on my mannequin stand, it still has been a blessing to have at school and work with since I bought it, and the price, tax, shipping, and all makes me feel like I made out like a bandit! I would recommeded it to other cosmetology students!</li>
            <li> Hair is nice and a little thin at the ends but good for stateboard</li>
            <li> I guess nice head for the price, learned to cornrow on it. However the hair is very briytle and it begins rather qyickly too get a \\&quot;sharp\\&quot; feeling about it. Its definatley synthetic hair, but it proved its purpose with learning to cornrow so i give three stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for, and these heads are usually very expensive for the quality hair that they offer, seeing as how this is only 40+ dollars its no surprise the hair is s***. ð&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase another vettwe quality hair where i can do other styles..but for learning basic braiding not a bad deal. I&#x27;ve only used it a handful of times and am tiered of my fingers hurting from the coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my daughter to use has a toy for dress up.  After a few times it became stained by the make-up.  I would not recommend it for this reason.</li>
            <li> This mannequin is exactly what I ordered and came in a timely manner. With a bit of a trim it is still perfect for state boards (Maine anyways). My two complaints are that there are a lot of little short hairs sewed in, so for perfecting perm rolling, up-do&#x27;s, roller sets, or anything that requires smoothing it is added work like adding papers when rolling a perm. My second is the ends are very thin and tapered so even after as much of a trim as I could without disqualifying her for boards, she is still very thin and wispy at the bottom. But for boards having a thin mannequin means less hassle sectioning and less to have to work with, if thats what your buying her for. One last note: it is 100% human hair, I have used an iron on her and she curls perfectly where synthetic hair would burn and turn white at the ends.</li>
            <li> The hair is not 100% human hair.</li>
            <li> I love putting a few of these in my car on long road trips. it really keeps me company and breaks up the silence. Don&#x27;t try driving in the HOV 2+ lane though, as cops look for these and will pull you over for illegal use of the HOV lane. I have Debra, Nicki, and Dionne in my car and we have a BLAST. I just wish they&#x27;d talk more, they are quite introverted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you get tired of their personality, you can use them for lawn decorations:&lt;br /&gt;I love lining my yard with these. First, drench them in blood, but leave enough of the face showing. Second, stick them on a pole stuck firmly in the ground. Line the heads on sticks across your front lawn to keep solicitors and nut cases away. Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted this to practice hair on.  She is 14 &amp; loves it.  It does not tangle like some of the others do.  She has had it for over 6 months &amp; still does a lot of new hairstyles on it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and exactly like what comes in cosmetology kit</li>
            <li> Used it for my boards. Great for the price.</li>
            <li> Everything was okay.  It didn&#x27;t have many nits in it like the ones you get in school.</li>
            <li> Bought one for daughter and one as a gift. Both girls loved it. Makes a great gift for a tween.</li>
            <li> The doll needs more hair she was almost bald . The length of the hair was a joke it was suppose to be 21&amp;#34; long . There were about 20 strands of hair that was that long . The hair was more like 16&#x27; long.</li>
            <li> I hate that I could not find one the same price and hair length that had darker skin, she is quite pale! I hope my daughter enjoys it, the hair seems a bit frizzy and stringy.</li>
            <li> Her hair was way better than the Tina doll.  It was longer and felt more like real hair. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This mannequin was way better than the ones provided at my school (and cheaper). And for state boards, well i passed, so yes it works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, just a little advice to test takers, when rolling a perm, you&#x27;ll notice w/ this head, that hairs will poke out as your rolling, the solution for me was just to cut only ONE quad in the front a couple inches (preferably layered). And you wont have this problem. So yes, this head will get the job done.</li>
            <li> Product review said 10-15 inch hair around the head, false. Some of the hair is only 2 inches all over. The seller described this product poorly, I would not have bought this item if I knew this was what I was getting.</li>
            <li> Good product.. Good price . they cost like 40$ plus tax so it was a pleasure getting them at a cheaper price.when they go down to 37$ I&#x27;ll buy more.(it went up to$42)</li>
            <li> Its just like the ones we get in school. I just wish they were a tad less expensive so I could get 5 instead of only 3.</li>
            <li> Bought this dollhead specifically for my Stateboard. Just needed a basic dollhead to last me for the test. The wasnt as long as i thought it would be, but it served my purpose. The hair quality is good, very soft. Its a dollhead so it works. More on the pricier range but it was needed for a specific purpose and it served it.</li>
            <li> I thaught that the 21&amp;#34; was from the neck down not from the forehead. I need the 21&amp;#34; to practice hairstyle so I need the hair more long.</li>
            <li> My Daughter needed one for class and this one was just perfect.  The hair is amazing, 100% REAL HAIR! You will like it.</li>
            <li> This doll was perfect for what I needed it for</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for state boards.</li>
            <li> Thick &amp; good quality hair. Good for any hair services, such as color, highlighting, cutting, braiding, up-do. I had one in my beauty school. Perfect doll. After school I bought 1 more for my up-do and hair cutting practice. I had few other once but this was one of the best. I would highly recommend this doll for those who wants doll with thick hair.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as described and came on time. My ony csomplaint is that the hair is a little thin on the ends. Other then that I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 12-yr-old niece who is great with up-doos but few people who have any desire to have their hair done. The hair feels quite natural (I tried it too) and my niece just loves it. It is great for practicing. Don&#x27;t forget to get a rotating clamp to keep it in place!</li>
            <li> The hair is 12&amp;#34; long.  I measured it.  With the first cut to level out all the wispy ends, it will be a 7&amp;#34; doll.</li>
            <li> Man this thing be so life like it scares the crap out of me every time I walk into the room</li>
            <li> My school uses Pivot Point mannequin heads, and their mannequins are full sized. The Debra mannequin head is much smaller. Not like it&#x27;s a miniature or anything, just about three to four inches smaller. I don&#x27;t know what your state board requirements are, but if you have to go through mock bleach, etc, this is the mannequin for you. I don&#x27;t consider myself all that fast, but I was able to get through each 10 minute portion of the chemical applications on time with Debra. I even had time to spare! I still cannot do a ten minute application with my Pivot Point Heads, since they are larger and have higher density hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if you just want to practice hair shaping or the like, I will say that Debra&#x27;s hair has less density than other mannequins. She also sheds hair like crazy. But she&#x27;s a cheap mannequin head, so you can&#x27;t expect the world. If you need a mannequin for your board examination, get her.</li>
            <li> Great doll head for practicing during comsotology school.</li>
            <li> Not as nice as some of the others I&#x27;ve used so far harder to part and hair wasn&#x27;t sewn in as well</li>
            <li> When I received this mannequin head there was a few lice nits attached to pieces of hair in the front section of the head.  I pulled them out as they were not infested hairs, but it was still a little yucky that the nits were there to begin with.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few years ago when I was planning on going to cosmetology school. Well I have not yet gone but I still love Debra. She does freak a lot of people out as she sits at the top of my closet. She has even been used to sneak up behind people and caused some screams. I will likely be selling her soon.</li>
            <li> Great hair! But supper small head</li>
            <li> i like this manekin a lot i will use it for my boards</li>
            <li> Just what she needed for her class. Good shipping.</li>
            <li> She is our good luck manikin. Although I wish the stand it was supposed to come with had the right parts but they are two different companies. Manikin shipper was awesome.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my state board!</li>
            <li> I need to buy it for my wife comos exam. I think it a right price for the right product.</li>
            <li> Thank you !! Arrived quickly !! Great mannequin to practice on, I will absolutely order more !!</li>
            <li> purchased for someone as a gift as they were considering cosmetology. still works well even though she changed here career</li>
            <li> My daughter has been able to do lots of designs. But hair is thin and uneven</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t purchased this but wanted to let people know the complaints about lice is a normal thing on mannequins so cosmetology students know what they look like. They&#x27;re dead but most mannequins have them. It&#x27;s a learning tool not a mistake.</li>
            <li> I gave 1 star because the shipping was fast. First off this was the most I&#x27;ve ever paid for a manikin head , When I received this manikin it was infested with dead Lice &amp; knits I just about had a heart attack. After hours  of standing outside trying to get this out because I had to have for school. I brought to the college today and we found even more Lice and Knits. Even my instructor said this was the worst hair she had seen on a manikin head. It was thin and in so man different lengths. I would not recommend buying this manikin head at all not worth it.</li>
