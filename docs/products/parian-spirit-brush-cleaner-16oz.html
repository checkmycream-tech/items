            <li>Best brush cleaner HANDS DOWN</li>

            <li>Overall I can honestly say I will be getting this product again.</li>
            <li>the bristles came right out</li>
            <li>Use it for deep clean and I also bring in a spray bottle for quick clean between colors</li>
            <li>Its very gentle</li>
            <li>Dries fast too!</li>
            <li>It has destroyed a full set of &amp;#34;my new RC Cosmetic &amp; some Mac brushes</li>
            <li>YOU NEED TO LET THEM DRY :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Be sure to let your brushes fully dry before use.</li>
            <li>BE SURE TO DRY COMPLETELY BEFORE USING!!!  </li>
            <li>This product really cleans all the makeup off the brushes.</li>
            <li>Absolutely.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t expect it to everything, but for the really stubborn products-this is a dream.</li>
            <li>WoW!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It cleans brushes better than any other cleanser I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>As a pro makeup artist I use and clean my brushes regularly and this does the job!</li>
            <li>I used to use antibacterial dish soap mixed with a bit of olive oil at one point and it wouldn&#x27;t get them as clean.</li>
            <li>Cleans all the gunk off my brushes and leaves them soft!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fresh scent of orange peels, that later became a little overwhelming bc its scent tends to linger in the room.</li>
            <li>I can live with it.</li>
            <li>- Smells of citrus which I love but depending on how sensitive clients are, you may want to use it a few mins before you work on a client or give the brushes a minute or two if you are cleaning between clients</li>
            <li>Its better to get it in a spray form where you just spray where the makeup is on the brush and then in circles brush it out on a paper towel or cloth  until there is no more color.</li>
            <li>If brushes were white this product will return brushes to original white shade&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then once a week you use a deep cleanser to completely clean the brushes entirely, which in this case is the Parian Spirit brush cleaner of course, and you follow the instructions.</li>
            <li>Professionally in order to take care of your makeup brushes you are supposed to have a daily cleanser for your makeup brushes to clean them daily after each use.</li>
            <li>harsh smell and too strong on makeup brush glue.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it a full star rating due to the smell.</li>
            <li>I definitely like it for my synthetic brushes I use for lip sticks and gel liners, the product comes off the brushes instantly and dries fairly quick.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- NO DRY OR SCRATCHY BRUSHES which I appreciate because some brush cleaners are full of alcohol and the dry brushes irritates your clients skin, this one leave your brushes soft</li>
            <li>I used to spray the paper towel directly then rub my brush all over it</li>
            <li>But if you use this daily it will run out fast, guaranteed.</li>
            <li>This makeup brush cleaner is supposed to be used as a deep cleanser meaning it should be used once a week as a deep cleanser to deep clean your makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>To deep clean brushes: I pour a bit into a small cup and dip the brushes in, swirl around, wipe off excess on clean dry cloth.  </li>
            <li>I gently washed my grey squirrel hair brushes to get it out but was it ever IN the brushes.</li>
            <li>No other brush cleaner</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty strong and citrus-y.&lt;br /&gt;In terms of a spot cleaner and deep cleaner, I definitely like this for spot cleaning synthetic brushes, but sadly, will still search for something else for my more delicate brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you notice some of your brushes are dry, condition them with Extra Virgin Olive Oil.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s a bit harsh on your skin so be sure to be careful when using this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used other high end brush cleaners and this one makes others a joke to even consider.</li>
            <li>After wiping, I do let brushes dry for a few hours if I&#x27;m working with powder, but for creams, liquids, and gels, I keep right on going.</li>

            <li> I have finally found a product that works and doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell.</li>

            <li> Disappointed is an understatement &amp; a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I had transfered it to some aluminum bottles and found that the product reacted badly with the container causing the paint on it to corrode and it leaked wasting my product.</li>

            <li> Cleans all the gunk off my brushes and leaves them soft!!  To deep clean brushes: I pour a bit into a small cup and dip the brushes in, swirl around, wipe off excess on clean dry cloth.  Daily use:  I keep a small amount in a small spritzer and spray on dirty brushes, then wipe on cloth.  BE SURE TO DRY COMPLETELY BEFORE USING!!!  I tried blending with a slightly damp brush (on accident) and wound up with a red eye for two days!!!  This cleaner has orange extract of some sort in it and it burned my eye lid!  I have never had this problem since.... YOU NEED TO LET THEM DRY :)</li>
            <li> The scent is a wonderful orange citrus and the cleaning and sanitizing power is great! I separated mine into some spray bottles I can use. I enjoy spraying into some sort of cap or lid, then dipping my brush into the fully concentrated liquid, then sweeping and swirling the brush on a paper towel. I used to spray the paper towel directly then rub my brush all over it but I felt like I was going through more product because I needed to respray so many times. This stuff works so well! GET IT!</li>
            <li> It make my brushes squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> This product was a NIGHTMARE! It has destroyed a full set of &amp;#34;my new RC Cosmetic &amp; some Mac brushes my daughter got me for Christmas! After cleaning my brushes in this solution as stated on the bottle, the bristles of my brushes started shedding &amp; some the entire brush became disconnected from the handle. Disappointed is an understatement &amp; a waste of money! Attaching a few pictures.</li>
            <li> I love this brush cleaner!  I use it to clean my brushes after every use.  I still have to do a deep clean every week, but this works great and smells like oranges.</li>
            <li> WoW!!! Fabulous product! I&#x27;m so Happy too find this product for my brushes! Dries fast too! Love the scent too!!!!</li>

            <li> Has an orange -citrusy smell, so if you aren&#x27;t a fan of that scent you might not like this cleanser. It cleans the brushes so good and conditions them at the same time. I put mine in a spray bottle for on the go cleansing!</li>
            <li> This is amust for all makeup artist. It cleans everything off your brushes, leaves the bristles shinny, and smelling really good. Great for in between clients.</li>

            <li> This product really cleans all the makeup off the brushes. I&#x27;ve used ithis before and love it. It is a must have in my studio.</li>
            <li> - Smells of citrus which I love but depending on how sensitive clients are, you may want to use it a few mins before you work on a client or give the brushes a minute or two if you are cleaning between clients&lt;br /&gt;- it removes everything from eye shadow and gel liners to foundation&lt;br /&gt;- brushes dry almost instantly so there is virtually no wait time if scent is not an issue for you&lt;br /&gt;- NO DRY OR SCRATCHY BRUSHES which I appreciate because some brush cleaners are full of alcohol and the dry brushes irritates your clients skin, this one leave your brushes soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please keep this product in pet bottles or plastic bottles.  I had transfered it to some aluminum bottles and found that the product reacted badly with the container causing the paint on it to corrode and it leaked wasting my product. I switched to plastic bottles and have no problem!</li>
            <li> Love this product because it makes cleaning brushes a cinch. I would prefer the cleaner to be odorless but I&#x27;d rather have a scent of orange peels I&#x27;m my home, rather than a chemically induced scent. Overall great product.</li>
            <li> I like this cleaner. It is definitely great for getting out gel liner, liquids, and sparkly eye shadows. I don&#x27;t recommend it for grey squirrel hair brushes though. With proper use and even putting the product on a wash cloth and wiping the brushes off, after 3 days the brush hairs were hard. It seemed to create a build up. I gently washed my grey squirrel hair brushes to get it out but was it ever IN the brushes. This didn&#x27;t seem to be a problem for my Canadian squirrel hair brushes. I definitely like it for my synthetic brushes I use for lip sticks and gel liners, the product comes off the brushes instantly and dries fairly quick. The smell is pretty strong and citrus-y.&lt;br /&gt;In terms of a spot cleaner and deep cleaner, I definitely like this for spot cleaning synthetic brushes, but sadly, will still search for something else for my more delicate brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Is this product worth it? Absolutely. Just don&#x27;t expect it to everything, but for the really stubborn products-this is a dream.</li>
            <li> I love this cleaner for my brushes. As a pro makeup artist I use and clean my brushes regularly and this does the job! The clients love the smell too</li>
            <li> I love this brush cleanser. It&#x27;s a must have in my opinion. It gets my brushes clean and they smell great. For a deep cleansing, pour into a cup and swirl brushes in the cup then wipe them on a paper towel. For daily cleansing, pour into a spray bottle, spritz onto brushes, and wipe them on a paper towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;-It cleans brushes better than any other cleanser I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;-It smells amazing, like citrus. Your brushes will smell so good after you&#x27;re done cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;-You get a good amount for the price. It&#x27;s $18 for 16 oz. I used to use MAC&#x27;s brush cleanser and you only get 7.9 oz. for $15. It cleans so much better than the MAC one.&lt;br /&gt;-It makes cleaning so easy. I used to use antibacterial dish soap mixed with a bit of olive oil at one point and it wouldn&#x27;t get them as clean. Then I tried the MAC cleanser and it didn&#x27;t do much more than the dish soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;-The packaging isn&#x27;t great, but it&#x27;s not terrible. I can live with it. I can see how it might leak if I take it with me. I bought travel bottles for it so that won&#x27;t be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;-It might be a bit drying to some brushes. If you notice some of your brushes are dry, condition them with Extra Virgin Olive Oil.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s a bit harsh on your skin so be sure to be careful when using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great product. It gets the job done and it does it well. It&#x27;s great for the price. I would definitely recommend it. MUST BUY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Be sure to let your brushes fully dry before use.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush cleaner out there.  You don&#x27;t have to rinse over and over to remove the make up from the brush.  You just dip in a jar of this stuff and the makeup comes off easily.  No other brush cleaner I&#x27;ve used (proactive, sephora, drug store, etc) has worked as good.  This will be my go-to brush cleaner from now on.</li>
            <li> I have finally found a product that works and doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell. Its light citrus fragrance and rapid drying time had  me applying my makeup in a flash. Overall I can honestly say I will be getting this product again.</li>
            <li> Makeup just falls off brushes. Use it for deep clean and I also bring in a spray bottle for quick clean between colors</li>
            <li> I use this to clean my brushes and it leaves them clean and smelling like delicious oranges! Its very gentle and I use it daily with the parian spirit jar. Keeps my high end brushes in great condition!</li>
            <li> I say this is the best because I&#x27;ve used dozens of brush cleaners on hundreds of brushes over the last 30 years, This is the one I will not be without. Very effective yet gentle on bristles, dries quickly, and I personally love the citrus smell. Nothing degreases a foundation brush like this does. Japonesque used to sell this same formulation but they appear to have discontinued it. I put this in a spray bottle, spray my brushes after every use, and wipe off with a microfiber washcloth. I use it just about every day and have never had any breakage or change in bristle texture. After wiping, I do let brushes dry for a few hours if I&#x27;m working with powder, but for creams, liquids, and gels, I keep right on going. Quick, easy, effective.</li>
            <li> Life saver!! Love this product, cleans everything so fast and smells like oranges!</li>
            <li> Arrived leaking, but seller replaced it no questions asked. And the product is amazing! Smells good and really cleans out the makeup from the brush.</li>
            <li> Will not use again, leaves my brushes oily which makes using for days to weeks after a pain!</li>
            <li> Cleans very well!!!! I didn&#x27;t give it a full star rating due to the smell. It&#x27;s a fresh scent of orange peels, that later became a little overwhelming bc its scent tends to linger in the room.</li>
            <li> Excellent cleaner for stubborn makeup trapped in your makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> This definitely removes all the make up that are in the brushes</li>
