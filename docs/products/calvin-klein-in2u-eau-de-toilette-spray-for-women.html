            <li>Amazing perfume, original quality.</li>
            <li>Smell is very unique.</li>
            <li>Not overly strong like so many obnoxious colognes.</li>

            <li>This perfume is my new favorite!!</li>
            <li>and she was truly surprised and happy to get it -</li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t use this one at all - says gives her a headache and is just too strong.</li>
            <li>plus it is such a good price, you can buy it for your own girlfriend at any time, not just for the birthday or Christmas.</li>
            <li>Yes it is a strong perfume so you have to spray it once or twice.</li>
            <li>Smells exactly like the one that it replaced (nice clean, fresh scent, its a nice young smell, not like teeny bopper but not like clean grandma soap either lol)</li>
            <li>it is a pretty sexy scent that is also appropriate for day wear..</li>
            <li>just what i expected, is get on time and is just beautiful and original botton line i love it</li>
            <li>It has a light fruity smell to it and does not upset my allergies at all.  </li>
            <li>I love this scent and the size is really worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of fresh not a musk.</li>
            <li>this scent is just there lightly lingering..</li>
            <li>This scent is so fresh I love it and have been a fan for years..</li>
            <li>I bought it for a great price and it came earlier</li>
            <li>Price just right, and better buy it here at amazon.</li>
            <li>They love its light, fresh, clean, sweet fragrance, and so do I!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been so excited to receive this perfume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overwhelming, it&#x27;s perfect for day or night.</li>
            <li>excelente producto, de alta calidad, original, entregado a tiempo, lo recomiendo ampliamente a todos los lectores y espero que mi opini&amp;oacute;n les sea &amp;uacute;til.</li>
            <li>For Christmas a few years ago my husband bought us this set (men&#x27;s &amp; women&#x27;s) and I was blown away, not only by his great taste, but by how much I loved the way it smelled on me!</li>
            <li>I will certainly purchase this again online when I need more.</li>
            <li>Great product as expected</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to buy this amazing scent on amazon, as CK has stopped making it.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this as a gift for my mother, it&#x27;s her absolute favorite scent, and it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>
            <li>Good perfume and especially the price and to quality met my expectations.</li>
            <li>A sweet deal.</li>
            <li>, this was a gift to my mom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its smells like sweet citrics.</li>
            <li>Not sure if any additional orders would come this way, but what a nice surprise!!</li>
            <li>Also it came super fast in the mail!!</li>
            <li>If you like perfumes like Dolce And Gabbana Light blue or Turquatic by MAC you will love this fresh scent!</li>
            <li>So much leaked from this 32 ounce bottle that I might as well have paid tor a 24 ounce!!</li>
            <li>And this is what exactly I was looking for but made for women!</li>
            <li>Great for summer or everyday.</li>
            <li>It is not floral or too sweet, and is very versatile for day or night wear!</li>
            <li>Girls if you want to get IN2U for men for your loved one, be careful cuz its not even similar to this scent, it doesnt smell nice at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to stock up, and at this price, it&#x27;s SO worth it.  </li>
            <li>This is the real deal scent, not an imitation - she is thrilled and I earn points for being a thoughtful daughter!</li>
            <li>Quick shipping and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I also love it because it isn&#x27;t aimed at a particular age group (teeny-bopper or old lady)!!  </li>
            <li>I ordered it the Saturday before Mother&#x27;s Day and had it shipped to her directly using the \\&quot;super saver\\&quot; shipping method - and she got it that Thursday BEFORE Mother&#x27;s Day!</li>
            <li>Much better price/oz here than in the physical stores.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I first smelled this perfume when I took a chance a couple of months ago and purchased a bottle from Marshalls without smelling it..</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite go to fragrances, but the fragrance from this order did not last.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it, very light and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Good nights, it seems to me that it is important to do of his knowledge my displeasure and dissent with this Cologne, since it seems to me that this product is not original, his aroma does not last in the skin</li>
            <li>Product is the real deal, and came exactly as described.&lt;br</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>she loves this thanks</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>thanks you</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I wonder how much was the amount you charged me for the products I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>Ordered this for my wife and she absolutely loves the scent.</li>
            <li>When I ordered off of here I received it within 3 days, and is the real deal.</li>
            <li>The delivery was fast and the contents were intact.</li>
            <li>recommend highly!  </li>
            <li>Please there is grateful they to give the whole attention to this comment, since one since usuaria trusts in the seriousness and Amazon&#x27;s loyalty as intermediary for the acquisition of the products that are acquired across this page, I am not consent to the colony.</li>
            <li>one of my favorite purfumes by far, especially for the summer time.  </li>
            <li>The size is just right for young boys.  </li>
            <li>She likes the other Hugo boss Red and Davidoff Cool Water more than this one.</li>
            <li>, the aroma is not the same, I cannot classify it of good way, since it seems to me that I was defrauded, since my product is not original.</li>
            <li>I got over 3 times more for less than $10.00 compared to the bottle I purchased at Marshalls.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this flavor of these smells speak to you.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to walk into a department store and get a free whiff of it, and then order it on Amazon for their extremely discounted price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on smelling fresh and citusy..then dries down to a warm cozy amber smell..</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>this is my second time to buy ckn2u, the first time I purchased the 2.5 oz.</li>
            <li>light but citrus smell with a slight floral.</li>
            <li>Mixed fragances, i really like this one CK In2u-..</li>
            <li>Now my entire house smells like this perfume because of how much had leaked out onto the box and the bubble wrap.</li>
            <li>I bought one, and was pleasantly surprised to find it came as a gift set with body lotion.  </li>
            <li>I was always looking for a bit of masculine smell...</li>
            <li>My son is 7 years old.</li>
            <li>Not too overpowering but still noticeable, I have no problem wearing this every day although I&#x27;m usually sensitive to perfumes.</li>
            <li>I like it for a spring to early summer smell.</li>

            <li> Yes it is a strong perfume so you have to spray it once or twice.</li>
            <li> Smells exactly like the one that it replaced (nice clean, fresh scent, its a nice young smell, not like teeny bopper but not like clean grandma soap either lol)</li>
            <li> it is a pretty sexy scent that is also appropriate for day wear..</li>
            <li> just what i expected, is get on time and is just beautiful and original botton line i love it</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s more of fresh not a musk.</li>
            <li> this scent is just there lightly lingering..</li>
            <li> This scent is so fresh I love it and have been a fan for years..</li>
            <li> I bought it for a great price and it came earlier</li>
            <li> Price just right, and better buy it here at amazon.</li>
            <li> They love its light, fresh, clean, sweet fragrance, and so do I!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been so excited to receive this perfume.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overwhelming, it&#x27;s perfect for day or night.</li>
            <li> excelente producto, de alta calidad, original, entregado a tiempo, lo recomiendo ampliamente a todos los lectores y espero que mi opini&amp;oacute;n les sea &amp;uacute;til.</li>
            <li> For Christmas a few years ago my husband bought us this set (men&#x27;s &amp; women&#x27;s) and I was blown away, not only by his great taste, but by how much I loved the way it smelled on me!</li>
            <li> I will certainly purchase this again online when I need more.</li>
            <li> Great product as expected</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to buy this amazing scent on amazon, as CK has stopped making it.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my mother, it&#x27;s her absolute favorite scent, and it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>
            <li> Good perfume and especially the price and to quality met my expectations.</li>
            <li> A sweet deal.</li>
            <li> , this was a gift to my mom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its smells like sweet citrics.</li>
            <li> Not sure if any additional orders would come this way, but what a nice surprise!!</li>
            <li> Also it came super fast in the mail!!</li>
            <li> If you like perfumes like Dolce And Gabbana Light blue or Turquatic by MAC you will love this fresh scent!</li>
            <li> So much leaked from this 32 ounce bottle that I might as well have paid tor a 24 ounce!!</li>
            <li> And this is what exactly I was looking for but made for women!</li>
            <li> Great for summer or everyday.</li>
            <li> It is not floral or too sweet, and is very versatile for day or night wear!</li>
            <li> Girls if you want to get IN2U for men for your loved one, be careful cuz its not even similar to this scent, it doesnt smell nice at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to stock up, and at this price, it&#x27;s SO worth it.  </li>
            <li> This is the real deal scent, not an imitation - she is thrilled and I earn points for being a thoughtful daughter!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I also love it because it isn&#x27;t aimed at a particular age group (teeny-bopper or old lady)!!  </li>
            <li> I ordered it the Saturday before Mother&#x27;s Day and had it shipped to her directly using the \\&quot;super saver\\&quot; shipping method - and she got it that Thursday BEFORE Mother&#x27;s Day!</li>
            <li> Much better price/oz here than in the physical stores.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I first smelled this perfume when I took a chance a couple of months ago and purchased a bottle from Marshalls without smelling it..</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite go to fragrances, but the fragrance from this order did not last.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I love the smell of it, very light and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Good nights, it seems to me that it is important to do of his knowledge my displeasure and dissent with this Cologne, since it seems to me that this product is not original, his aroma does not last in the skin</li>
            <li> Product is the real deal, and came exactly as described.&lt;br</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> she loves this thanks</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> thanks you</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I wonder how much was the amount you charged me for the products I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my wife and she absolutely loves the scent.</li>
            <li> When I ordered off of here I received it within 3 days, and is the real deal.</li>
            <li> The delivery was fast and the contents were intact.</li>
            <li> recommend highly!  </li>
            <li> Please there is grateful they to give the whole attention to this comment, since one since usuaria trusts in the seriousness and Amazon&#x27;s loyalty as intermediary for the acquisition of the products that are acquired across this page, I am not consent to the colony.</li>
            <li> one of my favorite purfumes by far, especially for the summer time.  </li>
            <li> The size is just right for young boys.  </li>
            <li> She likes the other Hugo boss Red and Davidoff Cool Water more than this one.</li>
            <li> , the aroma is not the same, I cannot classify it of good way, since it seems to me that I was defrauded, since my product is not original.</li>
            <li> I got over 3 times more for less than $10.00 compared to the bottle I purchased at Marshalls.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this flavor of these smells speak to you.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to walk into a department store and get a free whiff of it, and then order it on Amazon for their extremely discounted price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes on smelling fresh and citusy..then dries down to a warm cozy amber smell..</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> this is my second time to buy ckn2u, the first time I purchased the 2.5 oz.</li>
            <li> light but citrus smell with a slight floral.</li>
            <li> Mixed fragances, i really like this one CK In2u-..</li>
            <li> Now my entire house smells like this perfume because of how much had leaked out onto the box and the bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> I bought one, and was pleasantly surprised to find it came as a gift set with body lotion.  </li>
            <li> I was always looking for a bit of masculine smell...</li>
            <li> My son is 7 years old.</li>
            <li> Not too overpowering but still noticeable, I have no problem wearing this every day although I&#x27;m usually sensitive to perfumes.</li>
            <li> I like it for a spring to early summer smell.</li>
            <li> It last a long time..</li>
            <li> far less then anywhere else I used to purchase at.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> MAybe it sat to long.</li>
            <li> I had forgotten and finally gave up trying to find it, until I ordered some other items for Christmas for my granddaughter and thought I&#x27;d give it a try...</li>
            <li> Smell all day long!!</li>
            <li> I could smell it from outside the box which I thought was a little strange.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really a fan.  </li>
            <li> This is not real Calvin Klein .</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the size that I expected but that is a plus.  </li>
            <li> then i expected it to.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I definately recommend these type of perfume for other users.</li>
            <li> I got it carefully wrapped and packaged in 2 days!</li>
            <li> and I have used this colony in other opportunities and know that the smell lasts during the day</li>
            <li> I remember paying at least double when it was out through CK.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s delicate enough not to be obnoxious, but when people come into contact with me, I always get loads of compliments on the smell.</li>
            <li> This was so much less than even our outlet store we have down the road from us.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time on this.</li>
            <li> I was shocked she got it so fast!</li>
            <li> Spray a little and that&#x27;ll do the trick for hours!</li>
            <li> It arrived in just a few days!</li>
            <li> what a waste of $35!</li>
            <li> In2u has subtle vanilla/citrus/woodsy aroma that suits any occasion and season.</li>
            <li> I hate picking out perfumes...</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!!! :-(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Wow! What a great price!!! I ran out of this perfume and needed more. This was so much less than even our outlet store we have down the road from us. I LOVE this perfume and LOVE the price!</li>
            <li> Daughter&#x27;s favorite fragrance - ordered shipped and given as a gift...thanks</li>
            <li> Very nice scent, good quality.  Much better price/oz here than in the physical stores.  I will certainly purchase this again online when I need more.</li>
            <li> I had no problem with the order, delivery or products.  Thank you  :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my mother, it&#x27;s her absolute favorite scent, and it&#x27;s been discontinued. I was so happy to find this large size on Amazon and she was truly surprised and happy to get it - I ordered it the Saturday before Mother&#x27;s Day and had it shipped to her directly using the \\&quot;super saver\\&quot; shipping method - and she got it that Thursday BEFORE Mother&#x27;s Day! I was shocked she got it so fast! This is the real deal scent, not an imitation - she is thrilled and I earn points for being a thoughtful daughter! :) Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> A great gift to get any wife.  It has a light fruity smell to it and does not upset my allergies at all.  I would recommend to walk into a department store and get a free whiff of it, and then order it on Amazon for their extremely discounted price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definite Buy!!!</li>
            <li> I bought 1.7 ounce from Calvin Klein store, and it was wonderful. This one smelled heavier &amp; sweeter. There was something off about it. I will probably give it to Goodwill. Very disappointed!!! :-(</li>
            <li> So glad that I found this! I received a sample sized one, and couldn&#x27;t find the actual size anywhere! I love the smell of it, very light and long lasting. Product is the real deal, and came exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it two days before the estimated arrival date!</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for my daughter she loves this thanks</li>
            <li> Whenever I wear this, people can&#x27;t help but ask me what I&#x27;m wearing.  They love its light, fresh, clean, sweet fragrance, and so do I!&lt;br /&gt;If you are not a \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; perfume type of person, you&#x27;ll love CK In2U.</li>
            <li> I hate picking out perfumes...I can never find one I like, or one that suits me. For Christmas a few years ago my husband bought us this set (men&#x27;s &amp; women&#x27;s) and I was blown away, not only by his great taste, but by how much I loved the way it smelled on me! It is not floral or too sweet, and is very versatile for day or night wear! I also love it because it isn&#x27;t aimed at a particular age group (teeny-bopper or old lady)!!  I totally recommend this to anyone looking for a great scent! (don&#x27;t forget to try the men&#x27;s too!)</li>
            <li> Everything is AOK. Ck In2U by Calvin Klein for Women, Eau De Toilette Spray, 5 Ounce  arrived on time. I am pleased, I will reccommend this to anyone. I will do business with this company again. Thanks for your great service.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is a favorite of mine, so nice to get a large size for a good price. It arrived in just a few days! thanks.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my Wife. She likes the other Hugo boss Red and Davidoff Cool Water more than this one. She doesn&#x27;t use this one at all - says gives her a headache and is just too strong.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and I could have not made a better decision :) she was so happy with it. Also it was a great price, I tried to get this at the outlet store n to get the size I got I would have paid twice the amount I paid for this one..</li>
            <li> This was one of the fragrances that my daughter wanted for her birthday.  Great price and she was very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite parfume. I use it more than 10 years. The smell very womanly. All my boyfriends like the smell)))</li>
            <li> i love this perfume i wear it every time i go on a date and always get compliment from guys. Girls if you want to get IN2U for men for your loved one, be careful cuz its not even similar to this scent, it doesnt smell nice at all.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this scent for over 4 years now and would not go to another. I&#x27;m so glad that I can get it online as many stores don&#x27;t carry it. My boyfriend agrees. CK in 2 U for Her is a nice citrusy scent that lasts. I love it.</li>
            <li> LOVE this fragrance!!!! Quick shipping and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and the size is really worth the money. Great deal at a great price. Great item.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t to sure about this perfume. I got in it and the box is pretty and tried it on and it smells so awesome! Love it!</li>
            <li> Good perfume and especially the price and to quality met my expectations. I definately recommend these type of perfume for other users.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really a fan.  What I get from this fragrance is amber and citrus, and the two bodies of notes aren&#x27;t well mixed.  They don&#x27;t seem to work well together at all.  This fragrance seemed to be in a constant state of discord- it just didn&#x27;t gel for me.</li>
            <li> I had no problem with the order, delivery or products. Smell good really good!!!! Mixed fragances, i really like this one CK In2u-..</li>
            <li> bought the 5 ounce, you never know when it will be gone. Its a steal now and Amazon purchase too. I remember paying at least double when it was out through CK. I don&#x27;t know when CK stopped making it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such a beautiful energizing yet pretty fragrance. I get complimented on this &amp;#34;day&amp;#34; perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon Prime student I got it carefully wrapped and packaged in 2 days! love it.</li>
            <li> Excelent. I like this produc is very very very very nice  I love this fragame the calvin Klein thanks you</li>
            <li> The fragrance is light and best to use for the day. It is one of my favorites! Not sold in stores anymore, but I love that Amazon has it online!</li>
            <li> I love the CK brand, the perfume smell awesome, it&#x27;s my favorite. The size is perfect. I&#x27;ve been usig this perfume since i bought it 2 years ago.</li>
            <li> Calvin Klein, A very nice women&#x27;s perfume... beautiful day scent wear! Great for the office. Fast shipping! Great price for a 5 oz bottle. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Great product as expected</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves it every time! plus it is such a good price, you can buy it for your own girlfriend at any time, not just for the birthday or Christmas.</li>
            <li> one of my favorite purfumes by far, especially for the summer time.  this is my second time to buy ckn2u, the first time I purchased the 2.5 oz. and that definately wasn&#x27;t enough, so i went for the 5 oz.er.  LOVE LOVE LOVE it!</li>
            <li> In2u has subtle vanilla/citrus/woodsy aroma that suits any occasion and season. Highly recommend this flavor of these smells speak to you. Not overly strong like so many obnoxious colognes. Spray a little and that&#x27;ll do the trick for hours! Yum</li>
            <li> great smell, great quality.. a bit strong and can be used as a unisex scent!</li>
            <li> Hello. I wonder how much was the amount you charged me for the products I&#x27;ve purchased. Just to check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bye</li>
            <li> Amazing deal, they came with the plastic wrap and everything and smells amazing. A friend gave it.to me as a present 1 year ago and I just love to wear it at night outs, gives a sexy scent that always gets me compliments</li>
            <li> This is not real Calvin Klein . so please think before buy</li>
            <li> Scent wears off too soon, but smells nice.</li>
            <li> An excellent product and was sent as estimated good provider my expectations were covered is the first time you use the product and I like his size and texture the forum shows the reality and its fragrance is very good</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my wife and she absolutely loves the scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been so excited to receive this perfume. I&#x27;ve owned it before and love the way it smells. However, DO NOT BUY this item from Amazon. It came bubble wrapped in a box. I could smell it from outside the box which I thought was a little strange. So, when I opened the package, the perfume had leaked out EVERYWHERE! I am so irritated. So much leaked from this 32 ounce bottle that I might as well have paid tor a 24 ounce!! Don&#x27;t waste your time on this. You can find this perfume in stores and the price isn&#x27;t much different. Now my entire house smells like this perfume because of how much had leaked out onto the box and the bubble wrap. The bottle is cheaply constructed and it is leaking from the bottom AND the top!!! what a waste of $35!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to buy this amazing scent on amazon, as CK has stopped making it.  I&#x27;m trying to stock up, and at this price, it&#x27;s SO worth it.  I bought one, and was pleasantly surprised to find it came as a gift set with body lotion.  I bought a 2nd one, and it also came this way! Not sure if any additional orders would come this way, but what a nice surprise!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a product I have used for quite sometime. It&#x27;s more of fresh not a musk. A spray or two will last especially on your clothes.</li>
            <li> Meet my expectations. Great price and great product !!!. It is the big presentation of the perfume which is excellent.</li>
            <li> I first smelled this perfume when I took a chance a couple of months ago and purchased a bottle from Marshalls without smelling it..I am a big fan of all the CK scents...then I saw that Amazon had this perfume at a WAY better price I got over 3 times more for less than $10.00 compared to the bottle I purchased at Marshalls. This perfume is my new favorite!! It goes on smelling fresh and citusy..then dries down to a warm cozy amber smell..I love it..I love how my clothes smell at the end of the day when I take them off...this scent is just there lightly lingering..it is a pretty sexy scent that is also appropriate for day wear..love it..huge value!!</li>
            <li> I was SO upset when they discontinued this perfume. When I ordered off of here I received it within 3 days, and is the real deal. It smells just like I remember and always got compliments on it!</li>
            <li> wao muy rica fragancia, el empaque llego completamente en prefecto estado, sin da&amp;ntilde;os, me complazco plenamente en recomendarlo. bueno bueno</li>
            <li> Amazing perfume, original quality. Smell all day long!! The delivery was fast and the contents were intact. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the size that I expected but that is a plus.  I love this fragence and when I run out know I know where to purchase more.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because, I couldn&#x27;t find this product anywhere, so I thought I would check Amazon.com.  You had it for sale for far less then anywhere else I used to purchase at.&lt;br /&gt;I love this Spray and when I wear it I get many great compliments.  I have used this product since it came out and then, it was gone from the store I used to buy it at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for selling it</li>
            <li> The CK perfume is light and smells very nice. I have used this product before and loved it. I would recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> really good product and just what i expected, is get on time and is just beautiful and original botton line i love it</li>
            <li> I was always looking for a bit of masculine smell... And this is what exactly I was looking for but made for women! Yes it is a strong perfume so you have to spray it once or twice. It last a long time.. Smell is very unique. I love it. I would purchase this again if I ever run out of it.</li>
            <li> I have always love this fragrance so I guess I wasn&#x27;t dissapointed when I got  this one. A sweet deal.</li>
            <li> My son was so happy to receive this watch.  The size is just right for young boys.  My son is 7 years old.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this spray on a cruise ship a while ago.  I have a problem with some scents that change with my own chemistry, but this is one that I can use and it smells lovely on me.  But....I could not find it anywhere  when I was running low!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon came to the rescue!  I had forgotten and finally gave up trying to find it, until I ordered some other items for Christmas for my granddaughter and thought I&#x27;d give it a try...and there it was!  I now have a source and am so glad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon for being there and having something that I could not find anywhere else!</li>
            <li> This has been my signature scent for a while. It&#x27;s delicate enough not to be obnoxious, but when people come into contact with me, I always get loads of compliments on the smell.</li>

            <li> Love this cologne. Would wear it all the time if I could find it more easily.</li>
            <li> Good nights, it seems to me that it is important to do of his knowledge my displeasure and dissent with this Cologne, since it seems to me that this product is not original, his aroma does not last in the skin and I have used this colony in other opportunities and know that the smell lasts during the day, the aroma is not the same, I cannot classify it of good way, since it seems to me that I was defrauded, since my product is not original. Please there is grateful they to give the whole attention to this comment, since one since usuaria trusts in the seriousness and Amazon&#x27;s loyalty as intermediary for the acquisition of the products that are acquired across this page, I am not consent to the colony. Without m&amp;aacute; that refer, one dismisses Attentivly, Janeth Matute</li>
            <li> Great product, great gift.</li>
            <li> Nice scent. Elegant bottle. Price just right, and better buy it here at amazon. A good gift for the wife</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. Great scent</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the one i had bought years ago from a department store. Smells exactly like the one that it replaced (nice clean, fresh scent, its a nice young smell, not like teeny bopper but not like clean grandma soap either lol) I am 24 and have been wearing it since I got it for my 17th birthday and I get compliments on it. I like it for a spring to early summer smell. Also it came super fast in the mail!!</li>
