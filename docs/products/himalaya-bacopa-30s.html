    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>excellent price and</li>
            <li>I started taking Bacopa about a week ago, and the results have been AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li>i am very happy</li>
            <li>Well, after taking this stuff for about a week, I went from being about to study about 2-3 hours tops, to being able to study 20 HOURS in ONE DAY!!!</li>
            <li>good always very good.</li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>Great for mediation, relaxing and enhance concentration.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Only the very experienced Ayurvedic physician can tell you through his dianostic methods, pulse-reading is one, among many, which dosha or doshas are in disequilibrium.</li>
            <li>good drugs</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I kind of forgot why I bought it.</li>
            <li>best part is, it all feels completely natural!</li>
            <li>buyer beware,,, best to buy barcopa from the Himayala Herbal company who has all natural ingredients....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Often the advice of Ayurvedic physicians seems counter-intuitive: for hyperacidity I was asked to eat more spicy foods, not less.&lt;br /&gt;Yogert is consisered a healthy food for the digestive tract.</li>
            <li>Will order more.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it for anyone that is having problems focusing.</li>
            <li>the Ayurvedic system of medicine, there are three primary energies--vata, kapha, and pitta.</li>
            <li>As an example, generally speaking, Triphala, one of Ayurved&#x27;a most revered compounds and an amazing digestive tonic, may not be indicated for someone with hypertension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used some from GNC previously with great results.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>Ideally these energies are in balance but when they are not, it is the physicians task to restore the harmony between the doshas by various means such as herbals, diet, yoga, mantras, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It can also reduce&lt;br /&gt;Kapha (i.e., structure--bones, mass, tissue), and if taken in the right dose can normalize \\&quot;Vata\\&quot; (the force of propulsion--circulation, breath, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>thanks!  </li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t notice much change.</li>
            <li>its really you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li>i really have my doubts about any manufacturer in India.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: This product did absolutely nothing to me.</li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>I really noticed a difference in my focus and motivation with this product.</li>
            <li>But then I noticed I was thinking much clearer &amp; faster.</li>
            <li>Very soothing herb.</li>
            <li>This particular company packages this product very well.</li>
            <li>By realizing I would no more prescribe&lt;br/&gt;an herb for myself than I would an anti-hypertensive drug, I have seen astonishing improvements in my health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually get this from smart powders, but have gotten from vitamin shoppe, and some other popular brand on amazon</li>
            <li>I stopped for a few days and felt fine.  </li>
            <li>felt a need to suggest these things because hearing that an herb can produce certain beneficial results is only part of the truth.</li>
            <li>I first purchased this product I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, because I&#x27;d tried Nootropics, including: Piracetam, Aniracetam, and Noopept in the past, and didn&#x27;t notice much of a change in my concentration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Take it one to two times a day , seems to help clear the fog out of this 55 year old brain.</li>
            <li>ng slow but sure.</li>
            <li>It takes several hours to feel normal..</li>
            <li>No unpleasant side effects but no significant benefits either.</li>
            <li>I like the green gel capsules they absorb in your body quickly.</li>
            <li>I am consistently amazed that people self-prescribe herbals from alternative medical systems such as TCM or Ayurveda, the latter being the system most-associated with Bacopa Monneria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This came as expected, and I can&#x27;t really fault the seller, it just did nothing for my memory or concentration.</li>
            <li>Consequently, if a person presented with excess pitta or deficient Kapha, Brahmi may be counter-indicated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite often, after a consultation with an ayurvedic physician, I have been prescribed two or three herbs to be used jointly, and more times than not, if the dose on the bottle said to take two, he would say to take one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to go as far as saying this is fake, but it sure feels and looks like it.</li>
            <li>I have the menopausal &amp;#34;Fog&amp;#34; combined with getting older but after taking this product for a week I can see the difference in my mental clarity.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure for a fact that it&#x27;s the Bacopa, but I&#x27;m almost positive it is, because that&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve done differently.</li>
            <li> fault for this misuse of these botanicals rests with the mass media and well-intentioned but uninformed western-trained physicians like Dr. Oz and Andrew Weil who, hearing an herb is used for a a specific pathology, and has the science to back it up, believe that the herb is indicated for everyone with the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend getting Bacopa, I think it will go great,with any other focus aids.</li>
            <li> The prescription of a n herb depends on a patient&#x27;s individual constitution, the time of year, and other factors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Went through about 1 1/2 bottle so far; very little, if any, noticeable effect.</li>
            <li> I do know that it says to wait at least 12 weeks before the results are actually noticeable, which I will come back and rate after that time period is</li>
            <li> addition, what may also be helping is a few times this week I&#x27;ve taken 10mg Noopept of twice daily.</li>
            <li> Company won&#x27;t provide COA to verify purity and quality without unnecessary personal information (phone number, date of birth, address), ignored further emails after personal information was not given.</li>
            <li> Other words, three years after its manufactured date.</li>
            <li> I have been using them for past 10 years, not regularly of course!</li>
            <li> A few of the caps were broken so its really dusty inside and the stuff they filled it with looks odd compared to any other Bacopa I&#x27;ve bought.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s connected, but every time I take it a few hours later I feel as if I&#x27;ve just stepped off a Tilt-a-whirl ride.  </li>
            <li> I just received this a few days ago &amp; will start it at the beginning of the week &amp; will also take this for 6 or so weeks to see if there is any sign of what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unless one knows which dosha or doshas are either deficient or excessive, an herb such as Brahmi, which may be indicated for one person, may not be for another.</li>
            <li> Not sure this was Brahmi.  </li>
            <li> helps keep my mind from feeling spleepy or dull.</li>
            <li> Compared to other suppliments i&#x27;ve purchased it seems really dirty.  </li>
            <li> I had to stop before it got worse</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a person that might be considered ADD, because  my mind wanders a lot, and I tend to get bored</li>
            <li> heard questionable things about their quality/purity as well.</li>
            <li> Studying has become Effortless, and Even fun!&lt;br /&gt;I can sit and go over what would probably be considered to be Boring, or Tedious subjects, without getting tired of, and without strain.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> excellent price and it works too. helps keep my mind from feeling spleepy or dull. keeps the mind focused and alert.</li>
            <li> I started taking Bacopa about a week ago, and the results have been AMAZING!!! I&#x27;m a person that might be considered ADD, because  my mind wanders a lot, and I tend to get bored easy.&lt;br /&gt; Well, after taking this stuff for about a week, I went from being about to study about 2-3 hours tops, to being able to study 20 HOURS in ONE DAY!!! I&#x27;m not sure for a fact that it&#x27;s the Bacopa, but I&#x27;m almost positive it is, because that&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve done differently. Studying has become Effortless, and Even fun!&lt;br /&gt;I can sit and go over what would probably be considered to be Boring, or Tedious subjects, without getting tired of, and without strain.&lt;br /&gt;I never knew I had it in me to study like that.&lt;br /&gt;The best part is, it all feels completely natural! (I&#x27;ve been taking about 2 capsules a day).&lt;br /&gt;When I first purchased this product I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, because I&#x27;d tried Nootropics, including: Piracetam, Aniracetam, and Noopept in the past, and didn&#x27;t notice much of a change in my concentration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, what may also be helping is a few times this week I&#x27;ve taken 10mg Noopept of twice daily.

Company won&#x27;t provide COA to verify purity and quality without unnecessary personal information (phone number, date of birth, address), ignored further emails after personal information was not given. Seems pretty shady.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t taken this as of yet. I just received this a few days ago &amp; will start it at the beginning of the week &amp; will also take this for 6 or so weeks to see if there is any sign of what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Excellant has madesuch a difference with my hair</li>
            <li> I was expecting a longer lasting expiration date. The shipment arrived on promised time, in June 2015, but it will expire on Oct. 2016. Other words, three years after its manufactured date.</li>
            <li> Compared to other suppliments i&#x27;ve purchased it seems really dirty.  A few of the caps were broken so its really dusty inside and the stuff they filled it with looks odd compared to any other Bacopa I&#x27;ve bought.  I usually get this from smart powders, but have gotten from vitamin shoppe, and some other popular brand on amazon its really you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> I am consistently amazed that people self-prescribe herbals from alternative medical systems such as TCM or Ayurveda, the latter being the system most-associated with Bacopa Monneria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fault for this misuse of these botanicals rests with the mass media and well-intentioned but uninformed western-trained physicians like Dr. Oz and Andrew Weil who, hearing an herb is used for a a specific pathology, and has the science to back it up, believe that the herb is indicated for everyone with the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the Ayurvedic system of medicine, there are three primary energies--vata, kapha, and pitta. Ideally these energies are in balance but when they are not, it is the physicians task to restore the harmony between the doshas by various means such as herbals, diet, yoga, mantras, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless one knows which dosha or doshas are either deficient or excessive, an herb such as Brahmi, which may be indicated for one person, may not be for another. As an example, generally speaking, Triphala, one of Ayurved&#x27;a most revered compounds and an amazing digestive tonic, may not be indicated for someone with hypertension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to Brahmi, it can be used to rejuvenate \\&quot;Pitta\\&quot;--the dosha associated with heat (think metabolism). It can also reduce&lt;br /&gt;Kapha (i.e., structure--bones, mass, tissue), and if taken in the right dose can normalize \\&quot;Vata\\&quot; (the force of propulsion--circulation, breath, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only the very experienced Ayurvedic physician can tell you through his dianostic methods, pulse-reading is one, among many, which dosha or doshas are in disequilibrium.

Not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt a need to suggest these things because hearing that an herb can produce certain beneficial results is only part of the truth. Herbal medicine is not a one-size-fits-all proposition. The prescription of a n herb depends on a patient&#x27;s individual constitution, the time of year, and other factors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please keep that in mind when trying to self-medicate with boatanicals that are truly medicines.</li>
            <li> I have been using them for past 10 years, not regularly of course! It does help with the concentration and focus. Takes time to get the effect going but be patient and believe in it.</li>
            <li> I kept getting a headache every time I took it, finally gave it up. 1 star cause i really have my doubts about any manufacturer in India. They can get away with making and selling trash for centuries, there is no checks an controls in place.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about a week ago, and I don&#x27;t know if I actually feel anything yet. I do know that it says to wait at least 12 weeks before the results are actually noticeable, which I will come back and rate after that time period is up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: This product did absolutely nothing to me. I felt the same as I did before taking this. I don&#x27;t want to go as far as saying this is fake, but it sure feels and looks like it.</li>
            <li> I heard from Dr. Oz&#x27;s show that you need Brahmi Bacopa for memory problems so I bought this and it really works.</li>
            <li> Not sure this was Brahmi.  Didn&#x27;t smell like Brahmi and no effect felt.</li>
            <li> I really noticed a difference in my focus and motivation with this product. I strongly recommend it for anyone that is having problems focusing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel any different. What i did notice was my body did take the supplement so it rejected it and a rash was on my hand. I had to stop before it got worse</li>
            <li> The product worked for me. It did what it said it would do. This product was used in place of my hormone medicine. It has calming effects for me.</li>
            <li> ng slow but sure. from india. good always very good. I hope to buy. good drugs thanks!  i am very happy</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t notice much change. But then I noticed I was thinking much clearer &amp; faster. Great stuff. Will order more.</li>
            <li> No unpleasant side effects but no significant benefits either. Gave it a month&#x27;s trial (30 capsules) then gave it up</li>
            <li> This came as expected, and I can&#x27;t really fault the seller, it just did nothing for my memory or concentration.</li>
            <li> It works okay. I guess. I kind of forgot why I bought it. But I guess it works okay.That is all I have to say. I have to do a review about a memory supplemnt now.</li>
            <li> Take it one to two times a day , seems to help clear the fog out of this 55 year old brain.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  It totally works!  I have the menopausal &amp;#34;Fog&amp;#34; combined with getting older but after taking this product for a week I can see the difference in my mental clarity. I would recommend this product for any one who had memory issues.</li>
            <li> the people who ship this do not know what the ingredients are so please do not buy from them, the herb in encased in a capsule but the ingredients of the capsule the seller has no idea of.  buyer beware,,, best to buy barcopa from the Himayala Herbal company who has all natural ingredients....this brahmi is comes from India</li>
            <li> Very soothing herb. Great for mediation, relaxing and enhance concentration. This particular company packages this product very well. I like the green gel capsules they absorb in your body quickly.</li>
            <li> I just bought this herb for memory.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s connected, but every time I take it a few hours later I feel as if I&#x27;ve just stepped off a Tilt-a-whirl ride.  I get dizzy and nauseous. It takes several hours to feel normal.. I thought I was just getting vertigo, but my husband made the connection to this happening every time I took the herb.  I stopped for a few days and felt fine.  Just took it today again and the dizziness is bak.  Anyone else had this happen to them?</li>
            <li> not recommended, did not work for me</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years in place of anti&#x3D;depressants. I will never use anything else and have recommended to others</li>
    </ol>
