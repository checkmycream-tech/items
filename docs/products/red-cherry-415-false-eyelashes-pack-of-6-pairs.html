            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>A great pair of lashes to purchase if you like lashes that give you length but are subtle and natural</li>
            <li>i wear them if you like your lashes to look big and full</li>
            <li>They are full enough for me!</li>
            <li>Most of the time I don&#x27;t have to cut the end of false lash strips but after that, they fit perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>, I had to double stack them, but personally I love ridiculously long lashes.</li>
            <li>The 415s are my FAVORITE everyday lash.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love these lashes, as of lately I been obsessed with lashes.  </li>
            <li>It looks very natural and people never ask if I&#x27;m wearing falsies.</li>
            <li>This is easily fixed by doing a wing with your liner!</li>
            <li>Nice lashes but too long for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>I have to cut these a little bit to make them fit my eyes.</li>
            <li>They are natural looking</li>
            <li>I ordered a whole bunch of red cherry lashes one night and never regretted the purchase.</li>
            <li>So easy to put on, I had problems with other brands because they weren&#x27;t rounded enough (these are perfect for big round eyes like mine) and the strip itself is very thin</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very soft and I love the thin clear band.</li>
            <li>They look amazing on but yet still don&#x27;t look totally like you are wearing false eyelashes.</li>
            <li>you can barely feel you even got falsies on.</li>
            <li>Red cherry has now become my favorite brand for false lashes</li>
            <li>I have not put them on yet but just by looking at them they look natural and like single lashes.</li>
            <li>They are a little stiff and easy to damage</li>
            <li>A bit long for a more dramatic look.</li>

These lashes are very nice, but they are a bit wide! When I mean wide, I mean they literally go from the corner of the eye to the outside corner. This is easily fixed by doing a wing with your liner! I recommend these lashes!</li>

            <li> So easy to put on, I had problems with other brands because they weren&#x27;t rounded enough (these are perfect for big round eyes like mine) and the strip itself is very thin so you never feel like they&#x27;re on, perfect since I wear them everyday at work.</li>
            <li> i ordered an air compressor and got eye lashes stuff. How do you think i feel about that. Not real happy.</li>

            <li> Love the lashes! They are full enough for me! A bit long for a more dramatic look. I love the red cherry brand. I&#x27;m still using my 1st pair &amp; it&#x27;s been like 4 days.</li>
            <li> The lashes came in a good time frame. They look very nice and sexy. I have not put them on yet but just by looking at them they look natural and like single lashes.</li>
            <li> Long but moderate in thickness. Beautiful to wear out for everyday!! A great pair of lashes to purchase if you like lashes that give you length but are subtle and natural</li>
            <li> Very pretty eyelashes. I love make up and I just started wearing eyelashes. These are natural looking but pretty long which make them dramatic. However, love them. They&#x27;re very soft and I love the thin clear band. You do not need eyeliner to cover the band which is great. Would order them again, just wish they weren&#x27;t so long!</li>
            <li> love the clear band and lash length, my lashes look alluring without looking like spider legs are attached to my eyeballs. Will definitely repurchase.</li>

            <li> Product arrived on time. It was just to long, was not natural looking</li>
            <li> These are absolutely the best lashes ever!! They are dramatic, but also very natural looking at the same time. The 415s are my favorites, and I wear them every day now. I wholeheartedly recommend these :).</li>
            <li> Very good quality. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Definetly longer than expected ,but really nice lashes will give them a try .</li>
            <li> Everything is wonderful</li>
            <li> I was so pleased with the results of these eyelashes! They are amazing, they have a very lightweight feeling to them you can barely feel you even got falsies on. They last all day without getting lose or anything &amp; they bring out great volume to your lashes, since they are more natural looking I do wear it on a day to day basis. I&#x27;ll definitely repurchase &amp; would recommend this to anyone! Shipping was pretty fast as well!</li>
            <li> I ordered a whole bunch of red cherry lashes one night and never regretted the purchase. They came within the time lapse given for there arrival and they are beautiful. I&#x27;ve used the #415 and #43 lashes already and I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> The 415s are my FAVORITE everyday lash. It looks very natural and people never ask if I&#x27;m wearing falsies. I also love the brand Red Cherry (and Ardell) because of how their bands adhere so well to my lash line, and how they&#x27;re reusable for up to a month if you clean and care for them diligently :)</li>
            <li> These lashes are beautiful and slightly dramatic which I like a lot.  They are a little stiff and easy to damage but I love the look.</li>
            <li> As far as false lashes go, these are some of the best. I love that they are made of real hair. They are light and can be worn all day without giving my sensitive eyes any problems. I have to cut these a little bit to make them fit my eyes. Most of the time I don&#x27;t have to cut the end of false lash strips but after that, they fit perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Love the glamorous look!</li>
            <li> This is my second order from this seller and I absolutely love the promptness of my order! The quality of the eyelashes is great!</li>
            <li> Nice lashes but too long for everyday wear. Could also be thicker.</li>
            <li> This is just what i wanted and expected from these Red Cherry False Eyelashes i would sure get some more Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite eyelashes. Everyone always compliments me when I have them on. Definitely a must!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE THESE! Omg. Ok so red cherry has been my fav lash brand for a while. I went out on a limb and bought the 415s to take a break from my 43s and I like these just as much..or more! Fantastic. I love that they don&#x27;t flare out as much on the end as the 43s cause it&#x27;s a more natural look. Beautiful with winged liner or without.</li>
            <li> Fantastic lashes! They look pretty on almost all eye shapes and sizes and the silicone band means a good, solid adhesion every time with no lifting.</li>
