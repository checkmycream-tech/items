    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>/&gt;I would surely recommend this fragrance for those whom have a MAN, as well as those trying to catch one..!!!!</li>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>Perfect for daytime.  </li>
            <li>If you can get your hands on this perfume try it, musky and feminine, just beautiful.</li>
            <li>Always pleasant.</li>
            <li>it also smells good on her.</li>
            <li>and I think it is rather nice myself.</li>
            <li>The smell of perfume was very strong when I opened the box.</li>
            <li>able to somehow get into the most supposedly legit operations (which I had assumed Amazon was) and what you get is</li>
            <li>smell contains rose, gardenia and light petchouli.</li>
            <li>Lovely amber scent.</li>
            <li>Love this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>as I LOVE the Sexy Fragrance &amp; Confidence it gives off when I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
            <li>Love how this smells on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, doesn&#x27;t smell like</li>
            <li>Her favorite.</li>
            <li>so I love it too.  </li>
            <li>The scent is light but refreshing, not fruity but a hint of flower.</li>
            <li>not even sure I recognize the scent to b true, hmmmm...</li>
            <li>I can say is that this is the best price you will find anywhere for such a first rate product.</li>
            <li>And it arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>The petchouli smell is not the \\&quot;Hippy / Granola\\&quot; smell of petchouli from college, but a light spicy scent.</li>
            <li>This particular bottle arrived oily and the atomizer sprayer has given me many issues</li>
            <li>Needless to say the MANY compliments &amp; looks I get because I smell ABSOLUTELYYYYY Marvelous..</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and arrived well packed, no damage.</li>
            <li>Seems to sell out quickly</li>
            <li>So glad they have it and will buy more in the future.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice mature smell for someone not in the flowery perfume for teenagers or the strong musky perfumes that older ladies tend to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Soft and elegant.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I purchased this online because it is much more expensive in the store.</li>
            <li>The top was loose and it leaked all over in the envelope.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Got Prada L&#x27;Eau Ambree as a present for Christmas a few years ago and fell in love with the light scent.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite scents, becoming difficult to find.</li>
            <li>Very nice, office wear, expensive and do not irritative smell</li>
            <li>Soft scent - not overpowering.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Got it for about half of the cost I would normally pay</li>
            <li> I love this scent - but it&#x27;s crazy to try and describe or sell someone on something that is so subjective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was not full it was one third empty.</li>
            <li> Although this was ordered directly from Amazon, it turned out to be just as Fake as the one ordered from Fragrancenet.com&lt;br</li>
            <li> The valve was trapped in the bottle cover, which caused the leak of the liquid during the shipment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had in the past.  </li>
            <li> The perfume is delicate and can be smelled from around 3 feet</li>
            <li> It is a delicate scent, so do not expect it to be over powering.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a HUGH problem out there, and even AMAZON itself fell into the trap of these FAKE perfume gangs.</li>
            <li> and I hate to run around to find it so tried looking at amazon...</li>
            <li> Terrible situation,</li>

            <li> Although this was ordered directly from Amazon, it turned out to be just as Fake as the one ordered from Fragrancenet.com&lt;br /&gt;There is a HUGH problem out there, and even AMAZON itself fell into the trap of these FAKE perfume gangs. They apparently&lt;br /&gt;are able to somehow get into the most supposedly legit operations (which I had assumed Amazon was) and what you get is&lt;br /&gt;not only a stinky product, it actually burnt my skin!  Terrible situation, and I am close to deciding that one can not buy perfumes&lt;br /&gt;on the internet anymore. What a shame.</li>
            <li> The perfume is delicate and can be smelled from around 3 feet away.&lt;br /&gt;The smell contains rose, gardenia and light petchouli. The scent is light but refreshing, not fruity but a hint of flower. The petchouli smell is not the \\&quot;Hippy / Granola\\&quot; smell of petchouli from college, but a light spicy scent. It is a nice mature smell for someone not in the flowery perfume for teenagers or the strong musky perfumes that older ladies tend to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife loves it, the kids like sniffing her too... and I think it is rather nice myself. It is a delicate scent, so do not expect it to be over powering. Perfume is not meant to smell up an entire room, which some people don&#x27;t seem to understand.</li>
            <li> Used for years. Lovely amber scent. Mysterious and seductive.</li>
            <li> The top was loose and it leaked all over in the envelope. It was defective the medal part that meets the glass part is where the leak was.  It was not full it was one third empty.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance.  Soft and elegant.  Always pleasant.</li>
            <li> I gave PRADA L&#x27;Eau Ambree 5 starts, as I LOVE the Sexy Fragrance &amp; Confidence it gives off when I&#x27;m wearing it. Needless to say the MANY compliments &amp; looks I get because I smell ABSOLUTELYYYYY Marvelous..!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would surely recommend this fragrance for those whom have a MAN, as well as those trying to catch one..!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Supplier to be recommended</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents, becoming difficult to find. Shipped quickly and arrived well packed, no damage. If you can get your hands on this perfume try it, musky and feminine, just beautiful.</li>
            <li> Love how this smells on my skin.  Get lots of compliments.  Soft scent - not overpowering.  Perfect for daytime.  This is my second bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I purchased this online because it is much more expensive in the store. For awhile, I couldn&#x27;t find it in the store. The scent is the same and I had no problems with the shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, doesn&#x27;t smell like Prada L&#x27;Eau Ambree I&#x27;ve had in the past.  Will not order perfumes on line again.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it. Her favorite. Got it for about half of the cost I would normally pay so I love it too.  it also smells good on her.</li>
            <li> Got Prada L&#x27;Eau Ambree as a present for Christmas a few years ago and fell in love with the light scent.  Seems to sell out quickly and I hate to run around to find it so tried looking at amazon...So glad they have it and will buy more in the future.  Get compliments on the aroma a lot!!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice, office wear, expensive and do not irritative smell</li>
            <li> The smell of perfume was very strong when I opened the box. The valve was trapped in the bottle cover, which caused the leak of the liquid during the shipment. I have photos and I would like to be reimbursed. I had to travel back to my country one day after the arrival of the product and I did not have enough time to order another bottle before the trip. So I would get my money back. I&#x27;ve ordered 8 items on the website and I had problems only with this product. Thanks.</li>
