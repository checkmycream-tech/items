            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>This is a great mask.</li>
            <li>This does a great job of hydrating your skin, and you feel amazing after using it.</li>
            <li>However, once you get it in place it does a good job of hydrating and firming.</li>
            <li>Of course, I also use the eye serum and the night moisturizer and love all these products too!</li>
            <li>, ehich was a nightmare all of its own.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m 23, and love it.</li>
            <li>I had hoped for more.</li>
            <li>Breaks up easily while applying.</li>
            <li>The mask is not good,don&#x27;t do anything in my face skin and easy the moment of the application in my face,the mask breaks in mini pieces.</li>
            <li>it is easy to put on your face</li>
            <li>I bought this for my mom who is 60, and she loves it and swears she sees a huge difference in her skin, and I have to agree, we both see a difference in our skin.</li>
            <li>even more so glad i didn&#x27;t spend a lot of money on it because the whole box needed to be thrown away don&#x27;t buy this mask</li>
            <li>I also put it bavk in tne package and used it on my neck and and chest next dsy and worked just as good.</li>
            <li>The key to loving this product is how to use it.</li>
            <li>They say a picture is worth a thousand words.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product with more Vivo per lei products and was very satisfied with the quality and felt I should ass that considering all the negative reviews on here.</li>
            <li>I tried putting it in the freezer first</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care how much a person pays for a product; 10 or 500 dollars a piece, you should receive exactly what is advertised, period.  </li>
            <li>I only gave this product a four because the masks are easy to tear when placing on your face.</li>
            <li>Ended up throwing the whole box in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is not a mask in a jar, it is a real mask that is made out of a jelly type of product.</li>
            <li>It seems to last a few days and very happy with this entire line.  </li>
            <li>This was the same product for almost free.</li>
            <li>Highly reckmmend.  </li>
            <li>I just saw a new dr.</li>
            <li>The properties in the mask moisturize and smooth and my wrinkles look less harsh and my face is soft and smooth for days on end!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure exactly what its supposed to do, and it feels kinda gross when its on, but I do feel my skin looked smoother and more vibrantðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li>Make sure your face is clean and dry, and not warm as in just out of the shower!</li>
            <li>Save your money, buy a bottle of coconut oil, it moisturizes better than the 10,000 little chunks of this mask that you&#x27;ll end up with just trying to open the package</li>
            <li>This will leave your skin soft</li>
            <li>It makes your skin vetyy soft and looks alot whiter like sun damage is gone.  </li>
            <li>It completely fell apart.</li>
            <li>Even attempting on the other masks to be more careful didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>The first time was pretty hard</li>
            <li>I tried to put them together like a puzzle on my face, but all that did was create a giant mess for me to clean up.  </li>
            <li>It is not hard to put on, and once you do, lay flat for about 10 minutes, then you can get up and move around with out the mask sliding off your face.  </li>
            <li>That replaced my regular doctor and he thought I was 40 years old and</li>

            <li> Very bad product, this does not seem to be an original product because the material is not a solid gel, it is a liquid with golden parts can not be applied well in the face.</li>

            <li> The anti aging mask is a joke, it would not come off the paper in one peel, came off in big junks and made a mess.</li>

            <li> No matter who ships the product I haven&#x27;t received the quality I expected.  </li>
            <li> Big mess!</li>

            <li> I use a mirror as i lay down</li>
            <li> I just put on, laid down, and did what the box said &amp;#34;relax&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and it just makes a mess.</li>
            <li> I could tell this mask would be moisturizing, but when I tried to get it out of the package, it tore into a million little pieces.  </li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!&lt;br</li>
            <li> As someone suggested putting this in the freezer to firm it up before applying would prevent it from falling apart, ummmm</li>
            <li> laws very disappointed because I love the other products from Vivo Per Lei!</li>
            <li> Just trying to get it out of the package is a mess!</li>

            <li> This mask is a waste of time and money!! It is gooey, slippery and falls apart. Mine fell into a million pieces before I could even get it out of the wrapping. Smells bad and burned my face when I eventually pieced it on. Even attempting on the other masks to be more careful didn&#x27;t help. The best thing about the order was the box it came in! Don&#x27;t waste your time!!</li>
            <li> I only gave this product a four because the masks are easy to tear when placing on your face. However, once you get it in place it does a good job of hydrating and firming. I would buy again.</li>

            <li> It broke in small pieces when I tried to take it out of the package.  Big mess! Don&#x27;t know how it works.</li>
            <li> This mask Sucks!!  Don&#x27;t buy...waste of hard earned money, it breaks into pieces and slides off your face.  Hated it.</li>
            <li> I was not happy at all with this mask! Just trying to get it out of the package is a mess! Ended up throwing the whole box in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;I laws very disappointed because I love the other products from Vivo Per Lei!</li>
            <li> The mask is not good,don&#x27;t do anything in my face skin and easy the moment of the application in my face,the mask breaks in mini pieces. Not recommended at all.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t go on like a mask, pieces fall off all over and it just makes a mess. wouldn&#x27;t reccomend this</li>
            <li> I am one who never complains but I have never been so disappointed with any item as much as this product. I ended up throwing it out because it tured into a million pieces just trying to open the package.</li>
            <li> This is not a mask in a jar, it is a real mask that is made out of a jelly type of product. Came apart as I tried to lift it to put on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Pieced it together but the liquid dripped down my neck, anything but relaxing. Ended up throwing the rest away.</li>
            <li> This will leave your skin soft it is easy to put on your face a must have for girls night</li>
            <li> Great price. Speedy delivery. A+.</li>
            <li> Bleh!  I could tell this mask would be moisturizing, but when I tried to get it out of the package, it tore into a million little pieces.  I tried to put them together like a puzzle on my face, but all that did was create a giant mess for me to clean up.  I&#x27;ll pass on this for next time.</li>
            <li> All the masks they were broke to the peaces when I received so I never got the chance to try it... :(</li>
            <li> This is a great mask. It is slippery, so you have to be careful. You should open the entire seal on the mask before you try to get it out. If you do that it does not rip. It is slippery yes, but that is what will soak into your skin. It is not hard to put on, and once you do, lay flat for about 10 minutes, then you can get up and move around with out the mask sliding off your face.  This does a great job of hydrating your skin, and you feel amazing after using it. I use it and i&#x27;m 23, and love it. I bought this for my mom who is 60, and she loves it and swears she sees a huge difference in her skin, and I have to agree, we both see a difference in our skin. I will continue to use this, along with the rest of the Vivo products.</li>
            <li> The anti aging mask is a joke, it would not come off the paper in one peel, came off in big junks and made a mess. Would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> arrived shattered in tens of pieces....unusable</li>
            <li> I love these mask, they can be difficult to get on without tearing. The first time was pretty hard but i read reviews and tried to be cateful. I use a mirror as i lay down i rearrange where i wsnt it. I also put it bavk in tne package and used it on my neck and and chest next dsy and worked just as good. It makes your skin vetyy soft and looks alot whiter like sun damage is gone.  It seems to last a few days and very happy with this entire line.  I just saw a new dr. That replaced my regular doctor and he thought I was 40 years old and my husband&#x27;s daughter. I am 58 and my husband is 64.  Highly reckmmend.  I had just purchased this product in the mall for $150.00 for my daughter&#x27;s birthday. We had purchased it a couple of times before. This was the same product for almost free.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  I had hoped for more. It completely fell apart.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!&lt;br /&gt;It just falls apart when removed from the package. I put together &#x27;in-home spa&#x27; gift baskets for Christmas for my friends and family...I was very embarrassed and disappointed.</li>
            <li> Poor product! The mask, not one of them, stayed together while I tried (every way possible) to apply each one!  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s the &amp;#34;deal&amp;#34; with this line.  No matter who ships the product I haven&#x27;t received the quality I expected.  I don&#x27;t care how much a person pays for a product; 10 or 500 dollars a piece, you should receive exactly what is advertised, period.  With this product I have had nothing but problems.  Will not order it again.</li>
            <li> not happy. My mask was black and broken up . can not apply it at all.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give this,a,zero if I could. As someone suggested putting this in the freezer to firm it up before applying would prevent it from falling apart, ummmm no it didn&#x27;t it still fell apart and froze the hell out of my face on the process. The mask sucks. What is the point in making a mask  that no one can actually take out of the package and put on their face? This is worthless crap. Save your money, buy a bottle of coconut oil, it moisturizes better than the 10,000 little chunks of this mask that you&#x27;ll end up with just trying to open the package, ehich was a nightmare all of its own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this zero stars..u can&#x27;t even pick this up to put on ur face without it falling apart...so u manage to put pieces of it on ur face and then it slides off...horrible</li>
            <li> Feels awesome afterward. I&#x27;m not sure exactly what its supposed to do, and it feels kinda gross when its on, but I do feel my skin looked smoother and more vibrantðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> Wife ordered/ wife reviewing: I ordered this product with more Vivo per lei products and was very satisfied with the quality and felt I should ass that considering all the negative reviews on here. Product was all in one piece and although slippery (duh) it didn&#x27;t break into a million pieces and was very relaxing and hydrating. My skin feel nourished and I can&#x27;t wait to wear again. It wasn&#x27;t difficult to apply I just put on, laid down, and did what the box said &amp;#34;relax&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The key to loving this product is how to use it. Place flattened mask in freezer before you want to use it. Make sure your face is clean and dry, and not warm as in just out of the shower! When mask is almost frozen and you can bend it just a little, peel off just one side of the plastic and place the open sided mask on a tilted upward face. I leave the plastic ON the other side of the mask for reuse later. The properties in the mask moisturize and smooth and my wrinkles look less harsh and my face is soft and smooth for days on end! Of course, I also use the eye serum and the night moisturizer and love all these products too!</li>
            <li> I tried putting it in the freezer first and it is still broke into pieces. They say a picture is worth a thousand words.</li>
            <li> It falls apart before you even get to put it on your face.</li>
