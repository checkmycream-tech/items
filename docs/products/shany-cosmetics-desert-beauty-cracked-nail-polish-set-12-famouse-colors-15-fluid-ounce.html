            <li>I gave it one star because the product is purposely misleading people into thinking that they&#x27;re buying 5x more than the actuality-</li>
            <li>wanted to help out :)</li>
            <li>gets the job done in a stylish way.</li>
            <li>The colors mostly looked muted and muddy.</li>

            <li>Once opened they looked OK and worth a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really dissapointed, was a gift to my girl friend since she liked the colors in pack</li>
            <li>But overall it&#x27;s nice to have if looking for a wide-range of colors!</li>
            <li>Paint each nail a diffrent color for summer, SUPER FUN!</li>
            <li>I love the variety of colors because most companies only have 2 or 3 shades!</li>
            <li>This set is pretty affordable and allows for a ton of color combinations!</li>
            <li>This set come with 12 colors, some bright and some dark.</li>
            <li>is very light and would require atleast 2-3 coats before actually covering the nail with color.</li>
            <li>I love all the different shades of crackle you can get in this set.</li>
            <li>Thanks Shany!</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>For those of you who want to do the math before buying :) &#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;first off, WARNING: THE BOTTLES ARE NOT 15 FLUID OUNCES</li>
            <li>so finding a bigger bottle is better.  </li>
            <li>The price is fair, but if you get 2 or 3 dried up bottles in every box.</li>
            <li>these crackles are actually at a really good price, they come out to around $2 each which is not bad considering that at the drugstore one crackle alone would be at least $5.</li>
            <li>The bottles are small and the colors are not has bright has they appeir in the picture</li>
            <li>The price is so cheap compared to some of the other companies with the same kind of crackle polish.</li>
            <li>Most of them were DRY!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find crackle polish in bright colors without spending alot of money.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put too much nail polish on the brush because the cracked look won&#x27;t come out correctly.</li>
            <li>REALLY DISAPOINTED</li>
            <li>Much nicer than I had anticipated.  </li>
            <li>COMPLETE RIP OFF!</li>
            <li>(seasoned nail polish consumers know the standard is 0.5 fl.</li>
            <li>I love the crackled look but hate the price of most!</li>
            <li>you can not return it, a huge waste of money, do yourself a favor and do not purchase this.</li>
            <li>Definitely WREAKED a toxic odor so much so that I questioned even gift wrapping it.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to worry about tracking down all the colors because they are all right</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve kept in mind that it is a decent price for a crackle if you&#x27;re not near any dollar stores</li>
            <li>they do not work very well, and the polish dries up in the bottle even with lid tightly closed.  </li>
            <li>Ordered several of these for swag bags and in every set 2 to 3 bottles were dried up and the colors are no where near as vibrant as pictured.  </li>

            <li> All in all this was thrown away and not a great experience.</li>
            <li> it is really bad quality.</li>
            <li> POOR QUALITY!!!</li>
            <li> You just would need to buy a base color to use the crackle</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I would not have bought this if I had known how terrible it is.</li>
            <li> compared to the reality of 3.24oz is a vicious lie.</li>

            <li> This is the worse thing I have ever received from Amazon... These people know just what they are selling and I am contacting the Better Business Bureau ....

Number 3 3 bottles were dried up... Please note video where I will show you the \\&quot;Crackle effect\\&quot; and dried polish!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my teen age daughter for Christmas. Five colors are completely dried up. Two are very thick and can&#x27;t be used. This is not a \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; purchase. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Received item in seal-wrapped plastic inside beat-up cardboard box. Definitely WREAKED a toxic odor so much so that I questioned even gift wrapping it. Small bottles, one of which was broken or defective. One color was completely dried up even before opening/using. For the price I wasn&#x27;t expecting OPI Shatter quality, but disappointed results for teen daughters to goof around with.</li>

            <li> &#x3D;&#x3D;For those of you who want to do the math before buying :) &#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;first off, WARNING: THE BOTTLES ARE NOT 15 FLUID OUNCES AS STATED!&lt;br /&gt;-proof in the pictures, zoomed into one u can read \\&quot;0.27 fl oz\\&quot; off the blue&lt;br /&gt;-12 bottles x 0.27 fl oz is only 3.24 fl oz. (seasoned nail polish consumers know the standard is 0.5 fl. oz.)&lt;br /&gt;25dollars divided between 3.24 oz is &#x3D; $7.72/ fl. oz.&lt;br /&gt;divide that by 2 because the standard bottle is 0.5 fl. oz. and you find out&lt;br /&gt;you&#x27;re paying $3.86 per 0.5 fl. oz!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just trying to help people see its actual size because all my other searches over the internet claim it&#x27;s 15 fl. oz... 15oz compared to the reality of 3.24oz is a vicious lie. I gave it one star because the product is purposely misleading people into thinking that they&#x27;re buying 5x more than the actuality- and it&#x27;s such a shame that this wasn&#x27;t corrected here or anywhere else. I&#x27;ve kept in mind that it is a decent price for a crackle if you&#x27;re not near any dollar stores (1-star up for that)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;imo, smaller bottles are never worth it because there is always going to be some leftover in a bottle that can&#x27;t be used/ just sits there to dry up... so finding a bigger bottle is better.  *Smaller the bottle, faster the chucking (1-star down for that).&lt;br /&gt;again, the size named is a lie- these are practically minisized!&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted to help out :) please share warning, somebody has to rename the product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife who seen the collection of colors and really liked it.  When we recieved the shipment from Amazon she tried using it, it did not work at all, the product was horrible and to top it off you can not return it, a huge waste of money, do yourself a favor and do not purchase this.</li>
            <li> Received this intact and boxed however, the chemical smell radiating from the sealed box was horrendous! Once opened they looked OK and worth a try. They ended up being completely dried and useless. Not returnable. All in all this was thrown away and not a great experience.</li>
            <li> gets the job done in a stylish way. how ever two of mine arrived dried out. cant beat the deal though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really dissapointed, was a gift to my girl friend since she liked the colors in pack but she was dissapointed after applying.&lt;br /&gt;This is very light and would require atleast 2-3 coats before actually covering the nail with color.</li>
            <li> POOR QUALITY!!! Most of them were DRY! I tried to send a message to the company, they replied once but never replied after that. I wasted my money on this one! I am so disappointed!</li>
            <li> Bad product, some nail polish were dry, could not use them.</li>
            <li> The reason why I purchased these was because I like to perform my own product reviews from time to time. The price is fair, but if you get 2 or 3 dried up bottles in every box. You&#x27;re wasting money. DO NOT buy. Also they are 0.27 Fl Oz.</li>
            <li> Ordered several of these for swag bags and in every set 2 to 3 bottles were dried up and the colors are no where near as vibrant as pictured.  The colors mostly looked muted and muddy.</li>
            <li> Much nicer than I had anticipated.  The nail polish was packaged in a nice box (inside of a protective shipping box) and was shipped promptly.  The colors are great and very bright -which was perfect for the teenager it was given to as a gift.  She had her nails painted within 15 minutes in blue, - and they looked just like the photo said they should look.</li>
