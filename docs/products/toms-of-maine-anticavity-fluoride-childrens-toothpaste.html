            <li>our favorite toothpaste!</li>
            <li>I purchased &amp;#34;Strawberry&amp;#34; flavor toothpaste after buying and loving Tom&#x27;s of Maine &amp;#34;Orange mango&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>nice toothpaste, my child like it</li>
            <li>I have to say that I liked Orange Mango more in both respects of flavor and foaming.</li>
            <li>once I started brushing with it, I probably would have liked it better.</li>
            <li>Okay, so it&#x27;s kind of healthy looking,</li>
            <li>Son does great with this (10mos)- His first toothpaste experience</li>
            <li>which I guess could be an issue with kids (I know I would have probably not been convinced as a kid :)).</li>
            <li>my kids love the flavor.</li>
            <li>Strawberry is his favorite.  </li>
            <li>My kids love this toothpaste</li>
            <li>could have more of a strawberry flavor like you find in chapstick.</li>
            <li>My kiddos love the flavor, and I love the lack of fluoride.</li>
            <li>Also, interestingly I had to brush his teeth at Grandmas and all she had was kids crest--he also spit that out.</li>
            <li>The baby love it,believe in the tom&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very excited.</li>
            <li>great tasting for mom and 2 year old.....</li>
            <li>I have to say that I&#x27;m not really that impressed.</li>
            <li>After purchasing this I excitedly told my sister (also into more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products).</li>
            <li>Tastes fine, no sugar in their recipe.</li>
            <li>Super excited about that :)</li>
            <li>Now that I need gluten free</li>
            <li>my children love this toothpaste and i love that it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li>My kid loves this flavor since he is young and thinks that the peppermint kind is too spicy for him.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li>course, my daughter misses her barbie bubble gum sweet sweet candy toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Great option for a natural, fluoride-containing toothpaste for once kids turn 2yrs old.</li>
            <li>My new favorite.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a win since he was refusing to brush with the previous Colgate kids toothpaste we tried.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it&#x27;s still a little stinky after a brush, but it&#x27;s better than no brushing for sure!  </li>
            <li>Love that its all natural but still has fluoride!</li>
            <li>I was excited when I read all the positive reviews on this product.</li>
            <li>I love that it is natural and have been using this for years.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste but it has made me overly sensitive to gagging while I brush my teeth.</li>
            <li>After much research I determined that it was among the safest, most natural one to use for your kids.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves it very much.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve introduced this to my son at 2 years of age, and he&#x27;s all excited about his his new strawberry toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Overall its an OK toothpaste, but I very much doubt I will repurchase it.</li>
            <li>My toddler loves the taste of this and makes brushing so much easier!</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was my toothbrush</li>
            <li>The kids use it willingly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of strange at first, not very foamy, but I like it, and I love the flavor.</li>
            <li>Everything else about brushing his teeth, yes, and the flavor of most any other food that is not chicken nuggets or chocolate, yes, but he does not complain about the flavor of this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that his mouth doesn&#x27;t smell real fresh after brushing.  </li>
            <li>My four year old loves the flavor and he is super picky</li>
            <li>Unfortunately my kids didn&#x27;t like the taste of this toothpaste at all, and I have to agree with them, it doesn&#x27;t taste very good.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really sud up that much or feel like it was really cleaning my teeth either.</li>
            <li>but if I can&#x27;t get them to put the brush in their mouth, it doesn&#x27;t really help their teeth much.  </li>
            <li>Very tasty tooth paste.</li>
            <li>The kids really don&#x27;t like the taste of this tooth paste.</li>
            <li>My daughter is very picky about her toothpaste (you&#x27;ve no idea</li>
            <li>It liquified rather fast.</li>
            <li>If it didn&#x27;t liquify as fast as it did</li>
            <li>So I was very excited when I tried this toothpaste, with its no artificial colors or flavors, and found that with its mild-but-tasty and little foam, I didn&#x27;t gag!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was the super minty flavor, or the extra foaming action, but I gagged every.</li>
            <li>My teeth do feel clean, but not nearly as much as when I use colgate/crest toothpastes.</li>
            <li>daughter loves this, i like that its is all natural and you cant beat the price!</li>
            <li>I expected that this flavor will be as true to its name in taste as Orange mango was to its.</li>
            <li>my kids use this exclusively and when my 5 yr old went in for his first dentist appt last week - he had no cavities!</li>
            <li>She complains that she wants the old toothpaste back.</li>
            <li>I like this toothpaste because my three year old likes the taste.  </li>
            <li>Well, maybe it&#x27;s not for the 3 year old to be.</li>
            <li>She did not like it when she was 2 - 3 years old.  </li>
            <li>So here&#x27;s to hoping I&#x27;ve been early enough in introducing him to not-so-stylish-but-more-healthy hygiene products, so that this will be his new normal.</li>
            <li>Be sure to buy a small tube and let your kids try it before you commit to a three pack!</li>
            <li>Our little one loves this toothpaste and is excited to brush with it twice a day</li>
            <li>I have always felt lucky that my son seemed to prefer the taste of this toothpaste to the commercial brands with all those chemical dyes and other things.  </li>
            <li>, we have new big girl toothpaste now&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>My four year old uses this daily.</li>
            <li>However, this being the first toothpaste my little guy has used, I decided to try it anyway.</li>
            <li>At first he would spit it out and make a terrible face, but now he&#x27;s doing great.</li>

            <li> , we have new big girl toothpaste now&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My four year old uses this daily.</li>
            <li> However, this being the first toothpaste my little guy has used, I decided to try it anyway.</li>
            <li> At first he would spit it out and make a terrible face, but now he&#x27;s doing great.</li>
            <li> I try to avoid artificial colors and love that this product fits the bill.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste has a strange flavor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read plenty about it, and the danger with fluoride is when it is ingested over long periods of time, like how the government puts it into city water.</li>
            <li> The flavor is like strawberry bubblegum, kinda strange...</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve tried several different kinds, but I finally switched toothpastes and I have no more issues.   </li>
            <li> single.</li>
            <li> The child is very not love to use, said the smell strange, no strawberry flavor, but a little spicy.</li>
            <li> Ever since my pregnancy test came back positive, I&#x27;ve found it impossible to use my regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It is not sticky or gel like other kids toothpaste.</li>
            <li> but I will buy other toms products, and I will gave my remaining tubes to my sister...</li>
            <li> I was having sensitivity problems with my usual toothpaste, and just decided to try something different.  </li>
            <li> So though I find the taste pretty terrible, I will give it 4 stars because my 18 month old doesn&#x27;t seem to mind.</li>
            <li> This worked for me, no more sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s got natural ingredients without all the artificial colors and chemicals.</li>
            <li> With all the controversy around having carrageenan added to certain foods, I was disappointed to find that this toothpaste which I&#x27;ve been buying for my daughter for quite some time, has this additive.  </li>
            <li> I have to first say that I absolutely hate mint toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend (especially for people who hate mint!)</li>
            <li> I actually enjoyed the bubblegum flavor of one of the major brands, but was shocked to find out that it has an insane amount of food coloring.</li>
            <li> It is hard to get him to brush his teeth.</li>
            <li> That makes it a winner in my book : 0 ) Docking one star for the price....so expensive,</li>
            <li> She said she had tried this and that neither of her boys would use it due to the terrible taste.</li>
            <li> We made the switch cold</li>
            <li> When it arrived I tested it out did find it to be quite unpleasant.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;d make these awful faces and shudder like I was putting something so gross and disgusting into his mouth.</li>
            <li> After brushing my son&#x27;s mouth is smelly and unpleasant, not as orange mango!  </li>
            <li> My children hated the chalky taste.</li>
            <li> but I just did and this has a horrible taste now.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Son does great with this (10mos)- His first toothpaste experience and he loves brushing his teeth!</li>
            <li> With all the controversy around having carrageenan added to certain foods, I was disappointed to find that this toothpaste which I&#x27;ve been buying for my daughter for quite some time, has this additive.  I won&#x27;t be buying it anymore.</li>
            <li> Great option for a natural, fluoride-containing toothpaste for once kids turn 2yrs old.</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste because my three year old likes the taste.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that his mouth doesn&#x27;t smell real fresh after brushing.  Sometimes it&#x27;s still a little stinky after a brush, but it&#x27;s better than no brushing for sure!  So all in all it&#x27;s a win since he was refusing to brush with the previous Colgate kids toothpaste we tried.</li>
            <li> The only toothpaste I buy for my kiddos</li>
            <li> I purchased &amp;#34;Strawberry&amp;#34; flavor toothpaste after buying and loving Tom&#x27;s of Maine &amp;#34;Orange mango&amp;#34;. I expected that this flavor will be as true to its name in taste as Orange mango was to its. However, this is not so. This toothpaste has a strange flavor. After brushing my son&#x27;s mouth is smelly and unpleasant, not as orange mango!  I have to say that I liked Orange Mango more in both respects of flavor and foaming. I will not use the three tubes of Strawberry I bought and I will not be buying this flavor again.</li>
            <li> I have always felt lucky that my son seemed to prefer the taste of this toothpaste to the commercial brands with all those chemical dyes and other things.  Now that I need gluten free I was so happy to check the website and find that all their products are gluten free!  I don&#x27;t see a seal certifying that status, just going by what they state on their website.</li>
            <li> Okay, so it&#x27;s kind of healthy looking, which I guess could be an issue with kids (I know I would have probably not been convinced as a kid :)). But I&#x27;ve introduced this to my son at 2 years of age, and he&#x27;s all excited about his his new strawberry toothpaste. So here&#x27;s to hoping I&#x27;ve been early enough in introducing him to not-so-stylish-but-more-healthy hygiene products, so that this will be his new normal.</li>
            <li> Love that its all natural but still has fluoride! My kid loves the strawberry flavor!</li>
            <li> The child is very not love to use, said the smell strange, no strawberry flavor, but a little spicy. Well, maybe it&#x27;s not for the 3 year old to be.</li>
            <li> Great product for kids been using for years</li>
            <li> A lot of foams just like aldult toothpaste, but &amp;#34;not spicy&amp;#34; - my kid loves it.</li>
            <li> my kids love the flavor. they don&#x27;t care for anything minty so this stuff is great. but pricey.</li>
            <li> My son, who has Asperger&#x27;s, will only brush his teeth with Tom&#x27;s toothpaste...and only the fruit flavor.  Strawberry is his favorite.  He&#x27;s been using it for over 14 years now and hasn&#x27;t had one cavity.  Highly recommend (especially for people who hate mint!)</li>
            <li> My kid loves this flavor since he is young and thinks that the peppermint kind is too spicy for him. I love that it is natural and have been using this for years. It is not sticky or gel like other kids toothpaste. Great price!</li>
            <li> nice toothpaste, my child like it</li>
            <li> very good, nicee smell, my girl likes it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried this toothpaste, but my son doesn&#x27;t complain about the taste. Everything else about brushing his teeth, yes, and the flavor of most any other food that is not chicken nuggets or chocolate, yes, but he does not complain about the flavor of this toothpaste. I like that it has fluoride.</li>
            <li> My toddler loves the taste of this and makes brushing so much easier!</li>
            <li> My kids will actually use this  toothpaste! Tastes fine, no sugar in their recipe.</li>
            <li> Good product...our toddler loves the taste and loves to have her teeth brushed!</li>
            <li> START TO USE IT AND IT TASTES VERY GOOD!</li>
            <li> Update: I love this toothpaste but it has made me overly sensitive to gagging while I brush my teeth. At first I thought it was my toothbrush so I&#x27;ve tried several different kinds, but I finally switched toothpastes and I have no more issues.   I won&#x27;t use it again but I will buy other toms products, and I will gave my remaining tubes to my sister...she loves it.  It&#x27;s kind of strange at first, not very foamy, but I like it, and I love the flavor.</li>
            <li> The kids did not like any toothpaste we tried... until Tom&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my kids didn&#x27;t like the taste of this toothpaste at all, and I have to agree with them, it doesn&#x27;t taste very good.  It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s all natural but if I can&#x27;t get them to put the brush in their mouth, it doesn&#x27;t really help their teeth much.  Be sure to buy a small tube and let your kids try it before you commit to a three pack!</li>
            <li> My new favorite.  I was having sensitivity problems with my usual toothpaste, and just decided to try something different.  This worked for me, no more sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Does a good job. Flavor is not overpowering like the minty toothpaste.</li>
            <li> my children love this toothpaste and i love that it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li> daughter loves this, i like that its is all natural and you cant beat the price! i will continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> My children loves this toothpaste now.  She did not like it when she was 2 - 3 years old.  I guess her tastebuds changed.</li>
            <li> Very tasty tooth paste. After much research I determined that it was among the safest, most natural one to use for your kids.</li>
            <li> My son fought me on brushing his teeth when he was younger, even though I&#x27;d buy him the Spongebob toothpaste, Transformer one, or cherry flavor or bubblegum ones...He&#x27;d make these awful faces and shudder like I was putting something so gross and disgusting into his mouth. One day he said he wanted the toothpaste that his teacher at his preschool gives him and when I got to see her at school, I asked her which toothpaste they were using, it was this Tom&#x27;s strawberry one. Now he loves brushing his teeth! I like that it&#x27;s got natural ingredients without all the artificial colors and chemicals. Love it!</li>
            <li> Ever since my pregnancy test came back positive, I&#x27;ve found it impossible to use my regular toothpaste. I don&#x27;t know if it was the super minty flavor, or the extra foaming action, but I gagged every. single. time. So, my husband suggested I try a children&#x27;s toothpaste. I actually enjoyed the bubblegum flavor of one of the major brands, but was shocked to find out that it has an insane amount of food coloring. (In a toothpaste? Why?) So I was very excited when I tried this toothpaste, with its no artificial colors or flavors, and found that with its mild-but-tasty and little foam, I didn&#x27;t gag!  I think I&#x27;ll continue using this even after my nine months are up.</li>
            <li> The kids really don&#x27;t like the taste of this tooth paste.</li>
            <li> My kids love this toothpaste</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this in a couple of years but I just did and this has a horrible taste now.  Plus with SLS and Carrageenan in it, why would you even want this?  Goodbye Tom&#x27;s of Maine.</li>
            <li> My daughter is very picky about her toothpaste (you&#x27;ve no idea the battles we&#x27;ve had over toothpaste). She loves this product. That&#x27;s all I need to keep buying it!</li>
            <li> I like this product for my daughter.  It&#x27;s organic, low in sugar, and doesn&#x27;t have a lot of the yuckiness found in a lot of kids toothpaste.  We made the switch cold turkey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, my daughter misses her barbie bubble gum sweet sweet candy toothpaste.  She complains that she wants the old toothpaste back. But she doesn&#x27;t outright refuse this when we tell her &amp;#34;nope, we have new big girl toothpaste now&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it very much.</li>
            <li> This is the only toothpaste my daughter will use for 4 years and running. That makes it a winner in my book : 0 ) Docking one star for the price....so expensive, ugh. But overall a household staple here.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my kiddo learning how to brush his teeth</li>
            <li> my daughter loves this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> My children hated the chalky taste. I tried it as well and had to drink a big glass of water to get rid of the chalky flavor in my mouth. I will not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> our favorite toothpaste! my kids use this exclusively and when my 5 yr old went in for his first dentist appt last week - he had no cavities! Super excited about that :)</li>
            <li> The kids use it willingly and I don&#x27;t worry about what&#x27;s in it. Win, win.</li>
            <li> Daughter loves this one. I do prefer the one WITH fluoride. I&#x27;ve read plenty about it, and the danger with fluoride is when it is ingested over long periods of time, like how the government puts it into city water. Applied topically like with toothpaste does not pose a risk.</li>
            <li> great tasting for mom and 2 year old.....</li>
            <li> My four year old loves the flavor and he is super picky so it was a gamble.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my nephew~ he likes the smell~</li>
            <li> My son is 22 months and has been using this toothpaste since he was about 9 months or so. He loves the taste. It is hard to get him to brush his teeth. This seems to work with a child&#x27;s electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> GOOD GOOD STUDY,DAY DAY UP----From China Mao YeYe</li>
            <li> Our little one loves this toothpaste and is excited to brush with it twice a day</li>
            <li> Tastes great, also works wonderfully for cleaning dental appliances!</li>
            <li> I have to first say that I absolutely hate mint toothpaste. So when I find something that isn&#x27;t mint I&#x27;m very excited. I saw this for a while and wanted to try it, but never did. I finally caught it on sale and purchased it. I have to say that I&#x27;m not really that impressed. The flavor is like strawberry bubblegum, kinda strange... could have more of a strawberry flavor like you find in chapstick. The texture was off. It liquified rather fast. wasn&#x27;t a paste texture while you were brushing. Just seemed to not hold a texture at all. It didn&#x27;t really sud up that much or feel like it was really cleaning my teeth either. My teeth do feel clean, but not nearly as much as when I use colgate/crest toothpastes. Overall its an OK toothpaste, but I very much doubt I will repurchase it. If it didn&#x27;t liquify as fast as it did once I started brushing with it, I probably would have liked it better. It almost felt like I was brushing with mouthwash.</li>
            <li> finally, my son isn&#x27;t screaming his brains out when we brush his teeth!!! good flavor for the kiddies</li>
            <li> My kiddos love the flavor, and I love the lack of fluoride. We have used this for years.</li>
            <li> The only toothpaste my daughter will use!</li>
            <li> Very nice toothpaste! Tastes great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good,I like this.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I read all the positive reviews on this product. I try to avoid artificial colors and love that this product fits the bill. After purchasing this I excitedly told my sister (also into more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products). She said she had tried this and that neither of her boys would use it due to the terrible taste. When it arrived I tested it out did find it to be quite unpleasant. However, this being the first toothpaste my little guy has used, I decided to try it anyway. At first he would spit it out and make a terrible face, but now he&#x27;s doing great. Also, interestingly I had to brush his teeth at Grandmas and all she had was kids crest--he also spit that out. So though I find the taste pretty terrible, I will give it 4 stars because my 18 month old doesn&#x27;t seem to mind.</li>
            <li> This is the only toothpaste my son will use. He hates the taste of all the others. If I could give this 10 stars I would as without this toothpaste, my child would refuse to brush his teeth!</li>
            <li> My four year old uses this daily.</li>
            <li> The baby love it,believe in the tom&#x27;s.</li>
