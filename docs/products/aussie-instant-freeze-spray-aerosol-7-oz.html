            <li>I have been using this product for a month now and am extremely pleased.  </li>

            <li>I was sent this product through Influenster for testing and I am glad I received it.  </li>

            <li>I love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li>I use it mostly every day.</li>
            <li>and I love curling my hair but not everyday&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I was really impressed that the hairspray does not leave any white residue or flakes.  </li>
            <li>I have tried gel, mousse, and many hair sprays.  </li>
            <li>Hold is what we gals mostly desire.  </li>
            <li>I am IN LOVE with this hairspray.</li>
            <li>But i like that because i&#x27;m able to feel where I put the hairspray and if I had missed spraying any curls.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of all aussie products...</li>
            <li>Sure.</li>
            <li>and My hair is perfect the next day.</li>
            <li>So refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love this product and everything about it.</li>
            <li>One of the best hair sprays I&#x27;ve used, especially for being an aerosol.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I received this originally for testing purposes and all of these opinions are my own.  </li>
            <li>Au tried Instafreeze on my curls and even though it did not hold my curls at their original state it still fell into a nice curl that did hold.</li>
            <li>I received it complimentary for free as a testing/review product and it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>I was impressed with how long it lasted.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even after a long night of dancing, my hair still looked perfect when I got home.</li>
            <li>I loved the aerosol can as well, makes it so much easier to use!</li>
            <li>I have awesome curls that lasted all day long!</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve found my new favorite hairspray!!</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t notice the smell that most have mentioned as being absolutely wonderful or extremely horrid.</li>
            <li>Wow! I absolutely love this hairspray!!</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m able to keep my hair in place for 6 hours then I&#x27;m happy, and Aussie seems to meet my requirements, especially for my hair :)  </li>
            <li>Its a great hold as far as the product</li>
            <li>I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>Tip gets clogged up cause its like glue but other than that, very happy</li>
            <li>It holds up to its name &amp;#34;Instant Freeze&amp;#34; as it held my fishtail braid in ALL day with very minimal fly - aways!</li>
            <li>I rarely wear my hair curly because by the end of the day they don&#x27;t look good but with this product my hair looked great after a long day!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, and I don&#x27;t have to keep worrying about what my hair looks like during the day.</li>
            <li>This hair spray was just like the name, you could easily &amp;#34;sprunch&amp;#34; your hair.</li>
            <li>first i was excited, i received this product for complimentary testing purposes but, after doing so i wasn&#x27;t happy..</li>
            <li>I love and have always loved Aussie Hair products but my favorite is the Instant Freeze aerosol hairspray.</li>
            <li>The nozzle has a strong defined spray as opposed to a fine mist.  </li>
            <li>Spray light because it is strong.</li>
            <li>I absolutely just love the smell of Aussie hair care!</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited and stoked to see that I could count on a product to keep me looking cute : )</li>
            <li>I was super excited!  </li>
            <li>I also found that this product does not leave a sticky or flaky residue on your hair in between washes and this is great for an on the go girl like me who doesn&#x27;t have time for daily washes.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m always hoping for a hair spray that will hold my curls, but leave them free and flowing.</li>
            <li>I got to try this product as part of a promotion to test the product and received it free in return for my opinion of the product.</li>
            <li>I have very curly and frizzy hair that does not stay well depending on what kind of weather we are having.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice to see a company with a product that still holds very well.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s important to keep that stack in its place on windy days.</li>
            <li>but it washes out clean and easy.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice to see a company with a product that still holds very well.</li>
            <li>It has such great hold I had to shampoo my hair twice to get it all out.</li>
            <li>I recieved this product via influenster.com as a free trial, and ended up using it on my daugher.  </li>
            <li>I received this hairspray for free for testing purposes</li>
            <li>and I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>I tested this product for free but the opinion is mine.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample to try and review.</li>
            <li>I was given this hair spray in my influenster box to try out for free.</li>
            <li>Aussie Freeze Hair Spray is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I loved the old smell</li>
            <li>This hairspray has the excellent hold I have come to depend on from my Big Sexy hairspray I typically use, but at a much better price!</li>
            <li>First, I was very happy with the way the product smelled; it wasn&#x27;t over-powering and seemed to last throughout the day, making me feel like my hair was still clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I wear a pompadour and it holds super strong.</li>
            <li>Aussie instant freeze is Amazing!</li>
            <li>The smell of Aussie Instant Freeze Hair spray is amazing!</li>
            <li>I was recently sent more from Influenster for free in return for my honest review on Aussie.com and Amazon.com.    </li>
            <li>I usually have tons of fly aways until I started using this product!  </li>
            <li>I was recently sent more from Influenster for free in return for my honest review on Aussie.com and Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product because it does exactly what it</li>
            <li>First off let me say that the smell is interesting.</li>
            <li>Overall I liked that Insta freeze was not hard and crunchy and it smelled nice as well!</li>
            <li>I have very fine, stick straight hair and find that it doesn&#x27;t hold curl well at all.</li>
            <li>It works amazingly and this will definitely be my new go to hairspray.</li>
            <li>Clean nozzle opening on occasion.</li>
            <li>It allows me to mix up my hair for work and special occasions.</li>
            <li>In my opinion I find them higher quality because they not only have quality, scent, but a great price.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased to say that this hairspray holds up pretty well in my normal day to day.  </li>
            <li>My brother had an outdoor wedding in the mountains this weekend and the wind was blowing full strength.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely have fallen in love with this hair spray.</li>
            <li>I particularly love it because it manages those fly-aways very well.</li>
            <li>the only reason why I do not give it 5 stars is that this one product does not smell that good</li>
            <li>However, my husband who really loved the instant freeze on his hair to hold in his styling!</li>
            <li>Another thing I loved about it is instead of having to wash it out it brushed out leaving no residue.</li>
            <li>I wish they kept the sweet smell from years ago.</li>
            <li>With this product I&#x27;ve been able to manage my hair so much easier.</li>
            <li>I love finding new products that work!</li>
            <li>I have pretty fine hair and side swept bangs</li>
            <li>Instant freeze is the most appropriate name</li>
            <li>I have tried this before with various hair sprays and some have worked and many more</li>
            <li>This is most definitely a miracle product :)</li>
            <li>So, I have been using my normal product to style most of my hair</li>
            <li>This hairspray quickly became my new favorite hair item.  </li>
            <li>Use it when i go to work to hold down any fly away</li>
            <li>This is a great spray for keeping down the stray hairs and holding in curls.</li>
            <li>I loved how this hairspray literally froze my style all day long!</li>
            <li>I did try this product on my own hair, however I wear it down most of the time</li>
            <li>The Aussie Instant Freeze hair spray is my favorite hair spray on the market!</li>
            <li>the spray is pretty flexible depending on the amount applied to the hair!</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says!</li>
            <li>This is does exactly as it says!  </li>
            <li>It works very well with my fine hair.</li>
            <li>It gets all the little fly away hairs and secures them in place.</li>
            <li>I have problems with fly aways and always have trouble keeping my hair where I want it to stay.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Instead of using lots of product and getting that hairspray residue goo, a light mist of this is really all you need.</li>
            <li>Overall I think this product is amazing</li>
            <li>I used this amazing instant freeze hairspray to tease my hair.</li>

            <li>So I received the Aussie Instant Freeze Hair Spray to test and see if I liked it and if it worked for my hair type.</li>
            <li>it is mostly intended for naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It is the only spray that effectively manages my style without a sticky residue.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Love it it is not heavy feeing</li>
            <li>I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.  </li>
            <li>It has a great smell to it and it doesn&#x27;t flatten your hair style or leave it feeling sticky or extremely stiff.</li>
            <li>This hairspray is nothing less than amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually very picky when it comes to hairspray because it&#x27;s always so hard to find one that has great hold, doesn&#x27;t flake or get crusty, holds for long periods of time, is flexible to style but still holds up, and is a great value.</li>
            <li>I do not know why all other products smell good except for this</li>
            <li>plus has a good scent, like other Aussie products.</li>
            <li>Freezes your hair right where it is.</li>
            <li>Freezes your hair right where it is.</li>
            <li>Easy for an early morning fix!</li>
            <li>The name holds true as it really does freeze.</li>
            <li>My hair stays bouncy and light, curls up like normal and stays that way.  </li>
            <li>What fly aways dont have no more..</li>
            <li>and I enjoy the new ways I can do my hair.</li>
            <li>I have super straight hair and this hairspray allows me to curl, tease, whatever I want.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to spray all that much for it to quickly &amp;#34;Freeze&amp;#34; it in place.</li>
            <li>This is my new go to for hairspray!!!</li>
            <li>Being able to apply it to hair that isn&#x27;t necessarily freshly washed is important because I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday</li>
            <li>I love the Instant Freeze.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the Aussie instant freeze spray!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Instant Freeze does exactly that.</li>
            <li>In order to get my desired results I had to use the Aussie Sprunch spray while my hair was damp and then use the Instant Freeze on top of that.</li>
            <li>This product really keeps my hair in place!  </li>
            <li>I tested this product at no cost thanks to influester!</li>
            <li>I also love the Instant freeze hairspray.</li>
            <li>I would use it again but it wont be my first choice.</li>
            <li>I first used it the night of my friends bachelorette party.</li>
            <li>After trying many products to controls my sons hair, I have finally found THE ONE!  </li>
            <li>When it dries, it dries in the exact position that you sprayed it.</li>
            <li>It has ok hold, didn&#x27;t last alllllll day</li>
            <li>I tried Aussie Instant Freeze Hair spray for the first time in my years of Aussie Products, and enjoyed every bit of it.</li>
            <li>I sprayed my hair when it&#x27;s wet and curly, it holds and lifts my hair to keep it looking nice through out the day and night.</li>
            <li>I will spray it first on the area then curl and when I&#x27;m all finished spray all over I like the holding it</li>
            <li>Everything else just stayed exactly where it was in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I am enjoying the Aussie Instant Freeze Hair Spray!</li>
            <li>but that is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>If you feel that is too light try this carefully now spray the front root of head by separating the hair easily.  </li>
            <li>It has a great hold, especially for my curly hair and such high humidity.  </li>
            <li>use this hairspray most on my straight hair days as I have a short style that needs lift.</li>
            <li>I will buy it whether I have a coupon or not because I have not been able to find a hair spray that lasts all day long like this one does.</li>
            <li>No more searching for a good hairspray for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I think its true purpose is to enhance natural waves and curls without having a crunchy or sticky feel.</li>
            <li>I just have to use a little more restraint in spraying!</li>
            <li>Unlike other hair sprays, the Aussie Instant Freeze has an amazing smell to it!</li>
            <li>Overall for the price, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Have been using the Aussie brand since I was in high school and fell in love due to the smell of the products, have been using a different hair spray from their line that I love</li>
            <li>This is such a great hair spray to give you the firm hold you need.</li>
            <li>It really does keep her hair in place while she is warming up and doing her routine.  </li>
            <li>I have really curly hair</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t take much for it to become frizzy but with this hairspray it literally freezes my curls in place</li>
            <li>but really these products aren&#x27;t made for that.</li>
            <li>This is really a maximum hold spray.  </li>
            <li>Really, they product stays put until I wash my hair.</li>
            <li>but really these products aren&#x27;t made for that.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day and my hair really stays in place.</li>
            <li>Gave this Aussie product the ultimate test today after receiving my free influenster sample...</li>
            <li>It really does hold your hair in place.  </li>
            <li>Since I like to straighten my hair the night before, this helps keep it straight in the morning</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m ready to go.     </li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair didn&#x27;t feel as &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; as I wanted it to, but I haven&#x27;t found products for curly hair yet that do the job and are light at the same time.</li>
            <li>The scent is also very flattering without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Influenster for allowing me to test this product.</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t really hold my curls.</li>
            <li>but at the end of the day my hair looks straight.</li>
            <li>But after I used this hairspray my hair hold on the curls for the whole day I slept with them and woke up with my hair curled.</li>
            <li>I am normally very picky and have the hardest time finding a hair spray that works well with my wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I have really curly hair</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li>I have to say that this hair spray did work very well</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t seem to hold the curls very well when i curled my hair</li>
            <li>but it held a curl very well while it was holding.</li>
            <li>hair is pretty straight and normal.</li>
            <li>I can reach for it 5 minutes before I leave--it takes less than a minute to spray and quickly scrunch up for an easy hairstyle.</li>
            <li>My place of work requires me to always wear my hair up and this hairspray keeps my fly aways and shorter pieces of hair tame during my entire 9 hour shift and beyond.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it is really an extreme hold.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the super strong hold that makes my hair stiff.</li>
            <li>I curled my hair (which is super straight and heavy) with my wand and waited for it to cool</li>
            <li>This might just be my new hairspray!</li>
            <li>Over all, its my new go to product!</li>
            <li>I can pull my curly hair back and spray a little on to make sure I have a clean looking style all day.</li>
            <li>On my down hair it held super well, to the point that when I flipped my head back up I thought I was in an 80s music video :)</li>
            <li>and I tease my hair to give it a high sleek looking bob.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it on high humidity days and days</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Aussie Instant Freeze Hair Spray\\&quot; does exactly what the name says!</li>
            <li>I just made sure it dried before anything touched her hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received Aussie Instant Freeze complimentary as part of a customer test.</li>
            <li>I love the instant freeze hair spray for styles I need to stay put for a long period of time.</li>
            <li>I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and I will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li>It held up well under the high humidity where I live.</li>
            <li>I love how this hairspray keeps my volume all day without leaving my hair stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li>It can be very stiff if you use too much because it is meant to hold particular styles well.&lt;br /&gt;Depending on how much product you use you can have a light spray</li>
            <li>It has amazing hold that last all day long and doesn&#x27;t give you that super crunchy heavy feel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always in the market for a new hairspray.</li>
            <li>This is the only hairspray I buy because I don&#x27;t have to use very much.</li>
            <li>Depending on how much product you use you can have a light spray or if you like that stiff look</li>
            <li>Instant Freeze does exactly that.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend it, I really like this product!</li>
            <li>but I achieve the look I am going for and avoid having wild locks!</li>
            <li>I gladly replaced the other with this Instant Freeze.  </li>
            <li>I even slept with it like that, and it looked exactly the same in the morning.</li>
            <li>This product is useful to keep a style in place all night long!</li>
            <li>Firstly, if you think it is TOO hardish, do this &amp;#62;&amp;#62;  after it is ready to be sprayed spray the product in you hand and take your hand andrub it through you hair at the roots, do this three (3) times and you won&#x27;t get the impact of the actual Aussie Instant Freeze.  </li>
            <li>Its very rare that barrel curls hold up to the wind and don&#x27;t look a mess</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, it doesn&#x27;t only hold your hairstyle without the crunchy hard feeling, it keeps</li>
            <li>I use it when my 4 year old has recitals and dance competitions.  </li>
            <li>Hairstyles change now with all the natural looks</li>
            <li>Hairstyles change now with all the natural looks</li>
            <li>With naturally curly hair the hair sprays don&#x27;t make my hair stick together or break off.</li>
            <li>It really does instantly freeze your hair.  </li>
            <li>This results (in my case with curly hair) in wild out of control curls at my hairline.  </li>
            <li>but I have to work and in a professional setting.  </li>
            <li>I did like the hold that this hairspray did have on my hair, however, I did not like how it retained the natural curls that I have</li>
            <li>This is by far one of the bests</li>
            <li>i would recommend this product to women with natural curls.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I won&#x27;t wash it out for my early morning wake ups that night and leave it in while I sleep</li>
            <li>however I was pleasantly surprised that it did not.</li>
            <li>On a windy day it also held there was no little hairs sticking up even with the wind.</li>
            <li>This product kept my hair going all day long (and I woke up with pretty decent curls the next day too)</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a strong, very firm hold, this product is for you.  </li>
            <li>but that usually is the case with most hairsprays so no big deal.</li>
            <li>I started using it in the mornings, especially when my hair was pulled up into a high bun.  </li>
            <li>It holds like no other!</li>
            <li>The price is economic and a littile spray goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It worked just as well as my $9.00 a can regular hairspray that I normally purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use hairspray on a daily basis  and am always trying new brands</li>
            <li>I live in Texas and we are known for our big hair!</li>
            <li>but I take care to towel dry my hairline really well.  </li>
            <li>I have very thick hair and most sprays I have tried</li>
            <li>You only need a light spray because it can leave little bitty white spray dots in your hair.</li>
            <li>But this exact instant freeze  product left an immedate white film on my hair as well as,other friends of mine with different type</li>
            <li>Aussie makes quality hair care products at very reasonable prices and I don&#x27;t feel as if they are any less than the salons products.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, and when I used this while wearing my hair down, it allowed for no natural movement and weighed my hair down.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do much with it generally, other than brush it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Between the humidity and the constant weather change my hair is a hot mess.</li>
            <li>so I tried a VERY expensive hairspray (around $20) on a reccomendation, and I loved it... but not the price.</li>
            <li>I needed it to have long lasting hold as it was a formal wedding, I was going to dance, and i had to get there early for pictures.</li>
            <li>Most either couldn&#x27;t control the cow licks or left their hair crunchy and with thick white film.  </li>

            <li> and I love curling my hair but not everyday&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I was really impressed that the hairspray does not leave any white residue or flakes.  </li>
            <li> I have tried gel, mousse, and many hair sprays.  </li>
            <li> Hold is what we gals mostly desire.  </li>
            <li> I am IN LOVE with this hairspray.</li>
            <li> But i like that because i&#x27;m able to feel where I put the hairspray and if I had missed spraying any curls.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of all aussie products...</li>
            <li> Sure.</li>
            <li> and My hair is perfect the next day.</li>
            <li> So refreshing.</li>
            <li> I love this product and everything about it.</li>
            <li> One of the best hair sprays I&#x27;ve used, especially for being an aerosol.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I received this originally for testing purposes and all of these opinions are my own.  </li>
            <li> Au tried Instafreeze on my curls and even though it did not hold my curls at their original state it still fell into a nice curl that did hold.</li>
            <li> I received it complimentary for free as a testing/review product and it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> I was impressed with how long it lasted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even after a long night of dancing, my hair still looked perfect when I got home.</li>
            <li> I loved the aerosol can as well, makes it so much easier to use!</li>
            <li> I have awesome curls that lasted all day long!</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve found my new favorite hairspray!!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t notice the smell that most have mentioned as being absolutely wonderful or extremely horrid.</li>
            <li> Wow! I absolutely love this hairspray!!</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m able to keep my hair in place for 6 hours then I&#x27;m happy, and Aussie seems to meet my requirements, especially for my hair :)  </li>
            <li> Its a great hold as far as the product</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Tip gets clogged up cause its like glue but other than that, very happy</li>
            <li> It holds up to its name &amp;#34;Instant Freeze&amp;#34; as it held my fishtail braid in ALL day with very minimal fly - aways!</li>
            <li> I rarely wear my hair curly because by the end of the day they don&#x27;t look good but with this product my hair looked great after a long day!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, and I don&#x27;t have to keep worrying about what my hair looks like during the day.</li>
            <li> This hair spray was just like the name, you could easily &amp;#34;sprunch&amp;#34; your hair.</li>
            <li> first i was excited, i received this product for complimentary testing purposes but, after doing so i wasn&#x27;t happy..</li>
            <li> I love and have always loved Aussie Hair products but my favorite is the Instant Freeze aerosol hairspray.</li>
            <li> The nozzle has a strong defined spray as opposed to a fine mist.  </li>
            <li> Spray light because it is strong.</li>
            <li> I absolutely just love the smell of Aussie hair care!</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited and stoked to see that I could count on a product to keep me looking cute : )</li>
            <li> I was super excited!  </li>
            <li> I also found that this product does not leave a sticky or flaky residue on your hair in between washes and this is great for an on the go girl like me who doesn&#x27;t have time for daily washes.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m always hoping for a hair spray that will hold my curls, but leave them free and flowing.</li>
            <li> I got to try this product as part of a promotion to test the product and received it free in return for my opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> I have very curly and frizzy hair that does not stay well depending on what kind of weather we are having.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice to see a company with a product that still holds very well.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s important to keep that stack in its place on windy days.</li>
            <li> but it washes out clean and easy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice to see a company with a product that still holds very well.</li>
            <li> It has such great hold I had to shampoo my hair twice to get it all out.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product via influenster.com as a free trial, and ended up using it on my daugher.  </li>
            <li> I received this hairspray for free for testing purposes</li>
            <li> and I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I tested this product for free but the opinion is mine.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample to try and review.</li>
            <li> I was given this hair spray in my influenster box to try out for free.</li>
            <li> Aussie Freeze Hair Spray is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I loved the old smell</li>
            <li> This hairspray has the excellent hold I have come to depend on from my Big Sexy hairspray I typically use, but at a much better price!</li>
            <li> First, I was very happy with the way the product smelled; it wasn&#x27;t over-powering and seemed to last throughout the day, making me feel like my hair was still clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I wear a pompadour and it holds super strong.</li>
            <li> Aussie instant freeze is Amazing!</li>
            <li> The smell of Aussie Instant Freeze Hair spray is amazing!</li>
            <li> I was recently sent more from Influenster for free in return for my honest review on Aussie.com and Amazon.com.    </li>
            <li> I usually have tons of fly aways until I started using this product!  </li>
            <li> I was recently sent more from Influenster for free in return for my honest review on Aussie.com and Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product because it does exactly what it</li>
            <li> First off let me say that the smell is interesting.</li>
            <li> Overall I liked that Insta freeze was not hard and crunchy and it smelled nice as well!</li>
            <li> I have very fine, stick straight hair and find that it doesn&#x27;t hold curl well at all.</li>
            <li> It works amazingly and this will definitely be my new go to hairspray.</li>
            <li> Clean nozzle opening on occasion.</li>
            <li> It allows me to mix up my hair for work and special occasions.</li>
            <li> In my opinion I find them higher quality because they not only have quality, scent, but a great price.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased to say that this hairspray holds up pretty well in my normal day to day.  </li>
            <li> My brother had an outdoor wedding in the mountains this weekend and the wind was blowing full strength.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely have fallen in love with this hair spray.</li>
            <li> I particularly love it because it manages those fly-aways very well.</li>
            <li> the only reason why I do not give it 5 stars is that this one product does not smell that good</li>
            <li> However, my husband who really loved the instant freeze on his hair to hold in his styling!</li>
            <li> Another thing I loved about it is instead of having to wash it out it brushed out leaving no residue.</li>
            <li> I wish they kept the sweet smell from years ago.</li>
            <li> With this product I&#x27;ve been able to manage my hair so much easier.</li>
            <li> I love finding new products that work!</li>
            <li> I have pretty fine hair and side swept bangs</li>
            <li> Instant freeze is the most appropriate name</li>
            <li> I have tried this before with various hair sprays and some have worked and many more</li>
            <li> This is most definitely a miracle product :)</li>
            <li> So, I have been using my normal product to style most of my hair</li>
            <li> This hairspray quickly became my new favorite hair item.  </li>
            <li> Use it when i go to work to hold down any fly away</li>
            <li> This is a great spray for keeping down the stray hairs and holding in curls.</li>
            <li> I loved how this hairspray literally froze my style all day long!</li>
            <li> I did try this product on my own hair, however I wear it down most of the time</li>
            <li> The Aussie Instant Freeze hair spray is my favorite hair spray on the market!</li>
            <li> the spray is pretty flexible depending on the amount applied to the hair!</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says!</li>
            <li> This is does exactly as it says!  </li>
            <li> It works very well with my fine hair.</li>
            <li> It gets all the little fly away hairs and secures them in place.</li>
            <li> I have problems with fly aways and always have trouble keeping my hair where I want it to stay.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Instead of using lots of product and getting that hairspray residue goo, a light mist of this is really all you need.</li>
            <li> Overall I think this product is amazing</li>
            <li> I used this amazing instant freeze hairspray to tease my hair.</li>
            <li> received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> The scent alone is worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>

            <li> &amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> So I received the Aussie Instant Freeze Hair Spray to test and see if I liked it and if it worked for my hair type.</li>
            <li> it is mostly intended for naturally curly hair.</li>

            <li> This hairspray is nothing less than amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually very picky when it comes to hairspray because it&#x27;s always so hard to find one that has great hold, doesn&#x27;t flake or get crusty, holds for long periods of time, is flexible to style but still holds up, and is a great value.</li>
            <li> I do not know why all other products smell good except for this</li>
            <li> plus has a good scent, like other Aussie products.</li>
            <li> Freezes your hair right where it is.</li>
            <li> Freezes your hair right where it is.</li>
            <li> Easy for an early morning fix!</li>
            <li> The name holds true as it really does freeze.</li>
            <li> My hair stays bouncy and light, curls up like normal and stays that way.  </li>
            <li> What fly aways dont have no more..</li>
            <li> and I enjoy the new ways I can do my hair.</li>
            <li> I have super straight hair and this hairspray allows me to curl, tease, whatever I want.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to spray all that much for it to quickly &amp;#34;Freeze&amp;#34; it in place.</li>
            <li> This is my new go to for hairspray!!!</li>
            <li> Being able to apply it to hair that isn&#x27;t necessarily freshly washed is important because I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday</li>
            <li> I love the Instant Freeze.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE the Aussie instant freeze spray!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Instant Freeze does exactly that.</li>
            <li> In order to get my desired results I had to use the Aussie Sprunch spray while my hair was damp and then use the Instant Freeze on top of that.</li>
            <li> This product really keeps my hair in place!  </li>
            <li> I tested this product at no cost thanks to influester!</li>
            <li> I also love the Instant freeze hairspray.</li>
            <li> I would use it again but it wont be my first choice.</li>
            <li> I first used it the night of my friends bachelorette party.</li>
            <li> After trying many products to controls my sons hair, I have finally found THE ONE!  </li>
            <li> When it dries, it dries in the exact position that you sprayed it.</li>
            <li> It has ok hold, didn&#x27;t last alllllll day</li>
            <li> I tried Aussie Instant Freeze Hair spray for the first time in my years of Aussie Products, and enjoyed every bit of it.</li>
            <li> I sprayed my hair when it&#x27;s wet and curly, it holds and lifts my hair to keep it looking nice through out the day and night.</li>
            <li> I will spray it first on the area then curl and when I&#x27;m all finished spray all over I like the holding it</li>
            <li> Everything else just stayed exactly where it was in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I am enjoying the Aussie Instant Freeze Hair Spray!</li>
            <li> but that is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> If you feel that is too light try this carefully now spray the front root of head by separating the hair easily.  </li>
            <li> It has a great hold, especially for my curly hair and such high humidity.  </li>
            <li> use this hairspray most on my straight hair days as I have a short style that needs lift.</li>
            <li> I will buy it whether I have a coupon or not because I have not been able to find a hair spray that lasts all day long like this one does.</li>
            <li> No more searching for a good hairspray for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I think its true purpose is to enhance natural waves and curls without having a crunchy or sticky feel.</li>
            <li> I just have to use a little more restraint in spraying!</li>
            <li> Unlike other hair sprays, the Aussie Instant Freeze has an amazing smell to it!</li>
            <li> Overall for the price, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Have been using the Aussie brand since I was in high school and fell in love due to the smell of the products, have been using a different hair spray from their line that I love</li>
            <li> This is such a great hair spray to give you the firm hold you need.</li>
            <li> It really does keep her hair in place while she is warming up and doing her routine.  </li>
            <li> I have really curly hair</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t take much for it to become frizzy but with this hairspray it literally freezes my curls in place</li>
            <li> but really these products aren&#x27;t made for that.</li>
            <li> This is really a maximum hold spray.  </li>
            <li> Really, they product stays put until I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> but really these products aren&#x27;t made for that.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and my hair really stays in place.</li>
            <li> Gave this Aussie product the ultimate test today after receiving my free influenster sample...</li>
            <li> It really does hold your hair in place.  </li>
            <li> Since I like to straighten my hair the night before, this helps keep it straight in the morning</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m ready to go.     </li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t feel as &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; as I wanted it to, but I haven&#x27;t found products for curly hair yet that do the job and are light at the same time.</li>
            <li> The scent is also very flattering without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Influenster for allowing me to test this product.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t really hold my curls.</li>
            <li> but at the end of the day my hair looks straight.</li>
            <li> But after I used this hairspray my hair hold on the curls for the whole day I slept with them and woke up with my hair curled.</li>
            <li> I am normally very picky and have the hardest time finding a hair spray that works well with my wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this hair spray did work very well</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t seem to hold the curls very well when i curled my hair</li>
            <li> but it held a curl very well while it was holding.</li>
            <li> hair is pretty straight and normal.</li>
            <li> I can reach for it 5 minutes before I leave--it takes less than a minute to spray and quickly scrunch up for an easy hairstyle.</li>
            <li> My place of work requires me to always wear my hair up and this hairspray keeps my fly aways and shorter pieces of hair tame during my entire 9 hour shift and beyond.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it is really an extreme hold.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the super strong hold that makes my hair stiff.</li>
            <li> I curled my hair (which is super straight and heavy) with my wand and waited for it to cool</li>
            <li> This might just be my new hairspray!</li>
            <li> Over all, its my new go to product!</li>
            <li> I can pull my curly hair back and spray a little on to make sure I have a clean looking style all day.</li>
            <li> On my down hair it held super well, to the point that when I flipped my head back up I thought I was in an 80s music video :)</li>
            <li> and I tease my hair to give it a high sleek looking bob.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it on high humidity days and days</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Aussie Instant Freeze Hair Spray\\&quot; does exactly what the name says!</li>
            <li> I just made sure it dried before anything touched her hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received Aussie Instant Freeze complimentary as part of a customer test.</li>
            <li> I love the instant freeze hair spray for styles I need to stay put for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and I will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> It held up well under the high humidity where I live.</li>
            <li> I love how this hairspray keeps my volume all day without leaving my hair stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li> It can be very stiff if you use too much because it is meant to hold particular styles well.&lt;br /&gt;Depending on how much product you use you can have a light spray</li>
            <li> It has amazing hold that last all day long and doesn&#x27;t give you that super crunchy heavy feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always in the market for a new hairspray.</li>
            <li> This is the only hairspray I buy because I don&#x27;t have to use very much.</li>
            <li> Depending on how much product you use you can have a light spray or if you like that stiff look</li>
            <li> Instant Freeze does exactly that.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it, I really like this product!</li>
            <li> but I achieve the look I am going for and avoid having wild locks!</li>
            <li> I gladly replaced the other with this Instant Freeze.  </li>
            <li> I even slept with it like that, and it looked exactly the same in the morning.</li>
            <li> This product is useful to keep a style in place all night long!</li>
            <li> Firstly, if you think it is TOO hardish, do this &amp;#62;&amp;#62;  after it is ready to be sprayed spray the product in you hand and take your hand andrub it through you hair at the roots, do this three (3) times and you won&#x27;t get the impact of the actual Aussie Instant Freeze.  </li>
            <li> Its very rare that barrel curls hold up to the wind and don&#x27;t look a mess</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, it doesn&#x27;t only hold your hairstyle without the crunchy hard feeling, it keeps</li>
            <li> I use it when my 4 year old has recitals and dance competitions.  </li>
            <li> Hairstyles change now with all the natural looks</li>
            <li> Hairstyles change now with all the natural looks</li>
            <li> With naturally curly hair the hair sprays don&#x27;t make my hair stick together or break off.</li>
            <li> It really does instantly freeze your hair.  </li>
            <li> This results (in my case with curly hair) in wild out of control curls at my hairline.  </li>
            <li> but I have to work and in a professional setting.  </li>
            <li> I did like the hold that this hairspray did have on my hair, however, I did not like how it retained the natural curls that I have</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the bests</li>
            <li> i would recommend this product to women with natural curls.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I won&#x27;t wash it out for my early morning wake ups that night and leave it in while I sleep</li>
            <li> however I was pleasantly surprised that it did not.</li>
            <li> On a windy day it also held there was no little hairs sticking up even with the wind.</li>
            <li> This product kept my hair going all day long (and I woke up with pretty decent curls the next day too)</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a strong, very firm hold, this product is for you.  </li>
            <li> but that usually is the case with most hairsprays so no big deal.</li>
            <li> I started using it in the mornings, especially when my hair was pulled up into a high bun.  </li>
            <li> It holds like no other!</li>
            <li> The price is economic and a littile spray goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It worked just as well as my $9.00 a can regular hairspray that I normally purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use hairspray on a daily basis  and am always trying new brands</li>
            <li> I live in Texas and we are known for our big hair!</li>
            <li> but I take care to towel dry my hairline really well.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and most sprays I have tried</li>
            <li> You only need a light spray because it can leave little bitty white spray dots in your hair.</li>
            <li> But this exact instant freeze  product left an immedate white film on my hair as well as,other friends of mine with different type</li>
            <li> Aussie makes quality hair care products at very reasonable prices and I don&#x27;t feel as if they are any less than the salons products.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and when I used this while wearing my hair down, it allowed for no natural movement and weighed my hair down.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do much with it generally, other than brush it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Between the humidity and the constant weather change my hair is a hot mess.</li>
            <li> so I tried a VERY expensive hairspray (around $20) on a reccomendation, and I loved it... but not the price.</li>
            <li> I needed it to have long lasting hold as it was a formal wedding, I was going to dance, and i had to get there early for pictures.</li>
            <li> Most either couldn&#x27;t control the cow licks or left their hair crunchy and with thick white film.  </li>
            <li> I love that it didn&#x27;t make my hair feel stiff and hard, but still held my hair like it should.</li>
            <li> It really males hair stiff,  </li>
            <li> It is a really quick and easy way for a casual hairstyle that isn&#x27;t so forced (the way it might look with stronger hairsprays).</li>
            <li> I can comb my wild hairline curls back, spray with the Instant Freeze and held down for a minute.  </li>
            <li> will continue to use Aussie Instant Freeze for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;In addition to Instant Freeze</li>
            <li> Not a single hair out of place all night long!!  </li>
            <li> I have slick straight hair that no matter what I do will not hold a curl.</li>
            <li> The instant freeze spray keeps my hair in place all day long.</li>
            <li> I also like to use it when I do updo&#x27;s because it gives it a long lasting freeze!</li>
            <li> I am an avid hair spray user, and I find that not all hair sprays work well with my hair type (wavy and thick).  </li>
            <li> It is highly affective and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Both myself and my daughter have naturally curly hair and it held our curls in place all day without weighing them down or making them crunchy.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the new smell.</li>
            <li> I like to use this hairspray on a daily basis - my hair is very thin and fine and doesn&#x27;t hold curl or shape for anything.  </li>
            <li> so the tend to move around and with this hairspray they stay in place all day long.</li>
            <li> It keeps every hair in place for a long time.</li>
            <li> It gives a flexible hold that lasts long and all I do is scrunch it up and toss it around a bit after spraying.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin, blonde, and curly/wavy so finding a good hair product is extremely difficult to me.</li>
            <li> My very thin, fine hair needed a boost</li>
            <li> Every other hair spray takes multiple layers of product to do what Aussie does in one application.</li>
            <li> I can see myself buying it again because although I have some other products that create a similar effect, none of them are meant to be applied to dry hair.</li>
            <li> No matter if I put my hair up and needed areas of it to stay slicked down or had my hair fixed down and needed it to not flair out</li>
            <li> and I got away with 1 single bobby pin.  </li>
            <li> My highest praise about this product is two-fold: it never ways down my super thin hair</li>
            <li> I sprayed on some instant freeze, pushed them down, and they stayed there...</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be using it when I wear my hair down, but will definitely be using it every time I wear my hair in an updo.</li>
            <li> and it was practically the same hairspray at less than a quarter of the price.</li>
            <li> Living in a gusty wind area on the edge of the Mojave Desert, could not live without it!</li>
            <li> I usually have several bobby pins in the back where my hair is a little too short and falls out throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I use it after I curl my hair with the wand, to hold my curls without looking stiff and they last all day long.</li>
            <li> This hold in this hairspray allows me to drive on the highway with the windows down and walk outside on extremely windy days without an ounce of worry that my hair will get messed up.</li>
            <li> This left my hair a little too crunchy for my liking.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ll wake up that next morning to it still the same way, with a little bed head, but I spray a little water to fix the bed head</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a little rough to brush out if you brush your hair later</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, and my hair stayed in place all night long.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold instantly on wet hair though.  </li>
            <li> once i sprayed it i automatically disliked the smell and once i sprayed it, it turned my hair feel gross and didn&#x27;t like that..</li>
            <li> I like the wet curly look</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t mind taking the extra few minutes to use the product</li>
            <li> The smell is nothing like the other Aussie hairspray I tried a few years back.</li>
            <li> The previous hairspray that I was trying has such an awful smell but the smell of this Aussie hairspray is so pleasant.</li>
            <li> I have also used this hairspray when I slightly tease my hair for a little extra volume.</li>
            <li> A little went a long way and it held my bun in place for hours.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t flake and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that doesn&#x27;t last long in any style but this spray defiantly held it together!</li>
            <li> I was using other hairsprays that were supposed to be extreme hold but by 3:30, I&#x27;m having my bangs start to fall into my eyes.</li>
            <li> This hairspray helps keep the curl for a lot longer than any other hair spray I have tried.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my biggest problem with other brands of hairspray.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t smell like alcohol like some other sprays.</li>
            <li> : it&#x27;s a little on the sticky side, but I still used it everyday for a week and will definitely be using it again!</li>
            <li> I am used to using half a bottle of hairspray to get my hair to stay put, but with this Freeze hairspray, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it feels a little heavy overall and can make my hairstyle drag a little.</li>
            <li> but, other then that thumbs down</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little sticky when it is wet.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use the hair spray when I wear my hair down, as it definitely has a very stiff hold, but this will be my go to product when I am wearing it up or in a style that needs to stay put.</li>
            <li> I have been using Aussie Instant Freeze aerosol hair spray for at least 6 months now.</li>
            <li> (My hair is dark brown)</li>
            <li> Bet you gals are putting too much on your hair and in the wrong places.  </li>
            <li> I have wavy thick hair but currently have a perm.</li>
            <li> It holds my thick curls ALL day even with walking outside alot.  </li>
            <li> and I would hands down recommend it.</li>
            <li> I toned it down with a damp rag and all was well again.</li>
            <li> Holds my style and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> Hands down for the price, amount given and quality I give it a 8.</li>
            <li> , I recommend it but just keep in mind it wont smell like other Aussie products, but it does get the job done!</li>
            <li> It is EXTREME hold!</li>
            <li> It makes my dead hair have extreme volume.</li>
            <li> and this does freeze it into place well without the sticky mess from some other hairspray products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for around 6 months previous to receiving it for review.</li>
            <li> I imagine that you could use this with an updo with little to no movement.</li>
            <li> With this hairspray, I can get my curls to stay a little bit longer than with anything else.  </li>
            <li> I work in a heavy wind area and wear my hair up often.  </li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t use it for everyday use but a few times a week.</li>
            <li> The product did work, the curl stayed in all day without a bunch of flyaways and it didn&#x27;t have a heavy smell to it either.</li>
            <li> Usually a few hrs</li>
            <li> This give the root-end a stronger dose of the product and the root is a firm hold but not the hair on top.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was slightly concerned from the beginning that this product would make my hair hard and crunchy like other products have in the past</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a hairspray that will offer the hold I need without looking stiff or greasy.</li>
            <li> or if you like that stiff look just keep applying</li>
            <li> They hold without being stiff or sticky</li>
            <li> They hold without being stiff or sticky</li>
            <li> Since I am a fan of hair spray yet wAnt flexible hold nothing stiff.</li>
            <li> The smell lingered for so long and gave me such a bad headache that I swore I would never use it again.</li>
            <li> hair.there was no exp date,although I m not sure if it should.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Aussie haircare products in the past</li>
            <li> I like my perm because I usually just mousse it</li>
            <li> It is a go-to spray on days when I want to wear my hair out but am not really sure what to do with my hair.</li>
            <li> I usually have to use a ton of bobby pins</li>
            <li> So I was anxious to get this from Influenster.</li>
            <li> but it appears now they have done something to the new formula and it stinks, too, too weak.  </li>
            <li> ; I don&#x27;t like hard stiff holding spray!</li>
            <li> Plus, my hair didn&#x27;t look hard or greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I have thick frizzy hair and this keeps the frizz under control</li>
            <li> When they say freeze, they truly mean frozen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other aerosol hair sprays and they smell horrific but Aussie is different.</li>

            <li> Use it when i go to work to hold down any fly away&#x27;s that may occur, did an awesome job of it. I love that it didn&#x27;t make my hair feel stiff and hard, but still held my hair like it should. It has a great smell and isn&#x27;t sticky either. This might just be my new hairspray!</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray the smell is amazing and it truly works!  My brother had an outdoor wedding in the mountains this weekend and the wind was blowing full strength.  My hair still looked great.  The wind didn&#x27;t stand a chance.  I received so many compliments on my hair and pictures turned out great.  Its very rare that barrel curls hold up to the wind and don&#x27;t look a mess but this Aussie Instant Freeze did the trick!</li>
            <li> Good flexible hold. Nice scent. I used this spray to set my hair. It held up well under the high humidity where I live. I was impressed with how long it lasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested this product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a hairspray that will offer the hold I need without looking stiff or greasy. Instant freeze is it! I have a lot of baby/flyaway hairs. I sprayed on some instant freeze, pushed them down, and they stayed there... all day! It was a miracle! Plus, my hair didn&#x27;t look hard or greasy at all. I think I&#x27;ve found my new favorite hairspray!!</li>
            <li> This stuff works so great! I&#x27;m so glad I got it</li>
            <li> I love this product! Instant freeze is the most appropriate name because this hair spray does just that, instantly freezes your hairstyle in place and lasts all day! I also found that this product does not leave a sticky or flaky residue on your hair in between washes and this is great for an on the go girl like me who doesn&#x27;t have time for daily washes.</li>
            <li> I love the Instant Freeze.  I use it when my 4 year old has recitals and dance competitions.  It really does keep her hair in place while she is warming up and doing her routine.  I loved it! No flyaways or strays.  Just a perfect ballerina bun.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice smell and the odor is not too overwhelming.  I felt safe using on my daughter - just made sure her eyes were shut tight.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little sticky when it is wet.  I just made sure it dried before anything touched her hair.&lt;br /&gt;Aussie is a permanent fixture in her dance bag now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> Great for windy days. This is perfect hairspray for styles you don&#x27;t want to move, however it is rather sticky.</li>
            <li> I absolutely have fallen in love with this hair spray. The scent alone is worth the buy. I have received so many compliments since I started using it. I do a lot of curling with my hair and I&#x27;m always hoping for a hair spray that will hold my curls, but leave them free and flowing. Aussie instant freeze is the hairspray that does that for me. I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I this product after I straighten my hair. I straighten then I make a side part (naturally middle) and I tease my hair to give it a high sleek looking bob. What I like about the hairspray is the smell is not over powering at all, and I also like that the spray didn&#x27;t clump up so it aerosols with no clumps. I did notice if you over brush it after it will flake up but that usually is the case with most hairsprays so no big deal. I would definitely recommend this product and also I would repurchase this product when I run out</li>
            <li> Wow! I absolutely love this hairspray!! The mist from the aerosol is very fine and you don&#x27;t have to worry about it soaking your hair. It has a very nice, clean scent, not overpowering like most, the hold is fabulous!! It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling like straw, and it leaves a nice shine to your hair!</li>
            <li> working in a kitchen its important to keep your hair in place my hair smells great and stays out of the food always defifnitely reccomend it!!</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair so it doesn&#x27;t take much for it to become frizzy but with this hairspray it literally freezes my curls in place and I don&#x27;t have to worry about my hair frizzing out by the end of the day I&#x27;ll say that&#x27;s pretty awesome!</li>
            <li> This is a great hairspray for the price point. It worked just as well as my $9.00 a can regular hairspray that I normally purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this in my VOXBOX and I will be getting more.&lt;br /&gt; Both myself and my daughter have naturally curly hair and it held our curls in place all day without weighing them down or making them crunchy.</li>
            <li> This will keep your hair in place!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this hairspray most on my straight hair days as I have a short style that needs lift. This hairspray has the excellent hold I have come to depend on from my Big Sexy hairspray I typically use, but at a much better price! My only complaint is that it feels a little heavy overall and can make my hairstyle drag a little. I just have to use a little more restraint in spraying! I think I would buy this one again!</li>
            <li> I got to try this product as part of a promotion to test the product and received it free in return for my opinion of the product. I use hairspray on a daily basis  and am always trying new brands but this is one of the best hairsprays I have tried thus far. I have very curly and frizzy hair that does not stay well depending on what kind of weather we are having. I have problems with fly aways and always have trouble keeping my hair where I want it to stay. This product worked wonders for my hair and it held my hair up under any circumstances. No matter if I put my hair up and needed areas of it to stay slicked down or had my hair fixed down and needed it to not flair out it always stayed in place and the hairspray held up all day without me having to re-spray my hair several times a day! I will now be purchasing this product from now on  to use in my daily hair routine. Another great product from a great brand!</li>
            <li> This holds my hair in place all day I have the wavy puffy kind of hair so this is the best and didn&#x27;t take a whole lot of spray to get the job done</li>
            <li> This spray is great for strong hold of your shape. When it says freeze spray it means it. It can be very stiff if you use too much because it is meant to hold particular styles well.&lt;br /&gt;Depending on how much product you use you can have a light spray or if you like that stiff look just keep applying and eventually it will get there, but really these products aren&#x27;t made for that. They hold without being stiff or sticky which is what I like about them.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this product. Hairstyles change now with all the natural looks it&#x27;s nice to see a company with a product that still holds very well. This is a great styling product it allows you to make wonderful hairstyles without fear of them falling or having a lot of fly aways.&lt;br /&gt;Also with this product it has that wonderful Aussie scent. I&#x27;ve used this product or another of their line since I was a teenager and I&#x27;m 32 now. Aussie makes quality hair care products at very reasonable prices and I don&#x27;t feel as if they are any less than the salons products. In my opinion I find them higher quality because they not only have quality, scent, but a great price. Which adds up to a great product deal!</li>
            <li> This is really a maximum hold spray.  It works very well with my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I m use to using the aussie max hold sun touched aussie hair spray.which is amazing however with the extra humity las vegas has been having I used the instant freeze from a women in the ladies room one day and it seemed to hold better.But this exact instant freeze  product left an immedate white film on my hair as well as,other friends of mine with different type hair.there was no exp date,although I m not sure if it should.</li>
            <li> This hair spray is not playing around. When they say freeze, they truly mean frozen. I do my hair up in a pompadour and a pony tail almost ever day for work and since I&#x27;ve started using this hairspray, My hair stays put until well after I get home. Really, they product stays put until I wash my hair. I was using other hairsprays that were supposed to be extreme hold but by 3:30, I&#x27;m having my bangs start to fall into my eyes. This is one of my biggest pet peeves. Lol.  Bottom line, this product works exactly how it promises and it smells great to boot. lol I have no reservations about recommending this to anyone. I did test this product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Instant Freeze, indeed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is pretty straight and normal. I don&#x27;t do much with it generally, other than brush it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend did my hair in elaborate curls in an updo. Even after a long night of dancing, my hair still looked perfect when I got home. I truly couldn&#x27;t believe it! My hair never holds curl well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of using lots of product and getting that hairspray residue goo, a light mist of this is really all you need. I&#x27;m really shocked. I would recommend it to anyone needing to hold their hair in place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used this product.  It has great hold.</li>
            <li> Love this product- consistently effective. Spray light because it is strong. Clean nozzle opening on occasion.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! I received it complimentary for free as a testing/review product and it&#x27;s amazing! It keeps your hair in place all day! It&#x27;s perfect for weddings, proms, when you want your hair to stay in place!</li>
            <li> The best freeze spray ever! I have a bob hair cut so it&#x27;s important to keep that stack in its place on windy days. Yes, it&#x27;s a little rough to brush out if you brush your hair later but it washes out clean and easy. I love the hold and the smell is always an added bonus!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Aussie haircare products in the past so I already was a fan for a while now. I was recently sent more from Influenster for free in return for my honest review on Aussie.com and Amazon.com.    Instant Freeze does exactly that. Freezes your hair right where it is. This spray has a great smell. While it does instantly freeze it does not make your hair untouchable. I particularly love it because it manages those fly-aways very well.Depending on how much product you use you can have a light spray or if you like that stiff look just keep applying and eventually it will get there, but really these products aren&#x27;t made for that. They hold without being stiff or sticky which is what I like about them.    I absolutely love this product. Hairstyles change now with all the natural looks it&#x27;s nice to see a company with a product that still holds very well. This is a great styling product it allows you to make wonderful hairstyles without fear of them falling or having a lot of fly aways. Also with this product it has that wonderful Aussie scent.    Again, received free sample but was already a fan of Aussie products on my own. I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I love and have always loved Aussie Hair products but my favorite is the Instant Freeze aerosol hairspray. I recently cut my hair short and this is the only product my hair needs! It holds my style all day with no need to re-apply! It smells good too!</li>
            <li> I have thick frizzy hair and this keeps the frizz under control</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray. I love the smell and it is really an extreme hold. It lasts all day and my hair really stays in place. I love it. I got to text it out complimentary from influenster. This is Mallary Cline</li>
            <li> Gave this Aussie product the ultimate test today after receiving my free influenster sample... It holds up to its name &amp;#34;Instant Freeze&amp;#34; as it held my fishtail braid in ALL day with very minimal fly - aways! With curly hair I am used to freaking with frizz but with Aussie Instant Freeze it did what it was suppose to do - hold every hair in place even among all the craziness of the day!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Aussie instant freeze spray! It will keep my hairstyle perfect. Even in a tornado! LOL LOVE ME SOME AUSSIE! tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I work in a heavy wind area and wear my hair up often.  I usually have tons of fly aways until I started using this product!  It really does hold your hair in place.  No more searching for a good hairspray for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products for testing purposes.  I tested the product at no cost and the opinions stated in this review are my own.</li>
            <li> I received Aussie Instant Freeze complimentary as part of a customer test. First, I was very happy with the way the product smelled; it wasn&#x27;t over-powering and seemed to last throughout the day, making me feel like my hair was still clean and fresh. The hairspray has great hold. I imagine that you could use this with an updo with little to no movement. I put my hair up in a bun and it stayed put throughout the entire day as well as when I was driving with my windows open. I won&#x27;t use the hair spray when I wear my hair down, as it definitely has a very stiff hold, but this will be my go to product when I am wearing it up or in a style that needs to stay put.</li>
            <li> Not a hair out of place with this hairspray! I received this from &amp;#34;influenster&amp;#34; and I am very pleased!!</li>
            <li> Aussie instant freeze is Amazing! A little went a long way and it held my bun in place for hours. It definitely froze my hair in place just as the name stated. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I recieved this as a product sample from Influenster. I decided to put this hairspray to the test, and use it on my hair for a wedding I was going too. I needed it to have long lasting hold as it was a formal wedding, I was going to dance, and i had to get there early for pictures. The name holds true as it really does freeze. A little bit goes a long way, and my hair stayed in place all night long. It really males hair stiff,  so i think it would be best used after hair is styled. Not sprayed, and then curled. Over all, its my new go to product! Yay!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s easy to use, and I don&#x27;t have to keep worrying about what my hair looks like during the day. I have incorporated it into my daily routine, spraying my hair before I head out the door for work. Since I like to straighten my hair the night before, this helps keep it straight in the morning so I&#x27;m ready to go.     Disclosure: I received this spray to test out (complimentary).</li>
            <li> I love the instant freeze hair spray for styles I need to stay put for a long period of time. And for a bonus...It smells AMAZING! I&#x27;ve tried other aerosol hair sprays and they smell horrific but Aussie is different. I&#x27;ve never had an issue with their products.</li>
            <li> both my wife and I use and love this product. Very strong hold. I wear a pompadour and it holds super strong. Great stuff. Tip gets clogged up cause its like glue but other than that, very happy</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I have pretty fine hair and side swept bangs so the tend to move around and with this hairspray they stay in place all day long. I have also used this hairspray when I slightly tease my hair for a little extra volume. Overall I think this product is amazing and I would hands down recommend it. I tested this product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I am an avid hair spray user, and I find that not all hair sprays work well with my hair type (wavy and thick).  I am very pleased to say that this hairspray holds up pretty well in my normal day to day.  If I&#x27;m able to keep my hair in place for 6 hours then I&#x27;m happy, and Aussie seems to meet my requirements, especially for my hair :)  It is an excellent product and very reasonably priced.  I will plan to use this product again in the future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did test this product at no cost, but my opinions are my own and not influenced by anyone.</li>
            <li> This is the only hairspray I buy because I don&#x27;t have to use very much. It is highly affective and a little goes a long way. But, it is drying. I think probably all hairsprays do that though.</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. But!!! I&#x27;ve been using it for around 6 months previous to receiving it for review. I started trying Aussie with the 3 min. miracle and fell in love wit this brand. So I went ahead and bought the hair spray which is very affordable and great quality for the price. I use it after I curl my hair with the wand, to hold my curls without looking stiff and they last all day long. It has a pleasant scent, not too strong. I definitely recommend it, I really like this product!</li>
            <li> Have been using the Aussie brand since I was in high school and fell in love due to the smell of the products, have been using a different hair spray from their line that I love so I got this recently and like it, does its job which is A+ the only reason why I do not give it 5 stars is that this one product does not smell that good I do not know why all other products smell good except for this, I recommend it but just keep in mind it wont smell like other Aussie products, but it does get the job done! I use it when I curl my hair so that the curls stay in place all day. I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> For those gusty windy days Aussie Instant Freeze can not be beat! Living in a gusty wind area on the edge of the Mojave Desert, could not live without it!</li>
            <li> I have been using Aussie Instant Freeze aerosol hair spray for at least 6 months now. I was recently sent more from Influenster for free in return for my honest review on Aussie.com and Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instant Freeze does exactly that. Freezes your hair right where it is. This spray has a great smell. While it does instantly freeze it does not make your hair untouchable. I particularly love it because it manages those fly-aways very well.&lt;br /&gt;My husband also uses Instant Freeze for his short but growing out hair style.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use Aussie Instant Freeze for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;In addition to Instant Freeze I also use Aussie 3 minute miracle deep conditioner for color treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, received free sample but was already using this product on my own.  I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter is in dance and we need hair products to keep her hair in place. She has frizzy hair so it always ends up frizzing out. I used this on her hair at our fall dance show. I did her hair around 3:00, set up the dance show and by the time the show started at 6:30, her hair was still in place! This hairspray held it in place through all 3 dances! I have to say I am impressed.</li>
            <li> I love this product! The smell lingers and smells so good. With naturally curly hair the hair sprays don&#x27;t make my hair stick together or break off. Would recommend this product to anyone!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My hair is thin, blonde, and curly/wavy so finding a good hair product is extremely difficult to me. The Freeze Spray worked almost too well, lol. I won&#x27;t be using it when I wear my hair down, but will definitely be using it every time I wear my hair in an updo. On my down hair it held super well, to the point that when I flipped my head back up I thought I was in an 80s music video :) I toned it down with a damp rag and all was well again. It surely does the trick for keeping your hair in place! It also has a nice smell without being overbearing. .</li>
            <li> I love hairspray that &#x27;freezes&#x27; my hair once I get it fixed &amp; this hairspray does just that. Love it.</li>
            <li> I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. This is such a great hair spray to give you the firm hold you need. When I have to go to a function that requires me to dress up and look top notch, I always use this hairspray to ensure that my hair will stay in place from the time I leave my home to the time I arrive at my destination. This hold in this hairspray allows me to drive on the highway with the windows down and walk outside on extremely windy days without an ounce of worry that my hair will get messed up. I like the fact that this product is in an aerosol can as well which centralizes the spray&#x27;s flow on where you&#x27;re targeting the spray to go on your head. I utilize this product in my daughter&#x27;s hair as well for her photo shoots and it also holds up to all the outdoor elements she&#x27;s experienced during the shoot. Can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product!</li>
            <li> I have wavy thick hair but currently have a perm. I like my perm because I usually just mousse it and I&#x27;m good to go. I tried this product after my mousse to give it that extra hold. I have awesome curls that lasted all day long! It has such great hold I had to shampoo my hair twice to get it all out. That is the only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product via influenster.com as a free trial, and ended up using it on my daugher.  It worked awesome for hairstyles that I wanted to last all day.  Not a hair came out of place!  I did try this product on my own hair, however I wear it down most of the time so I do not necessarily need the freeze hold.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the Aussie Instant Freeze hairspray to test and review.  It has a nice fragrance and it does what it says it will.  It really does instantly freeze your hair.  It doesn&#x27;t hold instantly on wet hair though.  I tried and my curls just have a mind of their own and then freeze .  I have been using this product daily for the last week though as I had a baby last year.  If you&#x27;re wondering why I would mention that I had a baby well here is why.  You lose a lot of your hair after you had a baby and then eventually it starts to grow back.  This results (in my case with curly hair) in wild out of control curls at my hairline.  This would be okay if I wanted to wear a workout headband all the time but I have to work and in a professional setting.  So, I have been using my normal product to style most of my hair but I take care to towel dry my hairline really well.  Then after I styled the rest of my hair.  I can comb my wild hairline curls back, spray with the Instant Freeze and held down for a minute.  They stay put and I they end up laying flay enough to blend in to the rest of my hair.  It does have that hairspray crunch but I achieve the look I am going for and avoid having wild locks!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a strong, very firm hold, this product is for you.  It works great when I wear my hair up.  It keeps every hair in place for a long time. The nozzle has a strong defined spray as opposed to a fine mist.  I have very fine hair, and when I used this while wearing my hair down, it allowed for no natural movement and weighed my hair down.  I don&#x27;t think this will be my go-to hairspray, but a great option on windy or humid days.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Aussie Instant Freeze Hair Spray\\&quot; does exactly what the name says! It will hold your hair in place all day. I have slick straight hair that no matter what I do will not hold a curl. This hairspray helps keep the curl for a lot longer than any other hair spray I have tried. Unlike other hair sprays, the Aussie Instant Freeze has an amazing smell to it! I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a hairspray to hold in curls that you&#x27;ve styled yourself, I don&#x27;t really think this is the best for that. I think its true purpose is to enhance natural waves and curls without having a crunchy or sticky feel. I think it&#x27;s great for my hair which is wavy and tends to frizz up and get puffy. It is a really quick and easy way for a casual hairstyle that isn&#x27;t so forced (the way it might look with stronger hairsprays). It is a go-to spray on days when I want to wear my hair out but am not really sure what to do with my hair. It gives a flexible hold that lasts long and all I do is scrunch it up and toss it around a bit after spraying. It&#x27;s great for what it is supposed to do and I don&#x27;t notice the smell that most have mentioned as being absolutely wonderful or extremely horrid. I can see myself buying it again because although I have some other products that create a similar effect, none of them are meant to be applied to dry hair. Being able to apply it to hair that isn&#x27;t necessarily freshly washed is important because I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday and I don&#x27;t always want to plan my hairstyles in advance. With the Aussie Instant Freeze Hair Spray.  I can reach for it 5 minutes before I leave--it takes less than a minute to spray and quickly scrunch up for an easy hairstyle.</li>
            <li> I received this hairspray for free for testing purposes and I really enjoy it. My place of work requires me to always wear my hair up and this hairspray keeps my fly aways and shorter pieces of hair tame during my entire 9 hour shift and beyond. The smell is pleasant, but not too overwhelming where in lingers in your hair all day. I already was a fan of this brand but I will re purchase this specific type in the future.</li>
            <li> This product is useful to keep a style in place all night long! It was perfect when I went to a wedding but I wouldn&#x27;t use it for everyday use but a few times a week. Smells good and definitely worth having when you need a style to stay in place all day all.</li>
            <li> I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. This is a great spray for keeping down the stray hairs and holding in curls. I tried the product on its own but didn&#x27;t get the results I hoped for. In order to get my desired results I had to use the Aussie Sprunch spray while my hair was damp and then use the Instant Freeze on top of that. My hair didn&#x27;t feel as &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; as I wanted it to, but I haven&#x27;t found products for curly hair yet that do the job and are light at the same time. The product did work, the curl stayed in all day without a bunch of flyaways and it didn&#x27;t have a heavy smell to it either. I will continue to use it on high humidity days and days I just want that extra curl to hang in there for the entire day.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month now and am extremely pleased.  The previous hairspray that I was trying has such an awful smell but the smell of this Aussie hairspray is so pleasant. I gladly replaced the other with this Instant Freeze.  In addition to the great smell, it has great hold and staying power that last all day.  I am very pleased with this product and will continue to use.  I received this originally for testing purposes and all of these opinions are my own.  If you haven&#x27;t tried it yet, you should!</li>
            <li> I have been an Aussie fan and user for 18 years now! I am really impressed with the instant freeze spray. The instant freeze spray keeps my hair in place all day long. The scent is also very flattering without being overpowering. I love it!</li>
            <li> This product really keeps my hair in place!  I was sent this product through Influenster for testing and I am glad I received it.  Humidity and my hair don&#x27;t get along, and usually when its humid by hair goes from curly to a flat, boring wavy.  This product kept my hair going all day long (and I woke up with pretty decent curls the next day too) I love finding new products that work!</li>
            <li> Used this product for trial runs for a wedding and will definitely be using it for the wedding day. Thanks to Influenster for allowing me to test this product. I would recommend it to anyone who needs all day and all night hold.</li>
            <li> first i was excited, i received this product for complimentary testing purposes but, after doing so i wasn&#x27;t happy.. once i sprayed it i automatically disliked the smell and once i sprayed it, it turned my hair feel gross and didn&#x27;t like that.. its good for in a pinch but, other then that thumbs down</li>
            <li> I absolutely just love the smell of Aussie hair care! I received my freeze spray complimentary for testing from Influenster in their Aussie VoxBox, and I must say I am one happy reviewer! I have very thick hair and most sprays I have tried just don&#x27;t hold. Aussie freeze spray does the job!</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray! Not overly sticky. Holds my style and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair. This is my new go to for hairspray!!!</li>
            <li> My hair is frizzy and curly and thick! I did like the hold that this hairspray did have on my hair, however, I did not like how it retained the natural curls that I have and I felt like it didn&#x27;t enhance them for me. However, my husband who really loved the instant freeze on his hair to hold in his styling!</li>
            <li> I tried out this product after I curled my hair. My hair doesn&#x27;t really hold my curls. Usually a few hrs but at the end of the day my hair looks straight. But after I used this hairspray my hair hold on the curls for the whole day I slept with them and woke up with my hair curled. It works :) I tested this product at no cost thanks to influester!</li>
            <li> This hair spray is so amazing. I am normally very picky and have the hardest time finding a hair spray that works well with my wavy hair. I don&#x27;t like the super strong hold that makes my hair stiff. This hair spray was just like the name, you could easily &amp;#34;sprunch&amp;#34; your hair. I love this stuff and plan to continue using it going forward. I also love the Instant freeze hairspray. This stuff is perfect for when you need a style to stay put. I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, it doesn&#x27;t only hold your hairstyle without the crunchy hard feeling, it keeps it&#x27;s bounce and volume plus has a good scent, like other Aussie products.</li>
            <li> The Aussie Instant Freeze hair spray is my favorite hair spray on the market! I will buy it whether I have a coupon or not because I have not been able to find a hair spray that lasts all day long like this one does. It has a great smell to it and it doesn&#x27;t flatten your hair style or leave it feeling sticky or extremely stiff. It&#x27;s very inexpensive and you get excellent quality on top of it.   This product was tested at no cost; this is just my opinion.</li>
            <li> I live in Texas and we are known for our big hair! I have no volume, unfortunately. I tease my hair after I straighten it so I can create the volume my hair does not have. I love how this hairspray keeps my volume all day without leaving my hair stiff or sticky. I would recommend this product for hold!</li>
            <li> I loved how this hairspray literally froze my style all day long! I am used to using half a bottle of hairspray to get my hair to stay put, but with this Freeze hairspray, a little goes a long way! I loved the aerosol can as well, makes it so much easier to use! Downside: it&#x27;s a little on the sticky side, but I still used it everyday for a week and will definitely be using it again! (I tested this product at no cost, but all opinions are my own).</li>
            <li> I received this to test complementary of influenster.  I love this hairspray.  It holds my thick curls ALL day even with walking outside alot.  My hair stays bouncy and light, curls up like normal and stays that way.  I recommend it!</li>
            <li> This left my hair a little too crunchy for my liking.&lt;br /&gt;I received the Aussie Instant Freeze Hair Spray to test, but these are my opinions.</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I LOVE this product because it does exactly what it it says on the label. I usually have to use a ton of bobby pins but now I don&#x27;t have to! I have very thick hair and this does freeze it into place well without the sticky mess from some other hairspray products!</li>
            <li> I used this amazing instant freeze hairspray to tease my hair. I absolutely loved the results I got. It truly is instant freeze. It smells great too! Another thing I loved about it is instead of having to wash it out it brushed out leaving no residue. That&#x27;s my biggest problem with other brands of hairspray. I would recommend this to anyone. I tested this product for free but the opinion is mine.</li>
            <li> I love this spray its smells so good and leaves my hair just as I like it. It doesn&#x27;t flake and a little goes a long way. The size also is as plus and you can&#x27;t beat the prize</li>
            <li> Best product for thin hair. It makes my dead hair have extreme volume. What fly aways dont have no more.. I use it mostly every day. No residues and the smell is amazing. Recommend for any one. The price is economic and a littile spray goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair curly a lot and I love curling my hair but not everyday&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t like hard stiff holding spray! Au tried Instafreeze on my curls and even though it did not hold my curls at their original state it still fell into a nice curl that did hold. I did use rollers on those curls so I will try again with a curling iron and see how that works. Overall I liked that Insta freeze was not hard and crunchy and it smelled nice as well!</li>
            <li> This hairspray is nothing less than amazing! I&#x27;ll never use another again. It holds like no other! 👍👍👍</li>
            <li> This hairspray quickly became my new favorite hair item.  It has a great hold, especially for my curly hair and such high humidity.  I was really impressed that the hairspray does not leave any white residue or flakes.  It makes my ponytail look impeccable and rids of any flyaways.  I tested this product at no cost, but all the opinions stated are my own.</li>
            <li> Aussie Instant Freeze worked wonders  . I like the wet curly look and it held it  in place all day and by the end of the night it still looked like it did when I started that morning. On a windy day it also held there was no little hairs sticking up even with the wind. The smell of  the hairspray  is good  and isn&#x27;t over powering like some. I received a sample of the Aussie Instant Freeze hairspray to test and review.</li>
            <li> This spray is amazing at &amp;#34;freezing&amp;#34; your hair in place! When I put my hair up and don&#x27;t want it to move, this is what I rely on! You only need a light spray because it can leave little bitty white spray dots in your hair. (My hair is dark brown) The smell is meh but it works!</li>
            <li> It has a great hold, however once it is in, it isn&#x27;t going anywhere. Long-lasting and humidity-resistant!</li>
            <li> Loved this hair spray. It does what it says, it holds the hair in place. Especially with ppl with curly hair. I have really curly hair and it helps with all the frizz</li>
            <li> I like the scent of this hairspray it doesn&#x27;t smell like alcohol like some other sprays. It does hold instantly but it is sticky while applying so I don&#x27;t really like it. I would use it again but it wont be my first choice. &amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My very thin, fine hair needed a boost so I tried a VERY expensive hairspray (around $20) on a reccomendation, and I loved it... but not the price. On a whim I tried Aussie Instant Freeze aerosol and it was practically the same hairspray at less than a quarter of the price. My highest praise about this product is two-fold: it never ways down my super thin hair and it washes out like a dream - no build-up!! It literally gave life to my lifeless hair.</li>
            <li> So I received the Aussie Instant Freeze Hair Spray to test and see if I liked it and if it worked for my hair type. I first used it the night of my friends bachelorette party. I curled my hair (which is super straight and heavy) with my wand and waited for it to cool I then sprayed my hair so that the curls could hold. Mind you I have tried this before with various hair sprays and some have worked and many more haven&#x27;t, my hair does not hold that well, a couple hours into the night the curls will start to unravel.  I have to say that this hair spray did work very well, I was out till 4am and the curls were still going and looking great! I was pretty excited and stoked to see that I could count on a product to keep me looking cute : )</li>
            <li> I received a free sample to try and review. This is by far one of the bests hair sprays I have used. It literally is an instant freeze. It gets all the little fly away hairs and secures them in place. I can pull my curly hair back and spray a little on to make sure I have a clean looking style all day. Will definitely be purchasing this hair spray as my go to style hold product.</li>
            <li> This product has become a staple at our house.  After trying many products to controls my sons hair, I have finally found THE ONE!  I have tried gel, mousse, and many hair sprays.  Most either couldn&#x27;t control the cow licks or left their hair crunchy and with thick white film.  I have found that Aussie instant freeze controls the style without leaving the white film and lasts all day.  The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming either (which is nice for boys hair)!  I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> the spray is pretty flexible depending on the amount applied to the hair! it is mostly intended for naturally curly hair. it didn&#x27;t seem to hold the curls very well when i curled my hair but when i sprayed my natural curly hair it held my curls perfectly. i would recommend this product to women with natural curls. also... it smells incredibly yummy.</li>
            <li> This has been one of the best hairsprays I&#x27;ve used! I&#x27;m usually very picky when it comes to hairspray because it&#x27;s always so hard to find one that has great hold, doesn&#x27;t flake or get crusty, holds for long periods of time, is flexible to style but still holds up, and is a great value. This one does it all! It has amazing hold that last all day long and doesn&#x27;t give you that super crunchy heavy feel. I actually used this hairspray for my sons hair on cray hair day at school. He&#x27;s a preschooler who is always on the move and he came home at the end of the day and his hair was the same way I had styled it that morning! It works amazingly and this will definitely be my new go to hairspray. I have tried many and none were as great as this one. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Hold is what we gals mostly desire.  Bet you gals are putting too much on your hair and in the wrong places.  Firstly, if you think it is TOO hardish, do this &amp;#62;&amp;#62;  after it is ready to be sprayed spray the product in you hand and take your hand andrub it through you hair at the roots, do this three (3) times and you won&#x27;t get the impact of the actual Aussie Instant Freeze.  If you feel that is too light try this carefully now spray the front root of head by separating the hair easily.  This give the root-end a stronger dose of the product and the root is a firm hold but not the hair on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I love the stuff - used to use Focus which was great years ago but it appears now they have done something to the new formula and it stinks, too, too weak.  You can purchase Aussie at Walmarts for $2.97 for a 7 oz. can.</li>
            <li> I tried Aussie hairspray 1 other time and hated it. The smell lingered for so long and gave me such a bad headache that I swore I would never use it again. UNTIL, I got this hairspray to try and review from Influenster. I am IN LOVE with this hairspray. The smell is nothing like the other Aussie hairspray I tried a few years back. The hold is amazing! When it says &amp;#34;Instant Freeze&amp;#34; it&#x27;s not kidding! I have very fine, stick straight hair and find that it doesn&#x27;t hold curl well at all. So, to put this hairspray to the test I curled my hair and it lasted all day long!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I also liked that when you spray this hairspray it has a stickyness to it. But i like that because i&#x27;m able to feel where I put the hairspray and if I had missed spraying any curls. When it dries, it dries in the exact position that you sprayed it. Very awesome hairspray and one that I will for sure purchase again!</li>
            <li> I was given this hair spray in my influenster box to try out for free. I think it works great as a hair spray. I wish they kept the sweet smell from years ago. I loved the old smell but I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the new smell.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says! It is amazing! It holds my curls all day and doesn&#x27;t have that awful hairspray smell! I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and I will definitely buy it again! Love it!</li>
            <li> Its a great hold as far as the product, my husband loves it BUT the nozzle tends to get clogged and needs to be soaked before the next use</li>
            <li> This hairspray works miracles for updos!!!  Not a single hair out of place all night long!!  This is most definitely a miracle product :)</li>
            <li> This is the BEST hairspray I have ever used in my life! It is EXTREME hold! I have super straight hair and this hairspray allows me to curl, tease, whatever I want.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! I have curly hair that is just God awful sometimes. Between the humidity and the constant weather change my hair is a hot mess. With this product I&#x27;ve been able to manage my hair so much easier. I am so thankful for this product and everyone should try it.  &amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is an awesome spray for very polished looks or also great to keep a teeze in place. I love the smell of all aussie products...ive used the shampoos, conditioners, and different hairsprays. Definitely a good one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always in the market for a new hairspray. As a person with African American curly hair, the frizz, the fuzz, the flyaways....enough said. So I was anxious to get this from Influenster. First off let me say that the smell is interesting. In one whiff it smells good and then another it smells bad. I think I like it but it&#x27;s not the best they&#x27;ve done scent wise. Now on use. Meh, its a hairspray. It has ok hold, didn&#x27;t last alllllll day but it held a curl very well while it was holding. Overall for the price, it&#x27;s fine. Would I recommend it? Sure. It&#x27;s a great drugstore brand but I don&#x27;t think I would buy it.</li>
            <li> Hands down for the price, amount given and quality I give it a 8. Since I am a fan of hair spray yet wAnt flexible hold nothing stiff. The smell can improve however.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the perfect strong hold! I have thick hair that doesn&#x27;t last long in any style but this spray defiantly held it together! It literally freezed it in place!</li>
            <li> Aussie Freeze Hair Spray is a fantastic product. I&#x27;ve been using Aussie Products for 18 years because it holds my hair the way I want it. I tried Aussie Instant Freeze Hair spray for the first time in my years of Aussie Products, and enjoyed every bit of it. I sprayed my hair when it&#x27;s wet and curly, it holds and lifts my hair to keep it looking nice through out the day and night. You don&#x27;t need to spray all that much for it to quickly &amp;#34;Freeze&amp;#34; it in place. Sometimes I won&#x27;t wash it out for my early morning wake ups that night and leave it in while I sleep, I&#x27;ll wake up that next morning to it still the same way, with a little bed head, but I spray a little water to fix the bed head and My hair is perfect the next day. Easy for an early morning fix! It is the only spray that effectively manages my style without a sticky residue. Every other hair spray takes multiple layers of product to do what Aussie does in one application. The smell of Aussie Instant Freeze Hair spray is amazing! So refreshing. It doesn&#x27;t smell like all those nasty Lacquer smelling Hair sprays. Best Hair spray on the market! &amp;#34;I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love it it is not heavy feeing doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel greasy or starchy it smells good not over powering gives a good hold when I curl my hair I will spray it first on the area then curl and when I&#x27;m all finished spray all over I like the holding it very good product  I tested the product at no cost to me but all my opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I was slightly concerned from the beginning that this product would make my hair hard and crunchy like other products have in the past however I was pleasantly surprised that it did not. It helped my curls stay curls throughout the day and helped to keep some of the frizz. I love this product and everything about it. I rarely wear my hair curly because by the end of the day they don&#x27;t look good but with this product my hair looked great after a long day! So maybe I will wear my hair curly more often!! :)</li>
            <li> The name says it all.  This is wonderful hairspray.  Kept my frizzes at bay whenever I have an updo.  I did not even need to worry about my hair all day.  It stayed in place.  I like this hairspray better than my salon hairspray (which I have been using for years!).  I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> This is does exactly as it says!  One of the best hair sprays I&#x27;ve used, especially for being an aerosol. It also does not have that typical&amp;#34; hair spray&amp;#34;  smell it smelled really good. It held my hair all day during a kindergarten carnival as well as my 5yr olds hair all day during dance! It has done well for updos, curls,and was great for &amp;#34;fly aways&amp;#34;  didn&#x27;t even notice them.  It is amazing I&#x27;ll be a forever changer to Aussie!</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.  I started using it in the mornings, especially when my hair was pulled up into a high bun.  I usually have several bobby pins in the back where my hair is a little too short and falls out throughout the day.  I figured I would try spraying it and I got away with 1 single bobby pin.  Everything else just stayed exactly where it was in the morning.  I was super excited!  I even slept with it like that, and it looked exactly the same in the morning.</li>
            <li> I like to use this hairspray on a daily basis - my hair is very thin and fine and doesn&#x27;t hold curl or shape for anything.  With this hairspray, I can get my curls to stay a little bit longer than with anything else.  I also like to use it when I do updo&#x27;s because it gives it a long lasting freeze!</li>
            <li> I am enjoying the Aussie Instant Freeze Hair Spray! It allows me to mix up my hair for work and special occasions. Before using the Instant Freeze Hair Spray, my hair was just blah! Now I don&#x27;t mind taking the extra few minutes to use the product and I enjoy the new ways I can do my hair. I like that it does not make my hair look or feel oily as well. I tested this product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> This hair spray does what the name promises.If you don&#x27;t like crunchy this is not for you but that is exactly what I needed. Love it.</li>
