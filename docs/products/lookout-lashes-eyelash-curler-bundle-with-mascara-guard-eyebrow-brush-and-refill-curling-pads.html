            <li>it&#x27;s OK but nothing special.</li>

            <li>My lashes are long but super straight, so its perfect for me.</li>
            <li>I was not wearing mascara my lashes were clean.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite eyelash curler yet!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t as lucky in having long and voluminous eyelashes, so having a tool that can help me accomplish a look of fuller and longer eyelashes makes me happy.</li>
            <li>Most eyelash curlers are not this large.</li>
            <li>Made very well and love the color.</li>
            <li>most eyelash curlers leave the outer lashes hanging and straight, this one grabs them all).</li>
            <li>I have seen the black kind before which will also brush our your eyebrows, but never the kind like the pink one also enclosed and that works GREAT</li>
            <li>In the mean time any helpful feedback would be great!  </li>
            <li>If you have long lashes, it&#x27;s important to brush them before curling, so the included brush is a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;The mascara shield is nicely designed and works well, and is a must when using waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li>First, let me just say how I love that it&#x27;s bright pink.</li>
            <li>I give this eyelash curler 5 stars, because it arrived quickly and just as described.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps it would work better for someone with short lashes and not so many.</li>
            <li>but I love that they add so many extra cushions for it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You get a whole bag of replacement silicone cushions that are super easy to change out--making this like getting 10 eyelash</li>
            <li>I tried the new one and it was much better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been applying mascara without any extra tool for 50 years, so I&#x27;m pretty good at it now.  </li>
            <li>I am a professional make-up artist where my work is displayed on Television screens and Theater screens and I only want the best for my high profile clients.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much better this eyelash curler is than my old one!</li>
            <li>The curling pad(s) are amazingly soft, and the grip is also very comfortable and user-friendly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to go back to the mascara guard and say this is the best thing I&#x27;ve ordered in a very long time!  </li>
            <li>It is smooth, gentle, and works effortlessly.</li>
            <li>No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned after testing.&lt;br /&gt;Views and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest and admit that I never considered eyelash curlers to be essential beauty tools.</li>
            <li>She says it&#x27;s the best she&#x27;s ever had, and the pink mascara guard thing she uses religiously instead of having to use qtips to fix her messed up mascara.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wide enough to get all of my lashes at once and curls them perfectly.</li>
            <li>Even if it doesnt work the curler alone is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Far better than any of the pricier ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Comes with extra lash pads, and a handy mascara guard.</li>
            <li>In my honest opinion, there could be some improvements made to the eyelash curler itself; wish it had a spring attachment to keep it open.</li>
            <li>Came quickly and really curls my lashes!</li>
            <li>I use the eyebrow brush to brush them in the right direction</li>
            <li>It provides just the right amount of curl.</li>
            <li>I think I did pretty great, because she uses this eyelash curler everyday.</li>
            <li>curler comes with a mascara guard, which is another handy-dandy tool that quickly became my absolute must-have; an eyebrow brush and a refill of curling pads.</li>
            <li>comes with extra pads so it will literally last forever, the brush isnt all that great</li>
            <li>I think the white foam ones are far superior.</li>
            <li>You really want to be able to control the movement of anything near your eye.</li>
            <li>Really makes your lashes pop out and be bold.</li>
            <li>I had hopes that this would be my new favorite eyelash curler since the ratings were so high, but I am still on the lookout.</li>
            <li>If providing a great lash curler and extra pads weren&#x27;t enough, the manufacturer went further and also included detailed accessories that separate the lashes, and that are great for helping to protect  the under eye concealer,as well as the eyeshadow from any messy mascara.  </li>
            <li>I am a commercial television actress, as well as a HUGE makeup junkie, so when I stumbled across this eyelash curler kit - I just had to try it!</li>
            <li>No fake lashes, no eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, the inner cushion is not rubber like most, but a silicone which seems to give more yet remain solid</li>
            <li>these were suggested, I thought I would give them a try and not only do I LOVE the results I have not pinched my eyelid once.</li>
            <li>My teenage grand daughter loves them</li>
            <li>Thank you to the designers of Lookout Lashes ..it is appreciated !</li>
            <li>With the Lookout Lashes curler, I can achieve a similarly defined look without all the hassle of gluing something on top of my eyelids.</li>
            <li>Used this curler exactly once.</li>
            <li>FIrst off</li>
            <li>Using this in conjunction with the curler gave me longer and fuller lashes probably because in using the mascara guard I was able to put on numerous coats, go from root to tip</li>
            <li>Something in the mechanism just seems more solid and curls my lashes with almost no effort.</li>
            <li>Love the last guard.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s designed to help you get as close to the end of your eyelashes as possible to get a better curl.</li>
            <li>I always get consistent results.  </li>
            <li>When you hold the eyelash curler it seems bigger than most.</li>
            <li>and I love this because it gets every eyelash (since I have big eyes</li>
            <li>Could have purchased a much more inexpensive one in my local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>This kit was not only shipped very professional but the courtesy card attached was nice to see.  </li>
            <li>This cute little set comes with a pretty vibrant pink eyelash curler that works great.</li>
            <li>I love how wide the curler opens so you can see exactly where you are placing it!</li>
            <li>My lashes are impossibly short, so a good set of curlers is essential.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and comes in a cute pink color, I like the few free goodies that comes with!</li>
            <li>The curler has a very flat side which is good for women with asian eyes or eyes that are not too deep-set.</li>
            <li>You can safely place the guard on the lower lashes, right under the lid and freely apply your mascara to give you a thick lower lash effect - AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I definitely don&#x27;t enjoy wearing falsies when it&#x27;s burning hot outside, because they make me feel like a circus escapee</li>
            <li>Love the hot pink color.</li>
            <li>Highly suggest you purchase!</li>
            <li>This one really does stop those problems and gives a visible curl that lasts.</li>
            <li>This kit, coupled with your favorite mascara, is all you need for lovely lashes.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the curler itself is one of the few I&#x27;ve used that did not put that tell-tale kink in the middle of my lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As much as I would like to like this item, I had to return it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found one I like this much.</li>
            <li>My eye lashes looked so much longer after using it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this kit!</li>
            <li>one really does delivery knockout</li>
            <li>I really could even tell any difference</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li>The  Lookout Lashes kit came with everything I needed and made very well.  </li>
            <li>It really does curl my eye lashes well..</li>
            <li>and very chic looking.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a functional and well-designed set of tools, it doesn&#x27;t take up much space at all</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>No big deal just as comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting to purchase a mascara guard but honestly couldn&#x27;t really find anywhere for a low price, as its a simple tool.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really struggled to get it to curl my lashes.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend this kit to anyone looking to purchase a curler because of all the extras you get with it for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>This curls really well.</li>
            <li>Curls lashes without even trying that much.</li>
            <li>The kit includes a purple stainless steel eyelash curler, 8 replacement curler pads, mascara guard and eyebrow/eyelash brush.</li>
            <li>I grip my eyelashes at the very end and hold for about 15 seconds then</li>
            <li>I really like this eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>I really want this to work for me...</li>
            <li>I really like like the guard and the fact</li>
            <li>So much fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>for the curling pad itself, I really like that the rubber isn&#x27;t flimsy.</li>
            <li>Both are removable to fit bigger fingers.</li>
            <li>Ordered these to add to my professional kit wondering if they would make a big difference being that the ones I had cost so much more.</li>
            <li>classes to become a professional make up artist, I have used eyelash curlers before, but I love how this one comes with 8 extra curling pads, and</li>
            <li>Wow I am amazed!!!  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it was just that perhaps I needed new mascara</li>
            <li>There is not really a specific reason I purchased this one other than the good reviews, the price and the extras it came with.</li>
            <li>Not to mention, I love the pink!</li>
            <li>It curls my lashes better than any other curler I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps I just don&#x27;t know how to use an eyelash curler correctly, but this one doesn&#x27;t seem to work any better than other ones I have tried.</li>
            <li>It really stinks when you find a great eyelash curler that you love to use, but it only comes with one replacement pad.</li>
            <li>Most eyelash curlers get gunked up and are hard to clean but this one is so easy to wipe down.</li>
            <li>After that, you either have to purchase a whole new kit  </li>
            <li>this curler does NOT and actually curls quickly and well.  </li>
            <li>I never know if anything will actually work better than the last.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this curler</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>but now I am glad I purchased this little kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am guessing it is because with the shield it allowed me to press in and wiggle the brush more firmer than I could have ever done without it and the guard has little ridges in it which I think aids in lash</li>
            <li>Love this little thing.</li>
            <li>This tool is easy to use, and works faster than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Great for small hands and prevent fingers slipping and pulling your lashes out.&#x27;</li>
            <li>Sometimes it curls them more round</li>
            <li>The only thing I found useful in this set was the eyelash comb.</li>
            <li>It took a few minutes to get the contraption positioned correctly but when I did I was extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how much better it works than my previous eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>With the new curler, I still have pinching problem when I crimp my lashes too close to the root.</li>
            <li>but I bought new mascara.</li>
            <li>so you dont have to keep going to buy new curlers all  the time.  </li>
            <li>An eye lash curler is the ONE accessory/tool I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li>I love how wide it is so it actually gets all of your eyelashes</li>
            <li>The curl lasts all day and is very natural looking.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Being that I do makeup on so many different people I needed something I didn&#x27;t have to make adjustments or have different ones for use to different people.  </li>
            <li>As a former model, and a woman who has used tons of products...I couldn&#x27;t recommend this any higher.</li>
            <li>Love the eyelash curler, not sure about the mascara shield.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I was blessed with good eyelashes (long and thick)</li>
            <li>This is a really good one I have been really into beauty lately bit still little new.</li>
            <li>Overall, I really like this now.</li>
            <li>I forgot to toss my old one after using this for a while.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t get cuts in it but can push enough to create a real curl, truly extending your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also like the fact it came a classy color.</li>
            <li>The eyelash curler gets all of my lashes and as it is wider than my old one the outer lashes curl instead of crimp.</li>
            <li>It actually curls your lashes instead of crimping them to stand up straight.</li>
            <li>It also came with an eyelash and eyebrow comb, lots of extra inserts for the eyelash curlers, and a really neat tool that I&#x27;ve never seen before.</li>
            <li>This curler allows you to be completely in control by offering a fully manual system.</li>
            <li>or you have to scour the shelves/internet for replacement pads only to find they don&#x27;t really sell them.</li>
            <li>This completely replaced all my old ones.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>My favorite part next to not getting my eyes lids pinched is the fact that is also keeps me from getting messy with the mascara.</li>
            <li>I tried the transparent pink protector while applying mascara, but I can&#x27;t say it was significantly helpful (except for reaching the tiny corner lashes on the bottom).  </li>
            <li>This curler works so well..much better than others that have been both less and more expensive.  </li>
            <li>Seller gives you 100% money back guarantee, so I highly recommend this product and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the curler after applying mascara as personally for myself - the lashes tend to stick together and create a huge mess for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None</li>
            <li>I have long straight eyelashes, so I this is a MUST tool for me.</li>
            <li>On top of the extra curling pads you also get  a mascara eye guard that actually prevents your from getting your eyelids messy from the mascara, that for me being a beginner is a bonus.</li>
            <li>Hot pink w rubber inserts in the finger holes.</li>
            <li>Black comb may be useful on occasion - I just haven&#x27;t had an occasion yet.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a simple tool, but really saves you lots of time and frustration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been curling my short, stick straight lashes since I was a teen.</li>
            <li>and I am very conscious of the extra weight.</li>
            <li>all the accessories make it a major bargain at the time of my review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What I do like about this product is the thickness of the rubber, it really triggers the curling action and all the other implements included are a plus.</li>
            <li>Curler is bulky and removes some eyeliner if I&#x27;m not careful how I hold it.</li>
            <li>He also offered to post a video of how to use the Mascara Guard in the near future.  </li>
            <li>This product gave me extra that extra boost to go with my new makeup.  </li>
            <li>I wish the rubber strip was not black - it&#x27;s more difficult to see where my lashes are laying during the curling process.  </li>
            <li>I guess my eye is wide because whatever curler i used left my outer and inner lashes straight.</li>
            <li>Of course, I was wrong, and I realized that when I first used this cool looking little tool, because it really does make a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but when you get the hang of it, it really helps you from having a mess of mascara or hitting yourself on accident with the mascara wand and ruining your makeup.</li>
            <li>I ordered it to get the reasonable supply of refill pads which became hard to find and expensive for my favored Maybelline curler that is less bulky and easier to use.</li>
            <li>It might not seem like a big deal, but having that little bit of extra padding really helps the process.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to used.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s OK but nothing special.</li>

            <li> I never thought about using a blow dryer to warm up the curler so thanks for the bonus instructions.</li>

            <li> This was such a great price and it came with 8 extras for the curler.</li>

            <li> Thank you for creating such an amazing product!</li>
            <li> The extra lash guard is also amazing!</li>
            <li> The design is so well thought out &amp; externally able to still be a pretty item.  </li>
            <li> I am so excited on using these not just on myself</li>
            <li> so I was really excited about this.</li>
            <li> I saw this on amazon review trader and was excited to be approved.</li>
            <li> My lashes are long but super straight, so its perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I was not wearing mascara my lashes were clean.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite eyelash curler yet!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t as lucky in having long and voluminous eyelashes, so having a tool that can help me accomplish a look of fuller and longer eyelashes makes me happy.</li>
            <li> Most eyelash curlers are not this large.</li>
            <li> Made very well and love the color.</li>
            <li> most eyelash curlers leave the outer lashes hanging and straight, this one grabs them all).</li>
            <li> I have seen the black kind before which will also brush our your eyebrows, but never the kind like the pink one also enclosed and that works GREAT</li>
            <li> In the mean time any helpful feedback would be great!  </li>
            <li> If you have long lashes, it&#x27;s important to brush them before curling, so the included brush is a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;The mascara shield is nicely designed and works well, and is a must when using waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> First, let me just say how I love that it&#x27;s bright pink.</li>
            <li> I give this eyelash curler 5 stars, because it arrived quickly and just as described.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps it would work better for someone with short lashes and not so many.</li>
            <li> but I love that they add so many extra cushions for it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You get a whole bag of replacement silicone cushions that are super easy to change out--making this like getting 10 eyelash</li>
            <li> I tried the new one and it was much better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying mascara without any extra tool for 50 years, so I&#x27;m pretty good at it now.  </li>
            <li> I am a professional make-up artist where my work is displayed on Television screens and Theater screens and I only want the best for my high profile clients.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much better this eyelash curler is than my old one!</li>
            <li> The curling pad(s) are amazingly soft, and the grip is also very comfortable and user-friendly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to go back to the mascara guard and say this is the best thing I&#x27;ve ordered in a very long time!  </li>
            <li> It is smooth, gentle, and works effortlessly.</li>
            <li> No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned after testing.&lt;br /&gt;Views and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest and admit that I never considered eyelash curlers to be essential beauty tools.</li>
            <li> She says it&#x27;s the best she&#x27;s ever had, and the pink mascara guard thing she uses religiously instead of having to use qtips to fix her messed up mascara.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wide enough to get all of my lashes at once and curls them perfectly.</li>
            <li> Even if it doesnt work the curler alone is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Far better than any of the pricier ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Comes with extra lash pads, and a handy mascara guard.</li>
            <li> In my honest opinion, there could be some improvements made to the eyelash curler itself; wish it had a spring attachment to keep it open.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and really curls my lashes!</li>
            <li> I use the eyebrow brush to brush them in the right direction</li>
            <li> It provides just the right amount of curl.</li>
            <li> I think I did pretty great, because she uses this eyelash curler everyday.</li>
            <li> curler comes with a mascara guard, which is another handy-dandy tool that quickly became my absolute must-have; an eyebrow brush and a refill of curling pads.</li>
            <li> comes with extra pads so it will literally last forever, the brush isnt all that great</li>
            <li> I think the white foam ones are far superior.</li>
            <li> You really want to be able to control the movement of anything near your eye.</li>
            <li> Really makes your lashes pop out and be bold.</li>
            <li> I had hopes that this would be my new favorite eyelash curler since the ratings were so high, but I am still on the lookout.</li>
            <li> If providing a great lash curler and extra pads weren&#x27;t enough, the manufacturer went further and also included detailed accessories that separate the lashes, and that are great for helping to protect  the under eye concealer,as well as the eyeshadow from any messy mascara.  </li>
            <li> I am a commercial television actress, as well as a HUGE makeup junkie, so when I stumbled across this eyelash curler kit - I just had to try it!</li>
            <li> No fake lashes, no eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the inner cushion is not rubber like most, but a silicone which seems to give more yet remain solid</li>
            <li> these were suggested, I thought I would give them a try and not only do I LOVE the results I have not pinched my eyelid once.</li>
            <li> My teenage grand daughter loves them</li>
            <li> Thank you to the designers of Lookout Lashes ..it is appreciated !</li>
            <li> With the Lookout Lashes curler, I can achieve a similarly defined look without all the hassle of gluing something on top of my eyelids.</li>
            <li> Used this curler exactly once.</li>
            <li> FIrst off</li>
            <li> Using this in conjunction with the curler gave me longer and fuller lashes probably because in using the mascara guard I was able to put on numerous coats, go from root to tip</li>
            <li> Something in the mechanism just seems more solid and curls my lashes with almost no effort.</li>
            <li> Love the last guard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s designed to help you get as close to the end of your eyelashes as possible to get a better curl.</li>
            <li> I always get consistent results.  </li>
            <li> When you hold the eyelash curler it seems bigger than most.</li>
            <li> and I love this because it gets every eyelash (since I have big eyes</li>
            <li> Could have purchased a much more inexpensive one in my local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> This kit was not only shipped very professional but the courtesy card attached was nice to see.  </li>
            <li> This cute little set comes with a pretty vibrant pink eyelash curler that works great.</li>
            <li> I love how wide the curler opens so you can see exactly where you are placing it!</li>
            <li> My lashes are impossibly short, so a good set of curlers is essential.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and comes in a cute pink color, I like the few free goodies that comes with!</li>
            <li> The curler has a very flat side which is good for women with asian eyes or eyes that are not too deep-set.</li>
            <li> You can safely place the guard on the lower lashes, right under the lid and freely apply your mascara to give you a thick lower lash effect - AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I definitely don&#x27;t enjoy wearing falsies when it&#x27;s burning hot outside, because they make me feel like a circus escapee</li>
            <li> Love the hot pink color.</li>
            <li> Highly suggest you purchase!</li>
            <li> This one really does stop those problems and gives a visible curl that lasts.</li>
            <li> This kit, coupled with your favorite mascara, is all you need for lovely lashes.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the curler itself is one of the few I&#x27;ve used that did not put that tell-tale kink in the middle of my lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As much as I would like to like this item, I had to return it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found one I like this much.</li>
            <li> My eye lashes looked so much longer after using it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this kit!</li>
            <li> one really does delivery knockout</li>
            <li> I really could even tell any difference</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> The  Lookout Lashes kit came with everything I needed and made very well.  </li>
            <li> It really does curl my eye lashes well..</li>
            <li> and very chic looking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a functional and well-designed set of tools, it doesn&#x27;t take up much space at all</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> No big deal just as comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to purchase a mascara guard but honestly couldn&#x27;t really find anywhere for a low price, as its a simple tool.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really struggled to get it to curl my lashes.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend this kit to anyone looking to purchase a curler because of all the extras you get with it for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This curls really well.</li>
            <li> Curls lashes without even trying that much.</li>
            <li> The kit includes a purple stainless steel eyelash curler, 8 replacement curler pads, mascara guard and eyebrow/eyelash brush.</li>
            <li> I grip my eyelashes at the very end and hold for about 15 seconds then</li>
            <li> I really like this eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> I really want this to work for me...</li>
            <li> I really like like the guard and the fact</li>
            <li> So much fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> for the curling pad itself, I really like that the rubber isn&#x27;t flimsy.</li>
            <li> Both are removable to fit bigger fingers.</li>
            <li> Ordered these to add to my professional kit wondering if they would make a big difference being that the ones I had cost so much more.</li>
            <li> classes to become a professional make up artist, I have used eyelash curlers before, but I love how this one comes with 8 extra curling pads, and</li>
            <li> Wow I am amazed!!!  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it was just that perhaps I needed new mascara</li>
            <li> There is not really a specific reason I purchased this one other than the good reviews, the price and the extras it came with.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, I love the pink!</li>
            <li> It curls my lashes better than any other curler I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I just don&#x27;t know how to use an eyelash curler correctly, but this one doesn&#x27;t seem to work any better than other ones I have tried.</li>
            <li> It really stinks when you find a great eyelash curler that you love to use, but it only comes with one replacement pad.</li>
            <li> Most eyelash curlers get gunked up and are hard to clean but this one is so easy to wipe down.</li>
            <li> After that, you either have to purchase a whole new kit  </li>
            <li> this curler does NOT and actually curls quickly and well.  </li>
            <li> I never know if anything will actually work better than the last.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this curler</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> but now I am glad I purchased this little kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am guessing it is because with the shield it allowed me to press in and wiggle the brush more firmer than I could have ever done without it and the guard has little ridges in it which I think aids in lash</li>
            <li> Love this little thing.</li>
            <li> This tool is easy to use, and works faster than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Great for small hands and prevent fingers slipping and pulling your lashes out.&#x27;</li>
            <li> Sometimes it curls them more round</li>
            <li> The only thing I found useful in this set was the eyelash comb.</li>
            <li> It took a few minutes to get the contraption positioned correctly but when I did I was extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how much better it works than my previous eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> With the new curler, I still have pinching problem when I crimp my lashes too close to the root.</li>
            <li> but I bought new mascara.</li>
            <li> so you dont have to keep going to buy new curlers all  the time.  </li>
            <li> An eye lash curler is the ONE accessory/tool I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> I love how wide it is so it actually gets all of your eyelashes</li>
            <li> The curl lasts all day and is very natural looking.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Being that I do makeup on so many different people I needed something I didn&#x27;t have to make adjustments or have different ones for use to different people.  </li>
            <li> As a former model, and a woman who has used tons of products...I couldn&#x27;t recommend this any higher.</li>
            <li> Love the eyelash curler, not sure about the mascara shield.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I was blessed with good eyelashes (long and thick)</li>
            <li> This is a really good one I have been really into beauty lately bit still little new.</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like this now.</li>
            <li> I forgot to toss my old one after using this for a while.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t get cuts in it but can push enough to create a real curl, truly extending your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also like the fact it came a classy color.</li>
            <li> The eyelash curler gets all of my lashes and as it is wider than my old one the outer lashes curl instead of crimp.</li>
            <li> It actually curls your lashes instead of crimping them to stand up straight.</li>
            <li> It also came with an eyelash and eyebrow comb, lots of extra inserts for the eyelash curlers, and a really neat tool that I&#x27;ve never seen before.</li>
            <li> This curler allows you to be completely in control by offering a fully manual system.</li>
            <li> or you have to scour the shelves/internet for replacement pads only to find they don&#x27;t really sell them.</li>
            <li> This completely replaced all my old ones.</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> My favorite part next to not getting my eyes lids pinched is the fact that is also keeps me from getting messy with the mascara.</li>
            <li> I tried the transparent pink protector while applying mascara, but I can&#x27;t say it was significantly helpful (except for reaching the tiny corner lashes on the bottom).  </li>
            <li> This curler works so well..much better than others that have been both less and more expensive.  </li>
            <li> Seller gives you 100% money back guarantee, so I highly recommend this product and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the curler after applying mascara as personally for myself - the lashes tend to stick together and create a huge mess for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None</li>
            <li> I have long straight eyelashes, so I this is a MUST tool for me.</li>
            <li> On top of the extra curling pads you also get  a mascara eye guard that actually prevents your from getting your eyelids messy from the mascara, that for me being a beginner is a bonus.</li>
            <li> Hot pink w rubber inserts in the finger holes.</li>
            <li> Black comb may be useful on occasion - I just haven&#x27;t had an occasion yet.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a simple tool, but really saves you lots of time and frustration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been curling my short, stick straight lashes since I was a teen.</li>
            <li> and I am very conscious of the extra weight.</li>
            <li> all the accessories make it a major bargain at the time of my review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I do like about this product is the thickness of the rubber, it really triggers the curling action and all the other implements included are a plus.</li>
            <li> Curler is bulky and removes some eyeliner if I&#x27;m not careful how I hold it.</li>
            <li> He also offered to post a video of how to use the Mascara Guard in the near future.  </li>
            <li> This product gave me extra that extra boost to go with my new makeup.  </li>
            <li> I wish the rubber strip was not black - it&#x27;s more difficult to see where my lashes are laying during the curling process.  </li>
            <li> I guess my eye is wide because whatever curler i used left my outer and inner lashes straight.</li>
            <li> Of course, I was wrong, and I realized that when I first used this cool looking little tool, because it really does make a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but when you get the hang of it, it really helps you from having a mess of mascara or hitting yourself on accident with the mascara wand and ruining your makeup.</li>
            <li> I ordered it to get the reasonable supply of refill pads which became hard to find and expensive for my favored Maybelline curler that is less bulky and easier to use.</li>
            <li> It might not seem like a big deal, but having that little bit of extra padding really helps the process.</li>
            <li> but I find the item so stiff that it doesn&#x27;t seem to apply enough pressure to make much happen.</li>
            <li> I really put this baby to the test when I had a friend of mine with small eyes of a totally different shape try it.  </li>
            <li> eyelashes are pretty long and thick, so I don&#x27;t usually have to wear falsies (unless I am going for a smoky eye look or something very popping!).</li>
            <li> Also, the curler was not curved enough to curl the lashes at the inner and outer part of the eyelid; therefore, only the lashes in the center would get curled.  </li>
            <li> My lashes look long and last all day.  </li>
            <li> I image that would last quite a long time and</li>
            <li> As if that weren&#x27;t enough I have had such a hard time with some other brands with fitting different size eyes which mean different size lashes and lash line.  </li>
            <li> being that it&#x27;s a wider curler, it makes it easier for me to curl my eyelashes and not pinch myself so much with it as I have previously with other curlers.</li>
            <li> , Which will last very long, and a mascara cover thingy with brush.</li>
            <li> Plus it feels better than cold metal pressing into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will keep practicing and will revise my review if it turns out to be my technique and not that the curler isn&#x27;t wide enough.  </li>
            <li> The curling pads are thick and very cushion-y, so no worries about accidentally pinching yourself.</li>
            <li> It is thick and very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I am older and have had trouble with all other curlers pinching my outer eyelid skin</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve learned to move the curler a little further away from the roots of my lashes and approach it at a different angle, and that seemed to solve the problem.</li>
            <li> It has brow/lash comb on the other end but the kit also comes w the regular lash/brow comb we are used to.</li>
            <li> I do not see a need in having to purchase another one for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Other curlers weren&#x27;t wide enough for my eyes.</li>
            <li> The curling head is wide, the arc is flat, and there is a wide opening that makes it effortless to place the lashes in the curler.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to naturally want to grab really close to the base of the lashes and take too much of a bit so that it grabbed the lash and skin.</li>
            <li> Only down fall is wish there were directions for the mascara shield.</li>
            <li> Compared to my current curler, it is slightly flatter in design so that it reaches almost all of my lashes.</li>
            <li> And the holes where you put fingers and little bigger.</li>
            <li> My eyes are small with long eyelashes, but my eyes are deep set, so that could be why the curler cannot get the corner eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste $ on fancy Japanese curlers.</li>
            <li> The designer seems to have considered every situation with careful thought .</li>
            <li> It has a wide opening of 1.5&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> and when I apply mascara they look fake, seriously my lashes have never looked better and I just regret not having bought it sooner</li>
            <li> It beat out my Tarte lash curler and every other one that I&#x27;ve  ever tried.</li>
            <li> I have no affiliation with any manufacturer or distributor other than choosing to review their item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have this problem with the other curlers that I bought.</li>
            <li> I do have long lashes and quite a few of them.</li>
            <li> purchased this product at a reduced price to facilitate this review but was not compensated in any other way.</li>
            <li> so I was always pinching my eyelid with other curlers.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant at first as I have had several bad experiences with big brand curlers but after reading the reviews on this one I decided to give it a try</li>
            <li> My eyelashes have always been short but after Chemo 4 years ago my eyelashes are not only short but very thin.</li>
            <li> Added to the one that already comes on it, that&#x27;s 9 heavy, thick long lasting lash curlers in all.</li>
            <li> The rubber insert is not too hard to break them, just sturdy enough to make the curl.</li>
            <li> All that is color-coordinated (pink and black!)</li>
            <li> I had to cut them down each time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never using any other brand!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that that I had to remove the cushions in the finger grips because they were too tight for me.</li>
            <li> Ive tried a few other curlers but they never curled all my lashes.</li>
            <li> With my previous curler, I don&#x27;t have pinching problem</li>
            <li> I also like how it takes less then a minute to see results.</li>
            <li> I did have to take the black rubber out of the holes for my fingers ...</li>
            <li> the less - after using the curler there was a noticeable &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34; effect versus the previous no curler stage.  </li>
            <li> No matter what I tried my lashes looked shorter and less curled than before I started.</li>
            <li> If I was going to guess the biggest problem is the black plastic pad.</li>
            <li> The handle openings were too small for my fingers (and I don&#x27;t have large hands), so it was difficult to hold.  </li>
            <li> The only down fall is that where you put your fingers is very very small and hard to use.</li>
            <li> They also wouldn&#x27;t curl them all without several tries (mostly fails).</li>
            <li> Hopefully this review was was helpful, but if not, just let me know what&#x27;s missing</li>
            <li> Part of why I bought it was that my lashes never fit in one curl.</li>
            <li> give it a few pumps.</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble with curlers, i.e. they tend to break my lashes and I have never used them after applying mascara.  </li>
            <li> With the Lookout Lash kit, I won&#x27;t have to waste my time or energy doing that.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go around unnoticed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the expensive  Shiseido curler since I have thick, but straight lashes.  </li>
            <li> It is approximately 5 inches long.</li>
            <li> However, my eyelashes are short and 3D Fiber mascara is insanely expensive.</li>
            <li> I really adore the mascara guard and use it every time I do my makeup, because there&#x27;s really nothing worse than spending an hour on perfecting your look and then getting it all ruined with a nasty smudge of mascara on your eyelid or under your eye.</li>
            <li> I am not skilled in makeup application</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this product because it seemed new.</li>
            <li> I have thin lashes that are very hard to keep curled with mascaea alone but with this curler I find it not only curls them but makes them longer and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> that grow downward so they are hard to curl.</li>
            <li> and I found the under eye mascara guard hard to use.</li>
            <li> One of the worst problems I have with curling my lashes, is pinching my lid, or damaging my lashes because the cushion doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to order these for my sister in hopes she will give up wearing false lashes everyday.</li>
            <li> I have thick lashes (thank you latisse)</li>
            <li> No more cleanup after mascara for this girl!</li>
            <li> and I always tell everyone that my secret is this gem.</li>
            <li> Not happy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclaimer: I received a sample of the product for evaluation purposes, all thoughts and opinions are my own.ing false</li>
            <li> This is a game changer!</li>
            <li> I never know what to get her for a gift, but she is obsessed with makeup and beauty stuff, so I decided to buy this eyelash curler kit.</li>
            <li> They make your lashes look like fake lashes, even without the use of mascara.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical</li>
            <li> but I was proven wrong.</li>
            <li> Sorry  </li>
            <li> I have very thin lashes</li>
            <li> but I am no longer afraid of curling my clients lashes.</li>
            <li> I am makeup tool crazy</li>
            <li> I am so mad that I didn&#x27;t buy it before, even without mascara</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to find these anymore (which I don&#x27;t understand).  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s too bad, because I like everything else in the package.</li>
            <li> and I was wishing so bad that it would work</li>
            <li> No one will be disappointed with it!!!&lt;br /&gt;-A.Kennedy</li>
            <li> But unfortunately for me it was just awful.</li>
            <li> But I cannot get all my eyelashes in the curler :-(  </li>
            <li> I hate wearing mascara</li>
            <li> Very Disappointed in this curler.</li>

            <li> I was blessed with good eyelashes (long and thick) but I never could get the most out of them until I tried this eyelash curler! Others that I tried would crimp them and make them look shorter. They also wouldn&#x27;t curl them all without several tries (mostly fails). Other curlers weren&#x27;t wide enough for my eyes. This one is! I really put this baby to the test when I had a friend of mine with small eyes of a totally different shape try it.  She was as amazed as I was and ordered hers immediately after trying it! She bought one for herself, and one for her mom. Ever since trying it, I have changed my look. I get more compliments than I ever have and I always tell everyone that my secret is this gem. It beat out my Tarte lash curler and every other one that I&#x27;ve  ever tried. I&#x27;m just as excited about the extras that it comes with! The mascara guard is my new best friend. No more cleanup after mascara for this girl!</li>
            <li> Bought it for the girlfriend and she loves it! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I got this for my sister as a birthday gift and she loves it! I got jealous and bought one too. It is a must-have!</li>
            <li> Its the best eyelash curler i ever tried so far the description tells it best. I already recommend it to everyone i know id i buy again and its on my list to buy everyone one for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Love! Love! Love! . My eyes are so beautiful after using this. Amazing difference! Christmas shopping will be so easy for my sisters this year. ,</li>
            <li> Love it! I hate wearing mascara but this makes my eyelashes POP without it.</li>
            <li> So in love with this product! This is a must have for every woman!! Plus the free stuff ❤❤ Thanks😊</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! Doesn&#x27;t pinch like most eyelash curlers do and makes your eyes POP! Love!</li>
            <li> Amazing eyelash curler! I love the results and recommend it to everyone! Kayla</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so many great things about the products. My sister used hers on my daughter for prom. Her already gorgeous lashes looked even more gorgeous. Can&#x27;t wait to get my own!</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes beautiful and long in minutes</li>
            <li> Great eye lash curler! Easy to use and the price is great. Extra bonus is all the stuff that comes with it.</li>
            <li> Wow! Such a great value and such a great curler! I am a professional make-up artist where my work is displayed on Television screens and Theater screens and I only want the best for my high profile clients. Highly suggest you purchase!</li>
            <li> Ordered these to add to my professional kit wondering if they would make a big difference being that the ones I had cost so much more. Wow I am amazed!!!  No sticking at all, beautiful curl to lashes, and the free things that come along are also so useful.  The design is so well thought out &amp; externally able to still be a pretty item.  This eyelash curler kit will be a kit must have from here out.  As if that weren&#x27;t enough I have had such a hard time with some other brands with fitting different size eyes which mean different size lashes and lash line.  Being that I do makeup on so many different people I needed something I didn&#x27;t have to make adjustments or have different ones for use to different people.  I cannot say enough about the quality of the eye lash curler kit.  Everyone needs this product professionals &amp; those of you doing your own makeup at home.</li>
            <li> One of the worst problems I have with curling my lashes, is pinching my lid, or damaging my lashes because the cushion doesn&#x27;t fit. This one really does stop those problems and gives a visible curl that lasts. I not only use this one myself but I am no longer afraid of curling my clients lashes.</li>
            <li> This here works great!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this product because it seemed new. However, my eyelashes are short and 3D Fiber mascara is insanely expensive. So I took the risk and ordered this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pictures speak for themselves! No fake lashes, no eyeliner. And this is hours after curling and being outside in humid southern weather. Just Lookout Lashes curler and Loreal Voluminous mascara. As a former model, and a woman who has used tons of products...I couldn&#x27;t recommend this any higher. Plus the extra goodies are the best! Order. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:8bbbd65f35ba7158259fa13150ef17c5]] This kit, coupled with your favorite mascara, is all you need for lovely lashes.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the curler itself is one of the few I&#x27;ve used that did not put that tell-tale kink in the middle of my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a solution on my lashes that makes them really long, but they pop even more with the perfect curl. If you have long lashes, it&#x27;s important to brush them before curling, so the included brush is a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;The mascara shield is nicely designed and works well, and is a must when using waterproof mascara. Extra pads are included as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE: Product received to test, with the option to review.

            <li> This kit is absolutely amazing!!! Get it for yourself or as a gift!! No one will be disappointed with it!!!&lt;br /&gt;-A.Kennedy</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!!! Every woman needs this in their makeup bag!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this pack of free stuff. Completely necessary.</li>
            <li> Good product, would order again!</li>
            <li> These eyelash curlers are great!  They are easy to use and the results are amazing.  The mascara guard is a must have for all makeup wearers.  I am very pleased and have recommended to all of my girlfriends.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and daughter, and they love it. I&#x27;m very satisfied. Thanks!</li>
            <li> IS PERFECT! I love everything about this kit. Being that I am a makeup artist by trade, I can assure you that you won’t find anything better when it comes to eyelash beauty. I give a huge thumbs-up to Lookout Lashes. Thank you for creating such an amazing product!</li>
            <li> Update 7/19/15: The company contacted me to find out why it didn&#x27;t work out for me and suggested that perhaps there was a defective product. They sent me another one free of charge to try again. I have to say I am very impressed with their customer service. With the new curler, I still have pinching problem when I crimp my lashes too close to the root. So I&#x27;ve learned to move the curler a little further away from the roots of my lashes and approach it at a different angle, and that seemed to solve the problem. With my previous curler, I don&#x27;t have pinching problem but my lashes would curl to different directions. I don&#x27;t have that problem with this product. Overall, I really like this now. It comes with so many curling pad refills and the mascara guard seems to work well.  --------------- As much as I would like to like this item, I had to return it. It seems to pinch my lids a lot when I use it. Perhaps it&#x27;s the shape of my eyes or something... I didn&#x27;t have this problem with the other curlers that I bought. Disclosure: i&#x27;m asian with short lashes. That&#x27;s too bad, because I like everything else in the package.</li>
            <li> Awesome curler!  The lash gaurd helps avoid mistakes.</li>
            <li> I love the length and volume added to my lashes with this curler.  A must have in your cosmetic bag..</li>
            <li> This product gave me extra that extra boost to go with my new makeup.  I feel like a glamour girl</li>
            <li> Love the eyelash curler, not sure about the mascara shield.  Maybe my eyes are too deeply set for it to work properly.  I&#x27;ll have to keep playing with it.</li>
            <li> I love it! Sometimes it curls them more round and sometimes it kinda folds them, but i think it just depends on the way i hold the curler. Either way it works great I&#x27;ve never found one I like this much. Came just when they said it would and came with everything they promised.</li>
            <li> I give this eyelash curler 5 stars, because it arrived quickly and just as described.  It does a very good job of curling my eyelashes, and I love the electric pink color. Very stylish and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome tool for any girl who loves to do makeup. This cute little set comes with a pretty vibrant pink eyelash curler that works great. My eye lashes looked so much longer after using it. The set also comes with a mascara guard that is great for putting on perfect mascara without messing up,ans  a eyebrow comb and brush .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the tools are great quality, easy to use and look fantastic. Best of it really works, I can not rave enough about the eye lash curler it is one of the best ones I have ever used. The description says this kit is used by makeup professionals and I can see why they are freaking awesome. I would highly recommend this kit!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too curved for my eyes</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eyelash curler I have owned. I forgot to toss my old one after using this for a while. I didn&#x27;t realize how much better this eyelash curler is than my old one! It is smooth, gentle, and works effortlessly. Not to mention, I love the pink!</li>
            <li> I always figured an eyelash curler was an eyelash curler and that some may have different features but that in the end, they would perform the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have changed my mind on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one really does delivery knockout lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And all the accessories make it a major bargain at the time of my review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the inner cushion is not rubber like most, but a silicone which seems to give more yet remain solid so you don&#x27;t get cuts in it but can push enough to create a real curl, truly extending your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get a whole bag of replacement silicone cushions that are super easy to change out--making this like getting 10 eyelash curlers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also get two combs to separate and lengthen lashes after applying your mascara or even without it.  I have seen the black kind before which will also brush our your eyebrows, but never the kind like the pink one also enclosed and that works GREAT--kind of looks like a mini shark mouth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great set, which will change your lashes completely the first time you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curler provided</li>
            <li> My eyelashes have always been short but after Chemo 4 years ago my eyelashes are not only short but very thin. This eyelash curler is the only curler that I have ever had that curls almost all of my eyelashes. Compared to my current curler, it is slightly flatter in design so that it reaches almost all of my lashes. I can&#x27;t speak for the durability as I have only had it a week, but it seems to be well made and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I believe this eyelash curler does work better than any I&#x27;ve used before.  My only complaint is that that I had to remove the cushions in the finger grips because they were too tight for me.</li>
            <li> The curler is fine.  I wish the rubber strip was not black - it&#x27;s more difficult to see where my lashes are laying during the curling process.  I tried the transparent pink protector while applying mascara, but I can&#x27;t say it was significantly helpful (except for reaching the tiny corner lashes on the bottom).  I&#x27;ve been applying mascara without any extra tool for 50 years, so I&#x27;m pretty good at it now.  Black comb may be useful on occasion - I just haven&#x27;t had an occasion yet.  I love the fact there are 8 refill rubber strips.  It&#x27;s very difficult to find these anymore (which I don&#x27;t understand).  Most curlers come with none or 1-2 refills.  For the price, this is a very good deal.</li>
            <li> Curler is bulky and removes some eyeliner if I&#x27;m not careful how I hold it. I ordered it to get the reasonable supply of refill pads which became hard to find and expensive for my favored Maybelline curler that is less bulky and easier to use.</li>
            <li> I have tried many eyelash curlers and was never impressed. I really could even tell any difference and I would end pinching my eyelid so I finally gave up. I hadn&#x27;t used them in years and then I read an article how important it is to use them and these were suggested, I thought I would give them a try and not only do I LOVE the results I have not pinched my eyelid once. I&#x27;m going to order these for my sister in hopes she will give up wearing false lashes everyday. I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> My teenage grand daughter loves them so I gave them to her.</li>
            <li> Broke after two uses. Returned.</li>
            <li> I have owned ALOT of eyelash curlers! I love this one! I have thick lashes (thank you latisse) that grow downward so they are hard to curl. This curler curls them up beautifully and holds all day. Never before has this happened. I can&#x27;t believe the difference. Don&#x27;t waste $ on fancy Japanese curlers. This is the one</li>
            <li> I love this eyelash curler set! The set comes with everything you would need  to have great lashes!  The color is so beautiful, it looks great on my vanity.  All of the items are very well-made and  excellent quality.</li>
            <li> Wow! I found this product off of pinterest, and I&#x27;m so glad that I did.  I&#x27;ve had it about a week now and my eyelashes look longer and fuller all because if the shape of the curler.  My husband even noticed and told me my eyelashes looked great, what did I do to them? I had no idea the shape of the curler could make such a difference, it&#x27;s a must buy for anyone wanting longer, fuller looking lashes!</li>
            <li> I received my Lookout Lashes product today from Amazon.com .  I am very impressed with this kit .  I do not see a need in having to purchase another one for a very long time. This kit was not only shipped very professional but the courtesy card attached was nice to see.  The  Lookout Lashes kit came with everything I needed and made very well.  I also like the fact it came a classy color. The designer seems to have considered every situation with careful thought . I no longer have to worry about getting pinched or pulling out my eyelashes. It really does curl my eye lashes well.. My favorite part next to not getting my eyes lids pinched is the fact that is also keeps me from getting messy with the mascara. I would 100% recommend this product . Thank you to the designers of Lookout Lashes ..it is appreciated ! Great idea !!</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! Make my eyelashes even more beautiful!!! It is a must have!!!</li>
            <li> No different than a store bought one.</li>
            <li> I am still adjusting to the mascara guard, but I will get it. The eyelash curler gets all of my lashes and as it is wider than my old one the outer lashes curl instead of crimp. I love it !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest and admit that I never considered eyelash curlers to be essential beauty tools. I didn&#x27;t think they actually made a difference! Of course, I was wrong, and I realized that when I first used this cool looking little tool, because it really does make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyelashes are pretty long and thick, so I don&#x27;t usually have to wear falsies (unless I am going for a smoky eye look or something very popping!). I definitely don&#x27;t enjoy wearing falsies when it&#x27;s burning hot outside, because they make me feel like a circus escapee and I am very conscious of the extra weight. With the Lookout Lashes curler, I can achieve a similarly defined look without all the hassle of gluing something on top of my eyelids. The curling pads are thick and very cushion-y, so no worries about accidentally pinching yourself. They also seem gentle on the eyelashes, so they get the job done without damaging your lashes (I had that happen with a cheap kind of eyelash curler once).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curler comes with a mascara guard, which is another handy-dandy tool that quickly became my absolute must-have; an eyebrow brush and a refill of curling pads. All that is color-coordinated (pink and black!) and very chic looking. I really adore the mascara guard and use it every time I do my makeup, because there&#x27;s really nothing worse than spending an hour on perfecting your look and then getting it all ruined with a nasty smudge of mascara on your eyelid or under your eye. Plus, using it is just so easy - all you need to do is hold it under your bottom lashes or over your eyelid and then apply the mascara. It&#x27;s such a simple tool, but really saves you lots of time and frustration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really love this set. It&#x27;s a functional and well-designed set of tools, it doesn&#x27;t take up much space at all, it&#x27;s easy to use and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do - it makes your lashes beautifully curled and way more noticeable without applying many layers of mascara or wearing false lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received a sample of the product for evaluation purposes, all thoughts and opinions are my own.ing false lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received a sample of the product for evaluation purposes, all thoughts and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Used this curler exactly once. It pulled out a bunch of my eyelashes. I was not wearing mascara my lashes were clean. The one star is for the eyelash brush....it&#x27;s OK but nothing special. I would not recommend this curler and I found the under eye mascara guard hard to use. I will just wipe off any boo boos with Q tips.</li>
            <li> This is a great value! It&#x27;s an awesome tool for curling lashes, and with all the extras that come with it,...I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Love the feel and design of this curler.  It curls my lashes better than any other curler I have tried.  The picture shows the rubber refills for the curler but I did not receive them in my order.</li>
            <li> I just love this curler. Its so easy to clean unlike some curlers. Most eyelash curlers get gunked up and are hard to clean but this one is so easy to wipe down. L9ve it!</li>
            <li> Very Disappointed in this curler. The handle openings were too small for my fingers (and I don&#x27;t have large hands), so it was difficult to hold.  Also, the curler was not curved enough to curl the lashes at the inner and outer part of the eyelid; therefore, only the lashes in the center would get curled.  The only thing I found useful in this set was the eyelash comb. I tossed everything else and have ordered a different curler.</li>
            <li> Like a regular eyelash curler but the extras make it nice and it does curl my eyelashes great</li>
            <li> Wow!  Just received my kit.  I am older and have had trouble with all other curlers pinching my outer eyelid skin ~~ this curler does NOT and actually curls quickly and well.  I am SO impressed and delighted; I have ordered several more sets as gifts for my sisters!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife. I never know what to get her for a gift, but she is obsessed with makeup and beauty stuff, so I decided to buy this eyelash curler kit. I think I did pretty great, because she uses this eyelash curler everyday. I hear her tell her friends about how awesome it is. She says it&#x27;s the best she&#x27;s ever had, and the pink mascara guard thing she uses religiously instead of having to use qtips to fix her messed up mascara. I give it 5 stars. Awesome product. Even more awesome gift.</li>
            <li> The best eyelash curler I have found in my 38 years on earth!  They make your lashes look like fake lashes, even without the use of mascara.</li>
            <li> I like how this product includes free mascara guard and a eyebrow-eyelash brush. I also like how it takes less then a minute to see results. This product works on all eye shapes and lashes and I like they add things to make themselves different from the competition. There is a lot of stuff on the market but I feel that if you want something different then this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> Amazing, works great on my lashes – RRC</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that this is one great lash curler!  The curling head is wide, the arc is flat, and there is a wide opening that makes it effortless to place the lashes in the curler.  The product seems to be made of higher quality material, which is surprising because of its reasonable cost.  The curling pad(s) are amazingly soft, and the grip is also very comfortable and user-friendly.  If providing a great lash curler and extra pads weren&#x27;t enough, the manufacturer went further and also included detailed accessories that separate the lashes, and that are great for helping to protect  the under eye concealer,as well as the eyeshadow from any messy mascara.  Great product!  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but I was proven wrong. I have been curling my short, stick straight lashes since I was a teen. Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s now.  I wish I had found this curler sooner.  My lashes look long and last all day.  I highly recommend this curler</li>
            <li> comes with extra pads so it will literally last forever, the brush isnt all that great but the mascara guard has separators on the ends to comb through lashes. The curler has a very flat side which is good for women with asian eyes or eyes that are not too deep-set. The curl lasts all day and is very natural looking. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love the extra wide design perfect fit for any eye!! The eyebrow brush that is attached to the mascara guard can double to comb out your mascara to get rid of any clumps. I love this product and it&#x27;s the perfect color!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing, my eyelashes look 100000% better, highly recommend to anyone who needs a better eyelash curler. I&#x27;m buying another one for my daughter!</li>
            <li> Finally I found the eyelash curler that didn&#x27;t  pinch my eyelids and pulled out lashes.  And it curled my lashes great. Comes with a free mascara guard and eyebrow brush.  I love the rubber comfort grips on the handles.  There were extra pads for the curler as an added bonus to this pack. Just a tip, I use my hair dryer to heat up the pads on the curler.  It seems to make them curl better for me.  I love this product .  I received a discount on this item for my fair and impartial review.  Great seller and super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I am very very happy with this eyelash curler. It actually curls your lashes instead of crimping them to stand up straight. My lashes are long but super straight, so its perfect for me. Also the seller is right, no pinching , very comfortable to use. I did have to take the black rubber out of the holes for my fingers ... No big deal just as comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Omg I love this eyelash curler it goes well with my Glamours mascara from Estee Lauder</li>
            <li> This tool is easy to use, and works faster than other brands I&#x27;ve tried. This set is a great value with all the extra pads that come with it!</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research to try and find a great curler that would actually curl! Perhaps I just don&#x27;t know how to use an eyelash curler correctly, but this one doesn&#x27;t seem to work any better than other ones I have tried.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! Comes with everything you need to help your lashes and brows looking BEAUTIFUL!! I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:cf514189d3df0a1df8b623cb13e5c8d3]] I am a commercial television actress, as well as a HUGE makeup junkie, so when I stumbled across this eyelash curler kit - I just had to try it! I cannot say enough wonderful things about the kit, so I got with my studio cameraman and decided to do a product video review to show everyone what is included in the kit, as well as what type of results I experienced using this product. I hope this video review helps you in your buying decision :) I love everything about this eyelash curler and the free extras, and I highly recommend this to every makeup-lover!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this curler set!  FIrst off I&#x27;ve been wanting to purchase a mascara guard but honestly couldn&#x27;t really find anywhere for a low price, as its a simple tool.  I was able to get my mascara guard and alot more in this purchase!  I don&#x27;t use the curler after applying mascara as personally for myself - the lashes tend to stick together and create a huge mess for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None the less - after using the curler there was a noticeable &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34; effect versus the previous no curler stage.  I&#x27;m going to go back to the mascara guard and say this is the best thing I&#x27;ve ordered in a very long time!  You can safely place the guard on the lower lashes, right under the lid and freely apply your mascara to give you a thick lower lash effect - AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope the pictures below give justice on such an awesome tool set this is!  Highly recommend! I received this item at a discount in exchange for my review.</li>
            <li> I am not a make up expert but I just started taking some make up classes to become a professional make up artist, I have used eyelash curlers before, but I love how this one comes with 8 extra curling pads, and being that it&#x27;s a wider curler, it makes it easier for me to curl my eyelashes and not pinch myself so much with it as I have previously with other curlers. On top of the extra curling pads you also get  a mascara eye guard that actually prevents your from getting your eyelids messy from the mascara, that for me being a beginner is a bonus. Then you get an eye brow brush and comb all in one package, now that&#x27;s what I call a deal. I wasn&#x27;t as lucky in having long and voluminous eyelashes, so having a tool that can help me accomplish a look of fuller and longer eyelashes makes me happy. I am so excited on using these not just on myself but my family and friends to show them how a great product this is and learning how to use it to it&#x27;s full potential with the goal of one day having many clients happy with their eyelashes. Seller gives you 100% money back guarantee, so I highly recommend this product and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I like the finish results and the cute curled eyelashes I get. Easy to use and comes in a cute pink color, I like the few free goodies that comes with!</li>
            <li> The curler is very comfortable to use, it will just take a bit to get used to it.  It seems to curl my lashes much better than the &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; versions, and I love that it comes with so many replacement pads!!!  I have not yet tried to use the mascara guard, but what a great idea!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for! Plan on getting for all my girlfriends!</li>
            <li> This is so awesome!! Absolutely LOVE it! I will never use anything else. 5 STARS!</li>
            <li> Love this eyelash curler! It&#x27;s wide enough to get all of my lashes at once and curls them perfectly. Not to mention all the accessories are a huge bonus! There&#x27;s enough pad replacements to last forever. Great product!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my Sephora one that had worn out. After reading the description and reviews I thought it sounded great. But unfortunately for me it was just awful. At first I thought it was just that perhaps I needed new mascara but I bought new mascara. I&#x27;ve tried it with 3 different brands and with and without primer. Part of why I bought it was that my lashes never fit in one curl. I do have long lashes and quite a few of them. Perhaps it would work better for someone with short lashes and not so many. I really struggled to get it to curl my lashes. It seemed to naturally want to grab really close to the base of the lashes and take too much of a bit so that it grabbed the lash and skin. No matter what I tried my lashes looked shorter and less curled than before I started. If I was going to guess the biggest problem is the black plastic pad. I think the white foam ones are far superior. So for me this one is going in the trash and I&#x27;ll look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Sorry  it did not work for my eyelashes at all and I was wishing so bad that it would work</li>
            <li> I have never used an eyelash curler since I did not need one when I was young as I was blessed with very good eyelashes, but now I am 50 and in need of help. There is not really a specific reason I purchased this one other than the good reviews, the price and the extras it came with. I do not know one curler from another but now I am glad I purchased this little kit.&lt;br /&gt;Really, what I like about this is the eyelash shield that they included. It took a few minutes to get the contraption positioned correctly but when I did I was extremely pleased with the results. I am typically messy with mascara, always have been but this made it SO much easier. Using this in conjunction with the curler gave me longer and fuller lashes probably because in using the mascara guard I was able to put on numerous coats, go from root to tip and my mascara did not clump at all. I am guessing it is because with the shield it allowed me to press in and wiggle the brush more firmer than I could have ever done without it and the guard has little ridges in it which I think aids in lash separation.&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it comes with so many replacement curler strips, I won&#x27;t have to buy any for who knows how long.&lt;br /&gt;So, all in all, I am very pleased with my choice and I would recommend this kit to anyone looking to purchase a curler because of all the extras you get with it for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Love it. Ive tried a few other curlers but they never curled all my lashes. I guess my eye is wide because whatever curler i used left my outer and inner lashes straight. This one doesnt get them 100 percent but its soo much better than the covergirl and lovely lashes(amazon) curlers. It comes with 8 refills!!, Which will last very long, and a mascara cover thingy with brush. I havent tried it out yet but its a good bonus. Even if it doesnt work the curler alone is worth the price. I definitely recommend this brand.</li>
            <li> This curls really well. I was surprised at how much better it works than my previous eyelash curler. Something in the mechanism just seems more solid and curls my lashes with almost no effort.</li>
            <li> Love it! Came quickly and really curls my lashes!</li>
            <li> Wish I could be as happy as everyone else is but I find the item so stiff that it doesn&#x27;t seem to apply enough pressure to make much happen. It&#x27;s not bad , and I do appreciate the item and its toys, but it&#x27;s just not as good as Shiseido. I&#x27;m spoiled. I wish there were an illustration on how to use the shield too.</li>
            <li> Love the hot pink color. This set was a really good value. Curls lashes without even trying that much.</li>
            <li> Loved this product. Easy to use, clean and sturdy. Gave my eye lashes wonderful shape. Will definitely be recommending this</li>
            <li> Curler is high quality and works great. I never thought about using a blow dryer to warm up the curler so thanks for the bonus instructions. Love the last guard. I can put mascara on the lower last without it smudging.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing eyelash curler kit at a great price. The kit includes a purple stainless steel eyelash curler, 8 replacement curler pads, mascara guard and eyebrow/eyelash brush. I love the metallic purple color on the eyelash curler. It is thick and very sturdy. It&#x27;s designed to help you get as close to the end of your eyelashes as possible to get a better curl. I love how wide it is so it actually gets all of your eyelashes and it doesn&#x27;t pinch your skin. It has a wide opening of 1.5&amp;#34;. Most eyelash curlers are not this large. It gives my eyelashes more curl and volume. You can tell an immediate difference. It fits perfectly against your eyes. There are silicone grips around the inside of the finger holes. You can get a good grip and it will not slide out of your fingers. This eyelash is really the best one that I have tried. I grip my eyelashes at the very end and hold for about 15 seconds then give it a few pumps. I do this on each eye then I repeat again if necessary. It definitely makes your eye pop. Included is a eyebrow brush and eyelash comb combo. It is approximately 5 inches long. I like to use the comb on my eyelashes before using the eyelash curler. I apply mascara to my top lashes and then I work on my eyebrows while they are drying. I use the eyebrow brush to brush them in the right direction then I fill in with a color. Next, I work on my bottom lashes and apply mascara. To help prevent any mascara mistakes, I use the mascara guard. It&#x27;s super easy to use. Sometimes I get in hurry and end up getting mascara all over my eye lid. This guard fits perfectly around your eye and helps you avoid any mistakes. This works on both upper and lower lashes. You can achieve gorgeous full lashes with this Lookout Lashes kit. It&#x27;s an amazing price for the kit. I received this kit to test for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I would definitely recommend this kit.</li>
            <li> Great eyelash curler set.  I always get consistent results.  And the extras that come with it are helpful.  Plus the color is adorable!</li>
            <li> Do you want perfect natural lashes all day, every day? Buy this. It&#x27;s a great buy. Gets all my lashes curled in one try. I haven&#x27;t tried the shield but I love that they add so many extra cushions for it.</li>
            <li> This curler is great! No pinching and it fits very comfortably around my eye. The will definitely be my one and only from now on!! So happy I found/purchased this product!!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best eyelash  curler I have purchased.  It curls my lashes with out  my own getting stuck n to the blade.</li>
            <li> Love the color I can find it easy in my makeup bag, lots of cool extras so you have basically everything you need to do your eye leashes and brows.  There are plenty of pad re[placements so you dont have to keep going to buy new curlers all  the time.  I really liked these and my lashes did as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product at a reduced price to facilitate this review but was not compensated in any other way.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Made very well and love the color. Lots of refill pads too.</li>
            <li> Love my eye lash curler. Makes your lashes so beautiful.</li>
            <li> These tools are so neat. I am makeup tool crazy so I was really excited about this. The eye lash curler is perfect. It curls them wonderfully and doesn&#x27;t pinch me at all, which has been a problem for me with other eyelash curlers. It also came with an eyelash and eyebrow comb, lots of extra inserts for the eyelash curlers, and a really neat tool that I&#x27;ve never seen before. It is a guard for when you put mascara on your eyelashes. What a neat idea!! I had to get used to using this tool but when you get the hang of it, it really helps you from having a mess of mascara or hitting yourself on accident with the mascara wand and ruining your makeup. Also a problem I have had lol. A wonderful tool to have for anybody who loves makeup and makeup tools!!</li>
            <li> I really like this eyelash curler. Good quality and doesn&#x27;t pinch eyelids like others do and love that it comes with all that you need for perfect beautiful eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Great product and curls your lashes very well. I like the extras that they sent to help do your eyelashes and make them full and beautiful. The only down fall is that where you put your fingers is very very small and hard to use. I wish they were bigger as i cant even get my fingers in them.</li>
            <li> Purchased this a couple of weeks ago. By far my favorite eyelash curler yet!</li>
            <li> I love this product!! It&#x27;s so easy to used. I am not skilled in makeup application so I was always pinching my eyelid with other curlers. I love how wide the curler opens so you can see exactly where you are placing it! It provides just the right amount of curl. The extra lash guard is also amazing!</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to getting this eyelash curler but when I used it ...I notice that the lashes were shorter than before in places.  Not happy.  I have very thin lashes and I don&#x27;t need this.  It may work for you if you have thicker lashes but if not, then I would not recommend.  UPDATE!!!!!!  The seller emailed and explained that this one might be defective and I could either get a refund or he would send me another one.  I tried the new one and it was much better.  He also offered to post a video of how to use the Mascara Guard in the near future.  I would be willing to buy again, it is great.  I now give 4 🌟🌟🌟🌟 in place of the 2 🌟🌟.</li>
            <li> An eye lash curler is the ONE accessory/tool I can&#x27;t live without. I have long straight eyelashes, so I this is a MUST tool for me. I does curl. The rubber insert is not too hard to break them, just sturdy enough to make the curl. When you hold the eyelash curler it seems bigger than most. It is also feels thicker and I love this because it gets every eyelash (since I have big eyes most eyelash curlers leave the outer lashes hanging and straight, this one grabs them all).</li>
            <li> I must say I have used MANY eyelash curlers.  I&#x27;ve purchased the expensive  Shiseido curler since I have thick, but straight lashes.  This curler is wider and thicker so it grabs more lashes without pulling.  Far better than any of the pricier ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I would rather give this a 2.5 than a 2.  The eyelashes that get curled look pretty good.  But I cannot get all my eyelashes in the curler :-(  A cm in from the outer corner does not get curled, and even gets smooshed while I am trying to curl.  My eyes are small with long eyelashes, but my eyes are deep set, so that could be why the curler cannot get the corner eyelashes.  I will keep practicing and will revise my review if it turns out to be my technique and not that the curler isn&#x27;t wide enough.  In the mean time any helpful feedback would be great!  I really want this to work for me...</li>
            <li> yes i love this curling eyelashes its very easy to use &amp;#60;#</li>
            <li> Amazing product!!! I&#x27;m never using any other brand! Easy to use and my lashes look flawless</li>
            <li> Love love love! Great quality and a fantastic deal! Will never buy another!</li>
            <li> Love it. It has everything you need and it a pretty good curler too</li>
            <li> I love the shape of this lash curler! Comes with extra lash pads, and a handy mascara guard. Super cute color too!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes look great! Plenty of volume and length. Excellent product at a great value. Plus, I love all the freebies! Plan to give to my friends as gifts.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant at first as I have had several bad experiences with big brand curlers but after reading the reviews on this one I decided to give it a try and oh am I glad that I did. Just amazing!!! I am so mad that I didn&#x27;t buy it before, even without mascara it makes my lashes look huge and when I apply mascara they look fake, seriously my lashes have never looked better and I just regret not having bought it sooner, best eyelash curler ever, I am in love with it and buying a second one.</li>
            <li> Loved this eyelash curler.  I was so happy to see they worked and I still have my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST eyelash curler/set I have ever purchased. I have thin lashes that are very hard to keep curled with mascaea alone but with this curler I find it not only curls them but makes them longer and lasts all day. Thank you for a great product!</li>
            <li> Nothing to brag about. Could have purchased a much more inexpensive one in my local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> Curler does what it is designed to do. I really like like the guard and the fact this package comes with extra pads. Overall great product</li>
            <li> This kit is wonderful. I never know if anything will actually work better than the last. But this kit gives full and sexy lashes. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I bought something similar to this before and I love it. This was such a great price and it came with 8 extras for the curler. Love the mascara thing. It help not having mascara on my eye lid.</li>
            <li> In my honest opinion, there could be some improvements made to the eyelash curler itself; wish it had a spring attachment to keep it open. What I do like about this product is the thickness of the rubber, it really triggers the curling action and all the other implements included are a plus.</li>
            <li> Love this eyelash curler!  I have always had trouble with curlers, i.e. they tend to break my lashes and I have never used them after applying mascara.  This curler works so well..much better than others that have been both less and more expensive.  I would recommend this item to anyone looking for a good eyelash curler and all the extras that come with it are great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an awesome curler.  I love it. Can&#x27;t do without it!</li>
            <li> I love this eyelash curler, it doesn&#x27;t crimp your end lashes like most others.</li>
            <li> As far as eye lash curlers go, this curler is pretty great. First, let me just say how I love that it&#x27;s bright pink. So much fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When looking for a curler, I look for something that does not have any springs. You really want to be able to control the movement of anything near your eye. This curler allows you to be completely in control by offering a fully manual system. Another great feature is the padded finger rests. It might not seem like a big deal, but having that little bit of extra padding really helps the process. Plus it feels better than cold metal pressing into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the curling pad itself, I really like that the rubber isn&#x27;t flimsy. There is a perfect amount of resistance to allow for a great curl. It&#x27;s easy to pop out and clean the pads too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto the perks, what sold me on this product is all of the extra curling pads included in this kit. It really stinks when you find a great eyelash curler that you love to use, but it only comes with one replacement pad. After that, you either have to purchase a whole new kit  or you have to scour the shelves/internet for replacement pads only to find they don&#x27;t really sell them. One time, I purchased replacement pads for a curler I couldn&#x27;t let go of and wouldn&#x27;t you know, the pads didn&#x27;t fit. I had to cut them down each time. With the Lookout Lash kit, I won&#x27;t have to waste my time or energy doing that.</li>
            <li> It seems to work at curling my lashes until I put on mascara.  I then have some lashes that droop and some that stay curled.  I had hopes that this would be my new favorite eyelash curler since the ratings were so high, but I am still on the lookout.</li>
            <li> Love this eyelash curler!!!! Great quality ...wonderful customer servIce</li>
            <li> Absolutely enjoyed! This completely replaced all my old ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with the eyelash curler! It doesn&#x27;t rip my eyelashes out and doesn&#x27;t leave a crease! Also, comes with extra rubber inserts!!</li>
            <li> I have been lookin for a good eyelash curler for a while. I saw this on amazon review trader and was excited to be approved. This is a really good one I have been really into beauty lately bit still little new. Only down fall is wish there were directions for the mascara shield. Easier way to use it. And the holes where you put fingers and little bigger. Glad I got this and will buy again if need another one</li>
            <li> Great product! Also makes a great gift!!!</li>
            <li> If you want great lashes this is the thing to get!! Really makes your lashes pop out and be bold. You won&#x27;t go around unnoticed that&#x27;s for sure!! Definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> AWESOME!!!  My lashes are impossibly short, so a good set of curlers is essential. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week and could not be happier. My eyes finally pop! Looking forward to buying more for gifts and stocking stuffers!</li>
            <li> Love this eyelash curler and guard.  Bought one for myself and now going to have to get my daughter one!</li>
            <li> Awesome product! I love the results you get with eyelash curler!</li>
            <li> WOW. Love this little thing. Hot pink w rubber inserts in the finger holes. Great for small hands and prevent fingers slipping and pulling your lashes out.&#x27; Both are removable to fit bigger fingers. Kit came w an item I had never seen before but now wonder how I EVER got along w/o it. Its a MASCARA GUARD to keep from getting mascara on your face (like I do ALL the time). GREAT idea. It has brow/lash comb on the other end but the kit also comes w the regular lash/brow comb we are used to. Oh. There&#x27;s more...you ALSO get a pkg w 8 curler refills. Added to the one that already comes on it, that&#x27;s 9 heavy, thick long lasting lash curlers in all. I image that would last quite a long time and those are always something I needed but would forget to buy. All said, this Lookout Lashes Eyelash Curler Kit has it all.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to purchase this kit at a reduced cost for my own honest Review and Honestly, I LOVE it.</li>
