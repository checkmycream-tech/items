            <li>if your on your feet most of the day.</li>
            <li>These are so comfortable!</li>
            <li>I bought another one; That should speak for itself. :)</li>
            <li>Just Okay.</li>
            <li>Love them and will get more of them.</li>
            <li>Makes my feet feel better no matter</li>
            <li>Any more than 1/2 hour of walking in dress shoes would cause pain.</li>
            <li>so glad that I purchased these.</li>
            <li>Best purchase in a long time.</li>
            <li>These are super comfy and support the heel of my feet nicely.  </li>
            <li>and I got thia ones to try to make my shoes more comfortable and give me more arch support.</li>
            <li>The pair I received were purple (which I like better) and way comfortable.</li>
            <li>Arrived in perfect condition, as expected.</li>
            <li>They do not slip while wearing the shoes and have made walking much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>I easily slip them into any shoe or boot I am wearing and off I go.</li>
            <li>Make sure you read the full description before purchasing.</li>
            <li>my daughter uses this item she hasnt complainted about it, so i am thinking they are working fine for her.</li>
            <li>Inserts fit well in my shoes</li>
            <li>My work boots were already comfortable, but these just added to the comfort.</li>
            <li>comfortable to walk all day</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really great if you just want to replace the inserts you currently have, but not too great if you have bigger issues.</li>
            <li>They stay put, and they are comfortable.</li>
            <li>its very good to control foot overpronation, but it cant fit in a shoe size 7 or less.</li>
            <li>I paid 28.00 at a sporting goods store and worth every cent!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t seem to help as much as I hoped but it is better than nothing.</li>
            <li>great cushion, hope it will last a long time though</li>
            <li>The only think I&#x27;d like better is if they were a tad bit longer.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>I wrote a review already with my first purchase.</li>
            <li>so just be aware,  </li>
            <li>If a tornado hit, I think that package would be the only thing safe hahahahah.</li>
            <li>Its a little bulky, but effective.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re wearing out fast...</li>
            <li>how they will hold up, they look very well constructed so</li>
            <li>Right now I just spent 150 dollara buying a new good pair of shoes for someone who has flat feet.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, good company, poor product quality...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wear it with flats because my foot is too high to sit in the shoe.</li>
            <li>These orthotics have seen many miles and have provided some extra comfort and support while on my feet for long periods of time.</li>
            <li>( u know the ones u normally see woman laying out on)  </li>
            <li>but I just used them to help ease breaking in some new shoes.</li>
            <li>As someone that deals with leg and back pain, these work very well.  </li>
            <li>I think that the extra cushion adds comfort and my feet don&#x27;t hurt as much at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Although I use it with another insert under, most people without serious foot issues could use alone.</li>
            <li>They do add about 1/8 to 1/4 an inch to the inside of the shoe, making the shoe a little bit tighter, so I imagine if a shoe is very tight, they might not fit, but so far, they&#x27;ve fit in every shoe I own.</li>
            <li>but I do generally recommend these!</li>
            <li>these really helped my feet, especially during  the summer/fall when i&#x27;m constantly walking around campus especially since it is a big campus.</li>

            <li> These insoles aren&#x27;t bad but it&#x27;d be better if it was a whole insole instead of a partial insole.</li>
            <li> Not sure if they would really work for a size 10 though.</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t seem to be anywhere near breaking down.</li>
            <li> I bought them because I bought a cheap pair of boots to wear to a concert, and I knew the boots were going to be uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I meant to purchase these for a long time, but as sometimes happens, I waited until I had a problem.</li>
            <li> Not too thick or much to them.</li>
            <li> Holyyyyyy cow when I got these they were packaged up in this bubble stuff that kinda resembling s tiny mini pool floating long chair</li>
            <li> at least a couple of hours in dress shoes or high heels</li>
            <li> needs a shoe half a number bigger</li>
            <li> , i used to have a pair that have hard plastic at the sole and that last longer than those with just foam</li>
            <li> The last few years I have been experiencing foot pain when wearing anything other than crocs and running shoes.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve heard how some other people didn&#x27;t dig the 3/4 length</li>
            <li> The arch is really high and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> but I wish it took a little less room in my shoes.</li>
            <li> and they come a little shorter than my foot.</li>
            <li> ( It was obviously from poor insole support.  </li>
            <li> I have terrible pain in the ball of my foot and this, honestly, helped just a bit.</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few insoles (ok, even memory foam shoes) and the pain is awful!</li>
            <li> Ill definitely reordering my shoe inserts from this seller!</li>
            <li> It says 6-10, but they are small.</li>
            <li> At least they work</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter because she had out grown an expensive pair prescribed by a doctor.</li>
            <li> any ways it was insanely Well packaging and extremely Well protected!  </li>
            <li> It feels awkward</li>
            <li> And the no toes thing is annoying because the insole will slip around.</li>

            <li> I had hoped for better arch support... but it is a good product.</li>
            <li> its very good to control foot overpronation, but it cant fit in a shoe size 7 or less. needs a shoe half a number bigger</li>
            <li> Work well. Ordered by my podiatrist.</li>
            <li> great cushion, hope it will last a long time though, i used to have a pair that have hard plastic at the sole and that last longer than those with just foam</li>
            <li> The best insert I have found.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter because she had out grown an expensive pair prescribed by a doctor. She said she liked them and they felt good.She dosen&#x27;t complain about any pain in the arch of her foot.</li>
            <li> Inserts fit well in my shoes however I work 8+ hours on my feet 5 days a week and they&#x27;re wearing out fast...</li>
            <li> Fit&#x27;s her shoes perfectly and has helped her legs from aching as much after a day on her feet.</li>
            <li> I meant to purchase these for a long time, but as sometimes happens, I waited until I had a problem. I had incredible pain in the arch of one foot for about 2 weeks with no relief. ( It was obviously from poor insole support.  ) As soon as these arrived I put them in, and within 3 days the pain was gone. I&#x27;ve had them for quite awhile and they don&#x27;t seem to be anywhere near breaking down.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t seem to help as much as I hoped but it is better than nothing.</li>
            <li> Good cushioning. I work on cement floors these insoles provide support and my legs and feet are not hurting after work.</li>
            <li> Item arrived as advertised</li>
            <li> It helps me when i,m using my rollerskate, i don,T fell pain, my feet stay protect with this insoles. Good,</li>
            <li> These are great with flats to protect your feet! The pair I received were purple (which I like better) and way comfortable. The only think I&#x27;d like better is if they were a tad bit longer. I were a size 6 and they come a little shorter than my foot. Nonetheless, these &amp;#34;really&amp;#34; work and I cannot say that about others. I paid 5.00 for a gel liner from payless and it did nothing. This is a wise investment. Although I just received them so I can not judge yet how they will hold up, they look very well constructed so I hope to put a lot of mileage on these. The arch comes up and the ball and heel of the foot are very nicely padded. I think these are a winner!</li>
            <li> Fell short and gave me heel pain.</li>
            <li> Great product if your on your feet most of the day. My feet aren&#x27;t rebelling against me.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I needed but I wish it took a little less room in my shoes. Its a little bulky, but effective.</li>
            <li> Everything is perfect</li>
            <li> Well I work as a waitress and I got thia ones to try to make my shoes more comfortable and give me more arch support. The truth ia that after the second day standing up for 12 houra on it, the insole just went flat and now doesnt make any difference.  Right now I just spent 150 dollara buying a new good pair of shoes for someone who has flat feet. Fast delivery, good company, poor product quality...</li>
            <li> Not too thick or much to them.</li>
            <li> These can add comfort to any shoe. I bought them because I bought a cheap pair of boots to wear to a concert, and I knew the boots were going to be uncomfortable. These made them very comfortable! After the concert, I started using them in my heeled boots that I wear to work. My work boots were already comfortable, but these just added to the comfort. Then when the weather got warmer, I transferred them daily to whatever heels I was wearing to work. I&#x27;m definitely buying another pair so I don&#x27;t have to keep transferring them. They do add about 1/8 to 1/4 an inch to the inside of the shoe, making the shoe a little bit tighter, so I imagine if a shoe is very tight, they might not fit, but so far, they&#x27;ve fit in every shoe I own.</li>
            <li> These orthotics have seen many miles and have provided some extra comfort and support while on my feet for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> These are so comfortable! I am on my feet at work 8-10 hours a day. My feet used to be killing me at the end of the day. Now they aren&#x27;t swollen at all at the end of a work day. Best purchase in a long time.</li>
            <li> I wrote a review already with my first purchase. I bought another one; That should speak for itself. :)</li>
            <li> I have heel pain, and these are so great! Cushions my heels while holding my feet in proper alignment. I paid 28.00 at a sporting goods store and worth every cent!</li>
            <li> It feels good, helps support and buffer. Although I use it with another insert under, most people without serious foot issues could use alone.</li>
            <li> They do the job. I bought a size 8 and when I got them it says fits size 5-8. The insoles go from my feel to the bottom of my toes. It feels awkward but I&#x27;m used to it now. Make sure you read the full description before purchasing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve placed these in a pair of sneakers that were starting to make my feet hurt since they were beginning to wear on the inside. These insoles have prolonged the use of these sneakers. I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> Bought 2 and switch them between shoes. I would buy them again. I don&#x27;t like to wear shoes without them. Stabilizes my feet and supports my arches.</li>
            <li> These insoles aren&#x27;t bad but it&#x27;d be better if it was a whole insole instead of a partial insole. At least they work that&#x27;s what counts.</li>
            <li> The arch is really high and uncomfortable. I can&#x27;t wear it with flats because my foot is too high to sit in the shoe. And the no toes thing is annoying because the insole will slip around. I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> comfortable to walk all day</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Cut a Bit Short. Just Okay.</li>
            <li> Arrived in perfect condition, as expected.</li>
            <li> COMFY!  For me any how but I just used them to help ease breaking in some new shoes. Definitely made it easier on me, However they are 3/4 length but I&#x27;m petite so it kinda worked out for me but I&#x27;ve heard how some other people didn&#x27;t dig the 3/4 length so just be aware,  but I do generally recommend these! Oh! Also!  Holyyyyyy cow when I got these they were packaged up in this bubble stuff that kinda resembling s tiny mini pool floating long chair ( u know the ones u normally see woman laying out on)  any ways it was insanely Well packaging and extremely Well protected!  If a tornado hit, I think that package would be the only thing safe hahahahah. Good job there!  Ill definitely reordering my shoe inserts from this seller!</li>
            <li> As someone that deals with leg and back pain, these work very well.  I would recommend then for anyone that has leg or back pain.l</li>
            <li> I have terrible pain in the ball of my foot and this, honestly, helped just a bit. It&#x27;s really great if you just want to replace the inserts you currently have, but not too great if you have bigger issues.</li>
            <li> These are super comfy and support the heel of my feet nicely.  I wear a size 6.5 and they are sized perfect. Not sure if they would really work for a size 10 though. It says 6-10, but they are small.</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few insoles (ok, even memory foam shoes) and the pain is awful! It feels like every bone in my feet are breaking. These insoles are the best I&#x27;ve found. They work for every pair of shoes I own and my feet don&#x27;t feel they are breaking anymore. Love them and will get more of them.</li>
            <li> my daughter uses this item she hasnt complainted about it, so i am thinking they are working fine for her.</li>
            <li> Makes my feet feel better no matter what shoe or slipper I put them into.  Great product would buy again when needed.</li>
            <li> In addition to using a tennis ball for foot exercises to relieve heel pain, the pads were purchased to help with pain during walking. The pads are being used in size 7 1/2 tennis shoes and no trimming was required. They do not slip while wearing the shoes and have made walking much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Works greats for my daughter, she&#x27;s on her feet all day.</li>
            <li> I find this product to be quite good. The last few years I have been experiencing foot pain when wearing anything other than crocs and running shoes. Any more than 1/2 hour of walking in dress shoes would cause pain. I won&#x27;t say this product is a miracle cure, but I can walk for a lot longer ... at least a couple of hours in dress shoes or high heels (when I use these insoles)without any discomfort. I easily slip them into any shoe or boot I am wearing and off I go. They stay put, and they are comfortable. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I always like having insoles. I think that the extra cushion adds comfort and my feet don&#x27;t hurt as much at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> these really helped my feet, especially during  the summer/fall when i&#x27;m constantly walking around campus especially since it is a big campus. im so glad that I purchased these. the great part is that I could wear them in most of my summer shoes and sandals with out people noticing it.</li>
