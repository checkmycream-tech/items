            <li>Received this product at a greatly reduce price thanks to some amazon deals site.</li>
            <li>According to many sources, the scent of Argan oil should be nutty, almost like popcorn.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>I would prefer a pump top to compensate for my clumsiness.</li>
            <li>Makes hair manageable and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this oil.</li>
            <li>Love this oil.</li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>have also used argon oil for my hair and making body butter, but it&#x27;s mostly used after chemical peels.</li>
            <li>It does something... but not the way most people I see on this talking about...</li>
            <li>it takes more than a couple drops.</li>
            <li>I love how it feels.</li>

            <li>Just love it</li>
            <li>Additionally, this product smells more like cooking oil than argan oil.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it, and I use it on everything.</li>
            <li>and since I have been using it (I mix in my hands with my lotion), my skin is softer and SO more moisturized.</li>
            <li>and this is really top quality Argon Oil.</li>
            <li>She adds this to her hair and it looks so shiny and healthy now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also have many allergies to additives in lotions</li>
            <li>But I am perfectly OK with that.</li>
            <li>Not greasy and oily feeling like most oils.</li>
            <li>Wish dropper held more.</li>
            <li>I love Argan oil.</li>

            <li>I love this Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li>It goes on nice and smooth and I am looking forward to trying more of these products.</li>
            <li>I used some on my cuticles though I felt the results were more temporary.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this Argan oil on my hair but mostly my skin.</li>

            <li>so much better and more practical than spending hundreds of dollars on creams and conditioners filled with chemicals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>THE BEST PRODUCT I have ever used for my dry skin and complextion!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect to use it in this dry cool weather in Texas!</li>
            <li>My daughters have very dry hair, and it is a great conditioner!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been great so far.</li>
            <li>I use it in my hair mostly, because I am going Natural with it, and this oil is amazing!</li>
            <li>I love that the oil is scent free, and although it&#x27;s an oil, it&#x27;s not oily.  </li>
            <li>So far im happy with this product.</li>
            <li>When you have a good idea of how much to use, you can do it on damp hair.</li>
            <li>It is good for your whole body</li>
            <li>I have been using this on my cracked heels and have been very successful reducing how dry they have been!</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of oil and argan oil is also one of the oils I was very excited to try.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and healthy now!!  </li>
            <li>Great shipping and these bottles are pretty big, so the value is good, too.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item for perspective as someone that has never had the chance to experience trying it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>most original state?</li>
            <li>The dropper makes it easy to control delivery, and it&#x27;s a moisturizing but not oily feeling.</li>
            <li>it dries easily and does not fee greasy.  </li>
            <li>The size compared to the price is exceptional and it works to moisturize my skin very well after a peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had heard many things great things about this product, so I decided to finally try it.  </li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t really have a scent and feels amazing on my skin.</li>
            <li>Rubs in easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the oil itself does not have strong smell and blends in the skin as I massage it on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>Good product, works as described, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>also gave this product as a Christmas gift to family and friends and the positive response I&#x27;ve received from everyone is overwhelming!</li>
            <li>I have started to spot treat some old scars to see if this oil will help reduce them, but in the meantime I am thrilled with the almost instantaneous results!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great facial and hand moisturizer (especially before bed...light and not overly greasy) and it also works great as a hair serum before blow drying (gets rid of fly-aways and makes hair shiny and more manageable).  </li>
            <li>Huge 8 oz glass bottle with glass dropper makes it easy to portion out 1-2 drops.</li>
            <li>I have heard wonderful things about Argan oil for a while now, but this is the first time I have actually used it for any length of time.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell too and is absorbed by the skin fast</li>
            <li>Great for so many uses, one new use i discovered was removing eye makeup gently.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s a big bottle too</li>
            <li>Got this for free during a promo period.</li>
            <li>Feel so moisture and smooth.</li>
            <li>This one is a big bottle, and the dispenser works great (no spill at all).</li>
            <li>I usually do a light exfoliating scrub on the scar them apply the blend.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin and hair rremarkably smooth.</li>
            <li>Available information trends toward inferior results if not processed correctly.</li>
            <li>This stuff is so light and succulent.</li>
            <li>it was not sent to me for free in return for a review.</li>
            <li>and my face has been silky smooth all day.</li>
            <li>Fantastic Oil.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.  </li>

            <li>Light and smooth.</li>
            <li>I just started using this oil and so far so good.  </li>
            <li>It is a great all-around beauty product, at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li>I am a woman over 50 years old always looking for good moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>so far so good</li>
            <li>All statements are of my honest unsolicited feedback as a result of my own personal use.</li>
            <li>but it has made my cuticles look better right away.  </li>
            <li>Its an excellent product to tame the frizz, resolve split ends, add moisture to course hair as well as add shine to the hair.</li>
            <li>It soaks up fairly quickly but not so quickly that you need more.</li>
            <li>but I am so not in love with the price of 100% Pure Argan Oil!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak to the long term effectiveness of this particular Argan Oil, but I can say that it goes on smoothly and feels wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Being a busy mom of three boys; I need products that are all in one, effective, and easy to bring with me on the go.</li>
            <li>This is actually 100% Argan Oil and it is amazing for your hair, skin, and nails!</li>
            <li>I suffer from acne, so I was really excited to start using this oil.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get ready in record-fast time AND the humidity didn&#x27;t make my hair frizz out!</li>
            <li>Week worth the money!</li>
            <li>It is so rich and silky.  </li>
            <li>this has now made a significant difference.</li>
            <li>I have been using Nadira Organic&#x27;s argan oil for about a week on my hair; I have been very pleased with the results so far.  </li>
            <li>So far I have been reading other reviews to get a better gauge of the best way to utilize this product.</li>
            <li>It is great for dry winter skin and hair.</li>
            <li>Also great moisturizer for dry, brittle hair.</li>
            <li>Hopefully I will be able to grow my own nails back out after using this awhile!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Light oil that absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>it feels so nice to use a product that is all natural too!</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and skin more youthful looking!</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into skin and when used on the tips of my hair it makes it soft, shiny and look nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I love 100% Pure Virgin Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li>Pure Argan oil for sure.</li>
            <li>What better to repair hair and nails than something so pure and close to it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I love this product, keeps ur skin looking smooth and vibrant</li>
            <li>Most argan oils are actually full of fillers but this is 100% Pure Virgin Cold-Pressed Argan Oil and that&#x27;s IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am all about natural and what will make my skin feel and look amazing.</li>
            <li>Another thing to love about this brand is you have full control over how much you want to apply with</li>
            <li>I am loving this product so far.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really smell it and that it can be used for so many things.  </li>
            <li>I received this complimentary argan oil for reviewing and testing purposes and this is one fantastic oil.</li>
            <li>It will take some time to see true results.</li>
            <li>If I put too much, my hair does look a bit too oily, so I concentrate it on my ends mostly and not on my scalp.</li>
            <li>I have loved using this product for multiple reasons!</li>
            <li>If you open the bottle and sniff, it doesn&#x27;t smell good</li>
            <li>: One can use argan oil as a full body moisturizer, just like you would use any body cream.  </li>
            <li>There are an overwhelming selection of products available for skin care, therefore it can be very difficult to know which products are best if you want healthy, glowing skin.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad either.</li>
            <li>It has a great dropper which makes it easier to apply and use without making a huge mess.</li>
            <li>We both only need a tiny amount to combat static and to keep our hair shiny and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I have been using Argan oil for some time and this product is cheap and very effective, much more so than some much more expensive oils I have purchased.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs rather quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>I have mild break outs, and this has helped so</li>
            <li>It does absorb quickly and seems to be hydrating well, but the smell is off-putting.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into your skin so quickly without an oily felling.  </li>
            <li>It makes my tattoos so vibrant and leaves my skin so smooth!  </li>
            <li>I was lucky to receive this product under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
            <li>This product dries quickly, and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>I am pregnant and have been putting Nadira Argan Oil on my belly every night before bed for over a month now</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I found a decent oil that doesn&#x27;t cost me a fortune now.</li>
            <li>I have tried others only to be minimally impressed for various reasons.  </li>
            <li>but I found this brand to absorb quickly into the skin within about 10 seconds.  </li>
            <li>The smell is horid but it disappears quickly.</li>
            <li>I am using it everywhere (hair, skin, nails- twice a day), and I go through it too quickly.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve got to try this product to reap the many benefits it offers!!</li>
            <li>I have only ever tried two others, but this one is a far more superior than either of those.</li>
            <li>Nadira&#x27;s organic kind is a must - I aim to buy organic and clean product whenever possible and in existence</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m actually really happy with all the other uses as well!</li>
            <li>It works great, there is a little smell from it, but not bad.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality and overall great oil</li>
            <li>my skin is alway dry and need good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>also the dropper that is with the bottle really helps so that the amount is easily measured.  </li>
            <li>The quality is good and I&#x27;ve used it for my hair and skin, as well as my sons dry skin patches.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for this!!</li>
            <li>I applied it on my face and woke up the next morning to find it in noticeably better condition!</li>
            <li>4.0 oz or 120ml is the exact amount that you will be getting!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how much two drops of this oil did for my hair!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only been two weeks and my hair and skin have never looked better!</li>
            <li>Previously been using lotion, and it was amazing to see how much better Argan oil is.</li>
            <li>This is the ultimate best hair oil for dry hair, or any hair for that matter.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and often break out into hives when using everyday beauty products, so this Organic Argan Oil was PERFECT!  </li>
            <li>The dropper is super helpful in using just the right amount.</li>
            <li>When I had an opportunity to review this product I was so excited because I have used Argan Oil in the past with great results</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a HUGE bottle (4 oz) of 100% Pure Virgin Cold-Pressed Argan Oil  </li>
            <li>It is also great for hair, and I have been rubbing a little on the ends of my hair in the mornings, which helps decrease the amount of frizz.  </li>
            <li>This oil smells fantastic and works really well on my hair.</li>
            <li>It is worth the price.</li>
            <li>It softens without feeling greasy and is very easily absorbed into your skin.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>The price is well worth it for the generous size of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that this Argan oil is perfume-free because I have sensitive skin that often does not pair well with chemicals.</li>
            <li>My hair never felt so soft and it looks and feels so healthy.</li>
            <li>/reviews 100% off of my own personal experience with the product.</li>
            <li>This has a distinct scent to it (being it&#x27;s Argan oil and does not contain any additives for perfume smell).</li>
            <li>Nice big bottle!</li>
            <li>So far I have really enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li>Helps her dyed hair look more natural.</li>
            <li>,and its soft and shinny ,,love this product.</li>
            <li>/reviews 100% off of my own personal experience with the product.</li>
            <li>I also use this allover my body when I&#x27;m fresh out of the shower as a body oil.</li>
            <li>and it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>: Argan oil is an extremely popular hair care product and there are good reasons behind it.</li>
            <li>I then shampoo &amp; condition like normal and my hair seems to retain more moisture afterward (more so than when using regular conditioner alone)</li>
            <li>Overall VERY satisfied and highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I noticed my hair was more soft and manageable after the first application.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair super soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>My dry skin is loving this oil.  </li>
            <li>It washes out easily and leaves hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>many people will know, rosehips are small fruits produced by a certain type of rose.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel wonderful, just know a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I warmed it slightly in hot water by putting it in a plastic bag.</li>
            <li>Just like using a hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisified with this!</li>
            <li>First, I use it as a moisturizer for my hands.</li>
            <li>first time trying the Aragan oil</li>
            <li>I love this oil especially for my hair.  </li>
            <li>so I was hesitant at first to put oil on my face but</li>
            <li>It makes her skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Very big bottle for the price and the oil seems to be top notch.</li>
            <li>When I first looked at the 4 ounce bottle, I thought &amp;#34;wow</li>
            <li>I use this as a hair moisturizer and a carrier oil for my favorite essential oils.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried argan oil</li>
            <li>i love the option it gives me on the various ways to apply the oil to my hair/body.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for weeks now and it helps keep my hair soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li>The only complain I have is that I do not like the medicine dropper dispensing top.</li>
            <li>One product for so many things is key and</li>
            <li>It is such a lovely oil.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>I use this just on the ends of my hair usually, but what I love about it is how versatile it is and how many uses it can have.</li>
            <li>Shipping and delivery was fast and on time!</li>
            <li>I use this in my hair occasionally, its ok</li>
            <li>I love using this oil, especially for my cuticles and nails.</li>
            <li>First</li>
            <li>At first I was hesitant on getting this product.  </li>
            <li>I love Argan oil for it&#x27;s multiple uses.</li>
            <li>It leaves the sink a bit greasy but hot water takes care of that</li>
            <li>Just remember not to use too much or it will leave your hair oily looking!</li>
            <li>Funny</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper than most leave-in conditioners because you only need a drop; plus, I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling weighed-down and greasy.</li>
            <li>I also love to mix a few drops in with my lotion, make my skin look so nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Well this is the same thing - probably a lot better because you can tell how pure it is.  </li>
            <li>, argan oil is a key ingredient in many of them.&lt;br /&gt;Mixed with rosehip seed oil and a little emu oil, it makes an excellent lotion for chapped and cracked hands and feet.&lt;br /&gt;Adding some avocado oil makes it amazing as a pre-wash hair conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Apply to the hair while it is dry (and scalp if you have a dry scalp), then after anywhere from a minute to an hour, shampoo it out for soft, silky hair.</li>
            <li>Only thing is the instructions say use 1-3 drops - I used a lot more than that to cover for my whole head.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair super shiny and soft!</li>
            <li>Makes my hair super soft and manageable!</li>
            <li>Pretty much use it for everything</li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t too much of a smell with it at all!</li>
            <li>My hair is very, very fine and gets really frizzy, so I put a drop of this oil onto my palms, distribute through my dry hair, and leave it in for 20 or so minutes.</li>
            <li>Argan Oil is one such rarity, it comes from a special Argan tree in Morocco and is loaded with Vitamin E!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend and there is no doubt that I will be coming back to purchase more in the future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it for deep conditioning and my hair is super soft and was easy to comb through.</li>
            <li>I tried to apply this oil as many times as needed on dry area of my skin.</li>
            <li>You can leave it in as long as you want, and wrap your hair in saran wrap for an even more intense conditioning.</li>
            <li>The product is light and does not weight my hair down and my skin feel so smooth.</li>
            <li>I am certain I will see a difference I took a before photo</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is 100% pure Virgin Argan oil with nothing added to it.</li>
            <li>Pure argan oil.</li>
            <li>the ingredients: 100% pure organic argan oil that is grade A, cold-pressed and unrefined.  </li>
            <li>I prefer to use pure products in my home and on my body.....</li>
            <li>High Quality Pure Argan Oil!</li>
            <li>Although argan oil is a relatively new and unfamiliar beauty product in the United States, it has actually been a skin care staple for many generations of Mediterranean women.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, I give my dry hair a good drenching once a week with it and leave it overnight for a deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>Argan oil helps in reducing wrinkles and fine lines and getting the glow back to your skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is hard to find 100% Pure Virgin Cold-Pressed Argan Oil From Morocco at a GOOD price but guess what?</li>
            <li>Thanks for the large size of Argan oil</li>
            <li>This marvel is absorbed by really rough skin and cuticles so quickly!</li>
            <li>so much</li>
            <li>I have used it for a month and it is NOT oily but moisturizes really well.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>almost whole body.</li>
            <li>Very moisturing and soothing.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t have any real scent to it.</li>
            <li>Everything is so much softer.</li>
            <li>The oil have a very silky texture.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really hold all the oil in and drips out.</li>
            <li>The oil can be dispensed straight from the bottom or with the use of the stopper-</li>
            <li>I have used it on my cuticles and it is hydrating and absorbing well.  </li>
            <li>It works very well on hair.</li>
            <li>However, this is OIL, so DO NOT use too much or else</li>
            <li>I have been using Moroccan hair oil for two years and decided to go for the real thing without fillers or synthetic fragrance.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>very</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t take much,  </li>
            <li>the stopper in the bottle allows me to control how much oil I use at a time, so I don&#x27;t overdo it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this helps so much</li>
            <li>I can really tell a difference when I use this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I really like the way it makes my skin feels.</li>
            <li>high quality - I use for my hair and skin!</li>
            <li>It felt so much softer, and did not look greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much of the oil, I have short-medium length hair, and I use about a nickel size amount in the palm of my hand.  </li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really notice any difference.</li>
            <li>I really do like it a lot.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and seller!</li>
            <li>This one has almost no detectable scent, and goes on light enough that I can put it on in the morning under my make-up in lieu of moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Fast absorbing.</li>
            <li>Used this on my unruly curls and I really saw a difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several brands but so far this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Its just a tad heavy but still a nice oil.</li>
            <li>I used a little on the dry ends of my hair and the results are beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Live in a hot state and always in the pool.</li>
            <li>As far as I can see right now, I have no stretch marks and this oil is helping tremendously.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I think the next time I have an empty brown bottle with a pump top, I will clean that for use with this Argan oil.</li>
            <li>Additionally it is virtually scent free, which I prefer to some that tend to add powerful flowery or other scents to their brand.  </li>
            <li>skin feels very soft, it feels oily at first</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are many other uses for Argan oil, like treating stretch marks, acne scars, and brittle nails.</li>
            <li>Excited to use this on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this on my long fine hair (but I have a lot of it).  </li>
            <li>The bottle is high quality and has a simple design, and the dropper is clean and efficient.</li>
            <li>The face is smooth, clear and radiant, all thanks to using argan oil as my daily morning</li>
            <li>I am able to style my hair and my hair is not weighed down.  </li>
            <li>Love to use in hair and has slowed down the qty of hair that falls off</li>
            <li>A little oil goes a long way, and I love that it is such a quick and easy addition to my beauty routine.</li>
            <li>(I did a little experiment right before bed, and found that it took 4 drops before my long hair started looking greasy, so make sure you use sparingly!)  </li>
            <li>I use it for my hair and makes my hair look less frizzy and healthy.</li>
            <li>My hair was so dry after I washed it, but I applied some on it, immediately felt smooth and shiny on my hair.</li>
            <li>Smells decent.</li>
            <li>I bought it mainly to curb the acne.</li>
            <li>I have been putting this in mainly my roots</li>
            <li>After applying the oil, my skin feels soft,  smooth and younger.</li>
            <li>I have been using it as a body moisturizer, which has left my skin feeling incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Was lucky enough to get a discount for a review this time.</li>
            <li>I use Argan oil on my face, neck and body, let it soak in for a minute or so and my skin looks vibrant.</li>
            <li>Great packaging by Amazon too - I doubt it could have broken in shipment (unless something smashed the box completely).</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase the product and I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>I was given the opportunity to test and try this product - 100% highly recommend based on quality and performance.</li>
            <li>High quality and makes my hair shiny and healthier than it ever was.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>High quality argan oil.  </li>
            <li>High quality and makes my skin and hair look shiny and healthier than it ever was.</li>
            <li>I received it and couldn&#x27;t wait to try on my face, the texture of the oil&#x27;s light unlike other oils which always makes me feel sticky, this oil quickly absorbed by the skin and my face is smooth after a minute with little message.</li>
            <li>Made my hair uber soft!!</li>
            <li>and my hair is so soft!!</li>
            <li>It really makes my skin feel soft</li>
            <li>I was really surprised at how fast it worked</li>
            <li>Nadira Organics offers what I feel is a very top-of-the line product.  </li>
            <li>So lush, it really pampers your skin.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff I put in on my hair and nails everyday and it feels so hydrating .</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels better, doesn&#x27;t looked all dried up as it looked before.</li>
            <li>Since I had such success on my face, I began using it on my hands and feet....</li>
            <li>The directions say to only use two drops on hair; my first day trying it out, that did not seem like enough, so I used 6 or 7 drops, which was definitely more than enough.  </li>
            <li>This one hardly has a oily feel , goes on light and quickly absorbs in.</li>
            <li>I like to put it on heavily and leave it all day in a braid for super soft hair the next day :)</li>
            <li>The dropper is useful because it only takes a small amount for most uses.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Argan Oil is the new it thing.</li>
            <li>Argan oil has taken a new trend these days.</li>
            <li>Normally my hair and scalp would be extremely dry after all these hot washes, but this oil has really helped my hair and scalp from drying out.</li>
            <li>Unless you have really thick hair you don&#x27;t really need more.</li>
            <li>I actually use this in my hair and really love how it makes it feel :) I have fine thin hair, but it&#x27;s dry and brittle, doesn&#x27;t weigh it down too much!</li>
            <li>feels very natural</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin  and eczema.  </li>
            <li>Even though I love the properties of Argan oil, I was considering not using it any longer because I was having a hard time tolerating the strong fragrance of the other two I have used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying so many different products for my dry skin and have finally found something that really works.  </li>
            <li>so I can only use really hot water to wash my hair.  </li>
            <li>I put it on only one arm first to see if any difference.</li>
            <li>getting close to my significant other while the odor dissipates, causes me  some anxiety.</li>
            <li>At first I was apprehensive about using on my face as I am prone to break outs, especially on my chin.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>There are not many products that are as versatile and beneficial as Argan oil, that can be used on any skin type and is safe for all ages including babies.</li>
            <li>My only regret is that I did not order three or four bottles of this product when I did order my first one.  </li>
            <li>a little bit goes a long way, but it works great on dry and damaged hair!</li>
            <li>I tried this on my very fine hair and it left it limp</li>
            <li>: It might seem unconventional to apply pure argan oil to your face, especially if you have oily prone acne skin, but I have been doing just that</li>
            <li>Seems the same as pure argan oil</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s smelling a little &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34;, I simply put a layer of one of my scented lotions on top.</li>
            <li>I work with my hands, so it&#x27;s always been hard to keep them soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>I use a few drops of this oil on both my skin and hair and it makes a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>HUGE bottle especially since you only need a tiny bit.</li>
            <li>But it keeps skin soft and moistured.</li>
            <li>.it leaves your skin so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>as well it makes your hair soft and shiny...</li>
            <li>it has helped considerably although I need to apply quite frequently.</li>
            <li>and it is BY FAR</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>This oil is moisturized and fixed my hair.</li>
            <li>100% Natural, all organic, one ingredient.</li>
            <li>Completely natural.</li>
            <li>I take the dropper and and 4-6 drops directly to my scalp and comb it through.</li>
            <li>When I wake up the next morning, my face is very moisturized and NOT oily.  </li>
            <li>This oil changed that completely.</li>
            <li>In just minutes, my treated arm and hand was soft and silky.</li>
            <li>So far its been going well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a natural virgin oil with no scents, so</li>
            <li>I have only had the chance of using it a few times, but from what I have used it for, so far I love it.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised by this product and odor, will buy again.</li>
            <li>Wow</li>
            <li>Wow</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seriously... I&#x27;m ready to order the next one to have on hand when this one is done.</li>
            <li>I must have gotten some old expired oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a naturally curly girl who can never keep it under control without crunchy crispy gel.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft and supple.</li>
            <li>Overnight the redness and itching completely subsided.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin incredibly smooth, without the heavy greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>I have been using Nadira for seven weeks now and the scar is nearly gone.  </li>
            <li>This will leave you with really soft, silky, shiny hair that is not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel so soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I also have been using this applied to a soft bristle brush on my goatee.</li>
            <li>I especially like what it&#x27;s doing for my hair, it just looks so much shinier and healthier.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and my hair is beginning to grow.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the size of the glass bottle.</li>
            <li>I can see a marked difference in my hair texture, vitality, shine and softness.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who wants younger looking hair</li>
            <li>enough I googled the odor and that smell (some call it nutty) is an indicator that you&#x27;ve got the real deal (and some agree with my rubber band scent).  </li>
            <li>I even used a drop on my two year old&#x27;s hair who still has baby curls.  </li>
            <li>My hair literally turned to silk after only a few uses of this magical oil.</li>
            <li>If I use too much (I used 10 drops the first time), my hair felt slightly gummy or powdered.</li>
            <li>I have to say my hair is back to normal after a week!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was concerned with using it on my hair, because I have that weird kind of hair that is super dry, but looks oily if I touch it.</li>
            <li>I live in a dry climate and my hair is very damaged.</li>
            <li>The smell is great too and you only need a very small amount so this will last a long time.</li>
            <li>One other thing to mention is that because there is no fragrance, I have been adding a few drops of my lavender essential oil to the bottle and it makes it smell amazing.</li>
            <li>Here in West Texas the air is so dry it really does a number on your skin and hair.</li>
            <li>I also use a little on my skin right after the shower and it absorbs well and keeps my skin soft in the winter.</li>
            <li>I am not brave enough to apply this after my hair dries completely, and I don&#x27;t typically blow-dry or straighten my hair, so I can&#x27;t speak to using this product when styling; however, I will definitely repurchase again although the bottle is so big I&#x27;m pretty sure Hell will freeze over first.</li>
            <li>Unlike lotions that leave your skin dry a few hours later, argan oil makes my skin feel more elastic.</li>
            <li>Most of the other ones have additives making them heavy and slimy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Argan oil in the past, and while I love the oil, I&#x27;ve found other brands to have a strong scent, or to be a bit thick, so I avoided putting it on my face during the day.  </li>
            <li>This Argan oil is light, and thin, and not thick and greasy.</li>
            <li>bottle also seems like it will last me a long time, so it is very cost-effective.  </li>
            <li>I can use it on myself (especially now that it&#x27;s winter) and on my 3 year old.</li>
            <li>There is no expiration date on the bottle, so it is possible the oil is just old.</li>
            <li>I have completely replaced my facial moisturizer with argan oil.</li>
            <li>Two products which are currently gaining favor among natural skin care enthusiasts are rosehip oil and argan oil.</li>
            <li>It makes for a much better and less messy application.</li>
            <li>I am taking a harsh chemo drug right now</li>
            <li>Its not remarkable but its okay enough that I may order again, won&#x27;t call it a must though.</li>
            <li>It soaks in much faster than coconut or other cooking oils when they get on your hands.  </li>
            <li>Primarily I have been looking for an affordable substitute for ridiculously overpriced shaving oils.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a true organic Argan Oil these days.</li>
            <li>Also, I put a small drop in some of my makeup concealers (ABH Cream Contour Palette) to help smooth them out when they start to dry out.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>my face - I have what they call combination skin - a strange mix of dry and oily skin, but I can still use small amounts of oil to make sure I nourish and hydrate my skin before applying daily moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I rub a few drops into the problem area before school and before bed and his hands look normal and have stayed clear of eczema!</li>
            <li>At first, your hair will appear oily, but after just a few moments it will absorb and leave you hair silky, shiny, and smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to be a little careful to wait a few minutes before touching something sensitive to oil, but one has to with lotion as well.  </li>
            <li>i could see how this might get a little messy when using - but so far not bad.  </li>
            <li>The other ones I&#x27;ve bought which were presumedly high quality are gross in comparison.</li>
            <li>Really helped my dry skin and also the dry ends on my hair from using the flat iron quite a bit.  </li>
            <li>I worked in cosmetics for many years, this should be much more expensive !!!</li>
            <li>Like argan oil, rosehip is very high in essential fatty acids.</li>

            <li> Just love it</li>
            <li> Additionally, this product smells more like cooking oil than argan oil.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it, and I use it on everything.</li>
            <li> and since I have been using it (I mix in my hands with my lotion), my skin is softer and SO more moisturized.</li>
            <li> and this is really top quality Argon Oil.</li>
            <li> She adds this to her hair and it looks so shiny and healthy now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also have many allergies to additives in lotions</li>
            <li> But I am perfectly OK with that.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and oily feeling like most oils.</li>
            <li> Wish dropper held more.</li>
            <li> I love Argan oil.</li>

            <li> I used some on my cuticles though I felt the results were more temporary.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this Argan oil on my hair but mostly my skin.</li>

            <li> I have used it on my daughter&#x27;s hair because her ends get dry and also on my hands and the results have been great!</li>
            <li> so much better and more practical than spending hundreds of dollars on creams and conditioners filled with chemicals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> THE BEST PRODUCT I have ever used for my dry skin and complextion!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect to use it in this dry cool weather in Texas!</li>
            <li> My daughters have very dry hair, and it is a great conditioner!  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been great so far.</li>
            <li> I use it in my hair mostly, because I am going Natural with it, and this oil is amazing!</li>
            <li> I love that the oil is scent free, and although it&#x27;s an oil, it&#x27;s not oily.  </li>
            <li> So far im happy with this product.</li>
            <li> When you have a good idea of how much to use, you can do it on damp hair.</li>
            <li> It is good for your whole body</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my cracked heels and have been very successful reducing how dry they have been!</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of oil and argan oil is also one of the oils I was very excited to try.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and healthy now!!  </li>
            <li> Great shipping and these bottles are pretty big, so the value is good, too.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item for perspective as someone that has never had the chance to experience trying it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> most original state?</li>
            <li> The dropper makes it easy to control delivery, and it&#x27;s a moisturizing but not oily feeling.</li>
            <li> it dries easily and does not fee greasy.  </li>
            <li> The size compared to the price is exceptional and it works to moisturize my skin very well after a peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had heard many things great things about this product, so I decided to finally try it.  </li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t really have a scent and feels amazing on my skin.</li>
            <li> Rubs in easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the oil itself does not have strong smell and blends in the skin as I massage it on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> Good product, works as described, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> also gave this product as a Christmas gift to family and friends and the positive response I&#x27;ve received from everyone is overwhelming!</li>
            <li> I have started to spot treat some old scars to see if this oil will help reduce them, but in the meantime I am thrilled with the almost instantaneous results!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great facial and hand moisturizer (especially before bed...light and not overly greasy) and it also works great as a hair serum before blow drying (gets rid of fly-aways and makes hair shiny and more manageable).  </li>
            <li> Huge 8 oz glass bottle with glass dropper makes it easy to portion out 1-2 drops.</li>
            <li> I have heard wonderful things about Argan oil for a while now, but this is the first time I have actually used it for any length of time.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell too and is absorbed by the skin fast</li>
            <li> Great for so many uses, one new use i discovered was removing eye makeup gently.  </li>

            <li> Just a couple of drops leaves my face silky smooth</li>
            <li> It keeps it smooth and shiney.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have finally found something that&#x27;s so versatile!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s a big bottle too</li>
            <li> Got this for free during a promo period.</li>
            <li> Feel so moisture and smooth.</li>
            <li> This one is a big bottle, and the dispenser works great (no spill at all).</li>
            <li> I usually do a light exfoliating scrub on the scar them apply the blend.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin and hair rremarkably smooth.</li>
            <li> Available information trends toward inferior results if not processed correctly.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so light and succulent.</li>
            <li> it was not sent to me for free in return for a review.</li>
            <li> and my face has been silky smooth all day.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Oil.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Has a light nutty smell.</li>
            <li> Light and smooth.</li>
            <li> I just started using this oil and so far so good.  </li>
            <li> It is a great all-around beauty product, at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li> I am a woman over 50 years old always looking for good moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> so far so good</li>
            <li> All statements are of my honest unsolicited feedback as a result of my own personal use.</li>
            <li> but it has made my cuticles look better right away.  </li>
            <li> Its an excellent product to tame the frizz, resolve split ends, add moisture to course hair as well as add shine to the hair.</li>
            <li> It soaks up fairly quickly but not so quickly that you need more.</li>
            <li> but I am so not in love with the price of 100% Pure Argan Oil!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to the long term effectiveness of this particular Argan Oil, but I can say that it goes on smoothly and feels wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Being a busy mom of three boys; I need products that are all in one, effective, and easy to bring with me on the go.</li>
            <li> This is actually 100% Argan Oil and it is amazing for your hair, skin, and nails!</li>
            <li> I suffer from acne, so I was really excited to start using this oil.  </li>
            <li> I was able to get ready in record-fast time AND the humidity didn&#x27;t make my hair frizz out!</li>
            <li> Week worth the money!</li>
            <li> It is so rich and silky.  </li>
            <li> this has now made a significant difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nadira Organic&#x27;s argan oil for about a week on my hair; I have been very pleased with the results so far.  </li>
            <li> So far I have been reading other reviews to get a better gauge of the best way to utilize this product.</li>
            <li> It is great for dry winter skin and hair.</li>
            <li> Also great moisturizer for dry, brittle hair.</li>
            <li> Hopefully I will be able to grow my own nails back out after using this awhile!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Light oil that absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> it feels so nice to use a product that is all natural too!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and skin more youthful looking!</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into skin and when used on the tips of my hair it makes it soft, shiny and look nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love 100% Pure Virgin Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li> Pure Argan oil for sure.</li>
            <li> What better to repair hair and nails than something so pure and close to it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I love this product, keeps ur skin looking smooth and vibrant</li>
            <li> Most argan oils are actually full of fillers but this is 100% Pure Virgin Cold-Pressed Argan Oil and that&#x27;s IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am all about natural and what will make my skin feel and look amazing.</li>
            <li> Another thing to love about this brand is you have full control over how much you want to apply with</li>
            <li> I am loving this product so far.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really smell it and that it can be used for so many things.  </li>
            <li> I received this complimentary argan oil for reviewing and testing purposes and this is one fantastic oil.</li>
            <li> It will take some time to see true results.</li>
            <li> If I put too much, my hair does look a bit too oily, so I concentrate it on my ends mostly and not on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I have loved using this product for multiple reasons!</li>
            <li> If you open the bottle and sniff, it doesn&#x27;t smell good</li>
            <li> : One can use argan oil as a full body moisturizer, just like you would use any body cream.  </li>
            <li> There are an overwhelming selection of products available for skin care, therefore it can be very difficult to know which products are best if you want healthy, glowing skin.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not bad either.</li>
            <li> It has a great dropper which makes it easier to apply and use without making a huge mess.</li>
            <li> We both only need a tiny amount to combat static and to keep our hair shiny and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I have been using Argan oil for some time and this product is cheap and very effective, much more so than some much more expensive oils I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs rather quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I have mild break outs, and this has helped so</li>
            <li> It does absorb quickly and seems to be hydrating well, but the smell is off-putting.</li>
            <li> It absorbs into your skin so quickly without an oily felling.  </li>
            <li> It makes my tattoos so vibrant and leaves my skin so smooth!  </li>
            <li> I was lucky to receive this product under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
            <li> This product dries quickly, and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> I am pregnant and have been putting Nadira Argan Oil on my belly every night before bed for over a month now</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I found a decent oil that doesn&#x27;t cost me a fortune now.</li>
            <li> I have tried others only to be minimally impressed for various reasons.  </li>
            <li> but I found this brand to absorb quickly into the skin within about 10 seconds.  </li>
            <li> The smell is horid but it disappears quickly.</li>
            <li> I am using it everywhere (hair, skin, nails- twice a day), and I go through it too quickly.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve got to try this product to reap the many benefits it offers!!</li>
            <li> I have only ever tried two others, but this one is a far more superior than either of those.</li>
            <li> Nadira&#x27;s organic kind is a must - I aim to buy organic and clean product whenever possible and in existence</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m actually really happy with all the other uses as well!</li>
            <li> It works great, there is a little smell from it, but not bad.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality and overall great oil</li>
            <li> my skin is alway dry and need good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> also the dropper that is with the bottle really helps so that the amount is easily measured.  </li>
            <li> The quality is good and I&#x27;ve used it for my hair and skin, as well as my sons dry skin patches.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for this!!</li>
            <li> I applied it on my face and woke up the next morning to find it in noticeably better condition!</li>
            <li> 4.0 oz or 120ml is the exact amount that you will be getting!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how much two drops of this oil did for my hair!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been two weeks and my hair and skin have never looked better!</li>
            <li> Previously been using lotion, and it was amazing to see how much better Argan oil is.</li>
            <li> This is the ultimate best hair oil for dry hair, or any hair for that matter.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and often break out into hives when using everyday beauty products, so this Organic Argan Oil was PERFECT!  </li>
            <li> The dropper is super helpful in using just the right amount.</li>
            <li> When I had an opportunity to review this product I was so excited because I have used Argan Oil in the past with great results</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a HUGE bottle (4 oz) of 100% Pure Virgin Cold-Pressed Argan Oil  </li>
            <li> It is also great for hair, and I have been rubbing a little on the ends of my hair in the mornings, which helps decrease the amount of frizz.  </li>
            <li> This oil smells fantastic and works really well on my hair.</li>
            <li> It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> It softens without feeling greasy and is very easily absorbed into your skin.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> The price is well worth it for the generous size of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that this Argan oil is perfume-free because I have sensitive skin that often does not pair well with chemicals.</li>
            <li> My hair never felt so soft and it looks and feels so healthy.</li>
            <li> /reviews 100% off of my own personal experience with the product.</li>
            <li> This has a distinct scent to it (being it&#x27;s Argan oil and does not contain any additives for perfume smell).</li>
            <li> Nice big bottle!</li>
            <li> So far I have really enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li> Helps her dyed hair look more natural.</li>
            <li> ,and its soft and shinny ,,love this product.</li>
            <li> /reviews 100% off of my own personal experience with the product.</li>
            <li> I also use this allover my body when I&#x27;m fresh out of the shower as a body oil.</li>
            <li> and it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> : Argan oil is an extremely popular hair care product and there are good reasons behind it.</li>
            <li> I then shampoo &amp; condition like normal and my hair seems to retain more moisture afterward (more so than when using regular conditioner alone)</li>
            <li> Overall VERY satisfied and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I noticed my hair was more soft and manageable after the first application.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair super soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> My dry skin is loving this oil.  </li>
            <li> It washes out easily and leaves hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> many people will know, rosehips are small fruits produced by a certain type of rose.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel wonderful, just know a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I warmed it slightly in hot water by putting it in a plastic bag.</li>
            <li> Just like using a hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisified with this!</li>
            <li> First, I use it as a moisturizer for my hands.</li>
            <li> first time trying the Aragan oil</li>
            <li> I love this oil especially for my hair.  </li>
            <li> so I was hesitant at first to put oil on my face but</li>
            <li> It makes her skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Very big bottle for the price and the oil seems to be top notch.</li>
            <li> When I first looked at the 4 ounce bottle, I thought &amp;#34;wow</li>
            <li> I use this as a hair moisturizer and a carrier oil for my favorite essential oils.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried argan oil</li>
            <li> i love the option it gives me on the various ways to apply the oil to my hair/body.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for weeks now and it helps keep my hair soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li> The only complain I have is that I do not like the medicine dropper dispensing top.</li>
            <li> One product for so many things is key and</li>
            <li> It is such a lovely oil.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> I use this just on the ends of my hair usually, but what I love about it is how versatile it is and how many uses it can have.</li>
            <li> Shipping and delivery was fast and on time!</li>
            <li> I use this in my hair occasionally, its ok</li>
            <li> I love using this oil, especially for my cuticles and nails.</li>
            <li> First</li>
            <li> At first I was hesitant on getting this product.  </li>
            <li> I love Argan oil for it&#x27;s multiple uses.</li>
            <li> It leaves the sink a bit greasy but hot water takes care of that</li>
            <li> Just remember not to use too much or it will leave your hair oily looking!</li>
            <li> Funny</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper than most leave-in conditioners because you only need a drop; plus, I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling weighed-down and greasy.</li>
            <li> I also love to mix a few drops in with my lotion, make my skin look so nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Well this is the same thing - probably a lot better because you can tell how pure it is.  </li>
            <li> , argan oil is a key ingredient in many of them.&lt;br /&gt;Mixed with rosehip seed oil and a little emu oil, it makes an excellent lotion for chapped and cracked hands and feet.&lt;br /&gt;Adding some avocado oil makes it amazing as a pre-wash hair conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Apply to the hair while it is dry (and scalp if you have a dry scalp), then after anywhere from a minute to an hour, shampoo it out for soft, silky hair.</li>
            <li> Only thing is the instructions say use 1-3 drops - I used a lot more than that to cover for my whole head.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair super shiny and soft!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair super soft and manageable!</li>
            <li> Pretty much use it for everything</li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t too much of a smell with it at all!</li>
            <li> My hair is very, very fine and gets really frizzy, so I put a drop of this oil onto my palms, distribute through my dry hair, and leave it in for 20 or so minutes.</li>
            <li> Argan Oil is one such rarity, it comes from a special Argan tree in Morocco and is loaded with Vitamin E!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend and there is no doubt that I will be coming back to purchase more in the future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it for deep conditioning and my hair is super soft and was easy to comb through.</li>
            <li> I tried to apply this oil as many times as needed on dry area of my skin.</li>
            <li> You can leave it in as long as you want, and wrap your hair in saran wrap for an even more intense conditioning.</li>
            <li> The product is light and does not weight my hair down and my skin feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> I am certain I will see a difference I took a before photo</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is 100% pure Virgin Argan oil with nothing added to it.</li>
            <li> Pure argan oil.</li>
            <li> the ingredients: 100% pure organic argan oil that is grade A, cold-pressed and unrefined.  </li>
            <li> I prefer to use pure products in my home and on my body.....</li>
            <li> High Quality Pure Argan Oil!</li>
            <li> Although argan oil is a relatively new and unfamiliar beauty product in the United States, it has actually been a skin care staple for many generations of Mediterranean women.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, I give my dry hair a good drenching once a week with it and leave it overnight for a deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> Argan oil helps in reducing wrinkles and fine lines and getting the glow back to your skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is hard to find 100% Pure Virgin Cold-Pressed Argan Oil From Morocco at a GOOD price but guess what?</li>
            <li> Thanks for the large size of Argan oil</li>
            <li> This marvel is absorbed by really rough skin and cuticles so quickly!</li>
            <li> so much</li>
            <li> I have used it for a month and it is NOT oily but moisturizes really well.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> almost whole body.</li>
            <li> Very moisturing and soothing.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t have any real scent to it.</li>
            <li> Everything is so much softer.</li>
            <li> The oil have a very silky texture.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really hold all the oil in and drips out.</li>
            <li> The oil can be dispensed straight from the bottom or with the use of the stopper-</li>
            <li> I have used it on my cuticles and it is hydrating and absorbing well.  </li>
            <li> It works very well on hair.</li>
            <li> However, this is OIL, so DO NOT use too much or else</li>
            <li> I have been using Moroccan hair oil for two years and decided to go for the real thing without fillers or synthetic fragrance.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> very</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t take much,  </li>
            <li> the stopper in the bottle allows me to control how much oil I use at a time, so I don&#x27;t overdo it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this helps so much</li>
            <li> I can really tell a difference when I use this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I really like the way it makes my skin feels.</li>
            <li> high quality - I use for my hair and skin!</li>
            <li> It felt so much softer, and did not look greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much of the oil, I have short-medium length hair, and I use about a nickel size amount in the palm of my hand.  </li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really notice any difference.</li>
            <li> I really do like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and seller!</li>
            <li> This one has almost no detectable scent, and goes on light enough that I can put it on in the morning under my make-up in lieu of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Fast absorbing.</li>
            <li> Used this on my unruly curls and I really saw a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several brands but so far this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Its just a tad heavy but still a nice oil.</li>
            <li> I used a little on the dry ends of my hair and the results are beautiful.  </li>
            <li> Live in a hot state and always in the pool.</li>
            <li> As far as I can see right now, I have no stretch marks and this oil is helping tremendously.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I think the next time I have an empty brown bottle with a pump top, I will clean that for use with this Argan oil.</li>
            <li> Additionally it is virtually scent free, which I prefer to some that tend to add powerful flowery or other scents to their brand.  </li>
            <li> skin feels very soft, it feels oily at first</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are many other uses for Argan oil, like treating stretch marks, acne scars, and brittle nails.</li>
            <li> Excited to use this on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my long fine hair (but I have a lot of it).  </li>
            <li> The bottle is high quality and has a simple design, and the dropper is clean and efficient.</li>
            <li> The face is smooth, clear and radiant, all thanks to using argan oil as my daily morning</li>
            <li> I am able to style my hair and my hair is not weighed down.  </li>
            <li> Love to use in hair and has slowed down the qty of hair that falls off</li>
            <li> A little oil goes a long way, and I love that it is such a quick and easy addition to my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> (I did a little experiment right before bed, and found that it took 4 drops before my long hair started looking greasy, so make sure you use sparingly!)  </li>
            <li> I use it for my hair and makes my hair look less frizzy and healthy.</li>
            <li> My hair was so dry after I washed it, but I applied some on it, immediately felt smooth and shiny on my hair.</li>
            <li> Smells decent.</li>
            <li> I bought it mainly to curb the acne.</li>
            <li> I have been putting this in mainly my roots</li>
            <li> After applying the oil, my skin feels soft,  smooth and younger.</li>
            <li> I have been using it as a body moisturizer, which has left my skin feeling incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Was lucky enough to get a discount for a review this time.</li>
            <li> I use Argan oil on my face, neck and body, let it soak in for a minute or so and my skin looks vibrant.</li>
            <li> Great packaging by Amazon too - I doubt it could have broken in shipment (unless something smashed the box completely).</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase the product and I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to test and try this product - 100% highly recommend based on quality and performance.</li>
            <li> High quality and makes my hair shiny and healthier than it ever was.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> High quality argan oil.  </li>
            <li> High quality and makes my skin and hair look shiny and healthier than it ever was.</li>
            <li> I received it and couldn&#x27;t wait to try on my face, the texture of the oil&#x27;s light unlike other oils which always makes me feel sticky, this oil quickly absorbed by the skin and my face is smooth after a minute with little message.</li>
            <li> Made my hair uber soft!!</li>
            <li> and my hair is so soft!!</li>
            <li> It really makes my skin feel soft</li>
            <li> I was really surprised at how fast it worked</li>
            <li> Nadira Organics offers what I feel is a very top-of-the line product.  </li>
            <li> So lush, it really pampers your skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff I put in on my hair and nails everyday and it feels so hydrating .</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels better, doesn&#x27;t looked all dried up as it looked before.</li>
            <li> Since I had such success on my face, I began using it on my hands and feet....</li>
            <li> The directions say to only use two drops on hair; my first day trying it out, that did not seem like enough, so I used 6 or 7 drops, which was definitely more than enough.  </li>
            <li> This one hardly has a oily feel , goes on light and quickly absorbs in.</li>
            <li> I like to put it on heavily and leave it all day in a braid for super soft hair the next day :)</li>
            <li> The dropper is useful because it only takes a small amount for most uses.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Argan Oil is the new it thing.</li>
            <li> Argan oil has taken a new trend these days.</li>
            <li> Normally my hair and scalp would be extremely dry after all these hot washes, but this oil has really helped my hair and scalp from drying out.</li>
            <li> Unless you have really thick hair you don&#x27;t really need more.</li>
            <li> I actually use this in my hair and really love how it makes it feel :) I have fine thin hair, but it&#x27;s dry and brittle, doesn&#x27;t weigh it down too much!</li>
            <li> feels very natural</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin  and eczema.  </li>
            <li> Even though I love the properties of Argan oil, I was considering not using it any longer because I was having a hard time tolerating the strong fragrance of the other two I have used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying so many different products for my dry skin and have finally found something that really works.  </li>
            <li> so I can only use really hot water to wash my hair.  </li>
            <li> I put it on only one arm first to see if any difference.</li>
            <li> getting close to my significant other while the odor dissipates, causes me  some anxiety.</li>
            <li> At first I was apprehensive about using on my face as I am prone to break outs, especially on my chin.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> There are not many products that are as versatile and beneficial as Argan oil, that can be used on any skin type and is safe for all ages including babies.</li>
            <li> My only regret is that I did not order three or four bottles of this product when I did order my first one.  </li>
            <li> a little bit goes a long way, but it works great on dry and damaged hair!</li>
            <li> I tried this on my very fine hair and it left it limp</li>
            <li> : It might seem unconventional to apply pure argan oil to your face, especially if you have oily prone acne skin, but I have been doing just that</li>
            <li> Seems the same as pure argan oil</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s smelling a little &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34;, I simply put a layer of one of my scented lotions on top.</li>
            <li> I work with my hands, so it&#x27;s always been hard to keep them soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> I use a few drops of this oil on both my skin and hair and it makes a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> HUGE bottle especially since you only need a tiny bit.</li>
            <li> But it keeps skin soft and moistured.</li>
            <li> .it leaves your skin so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> as well it makes your hair soft and shiny...</li>
            <li> it has helped considerably although I need to apply quite frequently.</li>
            <li> and it is BY FAR</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> This oil is moisturized and fixed my hair.</li>
            <li> 100% Natural, all organic, one ingredient.</li>
            <li> Completely natural.</li>
            <li> I take the dropper and and 4-6 drops directly to my scalp and comb it through.</li>
            <li> When I wake up the next morning, my face is very moisturized and NOT oily.  </li>
            <li> This oil changed that completely.</li>
            <li> In just minutes, my treated arm and hand was soft and silky.</li>
            <li> So far its been going well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a natural virgin oil with no scents, so</li>
            <li> I have only had the chance of using it a few times, but from what I have used it for, so far I love it.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised by this product and odor, will buy again.</li>
            <li> Wow</li>
            <li> Wow</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously... I&#x27;m ready to order the next one to have on hand when this one is done.</li>
            <li> I must have gotten some old expired oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a naturally curly girl who can never keep it under control without crunchy crispy gel.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Overnight the redness and itching completely subsided.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin incredibly smooth, without the heavy greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nadira for seven weeks now and the scar is nearly gone.  </li>
            <li> This will leave you with really soft, silky, shiny hair that is not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel so soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I also have been using this applied to a soft bristle brush on my goatee.</li>
            <li> I especially like what it&#x27;s doing for my hair, it just looks so much shinier and healthier.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and my hair is beginning to grow.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the size of the glass bottle.</li>
            <li> I can see a marked difference in my hair texture, vitality, shine and softness.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who wants younger looking hair</li>
            <li> enough I googled the odor and that smell (some call it nutty) is an indicator that you&#x27;ve got the real deal (and some agree with my rubber band scent).  </li>
            <li> I even used a drop on my two year old&#x27;s hair who still has baby curls.  </li>
            <li> My hair literally turned to silk after only a few uses of this magical oil.</li>
            <li> If I use too much (I used 10 drops the first time), my hair felt slightly gummy or powdered.</li>
            <li> I have to say my hair is back to normal after a week!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was concerned with using it on my hair, because I have that weird kind of hair that is super dry, but looks oily if I touch it.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate and my hair is very damaged.</li>
            <li> The smell is great too and you only need a very small amount so this will last a long time.</li>
            <li> One other thing to mention is that because there is no fragrance, I have been adding a few drops of my lavender essential oil to the bottle and it makes it smell amazing.</li>
            <li> Here in West Texas the air is so dry it really does a number on your skin and hair.</li>
            <li> I also use a little on my skin right after the shower and it absorbs well and keeps my skin soft in the winter.</li>
            <li> I am not brave enough to apply this after my hair dries completely, and I don&#x27;t typically blow-dry or straighten my hair, so I can&#x27;t speak to using this product when styling; however, I will definitely repurchase again although the bottle is so big I&#x27;m pretty sure Hell will freeze over first.</li>
            <li> Unlike lotions that leave your skin dry a few hours later, argan oil makes my skin feel more elastic.</li>
            <li> Most of the other ones have additives making them heavy and slimy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Argan oil in the past, and while I love the oil, I&#x27;ve found other brands to have a strong scent, or to be a bit thick, so I avoided putting it on my face during the day.  </li>
            <li> This Argan oil is light, and thin, and not thick and greasy.</li>
            <li> bottle also seems like it will last me a long time, so it is very cost-effective.  </li>
            <li> I can use it on myself (especially now that it&#x27;s winter) and on my 3 year old.</li>
            <li> There is no expiration date on the bottle, so it is possible the oil is just old.</li>
            <li> I have completely replaced my facial moisturizer with argan oil.</li>
            <li> Two products which are currently gaining favor among natural skin care enthusiasts are rosehip oil and argan oil.</li>
            <li> It makes for a much better and less messy application.</li>
            <li> I am taking a harsh chemo drug right now</li>
            <li> Its not remarkable but its okay enough that I may order again, won&#x27;t call it a must though.</li>
            <li> It soaks in much faster than coconut or other cooking oils when they get on your hands.  </li>
            <li> Primarily I have been looking for an affordable substitute for ridiculously overpriced shaving oils.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a true organic Argan Oil these days.</li>
            <li> Also, I put a small drop in some of my makeup concealers (ABH Cream Contour Palette) to help smooth them out when they start to dry out.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> my face - I have what they call combination skin - a strange mix of dry and oily skin, but I can still use small amounts of oil to make sure I nourish and hydrate my skin before applying daily moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I rub a few drops into the problem area before school and before bed and his hands look normal and have stayed clear of eczema!</li>
            <li> At first, your hair will appear oily, but after just a few moments it will absorb and leave you hair silky, shiny, and smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to be a little careful to wait a few minutes before touching something sensitive to oil, but one has to with lotion as well.  </li>
            <li> i could see how this might get a little messy when using - but so far not bad.  </li>
            <li> The other ones I&#x27;ve bought which were presumedly high quality are gross in comparison.</li>
            <li> Really helped my dry skin and also the dry ends on my hair from using the flat iron quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> I worked in cosmetics for many years, this should be much more expensive !!!</li>
            <li> Like argan oil, rosehip is very high in essential fatty acids.</li>
            <li> My hair had been extremely shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> hair serum before flat ironing (just 2 drops!)&lt;br /&gt;mixing with essential oils</li>
            <li> Lastly this is a generous 4 ounces which will last quite a long time, and yet is twice the size of some others that are at the same price point.  </li>
            <li> The smell is a little funny, maybe that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> and the jar is big enough to last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> It absorbs nicely so he isn&#x27;t left with that greasy feeling of the thick creams and lotions he dislikes so much!</li>
            <li> I really thought it was going to be small.</li>
            <li> It smells a bit &amp;#34;masculine&amp;#34; to me, but the scent does not last long after application.  </li>
            <li> This is going to last a long time.</li>
            <li> that will last you a really really long time.</li>
            <li> I love that it is truly all natural, and not filled with a list of complicated ingredients.</li>
            <li> For my hair, I use it to avoid getting split ends - just few drops rubbed between my hands and applied to wet hair guarantee healthy and thick</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and shiny without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Because of that, especially in the dry winter months, my hands are dry, scaly, and often the skin cracks open and causes sores.</li>
            <li> It constantly takes a beating from straighteners, blow dryers, and products, leaving it dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> those who came here looking for it for your hair, as a deep conditioning you would want to apply it to dry hair and to the ends only, unless you have a dry scalp, then you can apply to your scalp.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look and feel so refreshed and doesn&#x27;t have the feeling of being dry 10 minutes later as my face moisturizer used to.</li>
            <li> The oil is heavy enough to combat dryness but not heavy that it causes skin problems.</li>
            <li> I can use a few drops on my hands and it sinks in fairly fast.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit surprised by the strong, unpleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry from being outside in the sun.</li>
            <li> Unlike other oils, it doesn&#x27;t feel thick or slimy and sinks in rather quickly.</li>
            <li> Somehow my hands stayed softer all day long.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t remain in your hair too long, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it being greasy.</li>
            <li> been using it on long curly hair.</li>
            <li> This is natural so use a few drops for your hair</li>
            <li> It keeps my arms and hands hydrated for long periods.  </li>
            <li> He has long, color-treated hair.  </li>
            <li> Others I have tried did not nearly come close, to the point I am wiping oil OFF my hands.  </li>
            <li> It goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I put this in my super long and thick hair after getting out of the shower, added a little mousse, then let my hair airdry...</li>
            <li> FYI, just to get an idea of my hair type, I&#x27;m mixed with black, Indian &amp; Spanish</li>
            <li> I think I was sent an old bottle because it has a very bitter or sour smell to it.</li>
            <li> and it goes a long way!</li>
            <li> due to its multiple benefits it has become quite in demand.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it on my hair, but after reading the other reviews I&#x27;m going to give that a try next!</li>
            <li> Argan oil has a very distinguishable smell (kinda odd smell... not a good one), but it doesn&#x27;t last so not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I primrily use this on my face as I get a lot of dry spots during the day and</li>
            <li> My hair and skin get so dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> the dry winter air made me give it a try.</li>

            <li> I will use this for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> just dry.</li>
            <li> I get a couple of dry patches on my face if I do not</li>
            <li> I also started using it on my hands and toes to help with the dry skin around my nails.</li>
            <li> Just a miracle, for scars, bruises, dry really dry skin etc.</li>
            <li> It only takes a few drops, so one bottle will last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it 3 different times decreasing the amount each time and still left with heavy, greasy hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, curly hair that has natural frizz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to get rid of all my chemical-based beauty products and move to organic, all-natural, single ingredient products.  </li>
            <li> My hair tends to get a little dry and frizzy due to daily use of a hair dryer and frequent washing, and I have tried other oils before, but I must say, this product has given me the softest hair yet!  </li>
            <li> I have long hair, past the middle of my back.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s unbelievable how soft and moisturized my skin is.</li>

            <li> This extremely dry winter air is causing my hands and face to be really tight and overall</li>

            <li> My hair is less likely to tangle when I use it too!</li>
            <li> I put this on wet hair after shampooing and then just let it air dry.</li>
            <li> I also used a bit in the ends of my hair because they are very dry and frizzy and even tho</li>
            <li> I use a lot of oil on my children they have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I mixed a little bit with shea butter and apply it to the scars on my tummy (from getting my gallbladder removed).</li>
            <li> however you use so little that it feels like this will last forever.</li>
            <li> My hair is rather long, and the lower half tends to be dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> The other arm and hand was dry feeling.</li>
            <li> I can not speak to the oil&#x27;s ability to help acne or the other effects of the oil since I purchased it specifically for my dry hands.  </li>
            <li> Her skin and hair feels freat, and being a guy, I never really notice a difference…</li>
            <li> When my hair is wet</li>
            <li> Leaves you feeling moisturized, but not really oily.</li>
            <li> ; that was expected wasn&#x27;t there.</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful.  </li>
            <li> If you have curly, coarse, thick hair, look no further - this stuff WORKS.</li>
            <li> I also love using it on my skin, especially the past few weeks with all of the cold weather</li>
            <li> Minus one star for difficulty dispensing as a few drops go a long way.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use this on my hair and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> And a little goes a LONG way!  </li>
            <li> There are other uses mentioned on the bottle like moisturizing your skin etc.</li>
            <li> The oil does not smell like it&#x27;s been fragranced as some other ones on the market.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This product goes a long way with just a few drops.</li>
            <li> and I was curious to see if this one stood up to them!</li>
            <li> I cannot believe the difference with this oil compared to other Argan oils I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> My hair has lost all moisture in it due to the weather and when I wash my hair it still feels grimey.</li>
            <li> Other than I&#x27;ve had to play with it when using on my hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy like other oils.  </li>
            <li> I use it every other day or so after I shower and</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I usually apply it to my hair after shower while it is still a bit damp for an all over deep treatment or just take a few drops and apply to the ends after you blow dry your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to be very careful what I use.</li>
            <li> I am plagued with dry skin in the winter and a few drops of this oil is like a miracle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Scalp: If you have a dry or itchy scalp, dab a few drops of argan oil on to a cotton ball apply to your scalp.</li>
            <li> I use it after washing my hair and to tame frizzies when my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> Only downside is that it is not easily portable and not easily applied after each wash of the hands.  </li>
            <li> The only reason this isn&#x27;t 5 stars is because the dropper makes it a little difficult to use directly.</li>
            <li> Absolute game changer for my skin!</li>
            <li> You only need a few small drops when applying.</li>
            <li> My only complaint here is that the dropper drips without squeezing it.</li>
            <li> It heals my dark spots while it takes care of my eczema.  </li>
            <li> My son has eczema and it works so well without irritating his sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just smells sour.</li>
            <li> The product I received smells sour.</li>
            <li> I will not put sour smelling oil on my face...</li>
            <li> I have sasquatch-esque beard growth and it is thick, coarse and prickly.</li>
            <li> It has definitely been shinier and less frizzy lately.</li>
            <li> Keeps the frizz away and defines my curls but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down .</li>
            <li> I use this on everyone in our family, from my hair all the way down to my 2 year olds face.</li>
            <li> Way less frizzy and split ends are less noticable.</li>
            <li> There are 11 ingredients listed on the bottle; half of which I can&#x27;t pronounce.</li>
            <li> I put it in my hair for half an hour and wear a cap to keep the heat in.</li>
            <li> The oil itself is slightly yellowy, but the color does not skin your hair or skin when used.</li>
            <li> I am such a fain of this oil that  I have paid ridiculous amounts of money to get it.  </li>
            <li> I have used it directly so far on my face and it was surprisingly not oily and was moisturizing!</li>
            <li> A little weighed down but not greasy.  </li>
            <li> There is a little bit of an adjustment period while your skin learns to produce less oil</li>
            <li> The dropper however comes apart if you screw the cap on too tightly</li>
            <li> Skin does not feel tight and itchy anymore.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops of Argan oil in my hands, rub them together and distribute it throughout the lower half of my hair.</li>
            <li> I use a little on my hair every day.  </li>
            <li> my hair is softer and shinier, my skin smoother, and the little bit of acne I had around</li>
            <li> i put a little on my ends to seal them</li>
            <li> I use this a little bit of everywhere.</li>
            <li> considering how little you need of</li>
            <li> The ingredients listed are:  100% pure, virgin, grade-A, organic, cold pressed argan oil.</li>
            <li> I also use it to moisturize my hands because it has been cracking so much because of the cold weather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying a few drops to my face and hair overnight</li>
            <li> I also apply a few drops in my hands to massage the ends of my hair with.</li>
            <li> I use Argan Oil everyday...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s rather messy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days now</li>
            <li> but after a few hours it oil disappear, but the skin feels moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I had no allergy trouble with the Argan oil</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and I just add a few drops to my conditioner.</li>
            <li> Yesterday, I painted my nails and after they dried for a few minutes, I topped my nails and cuticles with it and it kept my polish from &amp;#34;nicking&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve started using this Argan Oil, it&#x27;s prolonging my tan by a few days.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nadira for a few weeks now, and have noticeably seen an improvement in my skin texture and hair hydration.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of the smell</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this and try adding another oil to it as I do not enjoy the plain scent of it.. will update my review.</li>
            <li> I also like that there is no strong scent</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not strong</li>
            <li> Absorbs very quickly - never greasy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft,it&#x27;s tame</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my hands, feet, and on the tips of my hair to tame the frizz and prevent split ends.</li>
            <li> This cold and snowy winter has been brutal on my nails, and I have seen a great difference after putting this oil on every morning for a week.</li>
            <li> use this one my hand when they get dry and cracked, my thumb is the worse.</li>
            <li> I have thick brunette hair while my daughter has thin blonde curly hair.</li>
            <li> It has the typical argan smell, but it doesn&#x27;t smell like manure like some do, but it&#x27;s also not super expensive like some other ones.</li>
            <li> I usually use Josie Maran&#x27;s argan oil but decided to try to find something cheaper on amazon.</li>
            <li> nails seen stronger and are not splitting as usual.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve also hardly had any breakouts.  </li>
            <li> have a really hard time growing my hair out</li>
            <li> I got it about 15 years ago and it had been seeming (to me at least) like it was fading.</li>
            <li> I use this oil for everything...dry hands, dry nose from a cold, stretch marks, scars even on my face.</li>
            <li> During the winter season, I notice that my skin suffers from persistent dry patches.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the cold weather has made my skin feeling dry and chapped.</li>
            <li> This product seriously works wonders.  </li>
            <li> Store bought moisturizers add preservatives that are not good for your skin.</li>
            <li> This oil doesn&#x27;t make my hair heavy and doesn&#x27;t smell weird.</li>
            <li> but, my shower has been broken for a couple weeks</li>
            <li> I was definitely not happy with.</li>
            <li> Some other users commented on a bad smell but remember this has no fragrance added to it.</li>
            <li> I have had terrible trouble this year with dry skin.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong</li>
            <li> When I opened the bottle a horrible sour smell came off the oil.</li>
            <li> I like this one because it is virgin cold pressed and organic.</li>
            <li> I like that it is organic, cold pressed and unrefined.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this stuff works miracles because my crazy hair is still crazy...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get on my clothes or make me feel dirty.</li>
            <li> and it usually dries my skin out terribly.</li>
            <li> does not smell bad..</li>
            <li> I base my ratings</li>
            <li> I base my ratings</li>
            <li> I was shocked at the size of the bottle!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s drying my skin out horribly.  </li>
            <li> but, it smells horrible!</li>
            <li> My 8 yr boy had terrible eczema on his hands.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this stuff!! Great value, huge bottle!!</li>
            <li> Superior product. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I like nadira’s argan oil. I am not an expert but am a big fan of argan oil and have been using it for several years now. I don’t know how to tell the difference in quality but I like the feel of this one goes on my skin. Just a couple of drops leaves my face silky smooth and it goes a long way! Living in the desert my skin is alway dry and need good moisturizer. I like this one because it is virgin cold pressed and organic.</li>
            <li> Made my hair uber soft!! I warmed it slightly in hot water by putting it in a plastic bag. Just like using a hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li> Argan Oil is the new it thing. Great smell, perfect for my natural 4C curls to hold in the moisture.</li>
            <li> The contents were perfect, as promised. The dropper however comes apart if you screw the cap on too tightly so there&#x27;s a happy-medium that you have to find when putting this product away after use.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase. I like that it is organic, cold pressed and unrefined. It would be nice to know what the shelf life of this product is.</li>
            <li> It has just a tiny smell. But it keeps skin soft and moistured. Love it!</li>
            <li> feels good on the hair, skin and nails.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair super soft and smooth.  I also use it as a face moisturizer and my face looks great.</li>
            <li> Smells decent. Great for so many uses, one new use i discovered was removing eye makeup gently.  Awesome product!</li>
            <li> I love this product, keeps ur skin looking smooth and vibrant</li>
            <li> bought this in hope it could help my daughters eczema, works wonders! so much so Ive already ordered a second bottle to have on hand.</li>
            <li> Love this prodcut for my hair I am currently using on my stretch marks from pregnancy I am certain I will see a difference I took a before photo and I will update this review with before and after photos.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. .it leaves your skin so soft and silky. ..a little goes a long way. It is worth the price. I use it as a hair treatment as well it makes your hair soft and shiny...and I also use it  to soften my cuticles.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for a couple weeks now and it works great. I mix it with lotion and put it on and I have noticed a definite difference. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisified with this! Great product!</li>
            <li> love it, makes my skin feel good</li>
            <li> The only reason this isn&#x27;t 5 stars is because the dropper makes it a little difficult to use directly. A spray or pump would be better. The product itself is awesome. My split ends thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I love the Nadira Organic Argan Oil. I use a little on my hair every day.  I hair feels moisturize without feeling greasy.  I am able to style my hair and my hair is not weighed down.  I also use it to moisturize my skin as well as my cuticles.  This stuff is great.  I purchased this product at a reduced rate as part of a trial to test.  I will continue to purchase the product and I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I just started using this oil and so far so good.  I am taking a harsh chemo drug right now and it&#x27;s drying my skin out horribly.  I primrily use this on my face as I get a lot of dry spots during the day and it has helped considerably although I need to apply quite frequently.</li>
            <li> It softens without feeling greasy and is very easily absorbed into your skin. I have used it alone and as part of a recipe and it was a wonderful addition to my essential oil pantry as a carrier oil.</li>
            <li> I love this for my hair. It keeps it smooth and shiney.</li>
            <li> Nadira is the best! I love how it can be used for literally everything- my hair is softer and shinier, my skin smoother, and the little bit of acne I had around my chin- gone. I will never stop using this, Nadira Organics- thank you!!</li>
            <li> I have now been using this product for 6 months and it is BY FAR THE BEST PRODUCT I have ever used for my dry skin and complextion!  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love love this product! I am all about natural and what will make my skin feel and look amazing. This product is a must have. Being a busy mom of three boys; I need products that are all in one, effective, and easy to bring with me on the go.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have finally found something that&#x27;s so versatile! I can use it on myself (especially now that it&#x27;s winter) and on my 3 year old. My hair and skin get so dry in the winter. This Argan Oil is lightweight and beautiful. My son has eczema and it works so well without irritating his sensitive skin. I also love that there are no perfumes in the product. I would recommend this to everyone! Thank you for making a product my entire family can use.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It is perfect for preventing flyaways and frizz on my curly hair, and makes it super shiny. I also use a little on my skin right after the shower and it absorbs well and keeps my skin soft in the winter. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this Argan oil! The dropper makes it easy to control delivery, and it&#x27;s a moisturizing but not oily feeling.</li>
            <li> I love this argan oil! It works great on my hair and nails and doesn&#x27;t over do it! It has a great dropper which makes it easier to apply and use without making a huge mess. This is a great product so glad I was able to use a discount code to get it!</li>
            <li> Really good argan oil. I love using this stuff on my skin, hair and nails. My hair is shiny and soft. Way less frizzy and split ends are less noticable. My skin feels soft and hydrated. Nails feel healthy and grow faster. This is a nice quality oil. I loved how it came very securely bubble wrapped. Nothing was hurting that bottle! I am happy to recieve this oil to review.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this stuff works miracles because my crazy hair is still crazy...but, my shower has been broken for a couple weeks so I can only use really hot water to wash my hair.  Normally my hair and scalp would be extremely dry after all these hot washes, but this oil has really helped my hair and scalp from drying out. Also, a little bit goes a long way so this bottle will last me quite a while.</li>
            <li> This Argan Oil is amazing... I have used it for a month and it is NOT oily but moisturizes really well.  No clogging of pores!</li>
            <li> I am loving this product so far.  I am plagued with dry skin in the winter and a few drops of this oil is like a miracle. I used a little on the dry ends of my hair and the results are beautiful.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use argan oil on a daily basis. I usually use Josie Maran&#x27;s argan oil but decided to try to find something cheaper on amazon. I found this oil, and it seems to work great but, it smells horrible! I think I was sent an old bottle because it has a very bitter or sour smell to it. Otherwise, it is a good product.</li>
            <li> This oil is restoring moisture to my nails. I love that the bottle comes with a dropper to make dispensing the oil easy. You get alot in one bottle, too!</li>
            <li> This is the best Argan oil I have ever used! I have only ever tried two others, but this one is a far more superior than either of those. This Argan oil is light, and thin, and not thick and greasy. It has a very light, almost unnoticeable scent. Even though I love the properties of Argan oil, I was considering not using it any longer because I was having a hard time tolerating the strong fragrance of the other two I have used. When I opened this bottle and sniffed, I was amazed at the lack of scent. I received this bottle of Argan oil in return for my honest and unbiased review, and I will continue purchasing this brand in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it in two different ways. First, I use it as a moisturizer for my hands. I have twins who are still in diapers, so I have to wash my hands a lot in the course of a day. Because of that, especially in the dry winter months, my hands are dry, scaly, and often the skin cracks open and causes sores. I use Argan oil instead of lotions, and I am amazed at how well it works. It absorbs rather quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy feeling. It only takes a few drops, so one bottle will last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I use it to improve the texture of my hair. My hair is rather long, and the lower half tends to be dry and frizzy. I put a few drops of Argan oil in my hands, rub them together and distribute it throughout the lower half of my hair. At first, your hair will appear oily, but after just a few moments it will absorb and leave you hair silky, shiny, and smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many other uses for Argan oil, like treating stretch marks, acne scars, and brittle nails. It is a great all-around beauty product, at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for this!! first time trying the Aragan oil and I love it. Pretty much use it for everything</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas. She&#x27;s totally into it, won&#x27;t stop talking about it! Her skin and hair feels freat, and being a guy, I never really notice a difference… But one day she made me try it, and I&#x27;ve definitely seen the benefits. This stuff is really good.</li>
            <li> I love this oil especially for my hair.  My unruly curly hair is not frizzy anymore.  It&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s a big bottle too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and I&#x27;m hooked. I have combination skin so I was hesitant at first to put oil on my face but the dry winter air made me give it a try. I&#x27;m amazed!  There is a little bit of an adjustment period while your skin learns to produce less oil but now my skin is so improved!  This has cured all the winter dryness on my face and help save my nails and hands too all without feeling greasy. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Got this for free during a promo period. My wife uses at night. She even uses it after using a derma roller. It makes her skin smooth and soft. It has a pleasant smell too and is absorbed by the skin fast so you don&#x27;t worry about your stains in your pillowcases</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Huge 8 oz glass bottle with glass dropper makes it easy to portion out 1-2 drops. No scent. Works wonders for my dry, frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Absolute game changer for my skin!</li>
            <li> The ingredients listed are:  100% pure, virgin, grade-A, organic, cold pressed argan oil. I like that I don&#x27;t really smell it and that it can be used for so many things.  I personally use it as a moisturizer for my face, skin, and cuticles. My nails are not as brittle any more. I like that it dries easily and does not fee greasy.  And I also use it on my dry and frizzy hair.  It makes it looking more moisturized and and helps with the frizz. Great product.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. Very moisturizing. The smell is a little funny, maybe that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> What an awesome oil! I&#x27;ve inly had it for two days but I&#x27;m already in LOVE!! Very big bottle for the price and the oil seems to be top notch. I&#x27;ve been applying a few drops to my face and hair overnight and my skin feels amazing when I wake up and my hair is so soft!!</li>
            <li> Great oil! I use it on my skin and it feels very good!</li>
            <li> My hair loves this oil. I am very pleased with this purchase. I live in a dry climate and my hair is very damaged. This oil is moisturized and fixed my hair.</li>
            <li> This marvel is absorbed by really rough skin and cuticles so quickly! Somehow my hands stayed softer all day long.</li>
            <li> This was a larger bottle fir being an essential oil. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> 100% Natural, all organic, one ingredient. It doesn&#x27;t get better!    I have thick, coarse, curly hair that has natural frizz. This Argan Oil helps to keep my curls defined and reduces the frizz. I was using an Argan oil spray that my hairdresser recommended to me, purchased at a big box store. I had NO IDEA what an injustice I was doing to my hair. There are 11 ingredients listed on the bottle; half of which I can&#x27;t pronounce. Why, oh why, did someone not recommend this? This is truly a curly girl&#x27;s best friend. One ingredient. Completely natural. I will never buy an \\&quot;argan oil spray\\&quot; knowing I can use this.    When my hair is wet I take the dropper and and 4-6 drops directly to my scalp and comb it through. I also apply a few drops in my hands to massage the ends of my hair with. There is a definitive difference in the texture and feel of my hair using Nadira argan oil.  I was given the opportunity to test and try this product - 100% highly recommend based on quality and performance. If you have curly, coarse, thick hair, look no further - this stuff WORKS.</li>
            <li> My dry skin is loving this oil.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I use Argan Oil everyday... very smooth texture and not too greasy. Love it</li>
            <li> Thanks for the large size of Argan oil</li>
            <li> I love 100% Pure Virgin Argan Oil.  I use it for my face body, foot and hair. almost whole body. Feel so moisture and smooth. Strong recommend to all my friend!</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I suffer from acne, so I was really excited to start using this oil.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks and I&#x27;ve noticed improvement with the way my skin feels and I&#x27;ve also hardly had any breakouts.  It has definitely helped in clearing up my skin, and also moisturizing it.  I&#x27;ve always been hesitant with putting oil or moisturizer on my face because I don&#x27;t like the oily feeling, but this oil doesn&#x27;t leave that oily residue once it soaks in your skin. It actually moisturizes!  I use it every night before I got to bed. I take about 3-4 drops and rub it throughout my face for about a minute.  When I wake up the next morning, my face is very moisturized and NOT oily.  I love this product and I&#x27;m so glad I discovered the miracle of argan oil.  It&#x27;s great for skin and hair! The price is well worth it for the generous size of the bottle.  This bottle should last you for quite sometime!</li>
            <li> I have recommended this product to everyone!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is really fantastic! I use it on my hair and skin and it works amazingly well. My skin feels so smooth and my hair has never felt silkier! I would definitely recommend this to everyone...so much better and more practical than spending hundreds of dollars on creams and conditioners filled with chemicals!</li>
            <li> Argan oil has a very distinguishable smell (kinda odd smell... not a good one), but it doesn&#x27;t last so not a big deal. This one is a big bottle, and the dispenser works great (no spill at all). Very moisturing and soothing. Love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I use it in my hair and it is a miracle . Keeps the frizz away and defines my curls but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down . The packaging is perfect and having the dropper is such a great way to control the amount . I also like that there is no strong scent and it doesn&#x27;t leave oily residue on your hands. It is a huge amount and it is going on the repurchase list .</li>
            <li> I have been using Argon oil for sometime. I have a coworker who is from Morocco and every time she visits back home, I ask her to bring me some Argon oil. When I saw this on Amazon and I had a coupon for a great discount, I immediately ordered it. I like the fact that it is 100% pure Virgin Argan oil with nothing added to it. It is great for dry winter skin and hair. I use it after shower on my body. Also great moisturizer for dry, brittle hair.I put it in my hair for half an hour and wear a cap to keep the heat in. It washes out easily and leaves hair soft and silky. Good for acne marks and nails too. Will definitely keep using it.</li>
            <li> I use this oil for everything...dry hands, dry nose from a cold, stretch marks, scars even on my face. It work wonders!</li>
            <li> I love to use argan oil when doing manicures, it is a great treatment for nails. I also like using it on damp hair as a leave in conditioner. Great for split ends.</li>
            <li> It caused my oily, acne-prone skin to breakout. I immediately stopped using it. So I&#x27;ve been using it on my skin. No bells and whistles there either!  I bought it mainly to curb the acne. DIDN&#x27;T WORK!</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of oil and argan oil is also one of the oils I was very excited to try. I received this complimentary argan oil for reviewing and testing purposes and this is one fantastic oil. Perfect for my nails and my skin; I have also tested it on my hair focusing on my hair ends and it not only hydrates it, but it also moisturizes my hair and giving it a healthy look. This is a high quality and overall great oil and I totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> I just got this recently and I couldn&#x27;t WAIT to write about it. The bottle is high quality and has a simple design, and the dropper is clean and efficient. I have seen a noticeable change in my skin texture and hair. My hair literally turned to silk after only a few uses of this magical oil. It doesn&#x27;t remain in your hair too long, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it being greasy. During the winter season, I notice that my skin suffers from persistent dry patches. This oil changed that completely. My face feels brighter and more moisturized than ever. This oil also helps with dry nails and elbows. I personally like using it as a leave-in deep conditioner because it leaves my hair shiny and manageable. I&#x27;m so glad that this Argan oil is perfume-free because I have sensitive skin that often does not pair well with chemicals. The oil itself is slightly yellowy, but the color does not skin your hair or skin when used. When I first looked at the 4 ounce bottle, I thought &amp;#34;wow, I&#x27;m never going to finish this.&amp;#34; But now I realize that these four ounces of oil will definitely need to be reordered soon!</li>
            <li> This oil smells fantastic and works really well on my hair. I used it for deep conditioning and my hair is super soft and was easy to comb through.</li>
            <li> Very clean oil, works great!</li>
            <li> Absorbs very quickly - never greasy.  This works great for my winter skin.  I&#x27;ve been trying so many different products for my dry skin and have finally found something that really works.  I wish I would have had it at the beginning of winter.  Will never be without it.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. The product is light and does not weight my hair down and my skin feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> So I love coconut oil and have read a lot about argon oil and I am now convinced Argan is better!! My hair never felt so soft and it looks and feels so healthy.</li>
            <li> This stuff it&#x27;s awesome!!! I have been using it on my hair and nails! I have noticed a difference in both. I have also been using it on my psoriasis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned with using it on my hair, because I have that weird kind of hair that is super dry, but looks oily if I touch it. I have been putting this in mainly my roots and I have noticed that it doesn&#x27;t have as many fly aways and that it doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;dead&amp;#34; on the ends. It also doesn&#x27;t look or feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails seen stronger and are not splitting as usual. Hopefully I will be able to grow my own nails back out after using this awhile!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the psoriasis, it has cleared it up!! I have mild break outs, and this has helped so much!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the bottle is very nice sized, so it will last awhile before I have to buy some more! This will be a must from now!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive a coupon to buy this with a discount to write my honest opinion of the product. That doesn&#x27;t effect my opinion at all. I base my ratings/reviews 100% off of my own personal experience with the product.</li>
            <li> this bottle is huge.  i have a feeling this will last me an eternity.  great deal.  doesn&#x27;t have any real scent to it. i could see how this might get a little messy when using - but so far not bad.  been using it on long curly hair.</li>
            <li> Great quality for a good price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it on my face for a while. Feels great and works great. Not a huge fan of the smell but it works well enough to get over that.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry from being outside in the sun. I tried to apply this oil as many times as needed on dry area of my skin. After applying the oil, my skin feels soft,  smooth and younger. I believe that using this oil for a period of time, will heal my dry skin. It&#x27;s also good for your hair and nails. After applying it I don&#x27;t feel any oily residue.  This is a really great product and I am glad that I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts and opinions.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Bought it through my hubby&#x27;s account, so this review is from a female perspective.  Everything arrived on time and in great packaging (no leaks!).  I&#x27;m trying to get rid of all my chemical-based beauty products and move to organic, all-natural, single ingredient products.  I have very sensitive skin and often break out into hives when using everyday beauty products, so this Organic Argan Oil was PERFECT!  No allergic reactions!  It&#x27;s a great facial and hand moisturizer (especially before bed...light and not overly greasy) and it also works great as a hair serum before blow drying (gets rid of fly-aways and makes hair shiny and more manageable).  And a little goes a LONG way!  The best part?  It&#x27;s organic!  No chemicals!</li>
            <li> I like that this product is multipurpose. I used it on my cuticles and some scars. It helped to keep my cuticles from drying out during the day. I also did notice some acne scars faded a bit after some time.</li>
            <li> Nice Product. Leaves you feeling moisturized, but not really oily. The Smell isn&#x27;t that great however.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to purchase this item through a discount.</li>
            <li> No smell. Made my hair silky</li>
            <li> Just received this miracle and have been using it on my arms, my legs, my fingers, my hair. With the Argan oil, it has so many uses. I put it on only one arm first to see if any difference. In just minutes, my treated arm and hand was soft and silky. The other arm and hand was dry feeling. So, I can say this is some great stuff and it doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel to it at all.</li>
            <li> I use this for my skin hair and nails. Everything is so much softer. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> It smells a bit &amp;#34;masculine&amp;#34; to me, but the scent does not last long after application.  Great moisturizer for hair, skin, and nails!</li>
            <li> Who doesnt like argan oil? I love this stuff. i put a little on my ends to seal them but I have used this mostly for my scars. The oil have a very silky texture. I mixed a little bit with shea butter and apply it to the scars on my tummy (from getting my gallbladder removed). I usually do a light exfoliating scrub on the scar them apply the blend. So far its been going well. It will take some time to see true results.</li>
            <li> This aragan oil is simply wonderful and the best part is it is organic.  High quality and makes my hair shiny and healthier than it ever was. I recommend it</li>
            <li> Organic Argan Oil - Premium Quality by Nadira Organics works great!  I accidently over processed my hair. So I found this. I have to say my hair is back to normal after a week! I was so worried my hair was going to be ruined but  Organic Argan Oil - Premium Quality by Nadira Organics  came to my rescue and I am grateful! Thank-you</li>
            <li> I love this oil! It&#x27;s so moisturizing yet doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling. I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> High Quality Pure Argan Oil!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use this on my hair and a little goes a long way. This is going to last a long time. Very good value. I noticed my hair was more soft and manageable after the first application.</li>
            <li> Pure Argan oil for sure. This has a distinct scent to it (being it&#x27;s Argan oil and does not contain any additives for perfume smell). This is natural so use a few drops for your hair and it works great. There are other uses mentioned on the bottle like moisturizing your skin etc. Simple bottle with a dropper for added convenience.</li>
            <li> Review from my wife - I am a woman over 50 years old always looking for good moisturizers.  This Argan oil is amazing.  I thought it would be greasy.  To my surprise it&#x27;s not.  I can put a good helping of it on before I head to work.  It doesn&#x27;t get on my clothes or make me feel dirty.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff I put in on my hair and nails everyday and it feels so hydrating .</li>
            <li> Love!! I put this in my super long and thick hair after getting out of the shower, added a little mousse, then let my hair airdry...I&#x27;ve never had better results. I was able to get ready in record-fast time AND the humidity didn&#x27;t make my hair frizz out!</li>
            <li> Feels wonderful on my hair. I like to put it on heavily and leave it all day in a braid for super soft hair the next day :) Especially nice when I am out in the sun to add in some heat for it to work in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed this help with the softness in my hair. I use it after washing my hair and to tame frizzies when my hair is dry. If I put too much, my hair does look a bit too oily, so I concentrate it on my ends mostly and not on my scalp. I also love to mix a few drops in with my lotion, make my skin look so nice and soft. Especially after exfoliating with a scrub. Also, I put a small drop in some of my makeup concealers (ABH Cream Contour Palette) to help smooth them out when they start to dry out.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m not giving 5 stars is because I can&#x27;t get over the smell. It&#x27;s not strong so I&#x27;m able to mask it with my hair styling products but it&#x27;s just smells sour. I&amp;#34;m sure it&#x27;s becuase it&#x27;s a natural virgin oil with no scents, so it&#x27;s what is expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this with a coupon code and have provided my honest opinion</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin and hair rremarkably smooth.</li>
            <li> I have only had the chance of using it a few times, but from what I have used it for, so far I love it. While it is an oil, it is not greasy. I use it on my skin. My hands are nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think my only tiny, miniscule critique would be the dropper it comes with. It doesn&#x27;t really hold all the oil in and drips out. Do you have to keep your hand low to the bottle. But again, it is not a big deal and won&#x27;t prevent me from buying it again. And hey, it&#x27;s going on my hands anyway!</li>
            <li> I bought this for stretch mark itch relief and I&#x27;m actually really happy with all the other uses as well! Week worth the money!</li>
            <li> Pure argan oil.HUGE bottle especially since you only need a tiny bit. The dropper is super helpful in using just the right amount.</li>
            <li> I use this as a hair moisturizer and a carrier oil for my favorite essential oils.  Nice big bottle!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried argan oil and I love it!!  I use it to soften my cuticles, but my favorite use is for my hair.  A couple drops on my palm, then run through my hair, gives it a nice shine and controls some frizzies without leaving my hair looking oily.  I received a discount to try this product but would gladly pay pull price!</li>
            <li> Received this product at a greatly reduce price thanks to some amazon deals site. I&#x27;ve been using it for some days. My skin looks and feels better, doesn&#x27;t looked all dried up as it looked before. The oil can be dispensed straight from the bottom or with the use of the stopper- i love the option it gives me on the various ways to apply the oil to my hair/body. Pleasantly surprised by this product and odor, will buy again.</li>
            <li> One of the only face oils that doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or break me out.</li>
            <li> According to many sources, the scent of Argan oil should be nutty, almost like popcorn. The product I received smells sour. Available information trends toward inferior results if not processed correctly. It does absorb quickly and seems to be hydrating well, but the smell is off-putting. I have used it on my hair but the enthusiastically stated &amp;#34;high shine&amp;#34; that was expected wasn&#x27;t there. If I use too much (I used 10 drops the first time), my hair felt slightly gummy or powdered. I have used it on my cuticles and it is hydrating and absorbing well.  I&#x27;ve used the product for 2 days and am still deliberating on whether to return it, if that&#x27;s even possible. The odor does dissipate after about an hour, but working through that time, well....getting close to my significant other while the odor dissipates, causes me  some anxiety.</li>
            <li> You only need a few small drops when applying. It works very well on hair. I have been using it for weeks now and it helps keep my hair soft and frizz free. Also protects it while blow drying. I love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> GREAT to use on hair and body, not too oily and absorbs pretty well.</li>
            <li> I use this for my toddler&#x27;s hair and my hands and nails. It&#x27;s great at keeping her fine hair moisturized as she&#x27;s not had a haircut since she was born. Before bedtime I use a couple of drops and massage the Argan oil into my hands and nails. The oil does not smell like it&#x27;s been fragranced as some other ones on the market. The only complain I have is that I do not like the medicine dropper dispensing top. It may be just me but it&#x27;s rather messy. I tend to get the oil on the outside of the bottle or on the sink counter. I would prefer a pump top to compensate for my clumsiness. I think the next time I have an empty brown bottle with a pump top, I will clean that for use with this Argan oil.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! Makes hair manageable and healthy looking.  Can be used on dry or wet hair.  I use it when I straighten my hair.  However, this is OIL, so DO NOT use too much or else your hair will look greasy!! I am very satisfied with the product.  It would be nice if it was scented tho.</li>
            <li> So far I have really enjoyed this product. I have noticed thicker, healthier looking hair, and skin since I have been using this product.</li>
            <li> a little bit goes a long way, but it works great on dry and damaged hair!</li>
            <li> I was paying over $100 for Josie Maran on QVC for the same product and consistency. Wow</li>
            <li> I actually use this in my hair and really love how it makes it feel :) I have fine thin hair, but it&#x27;s dry and brittle, doesn&#x27;t weigh it down too much!</li>
            <li> My wife swears by this. Helps her dyed hair look more natural.</li>
            <li> Nice packaging nice dropper.</li>
            <li> LOVE this oil. I have been using Moroccan hair oil for two years and decided to go for the real thing without fillers or synthetic fragrance. I am glad I did! This oil have a lovely scent on it&#x27;s own - kind of like olive oil and chocolate. It absorbs quickly into skin and when used on the tips of my hair it makes it soft, shiny and look nice and smooth. My only complaint here is that the dropper drips without squeezing it. Minus one star for difficulty dispensing as a few drops go a long way.</li>
            <li> This is great for hair. I have tried using a couple of drops before blow drying my hair and my hair is sleepier and shinier!</li>
            <li> Love this oil. My hair is so soft and healthy now!!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products that prise you beautiful shiny hair and none of them have done my hair justice except this product. I LOVE IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days now and I could already feel the difference</li>
            <li> I have loved using this product for multiple reasons! I have been using it as a body moisturizer, which has left my skin feeling incredibly soft and smooth. Unlike other oils, it doesn&#x27;t feel thick or slimy and sinks in rather quickly. I use it in my hair too, putting just a drop at the tips and it leaves it feeling wonderfully silky and smooth. I also read that is can help with acne and dry skin. I applied it on my face and woke up the next morning to find it in noticeably better condition! This is a product that can be used in so many ways and the best part is, it&#x27;s all natural! I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have used many brands of argon oil for years now and I must say I am very pleased with this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I have to get this out of the way - they have thee best darned packaging I have ever seen. It comes in a bubble space suit - very cool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used argon oil for my hair and making body butter, but it&#x27;s mostly used after chemical peels. I now do home chemical peels instead of paying an arm and a leg through a doctor&#x27;s office and one of my staples is the use of argon oil. The size compared to the price is exceptional and it works to moisturize my skin very well after a peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nadira Organics provided this sample for testing and review with no guarantee of a favorable review.</li>
            <li> Its too oily for the face and hairbso I use it to moisturize my heels and nails instead. Works great!</li>
            <li> I have used Argon before this brand is very good. Makes a difference on your hair. Will buy again. Was lucky enough to get a discount for a review this time. But really this is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> It does something... but not the way most people I see on this talking about... it takes more than a couple drops. Its not remarkable but its okay enough that I may order again, won&#x27;t call it a must though. FYI, just to get an idea of my hair type, I&#x27;m mixed with black, Indian &amp; Spanish</li>
            <li> easy to apply!  feels very natural</li>
            <li> Amazing! Great product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is so light and succulent. I love how it feels. Non greasy and so good for skin &amp; hair! It&#x27;s great for the beach !!!</li>
            <li> Using this for my skin and hair.  It really makes my skin feel soft and I am loving it.</li>
            <li> Great product. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am totally in love with this serum.  Especially that I can use it on my hair,skin and nails.  One product for so many things is key and also the dropper that is with the bottle really helps so that the amount is easily measured.  Really helped my dry skin and also the dry ends on my hair from using the flat iron quite a bit.  The smell is great too and you only need a very small amount so this will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I love Argan Oil. I use this a little bit of everywhere. This is a great size bottle if you use a lot of it!! good buy!</li>
            <li> Argan oil is the best oil ever. It is one of two oils I can use on my hair without breaking out.  I have very sensitive skin  and eczema.  I have to be very careful what I use. I love that that this comes with a dropper.  It is so rich and silky.  I am such a fain of this oil that  I have paid ridiculous amounts of money to get it.  It heals my dark spots while it takes care of my eczema.  It absorbs into your skin so quickly without an oily felling.  It is such a lovely oil.  I am a fan. This brand organic.  For me oils must be organic.  If not you get all kinds impurities if not.  It gets rid of stretch marks, scars, and helps with your nails/cuticles. Excellent product.  I received a discount on this product for an honest unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Very good quality oil, works great for smoothing hair</li>
            <li> Been using this mostly on my hair.  It has definitely been shinier and less frizzy lately.</li>
            <li> I love this argan oil!  It makes my tattoos so vibrant and leaves my skin so smooth!  I love using it in my sons hair also!  A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Awesome product... Love to use in hair and has slowed down the qty of hair that falls off gonna keep on using... Just love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Argan oil for years in my hair and never had one leave an oily residue until I tried this product. I&#x27;ve used it 3 different times decreasing the amount each time and still left with heavy, greasy hair. Additionally, this product smells more like cooking oil than argan oil. I was a bit surprised by the strong, unpleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product... it was not sent to me for free in return for a review.</li>
            <li> Great product. I would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> DISCLOSURE: I received a sample of this item at no cost in order to test, with the option to review if I so desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As one that makes a lot of my own skin care preparations, argan oil is a key ingredient in many of them.&lt;br /&gt;Mixed with rosehip seed oil and a little emu oil, it makes an excellent lotion for chapped and cracked hands and feet.&lt;br /&gt;Adding some avocado oil makes it amazing as a pre-wash hair conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Apply to the hair while it is dry (and scalp if you have a dry scalp), then after anywhere from a minute to an hour, shampoo it out for soft, silky hair.</li>
            <li> I am a long-time argan oil user - I adore the stuff. It truly makes my skin and my hair glow and be at their best state, all year around. For my hair, I use it to avoid getting split ends - just few drops rubbed between my hands and applied to wet hair guarantee healthy and thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;For my face - I have what they call combination skin - a strange mix of dry and oily skin, but I can still use small amounts of oil to make sure I nourish and hydrate my skin before applying daily moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil is a wonderful product and Nadira&#x27;s organic kind is a must - I aim to buy organic and clean product whenever possible and in existence so I am thrilled with this choice.</li>
            <li> Good product, works as described, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this on my hair..,and its soft and shinny ,,love this product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to the long term effectiveness of this particular Argan Oil, but I can say that it goes on smoothly and feels wonderful.  It keeps my arms and hands hydrated for long periods.  It has no odor - a good thing, in my book!</li>
            <li> This Argan Oil works great on hair and body.&lt;br /&gt;Especially during the winter months, when everything is so dry.&lt;br /&gt;Love that it is 100% organic! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I do not give 5 stars easily but this product earned it!  The difference in my hair is amazing. Instead of putting it on my hair daily I decided to add 1/2 of the included dropper into my shampoo &amp; conditioner (32oz) bottles.  Wow zero frizz.  My shampoo and conditioner was leaving my hair frizzy before- I did not change brands. I just added the oil.  Yay!!!</li>
            <li> I have heard wonderful things about Argan oil for a while now, but this is the first time I have actually used it for any length of time. I absolutely love it, and I use it on everything. It works wonders on my hair, skin, face, nails, EVERYTHING. And my skin loves it... I have extremely dry skin and since I have been using it (I mix in my hands with my lotion), my skin is softer and SO more moisturized. And it doesn&#x27;t take much,  the stopper in the bottle allows me to control how much oil I use at a time, so I don&#x27;t overdo it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously... I&#x27;m ready to order the next one to have on hand when this one is done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple a weeks twice a day morning and night.  I use it to moisturize my hair and my skin.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels very soft, it feels oily at first but after a few hours it oil disappear, but the skin feels moisturized.  I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Like this Argan Oil. I use it for my hair and makes my hair look less frizzy and healthy. I would buy this again!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love!! This is such a versatile product. I&#x27;ve used Argon oil in my hair plenty of times but this is the best AND organic. At first I was apprehensive about using on my face as I am prone to break outs, especially on my chin. I started using this every night and it&#x27;s been great so far. My face regimen causes dry outs but this helps so much, I even feel it speeds healing time. Since I had such success on my face, I began using it on my hands and feet....even have the hubby talked in to trying it! It dries quickly and feels great. Some other users commented on a bad smell but remember this has no fragrance added to it. If you open the bottle and sniff, it doesn&#x27;t smell good but it&#x27;s not bad either. PLUS, when used, there is no smell what so ever. I def will purchase again!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this and this is really top quality Argon Oil. She adds this to her hair and it looks so shiny and healthy now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for great quality, this is it.</li>
            <li> You will love the way your hair looks and feels after using this oil! I have long hair, past the middle of my back. To keep it healthy and shiney I used hair oil every day! I can really tell a difference when I use this stuff. My hair is less likely to tangle when I use it too! Even though it&#x27;s an oil it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking oily. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I have had terrible trouble this year with dry skin. The rock climbing chalk dries out my hand as does winter.  I also have many allergies to additives in lotions so I have to be careful.  I had no allergy trouble with the Argan oil and it seems to have helped.  I can use a few drops on my hands and it sinks in fairly fast.  I have to be a little careful to wait a few minutes before touching something sensitive to oil, but one has to with lotion as well.  It soaks in much faster than coconut or other cooking oils when they get on your hands.  I can not speak to the oil&#x27;s ability to help acne or the other effects of the oil since I purchased it specifically for my dry hands.  Only downside is that it is not easily portable and not easily applied after each wash of the hands.  But I am perfectly OK with that.</li>
            <li> I use this on everyone in our family, from my hair all the way down to my 2 year olds face. Not greasy and oily feeling like most oils. I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels great!!</li>
            <li> When I opened the bottle a horrible sour smell came off the oil. Argan oil does not smell that way. I must have gotten some old expired oil. There is no expiration date on the bottle, so it is possible the oil is just old. I will not buy this oil again! I will not put sour smelling oil on my face... Gross product...</li>
            <li> Really great product. Wish dropper held more.</li>
            <li> Fantastic !00%  Organic Argan oil!! I love Argan oil. I use it every day. It helps with my dry skin in the winter time. Also helps improves my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Argan Oil Benefits&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair: Argan oil is an extremely popular hair care product and there are good reasons behind it. Its an excellent product to tame the frizz, resolve split ends, add moisture to course hair as well as add shine to the hair. I usually apply it to my hair after shower while it is still a bit damp for an all over deep treatment or just take a few drops and apply to the ends after you blow dry your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scalp: If you have a dry or itchy scalp, dab a few drops of argan oil on to a cotton ball apply to your scalp. If you do this in the nighttime before you go to sleep, it will give time for the oil to moisturize your scalp. You can then wash your hair in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Face: It might seem unconventional to apply pure argan oil to your face, especially if you have oily prone acne skin, but I have been doing just that and my skin stays hydrated and nourished. The face is smooth, clear and radiant, all thanks to using argan oil as my daily morning moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Body: One can use argan oil as a full body moisturizer, just like you would use any body cream.  Use argan oil right after you get out of shower for best moisturizing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hands: Your hands would love argan oil. If your cuticles or nails are prone to cracking and peeling, argan oil would work wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing thing I have EVER used on my hair. I&#x27;m a naturally curly girl who can never keep it under control without crunchy crispy gel. It&#x27;s soft,it&#x27;s tame and it&#x27;s GORGEOUS.  My scalp is healthy too!!!!</li>
            <li> Argan oil has taken a new trend these days. due to its multiple benefits it has become quite in demand. Argan oil helps in reducing wrinkles and fine lines and getting the glow back to your skin. It also works great on your hair and helps in healthy hair growth. this is one product that i must say every household should have. I totally loved it. I was lucky to receive this product under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
            <li> Seems the same as pure argan oil I got from another supplier - absorbs well.</li>
            <li> Love this oil works great on my face after my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Nadira Organics Argan oil is a great product. I work with my hands, so it&#x27;s always been hard to keep them soft and healthy. I have been using this Argan oil for about a week now, applying several drops in the morning and before bed and rubbing it into my skin. Immediately after, I run my hands through my hair (especially my drier ends). This product dries quickly, and is not greasy. I have noticed a great change in my hands skin and my nails already. I have started to spot treat some old scars to see if this oil will help reduce them, but in the meantime I am thrilled with the almost instantaneous results! The packaging is nice, and the bottle is large.</li>
            <li> Works well, smells nice.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair super shiny and soft!</li>
            <li> Smells good and feels good</li>
            <li> Love love love this product. Made my hair feel son nice and smooth. I feel like it&#x27;s much more healthier than before. It&#x27;s lightweight and I just add a few drops to my conditioner. This product goes a long way with just a few drops.</li>
            <li> I have been using this in my daughters hair and what a difference it has made. Her hair shines so much more. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is the ultimate best hair oil for dry hair, or any hair for that matter. I am in love with it, and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> love it, great product</li>
            <li> love argan oil for hair and face.  no greasy feeling, feels wonderful</li>
            <li> Love this in my hair. Really happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I use this just on the ends of my hair usually, but what I love about it is how versatile it is and how many uses it can have. I think I will be trying it on my dry winter skin in months to some as well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my hands, feet, and on the tips of my hair to tame the frizz and prevent split ends. It makes my skin feel soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE Argan Oil fan but I am so not in love with the price of 100% Pure Argan Oil! When I had an opportunity to review this product I was so excited because I have used Argan Oil in the past with great results and I was curious to see if this one stood up to them! It didn&#x27;t take too many days to notice that this was QUALITY Argan Oil! I put a few dabs in my hair daily and my hair was so much shinier and healthier with in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a really hard time growing my hair out and I have noticed with the use of this every day my hair has even started to grow faster! I am IN LOVE for sure! The bottle is actually really big too so it will last a while! 4.0 oz or 120ml is the exact amount that you will be getting! There really isn&#x27;t too much of a smell with it at all! Sort of a really light nutty smell! Shipping and delivery was fast and on time! I would highly recommend and there is no doubt that I will be coming back to purchase more in the future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  I did receive a coupon to buy this with a discount to write my honest opinion of the product. That doesn&#x27;t effect my opinion at all. I base my ratings/reviews 100% off of my own personal experience with the product.</li>
            <li> I put this on wet hair after shampooing and then just let it air dry. It leaves my hair soft and shiny without weighing it down. Only thing is the instructions say use 1-3 drops - I used a lot more than that to cover for my whole head. But it&#x27;s a good sized bottle, so not a problem.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful for moisturizing my scalp.  I use it in my homemade body frosting also.</li>
            <li> The ultimate stocking stuffer for my sisters and mom this Christmas! Love how versatile it is and how it doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling sticky after using on my hair or skin.  Overall VERY satisfied and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great price for organic Argan oil. Store bought moisturizers add preservatives that are not good for your skin. I use Argan oil on my face, neck and body, let it soak in for a minute or so and my skin looks vibrant. Unlike lotions that leave your skin dry a few hours later, argan oil makes my skin feel more elastic. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my hair, but after reading the other reviews I&#x27;m going to give that a try next!</li>
            <li> I am pregnant and have been putting Nadira Argan Oil on my belly every night before bed for over a month now and it&#x27;s unbelievable how soft and moisturized my skin is. As far as I can see right now, I have no stretch marks and this oil is helping tremendously.&lt;br /&gt;I also gave this product as a Christmas gift to family and friends and the positive response I&#x27;ve received from everyone is overwhelming! Each person uses the oil for different purposes and loves the results! You&#x27;ve got to try this product to reap the many benefits it offers!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product as a moisturizer for a while now and I really like the way it makes my skin feels. Defininitely recommend it!!!!</li>
            <li> high quality - I use for my hair and skin!</li>
            <li> Wow! I cannot believe the difference with this oil compared to other Argan oils I&#x27;ve bought. This one hardly has a oily feel , goes on light and quickly absorbs in. The other ones I&#x27;ve bought which were presumedly high quality are gross in comparison. Read the labels! This is 100% Argan. Most of the other ones have additives making them heavy and slimy. Love Nadira!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! My 8 yr boy had terrible eczema on his hands. We have tried a number of products and at best, the problem is kept at bay but never gone. It is gone now! Overnight the redness and itching completely subsided. I rub a few drops into the problem area before school and before bed and his hands look normal and have stayed clear of eczema! It absorbs nicely so he isn&#x27;t left with that greasy feeling of the thick creams and lotions he dislikes so much!</li>
            <li> I was shocked at the size of the bottle! I really thought it was going to be small. The price is amazing! I worked in cosmetics for many years, this should be much more expensive !!! It smells great, and works on hair, nails and skin!!! As soon as I saw the price I knew I had to grab it!!!!!</li>
            <li> I used this product as an attempt to revive my dry, brittle hair that had been damaged by chlorine the night before.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how much two drops of this oil did for my hair!!  It felt so much softer, and did not look greasy at all.  (I did a little experiment right before bed, and found that it took 4 drops before my long hair started looking greasy, so make sure you use sparingly!)  I was hesitant to use any product with the word &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; in it for fear of the grease, but please don&#x27;t let that scare you off!</li>
            <li> It arrived in a nice package and was securely sealed.&lt;br /&gt;the oil itself does not have strong smell and blends in the skin as I massage it on my face and neck. The skin improves after 3 days after the winter (dry and irritated condition). Skin does not feel tight and itchy anymore. For now, my skin got its balance and might improves along with further uses. The bottle seems to last for months for my use (night and day).</li>
            <li> Excited to use this on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> does not smell bad.. im using it for my hair.. so far so good</li>
            <li> I use this in my hair occasionally, its ok but I prefer Moroccan oil.</li>
            <li> Very nice, smooth argan oil. I&#x27;ve used several brands but so far this is my favorite. It has the typical argan smell, but it doesn&#x27;t smell like manure like some do, but it&#x27;s also not super expensive like some other ones. Feels great on my face and body and I&#x27;m glad I found a decent oil that doesn&#x27;t cost me a fortune now. I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> The quality is good and I&#x27;ve used it for my hair and skin, as well as my sons dry skin patches. Feeling good!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been two weeks and my hair and skin have never looked better! My hair, or &amp;#34;beast&amp;#34;, has a mind of its own. It constantly takes a beating from straighteners, blow dryers, and products, leaving it dry and brittle. I started adding Argan Oil to my routine and it has virtually eliminated the frizz and split ends. Additionally, the cold weather has made my skin feeling dry and chapped. I started using Argan Oil as a body moisturizer and it is AMAZING. It leaves my skin incredibly smooth, without the heavy greasy feeling. I love that it is truly all natural, and not filled with a list of complicated ingredients. Can&#x27;t wait to keep finding more uses for this amazing product!</li>
            <li> Love that you can use this product not just on hair but your skin as we&#x27;ll!</li>
            <li> Excellent Organic argan oil for both your skin and conditioning your hair!</li>
            <li> I had heard many things great things about this product, so I decided to finally try it.  I have a scar on my arm from a birth mark that was removed six years ago.  I have tried many OTC products, but nothing seemed to work, so I was obviously skeptical.  I have been using Nadira for seven weeks now and the scar is nearly gone.  This product seriously works wonders.  I just ordered my third bottle.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter.  He has long, color-treated hair.  The Argan oil brings the color to life and gives is a beautiful soft shine.</li>
            <li> I like this oil. Its just a tad heavy but still a nice oil.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> Great shipping and these bottles are pretty big, so the value is good, too.</li>
            <li> I love this Argan Oil.  I use it in my hair mostly, because I am going Natural with it, and this oil is amazing! I loved that when I received it, it was packed pretty well.  I love that the oil is scent free, and although it&#x27;s an oil, it&#x27;s not oily.  I also love using it on my skin, especially the past few weeks with all of the cold weather we had been getting.  You don&#x27;t need much of the oil, I have short-medium length hair, and I use about a nickel size amount in the palm of my hand.  It goes on nice and smooth and I am looking forward to trying more of these products.</li>
            <li> So far I have been reading other reviews to get a better gauge of the best way to utilize this product. I have used it directly so far on my face and it was surprisingly not oily and was moisturizing! I used some on my cuticles though I felt the results were more temporary. I will continue to use this and try adding another oil to it as I do not enjoy the plain scent of it.. will update my review.</li>
            <li> Good oil. I have been using it when making my soaps.</li>
            <li> Awesome argan oil.  Makes myhair feel great!</li>
            <li> Healed my dry and cracked elbows! Previously been using lotion, and it was amazing to see how much better Argan oil is. Great packaging by Amazon too - I doubt it could have broken in shipment (unless something smashed the box completely).</li>
            <li> I will use this for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect to use it in this dry cool weather in Texas! My hair was so dry after I washed it, but I applied some on it, immediately felt smooth and shiny on my hair. I love it!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item for perspective as someone that has never had the chance to experience trying it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This should be 5++ stars!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is hard to find 100% Pure Virgin Cold-Pressed Argan Oil From Morocco at a GOOD price but guess what? Nadira Organics did it!! Most argan oils are actually full of fillers but this is 100% Pure Virgin Cold-Pressed Argan Oil and that&#x27;s IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a HUGE bottle (4 oz) of 100% Pure Virgin Cold-Pressed Argan Oil  that will last you a really really long time. It comes in a glass bottle with a glass dropper and rubber bulb. No scent to the product and the oil itself is yellow but does not leave a stain on anything you put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this Argan oil on my hair but mostly my skin. This extremely dry winter air is causing my hands and face to be really tight and overall just dry. I use 3 drops on my hands and massage it in. It soaks up fairly quickly but not so quickly that you need more. I just just 1 drop on my face under my makeup. I get a couple of dry patches on my face if I do not but when I put the argan oil on they do not appear throughout the day. The oil is heavy enough to combat dryness but not heavy that it causes skin problems. In fact, argan oil is used to combat skin problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this on my hair and my daughters hair. I have thick brunette hair while my daughter has thin blonde curly hair. We both only need a tiny amount to combat static and to keep our hair shiny and beautiful. You can use it as a deep conditioning treatment or as a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel wonderful, just know a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The best moisturizer!!!!</li>
            <li> I love using this oil, especially for my cuticles and nails. This cold and snowy winter has been brutal on my nails, and I have seen a great difference after putting this oil on every morning for a week. I was really surprised at how fast it worked but it has made my cuticles look better right away.  It is also great for hair, and I have been rubbing a little on the ends of my hair in the mornings, which helps decrease the amount of frizz.  A little oil goes a long way, and I love that it is such a quick and easy addition to my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> I love love love argan oil!! This stuff works wonders on hair and fingernails!! Your follicles will thank you for this product!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Great price.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best argan oil I have tried! I love that it doesn&#x27;t really have a scent and feels amazing on my skin. I used it the second I got out of the shower in place of my regular moisturizer and my face has been silky smooth all day. I also used a bit in the ends of my hair because they are very dry and frizzy and even tho its a rainy humid day my hair is frizz free!  I&#x27;m loving the dropper too! It makes for a much better and less messy application.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a big bottle, 4 oz is a lot of argan oil considering how little you need of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for&lt;br /&gt;cuticles&lt;br /&gt;deep conditioning&lt;br /&gt;a hair serum before flat ironing (just 2 drops!)&lt;br /&gt;mixing with essential oils I use argan as the carrier oil&lt;br /&gt;massage oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who came here looking for it for your hair, as a deep conditioning you would want to apply it to dry hair and to the ends only, unless you have a dry scalp, then you can apply to your scalp. You can leave it in as long as you want, and wrap your hair in saran wrap for an even more intense conditioning. When you have a good idea of how much to use, you can do it on damp hair. You can mix with coconut oil if you want the benefits of both. Wash it out with a good lathering shampoo after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to use it as a leave in, I recommend just two drops applied to the ends and then the fly aways. I put the drops in my palm and rub my hands together and apply just 2 drops. Unless you have really thick hair you don&#x27;t really need more. This will leave you with really soft, silky, shiny hair that is not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a coupon to try this product out for a huge discount in order to provide feedback and an honest review. I am more than happy with this argan oil, as i have tried others and some I was definitely not happy with.</li>
            <li> There are not many products that are as versatile and beneficial as Argan oil, that can be used on any skin type and is safe for all ages including babies. Argan Oil is one such rarity, it comes from a special Argan tree in Morocco and is loaded with Vitamin E! Nadira Aragan Oil comes in a 4 oz. brown glass bottle with a drop dispenser. The dropper is useful because it only takes a small amount for most uses.&lt;br /&gt;I use this one my hand when they get dry and cracked, my thumb is the worse. Just add a drop to the effected area or use all over your hands. Great for the finger nails as well. I just don&#x27;t like the oily feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I also used this on my hair. My hair has lost all moisture in it due to the weather and when I wash my hair it still feels grimey. So I add two drops in my hand and rub in. I can feel the softnes of my hair once added and i can tell the moisture is being put back in my hair. But, what I didn&#x27;t like is that when I woke up the next morning my hair was greesy.  Other than I&#x27;ve had to play with it when using on my hair, it works great.</li>
            <li> This product is really fantastic! I use it on my hair and skin and it works amazingly well. My skin feels so smooth and my hair has never felt silkier! I would definitely recommend this to everyone...so much better and more practical than spending hundreds of dollars on creams and conditioners filled with chemicals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I receive this product on a discount for reviewing purposes</li>
            <li> I used this this morning already. It is helping to improve my skin already! it feels so nice to use a product that is all natural too!</li>
            <li> I am incredibly impressed by this argan oil.  I have tried others only to be minimally impressed for various reasons.  Nadira Organics offers what I feel is a very top-of-the line product.  First the ingredients: 100% pure organic argan oil that is grade A, cold-pressed and unrefined.  It bears the certified organic seal on the label.  What better to repair hair and nails than something so pure and close to it&#x27;s most original state? Next, it is an oil but I found this brand to absorb quickly into the skin within about 10 seconds.  Others I have tried did not nearly come close, to the point I am wiping oil OFF my hands.  Additionally it is virtually scent free, which I prefer to some that tend to add powerful flowery or other scents to their brand.  Another thing to love about this brand is you have full control over how much you want to apply with it&#x27;s wonderful eye-dropper dispensing.  I have been using this on my cracked heels and have been very successful reducing how dry they have been! Lastly this is a generous 4 ounces which will last quite a long time, and yet is twice the size of some others that are at the same price point.  It is for all of those reasons I recommend this argan oil! I received this item for testing and review purposes.  All statements are of my honest unsolicited feedback as a result of my own personal use.</li>
            <li> At first I was hesitant on getting this product.  I am so glad I purchased this product.  My hair had been extremely shiny and soft.  I also like that I don&#x27;t have to use a lot of product.  This oil doesn&#x27;t make my hair heavy and doesn&#x27;t smell weird. I really like this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: Per Amazon policy I did receive a coupon for this product. It in no way had an impact on my review. These are my own opinions.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item at a greatly reduced price because I was willing to give my honest opinion about it. I just love this oil. It makes your skin feel so soft and hydrated. It is good for your whole body</li>
            <li> It works great, there is a little smell from it, but not bad.</li>
            <li> I have completely replaced my facial moisturizer with argan oil. It makes my skin look and feel so refreshed and doesn&#x27;t have the feeling of being dry 10 minutes later as my face moisturizer used to. I also started using it on my hands and toes to help with the dry skin around my nails. I did receive this at discount to give my review on it and I love it and will be buying again.</li>
            <li> My favorite oil. I use it daily</li>
            <li> What can I say? i already went through this entire bottle in just over a month! I use it in my hair, for my skin as a heat protectant before I straighten my hair. Love the smell and how lightweight the oil is</li>
            <li> Fantastic Oil. So lush, it really pampers your skin. I feel like an exotic beauty!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.  I keep it on my desk and rub into my cuticles several times a day.  I also use it on my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Seems like good quality oil.</li>
            <li> Love it! It is oily, so I use it with my body lotion, and it keeps my skin moisturized longer.</li>
            <li> Just a miracle, for scars, bruises, dry really dry skin etc. A must for everyone</li>
            <li> I have been applying on drop to my liquid foundation and LOVE the results. I tried this on my very fine hair and it left it limp but my skin loves it.</li>
            <li> Light oil that absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I received it and couldn&#x27;t wait to try on my face, the texture of the oil&#x27;s light unlike other oils which always makes me feel sticky, this oil quickly absorbed by the skin and my face is smooth after a minute with little message. Love it!</li>
            <li> Large bottle and 100% pure for an amazing price!!!  I use this on my hands and feet to sooth the dryness.  I also  put a drop or two on my face before applying makeup.  My daughters have very dry hair, and it is a great conditioner!  5 star item!!!!!</li>
            <li> There are an overwhelming selection of products available for skin care, therefore it can be very difficult to know which products are best if you want healthy, glowing skin. Two products which are currently gaining favor among natural skin care enthusiasts are rosehip oil and argan oil. The nuts of the argan tree are predominantly harvested in Morocco. Although argan oil is a relatively new and unfamiliar beauty product in the United States, it has actually been a skin care staple for many generations of Mediterranean women.&lt;br /&gt;As many people will know, rosehips are small fruits produced by a certain type of rose. Like argan oil, rosehip is very high in essential fatty acids. These have two benefits when applied to the skin.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong but I don&#x27;t really notice any difference. The smell is horid but it disappears quickly. I apply after shower to legs and arms but feel lotion keeps me softer longer.</li>
            <li> I love using this to keep my hair healthy and shiny. I use this before I blow try on the ends of my hair to both protect it from heat and give it a beautiful shine when I am finished. It is not runny like some I have used, which I love about this one. Great price too!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a true organic Argan Oil these days. I can say, this is a great one. I add it to my shampoo so I can get some moisture back into my bleached, over processed hair. Also, I give my dry hair a good drenching once a week with it and leave it overnight for a deep conditioning. Yesterday, I painted my nails and after they dried for a few minutes, I topped my nails and cuticles with it and it kept my polish from &amp;#34;nicking&amp;#34;. I also use this allover my body when I&#x27;m fresh out of the shower as a body oil. If it&#x27;s smelling a little &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34;, I simply put a layer of one of my scented lotions on top. I use a self tanner every week and it usually dries my skin out terribly. Since I&#x27;ve started using this Argan Oil, it&#x27;s prolonging my tan by a few days. I really do like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I love Argan oil for it&#x27;s multiple uses. It can be used on the face, skin, and hair for a healthy shine and fly away hair. This is a great product!</li>
            <li> This oil is the oil to use.  It&#x27;s not greasy like other oils.  Rubs in easily. I highly recommend this product and seller!</li>
            <li> I ordered this at the advise of my wife. Primarily I have been looking for an affordable substitute for ridiculously overpriced shaving oils. This seemed to be a good solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have been using this for almost two months I can confidently say that it is wonderful. It works great as a shaving oil. It leaves the sink a bit greasy but hot water takes care of that and it is well worth it. I also have been using this applied to a soft bristle brush on my goatee. I have sasquatch-esque beard growth and it is thick, coarse and prickly. this has now made a significant difference. I use it every other day or so after I shower and my goatee is noticeably softer. The final use I have been using this for is on a tattoo. I got it about 15 years ago and it had been seeming (to me at least) like it was fading. Whenever I used it on my goatee I would put a couple of drops in my palms and rubbed them together and applied some to my tattoo. It may be just my perception but the tattoo is more vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I am very pleased with this and will be using this product indefinitely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this at a discount for my honest review and I can honestly say this is good stuff. When it runs out I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Great for hair and skin. Excellent quality!</li>
            <li> Love this food for my hair. Live in a hot state and always in the pool. This helps me a lot</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! Here in West Texas the air is so dry it really does a number on your skin and hair. I use a few drops of this oil on both my skin and hair and it makes a HUGE difference. I especially like what it&#x27;s doing for my hair, it just looks so much shinier and healthier. I am very happy with my results.</li>
            <li> My only regret is that I did not order three or four bottles of this product when I did order my first one.  Will definitely be ordering this product again.  Have used it on my skin and  hair without any problems.  Makes my hair soft and my hair is beginning to grow.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the size of the glass bottle. It goes a long way. The dropper works well and best of all it is safe for my family to use. I have used it on my daughter&#x27;s hair because her ends get dry and also on my hands and the results have been great!</li>
            <li> So far im happy with this product. A little goes a long way! Makes my hair soft and skin more youthful looking! Just remember not to use too much or it will leave your hair oily looking!</li>
            <li> High quality argan oil.  Definitely would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I swear by Argan oil for my hair!  Face it at 40+ dying your hair is inevitable and so is the dryness and damage that comes with it.  I have been using Argan oil for some time and this product is cheap and very effective, much more so than some much more expensive oils I have purchased.  I can see a marked difference in my hair texture, vitality, shine and softness.  I recommend this to anyone who wants younger looking hair</li>
            <li> I think this does a nice job moisturizing and adding shine to hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nadira Organic&#x27;s argan oil for about a week on my hair; I have been very pleased with the results so far.  My hair tends to get a little dry and frizzy due to daily use of a hair dryer and frequent washing, and I have tried other oils before, but I must say, this product has given me the softest hair yet!  I look forward to trying it out on my nails as well, as I tend to have issues with cuticles and chipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle also seems like it will last me a long time, so it is very cost-effective.  The directions say to only use two drops on hair; my first day trying it out, that did not seem like enough, so I used 6 or 7 drops, which was definitely more than enough.  I scaled it back to 2, and it was perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving it!  I&#x27;ve used Argan oil in the past, and while I love the oil, I&#x27;ve found other brands to have a strong scent, or to be a bit thick, so I avoided putting it on my face during the day.  This one has almost no detectable scent, and goes on light enough that I can put it on in the morning under my make-up in lieu of moisturizer. (I&#x27;m also loving the price...my last purchase of organic argan oil was $30 for 1oz.) I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Amazing!! I love and swear by this stuff. A must for every woman&#x27;s bathroom.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair super soft and manageable!</li>
            <li> I recorded this item using a promotional discount.  I love this oil! A spa I go to is always selling Moroccan oil for a bajillion dollars and I&#x27;ve always listed after owning some.  Well this is the same thing - probably a lot better because you can tell how pure it is.  Maybe it&#x27;s just me but this oil kind of smells like rubber bands.  Funny enough I googled the odor and that smell (some call it nutty) is an indicator that you&#x27;ve got the real deal (and some agree with my rubber band scent).  I&#x27;ve been using this on my long fine hair (but I have a lot of it).  I&#x27;ve been really pleased with it.  My hair is silky and shiny.  A little weighed down but not greasy.  I even used a drop on my two year old&#x27;s hair who still has baby curls.  Great product and I intend to buy more when mine runs out- however you use so little that it feels like this will last forever.</li>
            <li> OMG OMG OMG!!! This product is so awesome. and the jar is big enough to last me a very long time. It was great on my hair after it has been straightened. I also use it to moisturize my hands because it has been cracking so much because of the cold weather. NOTE: Item purchased through a promotional discount.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nadira for a few weeks now, and have noticeably seen an improvement in my skin texture and hair hydration. I didn&#x27;t realize the value of putting something on my skin without any additives, fragrances, and chemicals. I feel really great, and knowing my body is benefiting from the non-toxicity is a win win in my book. The reason I am giving it 3 stars is that I wish it came in a bigger bottle. I am using it everywhere (hair, skin, nails- twice a day), and I go through it too quickly. One other thing to mention is that because there is no fragrance, I have been adding a few drops of my lavender essential oil to the bottle and it makes it smell amazing. I just wish it came in a bigger size so I don&#x27;t constantly have to re-order.</li>
            <li> Has a light nutty smell. Light and smooth. Is a very good quality. I use a lot of oil on my children they have very dry skin. I use it on my hair and face. Fast absorbing.</li>
            <li> A great product! This is actually 100% Argan Oil and it is amazing for your hair, skin, and nails! I am truly impressed with this product. My hair, skin and nails love it. You won&#x27;t find 100% Argan cheaper!</li>
            <li> My hair is very, very fine and gets really frizzy, so I put a drop of this oil onto my palms, distribute through my dry hair, and leave it in for 20 or so minutes. I then shampoo &amp; condition like normal and my hair seems to retain more moisture afterward (more so than when using regular conditioner alone) and it&#x27;s smoother and shinier. It&#x27;s cheaper than most leave-in conditioners because you only need a drop; plus, I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling weighed-down and greasy. I am not brave enough to apply this after my hair dries completely, and I don&#x27;t typically blow-dry or straighten my hair, so I can&#x27;t speak to using this product when styling; however, I will definitely repurchase again although the bottle is so big I&#x27;m pretty sure Hell will freeze over first.</li>
            <li> Used this on my unruly curls and I really saw a difference.</li>
            <li> Great product. The oil doesn&#x27;t have a pleasant smell, but it works great.</li>
            <li> Love it! Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Argan oil is a product that I use every day. It is great for the hair. Keeps it moisturized, reduced blow drying time, provides shine and you just wind up with a healthier head of hair. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great oil, easily absorbed and leaves my skin soft</li>
            <li> I prefer to use pure products in my home and on my body.....so when I heard about argan oil I had to get some.  I have been using Nadira Organics Argan Oil on my hair and nails for a couple of weeks and I am very pleased with what I am seeing.  My hair is shinier and softer.  My nails feel stronger.</li>
            <li> This aragan oil is simply wonderful and the best part is it is organic. High quality and makes my skin and hair look shiny and healthier than it ever was. I recommend it</li>
