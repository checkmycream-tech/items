            <li>And I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li>Received it quickly and in good condition.</li>
            <li>Love the Carol&#x27;s Daughter Monoi line.</li>
            <li>I also love the body lotion.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s because she is using better ingredients that cost more?</li>
            <li>If your hair is similiar to mine, you will be pleased.</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>I had a great experience with the sellar and absolutely recommend them</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have bought so many products trying to find one that works on my hair  </li>
            <li>I love carol&#x27;s daughter hair products, I used to use the Chocolat line.  </li>
            <li>Product is just ok..</li>
            <li>I purchase this product with the excitement of pleased results.</li>
            <li>I do have the Carol&#x27;s Daughter Loc Butter and love it</li>
            <li>and I enjoyed the repairing mask.  </li>
            <li>It did ok.</li>
            <li>but, again, the fragrance is too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I love the shampoo b/c it doesn&#x27;t contain sulphate but</li>
            <li>BUT YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW SO MANY STEPS,</li>
            <li>ANY MORE...</li>
            <li>I love this product, my hair is longer and it seems thicker.</li>
            <li>and I feel better about my hair.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I am a self proclaimed product junkie and have used many, many, many hair products.</li>
            <li>and yes, I think it does help to make it better even though I still have that semi-curly, untamed look by afternoon when a scrunchie comes in handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I fell in love with the scent.</li>
            <li>And the mask i feel is OK.</li>
            <li>Oh but it smells OK...</li>
            <li>THE FIRST TIME I USED THESE PRODUCTS WAS ON A RAINY DAY, A RAINY DAY!!!</li>
            <li>My favorite and will pay the money for a full size of it!  </li>
            <li>Hair is soft, manageable and smells great.</li>
            <li>I have heard about Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s products for years and have heard from many people how fantastic her hair care line is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;VE USED SO MANY PRODUCTS, FROM A TO Z, FROM CHEAP TO PRICEY,</li>
            <li>I love the shampoo it gets ALL my hair clean, smells beautiful and doesn&#x27;t leave residue however the conditioner seems to do more harm than good which is not helpful because I usually cowash.</li>
            <li>and it keeps my hair strong and vibrate.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen this product line advertised on HSN many times, but didn&#x27;t want to try it in full size.  </li>
            <li>for me it was fine.</li>
            <li>and I must say I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I believe that she&#x27;s improved her products significantly since then.</li>
            <li>First I will say that I love the smell of this collection.  </li>
            <li>, however these products (including the Monoi trio ( leave in, serum and oil)) made my hair smell Great, but felt Crunchy and dry.</li>
            <li>After using this system my hair feels perfectly soft and healthy :).</li>
            <li>FINALLY I CAN SHOW MY HAIR AS IT IS, WITH BEAUTIFUL CURLS, AND NO NEED TO USE HOT TOOLS</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick and I was so excited to use it.  </li>
            <li>Ordering full size bottles now.</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s relaxed it looks shiny, and full.</li>
            <li>I WILL BE ORDERING THE FULL SIZE</li>
            <li>no bad feelings, i guess</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s seriously the best hair line I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>:) Just for reference I have very fine, very straight, highlighted blonde hair that is to my shoulders.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>I felt a difference using these products after the first wash!</li>
            <li>Well worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I spent all this money on a product I thought would be good.</li>
            <li>I used this product and felt and saw a difference right away.</li>
            <li>I tried the trial size and just recently ordered the full sizes because I was so satisfied.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair however, but with the right products and good moisture and conditioner, my hair looks thick.</li>
            <li>My hair smelt Amazing, but was completely dry and crunchy..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like my money wasted, I am on a constant search for the best quality hair products that I can stick with, and I don&#x27;t feed into hype.</li>
            <li>My hair was soft, full and looked great just air dried.</li>
            <li>My hair is a step up from the most coarse hair you can have (4a?).</li>
            <li>For now, I plan to pay the higher prices however to maintain my hair health.</li>
            <li>My hair is so much stronger and healthier after just one month!</li>
            <li>I saw results after the first use.</li>
            <li>The first use I saw a difference.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am glad I only paid for the starter kit and will not be purchasing this - or any of Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>Great sizes to try out at least twice.</li>
            <li>Plus in the description it specify exactly how to use it which it was a pleasure to read.</li>
            <li>But because of how much improvement I am seeing, I definitely feel it was worth it :)</li>
            <li>Know your ounces before ordering because you won&#x27;t get much in this kit!</li>
            <li>Just bought this recently, only have used it a couple times but I will say that it made my hair feel very clean and helped with the dryness.</li>
            <li>Good but to small for the price....</li>
            <li>Always looking for something that will help me keep from losing more hair but allow me to wear my hair curly or straight ( flat iron).  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and full of shine.</li>
            <li>I bought a sample size of both of these in the store and am coming back for the full size bottles on Amazon because it is cheaper!</li>
            <li>One day, I&#x27;m certain that I will look for products that are comparable, if she doesn&#x27;t lower her prices.</li>
            <li>I have very dry, fine hair and have used so many different products trying to find something that works with my hair.</li>
            <li>Using all three is really too much for my Caucasian curly hair.</li>
            <li>Really has helped with the dryness and breakage.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice much difference.  </li>
            <li>seller was fast.</li>
            <li>I had as much breakage as I did before I started.</li>
            <li>, THEN I WANTED TO TRY THE WHOLE MONOI REPAIRING SYSTEM, I BOUGHT THIS STARTER KIT,</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>This product really does prevent hair loss.</li>
            <li>It really does what it says.</li>
            <li>Very pricey</li>
            <li>and my scalp was unusually tender to the touch.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Smell may be too much for some people</li>
            <li>I really cannot say anything.</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s at Target much cheaper)</li>
            <li>I am a caucasian women with pin-straight gray hair and like the way it makes my strawlike hair feel; soft and smooth but not limp.</li>
            <li>but luckily decided to actually tried it first lol!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It was shiny and easy to brush the next morning &amp; very soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>I used it on my daughter who has naturally fine curly hair that tends to be dry and brittle.</li>
            <li>At first this product made my hair soft &amp; manageable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely going to invest in the full size products.</li>
            <li>Firstly, the fragrance was very overwhelming, the shampoo and conditioner made my hair feel very hard.</li>
            <li>Too small a quantity to judge its effectiveness; uncertain if I am willing to buy more to determine its value.</li>
            <li>My hair is in decent shape, so perhaps it&#x27;s user error.  </li>
            <li>It looked equally as nice when I blow dried and stayed soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I have seen the infomercial regarding this particular product and thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li>When I first received this product, each in a tiny 2oz bottle, I was absolutely furious!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I try not to rely completely on hair stylists (they don&#x27;t really want to tell you what they use anyway).</li>
            <li>When I use the conditioner and comb it through my hair in the shower - I normally have hair in my comb - not with this product.</li>
            <li>The only compliant that I have about Carol&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s products is that they are very costly, compared to the price of most other shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>The mask was okay for my hair, and the only thing that I truly appreciated about the kit, other than the smell.  </li>
            <li>I wish it were available in other scents.</li>
            <li>My hair detangled easily, and I had less hair in my comb.</li>
            <li>I bought the black-Vanilla line, which did the EXACT same thing as the Monoi.</li>
            <li>After using this product my hair feels so soft!</li>
            <li>I had read mixed reviews and hoped I would have a positive experience.  </li>
            <li>Have only had this silkiness after using the conditionar in certain hair color products.</li>
            <li>Her shampoo and hair mask really added moisture back to my hair.</li>
            <li>carol&#x27;s daughter so far has done everything it advertised to do.</li>
            <li>It really does only take one time to see the results!</li>
            <li>So far, after only a few uses it seems like my hair is already doing better.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I have a sensitive nose or that I am inclined to overexaggerate.  </li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t know if the product has a shelf life and the seller sold me an old batch or an ingredient affects the product over time.  </li>
            <li>I developed a headache that evening which wasn&#x27;t that unusal to me,</li>
            <li>It also makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I am a natural blond</li>
            <li>Am hoping this product repairs the natural damage that happens with color products and age.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m natural with 4a/4b hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how this is passing in the natural community</li>
            <li>It really made my dry, coily, kinky hair very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>My hair is not black as is Carol&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>LIKE NO OTHER PRODUCT I EVER</li>
            <li>She recently went natural.</li>
            <li>My aunt who has natural hair swears by this product thats why i gave it a try,so I will just say this product did not work for me personally.</li>
            <li>Love the product-  was not happy with the price for a sample size product.  </li>
            <li>Saw less shedding of my hair with first use.  </li>
            <li>I heard my hair crackling, a little more than usual came out in the comb not a problem to me at that point.</li>
            <li>So im a natural with very dry hair.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I purchase this product with the excitement of pleased results.</li>
            <li> I do have the Carol&#x27;s Daughter Loc Butter and love it</li>
            <li> and I enjoyed the repairing mask.  </li>
            <li> It did ok.</li>
            <li> but, again, the fragrance is too overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo b/c it doesn&#x27;t contain sulphate but</li>
            <li> BUT YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW SO MANY STEPS,</li>
            <li> ANY MORE...</li>
            <li> I love this product, my hair is longer and it seems thicker.</li>
            <li> and I feel better about my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I am a self proclaimed product junkie and have used many, many, many hair products.</li>
            <li> and yes, I think it does help to make it better even though I still have that semi-curly, untamed look by afternoon when a scrunchie comes in handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the scent.</li>
            <li> And the mask i feel is OK.</li>
            <li> Oh but it smells OK...</li>
            <li> THE FIRST TIME I USED THESE PRODUCTS WAS ON A RAINY DAY, A RAINY DAY!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite and will pay the money for a full size of it!  </li>
            <li> Hair is soft, manageable and smells great.</li>
            <li> I have heard about Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s products for years and have heard from many people how fantastic her hair care line is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE USED SO MANY PRODUCTS, FROM A TO Z, FROM CHEAP TO PRICEY,</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo it gets ALL my hair clean, smells beautiful and doesn&#x27;t leave residue however the conditioner seems to do more harm than good which is not helpful because I usually cowash.</li>
            <li> and it keeps my hair strong and vibrate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen this product line advertised on HSN many times, but didn&#x27;t want to try it in full size.  </li>
            <li> for me it was fine.</li>
            <li> and I must say I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I believe that she&#x27;s improved her products significantly since then.</li>
            <li> First I will say that I love the smell of this collection.  </li>
            <li> , however these products (including the Monoi trio ( leave in, serum and oil)) made my hair smell Great, but felt Crunchy and dry.</li>
            <li> After using this system my hair feels perfectly soft and healthy :).</li>
            <li> FINALLY I CAN SHOW MY HAIR AS IT IS, WITH BEAUTIFUL CURLS, AND NO NEED TO USE HOT TOOLS</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick and I was so excited to use it.  </li>
            <li> Ordering full size bottles now.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s relaxed it looks shiny, and full.</li>
            <li> I WILL BE ORDERING THE FULL SIZE</li>
            <li> no bad feelings, i guess</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s seriously the best hair line I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> :) Just for reference I have very fine, very straight, highlighted blonde hair that is to my shoulders.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I felt a difference using these products after the first wash!</li>
            <li> Well worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I spent all this money on a product I thought would be good.</li>
            <li> I used this product and felt and saw a difference right away.</li>
            <li> I tried the trial size and just recently ordered the full sizes because I was so satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair however, but with the right products and good moisture and conditioner, my hair looks thick.</li>
            <li> My hair smelt Amazing, but was completely dry and crunchy..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like my money wasted, I am on a constant search for the best quality hair products that I can stick with, and I don&#x27;t feed into hype.</li>
            <li> My hair was soft, full and looked great just air dried.</li>
            <li> My hair is a step up from the most coarse hair you can have (4a?).</li>
            <li> For now, I plan to pay the higher prices however to maintain my hair health.</li>
            <li> My hair is so much stronger and healthier after just one month!</li>
            <li> I saw results after the first use.</li>
            <li> The first use I saw a difference.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am glad I only paid for the starter kit and will not be purchasing this - or any of Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> Great sizes to try out at least twice.</li>
            <li> Plus in the description it specify exactly how to use it which it was a pleasure to read.</li>
            <li> But because of how much improvement I am seeing, I definitely feel it was worth it :)</li>
            <li> Know your ounces before ordering because you won&#x27;t get much in this kit!</li>
            <li> Just bought this recently, only have used it a couple times but I will say that it made my hair feel very clean and helped with the dryness.</li>
            <li> Good but to small for the price....</li>
            <li> Always looking for something that will help me keep from losing more hair but allow me to wear my hair curly or straight ( flat iron).  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and full of shine.</li>
            <li> I bought a sample size of both of these in the store and am coming back for the full size bottles on Amazon because it is cheaper!</li>
            <li> One day, I&#x27;m certain that I will look for products that are comparable, if she doesn&#x27;t lower her prices.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, fine hair and have used so many different products trying to find something that works with my hair.</li>
            <li> Using all three is really too much for my Caucasian curly hair.</li>
            <li> Really has helped with the dryness and breakage.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice much difference.  </li>
            <li> seller was fast.</li>
            <li> I had as much breakage as I did before I started.</li>
            <li> , THEN I WANTED TO TRY THE WHOLE MONOI REPAIRING SYSTEM, I BOUGHT THIS STARTER KIT,</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> This product really does prevent hair loss.</li>
            <li> It really does what it says.</li>
            <li> Very pricey</li>
            <li> and my scalp was unusually tender to the touch.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Smell may be too much for some people</li>
            <li> I really cannot say anything.</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s at Target much cheaper)</li>
            <li> I am a caucasian women with pin-straight gray hair and like the way it makes my strawlike hair feel; soft and smooth but not limp.</li>
            <li> but luckily decided to actually tried it first lol!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It was shiny and easy to brush the next morning &amp; very soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> I used it on my daughter who has naturally fine curly hair that tends to be dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> At first this product made my hair soft &amp; manageable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely going to invest in the full size products.</li>
            <li> Firstly, the fragrance was very overwhelming, the shampoo and conditioner made my hair feel very hard.</li>
            <li> Too small a quantity to judge its effectiveness; uncertain if I am willing to buy more to determine its value.</li>
            <li> My hair is in decent shape, so perhaps it&#x27;s user error.  </li>
            <li> It looked equally as nice when I blow dried and stayed soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I have seen the infomercial regarding this particular product and thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> When I first received this product, each in a tiny 2oz bottle, I was absolutely furious!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I try not to rely completely on hair stylists (they don&#x27;t really want to tell you what they use anyway).</li>
            <li> When I use the conditioner and comb it through my hair in the shower - I normally have hair in my comb - not with this product.</li>
            <li> The only compliant that I have about Carol&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s products is that they are very costly, compared to the price of most other shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> The mask was okay for my hair, and the only thing that I truly appreciated about the kit, other than the smell.  </li>
            <li> I wish it were available in other scents.</li>
            <li> My hair detangled easily, and I had less hair in my comb.</li>
            <li> I bought the black-Vanilla line, which did the EXACT same thing as the Monoi.</li>
            <li> After using this product my hair feels so soft!</li>
            <li> I had read mixed reviews and hoped I would have a positive experience.  </li>
            <li> Have only had this silkiness after using the conditionar in certain hair color products.</li>
            <li> Her shampoo and hair mask really added moisture back to my hair.</li>
            <li> carol&#x27;s daughter so far has done everything it advertised to do.</li>
            <li> It really does only take one time to see the results!</li>
            <li> So far, after only a few uses it seems like my hair is already doing better.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have a sensitive nose or that I am inclined to overexaggerate.  </li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t know if the product has a shelf life and the seller sold me an old batch or an ingredient affects the product over time.  </li>
            <li> I developed a headache that evening which wasn&#x27;t that unusal to me,</li>
            <li> It also makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I am a natural blond</li>
            <li> Am hoping this product repairs the natural damage that happens with color products and age.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m natural with 4a/4b hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this is passing in the natural community</li>
            <li> It really made my dry, coily, kinky hair very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> My hair is not black as is Carol&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> LIKE NO OTHER PRODUCT I EVER</li>
            <li> She recently went natural.</li>
            <li> My aunt who has natural hair swears by this product thats why i gave it a try,so I will just say this product did not work for me personally.</li>
            <li> Love the product-  was not happy with the price for a sample size product.  </li>
            <li> Saw less shedding of my hair with first use.  </li>
            <li> I heard my hair crackling, a little more than usual came out in the comb not a problem to me at that point.</li>
            <li> So im a natural with very dry hair.</li>
            <li> The treatment mask made my hair stiff after it was rinsed out, didn&#x27;t really think anything of it.</li>
            <li> not worth the money... does not leave hair soft enough at all.</li>
            <li> and it may not have been long enough to tell the difference.  </li>
            <li> This really worked for me from the first application, I had badly damaged my hair trying something new a friend had recommended my hair was coming out in my hand.  </li>
            <li> The smell was nothing different than you would expect with other African American hair care products.</li>
            <li> I tried both the Monoi &amp; Black-Vanilla (in the past) on my daughter&#x27;s natural hair and got the same result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And bottles were smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this to stop my hair from shedding so much and to tame down the frizz.  </li>
            <li> Very few products live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> Also I have dye in my hair (semi), which makes it dry</li>
            <li> I have dry hair</li>
            <li> leaves my hair dry and brittle prone to dreading and breakage.</li>
            <li> I have dry and itchy scalp, this product truly made a difference.</li>
            <li> but when I used the Monoi repairing I noticed that I was only losing a small of hair and within a month I was barely losing any.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner helped soften my hair slightly after the shampoo but not much.i had to use my tresseme to help bring back life in my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair continued to be very dry.  </li>
            <li> I tried several things some worked a little and some didn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> You feel as each step is doing something different, and even though it is small it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Not really.  </li>
            <li> I, myself, have absolutely no troubles.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected...</li>
            <li> MY HAIR NEVER HAD BEEN SO TAME, SOFT, SHINY, NO MORE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m throwing out all the other products in my shower.</li>
            <li> I will definitely other Carol&#x27;s Daughter product line.</li>
            <li> thought i was tiredI set my hair as usual on combing it out the next day</li>
            <li> I have mixed gray &amp; dark brown hair that is neither thin nor coarse, and my hair is shorter, ending just below my ears.</li>
            <li> MY HAIR IS VERY THICK, NATURALLY CURLY, FRIZZY AND</li>
            <li> ...this Monoi product made my scalp itchy and weighted my hair down.  </li>
            <li> I will never use any other products now!</li>
            <li> Less breakage.</li>
            <li> Less hairs in the shower</li>
            <li> I did differently in the past day and decided to rewash my hair with my usual shampoos and conditioner....</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to a friend because of the price with little result.</li>
            <li> A little pricey though.</li>
            <li> This product did nothing to my hair but make it hard, brittle, and very dry.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair fuller and stronger and does not weigh my hair down at all!</li>
            <li> I also use the Monoi oil over my scalp and ends it still doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s won&#x27;t be a waste if you decide the product is not for you.</li>
            <li> A few years ago (before my color)</li>
            <li> Waste of time.</li>
            <li> I misplaced the packaging.  </li>
            <li> I am noticing way less hair in my hands as I wash and condition too!</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t hard to manage so it just seemed like any other shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> I have thin but curly dry and color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about everything to get some moisture into my dry, unhealthy hair.</li>
            <li> Way overpriced for these small packages.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> no more burnt hair</li>
            <li> A really harsh protein treatment!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pricy for a small amount of product</li>
            <li> my headache was finally gone even though now my hair is now damaged and will need cutting to regrow...</li>
            <li> Not amazing</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a very small amount.  </li>
            <li> If you get a bad smell when you take off the cap, just put it back.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell if it was the conditioner, shampoo, or both, but this was not good for my hair.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really not a good product.</li>
            <li> If the reviews on here concerning this trial set have been conflicting, and you are not sure whether to purchase this product or not (like I was), just try the trial size (like what I did), which isn&#x27;t as expensive.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and somewhat curly hair.</li>
            <li> To make matters worse, I suffered an allergic reaction , as my scalp started itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shampoo was crazy harsh on my hair.</li>
            <li> Very small and expensive</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had to return it.  </li>
            <li> (so does this cold weather).</li>
            <li> I have not used any of the product since and I am afraid to give it to any one else, because I don&#x27;t want their hair to fall out</li>
            <li> Maybe your hair has to be in really bad shape to appreciate this product.  </li>
            <li> Shocked!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It was horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is awesome. Saw less shedding of my hair with first use.  Well worth every penny. Ordering full size bottles now.</li>
            <li> Wife loved this for her birthday... She had wanted to try for a while the collection let her see what she like and didn&#x27;t...... now she just buys conditioner.</li>
            <li> Loving using this . Product. Hair is soft, manageable and smells great. Even my hair stylist say s th I s was a good product and reasonabley priced. You don&#x27;t have to u s e a lot of product to get good results.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with this kit. I have all of the products in this line and I must say I am not disappointed. the oil being my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;If you want stronger, healthier hair this is the best from Carol&#x27;s Daughter. My hair feels stronger after using it and the shine is fierce. I have no relaxer in my hair but I do have color and it keeps my hair strong and vibrate. I definitely recommend this kit for healthier stronger hair.</li>
            <li> Way overpriced for these small packages.  Product is overrated.</li>
            <li> Too small a quantity to judge its effectiveness; uncertain if I am willing to buy more to determine its value.</li>
            <li> Love the Carol&#x27;s Daughter Monoi line. My kinky hair loves it. I also have the Hair milk line and the Mirabelle Plum line which I will use soon.</li>
            <li> wonderful produce, great smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my sister and she loved it. She recently went natural. I also love the body lotion.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like my money wasted, I am on a constant search for the best quality hair products that I can stick with, and I don&#x27;t feed into hype. I try not to rely completely on hair stylists (they don&#x27;t really want to tell you what they use anyway). I try to take some responsibility for my own hair health as well. This product has given me everything I&#x27;ve been looking for. My hair is a step up from the most coarse hair you can have (4a?). When it&#x27;s relaxed it looks shiny, and full. I have fine hair however, but with the right products and good moisture and conditioner, my hair looks thick. This stuff helps my hair to do that. I tried Carol&#x27;s daughter years ago and didn&#x27;t like it at all! Back then her products were greasy, heavy and they just sat on your hair like real butter. I believe that she&#x27;s improved her products significantly since then. The shampoo and conditioner both lived up to their claims. My hair detangled easily, and I had less hair in my comb. The smell was nothing different than you would expect with other African American hair care products. I am about 10 weeks out since my last relaxer. This product is helping me stretch my relaxer and also keep hair on my head. Also I have dye in my hair (semi), which makes it dry (so does this cold weather). Her shampoo and hair mask really added moisture back to my hair. I put the mask on and sat under the dryer for 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If the reviews on here concerning this trial set have been conflicting, and you are not sure whether to purchase this product or not (like I was), just try the trial size (like what I did), which isn&#x27;t as expensive. It&#x27;s won&#x27;t be a waste if you decide the product is not for you. I tried the trial size and just recently ordered the full sizes because I was so satisfied. Hopefully they will be just as good as the trial sizes. The only compliant that I have about Carol&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s products is that they are very costly, compared to the price of most other shampoos and conditioners.Maybe it&#x27;s because she is using better ingredients that cost more? I&#x27;m not sure. For now, I plan to pay the higher prices however to maintain my hair health. One day, I&#x27;m certain that I will look for products that are comparable, if she doesn&#x27;t lower her prices. Try the trial size. If your hair is similiar to mine, you will be pleased.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to sey nating about hhe shampoo and conditioner itill not use yet,bat the oele is very good i love!!</li>
            <li> The best product for natural hair</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! My hair is so much stronger and healthier after just one month! I saw results after the first use. I have very dry, fine hair and have used so many different products trying to find something that works with my hair. My search is over</li>
            <li> Good but to small for the price....</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this product from Amazon, but I felt compelled to write a review anyway. I have relaxed, color-treated hair, so with that said i need Moisture... This product smells amazing.. I though this would be a winner, however these products (including the Monoi trio ( leave in, serum and oil)) made my hair smell Great, but felt Crunchy and dry. This is the 2nd time I purchased hair care product from Carol&#x27;s daughter, and this time it is the last. A few years ago (before my color) I bought the black-Vanilla line, which did the EXACT same thing as the Monoi. My hair smelt Amazing, but was completely dry and crunchy.. I tried both the Monoi &amp; Black-Vanilla (in the past) on my daughter&#x27;s natural hair and got the same result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I will just stick to the body lotions, salts, and bath soap because those are really great..</li>
            <li> carol&#x27;s daughter so far has done everything it advertised to do. there has been no breakage, and  my hair seems to be getting stronger.&lt;br /&gt;hthanks</li>
            <li> I will never use any other products now! I am in love with this line!</li>
            <li> I have heard nothing but good things about Carol&#x27;s Daughter.  My hair is in decent shape, so perhaps it&#x27;s user error.  Maybe your hair has to be in really bad shape to appreciate this product.  I couldn&#x27;t tell if it was the conditioner, shampoo, or both, but this was not good for my hair.  The mask was okay for my hair, and the only thing that I truly appreciated about the kit, other than the smell.  This should be a lotion (hint, hint).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen this product line advertised on HSN many times, but didn&#x27;t want to try it in full size.  Glad I didn&#x27;t.  I have dry hair and when I tried this out, I felt like my hair actually laughed.  Not moisturizing enough for me and won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I really love this set! It is a great way to try the products in an affordable way. I had a great experience with the sellar and absolutely recommend them</li>
            <li> At first this product made my hair soft &amp; manageable. After about 3 weeks (using once a week) my hair began falling out. It was horrible. My hairline was thinning &amp; receding. I don&#x27;t know if the blame is 100% on this product, but once I stopped using it &amp; began taking vitamins, my hair grew back. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Love it. This price beats the TV price. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> ...this Monoi product made my scalp itchy and weighted my hair down.  I had read mixed reviews and hoped I would have a positive experience.  Unfortunately, I had to return it.  I have mixed gray &amp; dark brown hair that is neither thin nor coarse, and my hair is shorter, ending just below my ears.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair with the shampoo and conditioner my hair fell out. All this hair was in my comb. I spent all this money on a product I thought would be good. I have not used any of the product since and I am afraid to give it to any one else, because I don&#x27;t want their hair to fall out</li>
            <li> Using all three is really too much for my Caucasian curly hair. But the Mask....AWESOME!!! My favorite and will pay the money for a full size of it!  I have bought so many products trying to find one that works on my hair  Really has helped with the dryness and breakage.</li>
            <li> This really worked for me from the first application, I had badly damaged my hair trying something new a friend had recommended my hair was coming out in my hand.  I tried several things some worked a little and some didn&#x27;t work at all but when I used the Monoi repairing I noticed that I was only losing a small of hair and within a month I was barely losing any.  Thank you Carol&#x27;s Daughter.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice much difference.  My hair isn&#x27;t hard to manage so it just seemed like any other shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> Received it quickly and in good condition. Product does what it says.  Have recommended it to three others.  Did order a bigger size.</li>
            <li> Waste of time. Products did nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li> It really does only take one time to see the results! I used it on my daughter who has naturally fine curly hair that tends to be dry and brittle. I couldn&#x27;t get over the difference! It was shiny and easy to brush the next morning &amp; very soft to the touch. Can&#x27;t wait to try it on mine!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Shipping was quick and I was so excited to use it.  I love carol&#x27;s daughter hair products, I used to use the Chocolat line.  I wanted to try this to stop my hair from shedding so much and to tame down the frizz.  So far, after only a few uses it seems like my hair is already doing better.  The mask does wonders!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, she said she loved it. She would like to try the entire line of there products.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  My hair continued to be very dry.  It also continued to break at the ends.  I wish I could get my money back.  I misplaced the packaging.  Amazon should refund my money!</li>
            <li> seller was fast. Product is just ok.. This sample is for maybe 3-4 washes. Dont feel a big difference in hair (softness) yet. Will use until im out.</li>
            <li> Shocked! Very few products live up to the hype. I have thin but curly dry and color treated hair. Always looking for something that will help me keep from losing more hair but allow me to wear my hair curly or straight ( flat iron).  The first use I saw a difference.  My hair was soft, full and looked great just air dried. It looked equally as nice when I blow dried and stayed soft and manageable.  I&#x27;m sold and will now by the larger set.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that seems to tangle and break all the time. I used this product and felt and saw a difference right away. I love the smell! I only wash my hair once a week. It used to get frizzy after day 2. Now with this product, it doesn&#x27;t get frizzy at all. I love it! I&#x27;m throwing out all the other products in my shower.</li>
            <li> I purchase this product with the excitement of pleased results. This product did nothing to my hair but make it hard, brittle, and very dry. I wasn&#x27;t happy at all. And I have very fine hair. I will try another product line from Carol&#x27;s Daughter.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell if this was a great product or not as I got the sample and it may not have been long enough to tell the difference.  I do have the Carol&#x27;s Daughter Loc Butter and love it so I thought I would try this.  I managed to use all of it but the smell affected me.  I don&#x27;t think I have a sensitive nose or that I am inclined to overexaggerate.  I also understand the concept of you get what you pay for.  However, I don&#x27;t know if the product has a shelf life and the seller sold me an old batch or an ingredient affects the product over time.  I think it is great that it is sulphate free and I enjoyed the repairing mask.  I will wait until I am in an actual store before I buy this product again. If you get a bad smell when you take off the cap, just put it back.</li>
            <li> It really made my dry, coily, kinky hair very soft and manageable.  I will definitely other Carol&#x27;s Daughter product line.</li>
            <li> It did ok. My hair still sheds. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to a friend because of the price with little result.</li>
            <li> I have heard about Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s products for years and have heard from many people how fantastic her hair care line is. I have seen the infomercial regarding this particular product and thought I would give it a try. Firstly, the fragrance was very overwhelming, the shampoo and conditioner made my hair feel very hard. Maybe there is some form of protein in it that caused this result. When I put in the hair mask, it seemed to do but, again, the fragrance is too overwhelming. I had as much breakage as I did before I started. To make matters worse, I suffered an allergic reaction , as my scalp started itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I only paid for the starter kit and will not be purchasing this - or any of Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> Great sizes to try out at least twice. I felt a difference using these products after the first wash!</li>
            <li> So im a natural with very dry hair. I was expecting this product to work a miracle. I love the shampoo b/c it doesn&#x27;t contain sulphate but the conditioner/hair mask wasn&#x27;t all that my hair felt like straw still after the use. I will probably just re-order the shampoo. But it smelled great.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! LOVE IT! It gives you every step that you need for a perfect hair. Plus in the description it specify exactly how to use it which it was a pleasure to read. You feel as each step is doing something different, and even though it is small it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> When I first received this product, each in a tiny 2oz bottle, I was absolutely furious! I hadn&#x27;t planned on spending almost 30$ for a one use product. I just about to hop online and share my greif but luckily decided to actually tried it first lol!&lt;br /&gt;This stuff truly is AMAZING! I have tried just about everything to get some moisture into my dry, unhealthy hair. After using this system my hair feels perfectly soft and healthy :). I&#x27;m definitely going to invest in the full size products. The only downside for me was the price. But because of how much improvement I am seeing, I definitely feel it was worth it :)</li>
            <li> I have biracial (African American and Caucasian) hair  that is currently transitioning. I have very thick and somewhat curly hair. I love the shampoo it gets ALL my hair clean, smells beautiful and doesn&#x27;t leave residue however the conditioner seems to do more harm than good which is not helpful because I usually cowash. leaves my hair dry and brittle prone to dreading and breakage.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and full of shine. Smells great. Less breakage. Great product. I have recommended thi product to friends and family</li>
            <li> CAROL&#x27;S DAUGHTER YOU ARE THE WOMAN WHO RESOLVE MY HAIR PROBLEMS ONCE AND FOR ALL!!! MY HAIR NEVER HAD BEEN SO TAME, SOFT, SHINY, NO MORE FRIZZ, DRYNESS, NO MORE DAMAGE ON MY HAIR ENDS, THE FIRST PRODUCT THAT I TRIED WAS MILK HAIR CURL DEFINER, THEN I WENT TO MACY&#x27;S TO GET THE CURL DEFINER BECAUSE I JUST FINISHED MY LAST BOTTLE, THEN I WANTED TO TRY THE WHOLE MONOI REPAIRING SYSTEM, I BOUGHT THIS STARTER KIT, I&#x27;VE USED SO MANY PRODUCTS, FROM A TO Z, FROM CHEAP TO PRICEY, NOTHING WORKS AS THESE PRODUCTS. MY HAIR IS VERY THICK, NATURALLY CURLY, FRIZZY AND NOW IS DAMAGED FROM DYES BECAUSE I HAVE GRAY HAIR. BUT NOW I KNOW THERE IS A PRODUCT FOR MY HAIR. IT&#x27;S LIKE THIS WOMAN TOUCH MY HAIR WITH A MAGIC WAND!!! THE FIRST TIME I USED THESE PRODUCTS WAS ON A RAINY DAY, A RAINY DAY!!! HERE ON SOUTH FLORIDA AND IT WORKS AS WONDERFUL, LIKE NO OTHER PRODUCT I EVER USED. I EVEN HAVE USED THOSE PRODUCTS THAT PROMISE YOU TO ELIMINATE FRIZZ, BUT YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW SO MANY STEPS, EVEN TO GET YOUR HAIR UNDER A HEAT CAP FOR 20 MINUTES, AND BLA, BLA, BLA. NOTHING, NOTHING WORKS AS WONDERFUL AS THESE PRODUCTS, AND ON THREE OR FOUR EASY STEPS (WITH THE MILK HAIR CURL DEFINER). I NEVER STICK WITH ONLY ONE BRAND, BUT I BELIEVE I FOUND THE ONE. FINALLY I CAN SHOW MY HAIR AS IT IS, WITH BEAUTIFUL CURLS, AND NO NEED TO USE HOT TOOLS ANY MORE... THANKS CAROL&#x27;S DAUGHTER.</li>
            <li> This product really does prevent hair loss. When I use the conditioner and comb it through my hair in the shower - I normally have hair in my comb - not with this product. It really does what it says. I do not like the scent though. I wish it were available in other scents. I was going to give it 4 stars because of the scent, but it works so well that it deserves 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I love this product, my hair is longer and it seems thicker. I recommended it to a friend hope she has the same results. Less hairs in the shower and I feel better about my hair.</li>
            <li> Very pricey and it&#x27;s a very small amount.  Know your ounces before ordering because you won&#x27;t get much in this kit!</li>
            <li> This product wasn&#x27;t for me. I followed the instructions to a tee, I have permed hair with a clor rinse. The treatment mask made my hair stiff after it was rinsed out, didn&#x27;t really think anything of it. I developed a headache that evening which wasn&#x27;t that unusal to me, thought i was tiredI set my hair as usual on combing it out the next day I heard my hair crackling, a little more than usual came out in the comb not a problem to me at that point. Still had a low grade headache for a couple days after, couldn&#x27;t get rid of it with medication either and my scalp was unusually tender to the touch. Couldn&#x27;t tie my head or set it with curlers. Suddenly the thought came to me about was I did differently in the past day and decided to rewash my hair with my usual shampoos and conditioner....what a relief I had, the tenderness from my scalp diminished and my headache was finally gone even though now my hair is now damaged and will need cutting to regrow...no bad feelings, i guess not all products work for everyone.My aunt who has natural hair swears by this product thats why i gave it a try,so I will just say this product did not work for me personally. Good luck Carol Daughters with your product.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. I bought a sample size of both of these in the store and am coming back for the full size bottles on Amazon because it is cheaper! :) Just for reference I have very fine, very straight, highlighted blonde hair that is to my shoulders. It makes my hair fuller and stronger and does not weigh my hair down at all! I am noticing way less hair in my hands as I wash and condition too! I also use the Monoi oil over my scalp and ends it still doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down! My hair has never looked better! I am a self proclaimed product junkie and have used many, many, many hair products. I have never done a review on any of them until now. This stuff works amazingly well for me! The scent is also wonderful! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m among the million+ women looking for the perfect hair product that is cruelty-free, tames the frizz and gives life to my hair.  First I will say that I love the smell of this collection.  Yes, I would buy it again or another kit in her collection.  Is it the cure for my frizz?  Not really.  Does it repair my hair?  I have throughout the years colored it and still do but not with regular frequency.  I do try to wear protective head gear in the sun.  With this said, my hair is maybe considered in need of something.  I have used this kit about 4 times now and yes, I think it does help to make it better even though I still have that semi-curly, untamed look by afternoon when a scrunchie comes in handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lent it to a friend to try and she said just putting some of the shampoo on her hand made her palm itch so she was hesitant to put it on her scalp.  I, myself, have absolutely no troubles.</li>
            <li> This makes your hair smell wonderful (unless you hate the smell of gardenia!) It also makes my hair soft and shiny. My hair is not black as is Carol&#x27;s. I am a natural blond but I like it all the same!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the service it&#x27;s very good thanks</li>
            <li> Not what I expected...Very strong floral, tropical fragrance.....not worth the money... does not leave hair soft enough at all. I will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after using a sample of both the shampoo and the conditioner. I fell in love with the scent. I am a caucasian women with pin-straight gray hair and like the way it makes my strawlike hair feel; soft and smooth but not limp. I recommended it to my younger sister with color processed curly hair to help with controlling frizz and repair damage.</li>
            <li> Have wanted to try for a while &amp; this set gave me that chance. Smell may be too much for some people but it goes away within a couple of hours so for me it was fine. Have only had this silkiness after using the conditionar in certain hair color products. Am hoping this product repairs the natural damage that happens with color products and age. Would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> AS SOON AS I CAN I WILL BE ORDERING THE FULL SIZE GREAT SHOPPING KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK THANKS</li>
            <li> Purchased the collection as a gift. I really cannot say anything.</li>
            <li> very good product for curly hair</li>
            <li> Just bought this recently, only have used it a couple times but I will say that it made my hair feel very clean and helped with the dryness. It smells great too.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair - that goes through a lot of heat damage ( in attempts to straighten). After using this product my hair feels so soft! Smells amazing too- no more burnt hair smell!&lt;br /&gt; Wish the trial bottles were slightly bigger, but will purchase the larger products soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m natural with 4a/4b hair. I only use shampoo once a month to clarify my scalp.The shampoo was crazy harsh on my hair. It felt like straw instantly, I didn&#x27;t even need to rub my scalp. The conditioner helped soften my hair slightly after the shampoo but not much.i had to use my tresseme to help bring back life in my hair. And the mask i feel is OK. I would never use the shampoo every again. Maybe the conditioner and mask as a protein treatment because that&#x27;s what it felt like on my hair...A really harsh protein treatment! I don&#x27;t know how this is passing in the natural community but it&#x27;s really not a good product. Oh but it smells OK... Not amazing</li>
            <li> This product smells great but it&#x27;s pricy for a small amount of product and I am unsure if I had any improvement.</li>
            <li> I have dry and itchy scalp, this product truly made a difference.</li>
            <li> Love the product-  was not happy with the price for a sample size product.  I only got two washing a out of this.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever!!! A little pricey though. And bottles were smaller than expected. But it&#x27;s seriously the best hair line I&#x27;ve ever used. (It&#x27;s at Target much cheaper)</li>
            <li> Very small and expensive</li>
    </ol>
