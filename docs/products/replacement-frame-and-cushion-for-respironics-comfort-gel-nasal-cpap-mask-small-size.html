            <li>Thanks for a great product, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be buying more as they tend not to last long while traveling.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and is a genuine Respironics replacement part.</li>
            <li>Perfect replacement for my broken frame.</li>
            <li>They should stop saying you get the full mask or they should work harder with Amazon to make sure their customers get the full mask.</li>
            <li>This is a Great Replacement Nasal mask for you if you use a nasal mask, Just remember, these mask do not need to be tight,  gently tighten the mask, Do A leak check.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>am glad to see his size back in stock.</li>
            <li>the plastic piece that holds the straps for the head gear snapped off the first week I had it</li>
            <li>Was exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>I have had good sleep, not waking every few hours.</li>
            <li>I replaced my original unit with this unit and its&#x27; met most of my expectations, except sometimes it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as snug as my previous one.</li>
            <li>The primary issue I have with it is that apparently I&#x27;m allergic to the material it&#x27;s made from.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>I got it in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>The headpiece is a bit wide and forces one to cinch up a bit tighter all around to make sure it stays in place.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>so much I ordered two more.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so much so, I cannot sleep.</li>
            <li>Med has a reasonable price on this item.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I prefer it over the one my doctor recommends which is a bit bulky and covers my full face, but buyers should be aware that the vendor only ships out the gel cushion and not the frame</li>
            <li>the first 2 weeks you have to use your old set-up.</li>
            <li>thanks to the passage of the new healthcare legislation</li>
            <li>It fits on the hose from his Respironics Comfort Classic.</li>
            <li>He has to jerryrig his mask until I can order new ones.</li>
            <li>Exactly the same mask!</li>
            <li>I like the way they have added a small vent at the top of the hose input.</li>
            <li>I am an old school CPap user and needed a new mask.  </li>
            <li>This was just what we needed to replace my husband&#x27;s old worn out mask.</li>
            <li>, I was so surprised to receive it almost immediately.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Oh, don&#x27;t be surprised if the cushion and frame are shipped separately.</li>
            <li>I was happily surprised when it came with head straps and all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve aired it out for weeks, soaked it in baby shampoo, then regular shampoo, sprayed it with perfume which just fades away.</li>
            <li>I have spent so much money on leaky masks that made my face hurt.  </li>

            <li> The very same part that I&#x27;ve been using and so much cheaper than through my usual medical supply company.  </li>
            <li> so you get only half a mask.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay sealed while I&#x27;m sleeping like other ones I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> but that could be due to the weather.  </li>
            <li> Other than that the product fits the need I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The equipment cost a lot less</li>
            <li> I was skeptical and used my prescription to get a new mask along with ordering one of these.  </li>
            <li> , It was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not satisfied with the Respironics gel mask I purchased.  </li>
            <li> bought a small size and came S/M size.</li>
            <li> It is small.</li>
            <li> Late with delivery</li>
            <li> The construction is weak so that the brackets which hold the head strap will break with the slightest tug.  </li>
            <li> husband has a bad habit of slipping off his mask without using the Velcro straps.</li>
            <li> The main problem is that it has a terrible smell.</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong size, but I still use it and will order again.</li>
            <li> Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> It is very disappointing.</li>
            <li> , even stupid nasal masks now require a prescription...</li>
            <li> It just has a permanent nasty smell that is so bad</li>
            <li> He has a nasty habit of breaking the forehead rest.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not satisfied with the Respironics gel mask I purchased.  It doesn&#x27;t stay sealed while I&#x27;m sleeping like other ones I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> This was just what we needed to replace my husband&#x27;s old worn out mask. It fits on the hose from his Respironics Comfort Classic. It worked so well, we ordered another one so we&#x27;d have a back-up.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product and pricing.  Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> This is a Great Replacement Nasal mask for you if you use a nasal mask, Just remember, these mask do not need to be tight,  gently tighten the mask, Do A leak check.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t as comfortable as the one it replaced,but it does the job.  The primary issue I have with it is that apparently I&#x27;m allergic to the material it&#x27;s made from.  I&#x27;ve had to cover everything with surgical tape to keep from breaking out,</li>
            <li> The main problem is that it has a terrible smell. It is a chemical type smell. I have tried everything to get rid of the oder and it comes back. I&#x27;ve aired it out for weeks, soaked it in baby shampoo, then regular shampoo, sprayed it with perfume which just fades away. It just has a permanent nasty smell that is so bad the first 2 weeks you have to use your old set-up.</li>
            <li> Good price and works great.</li>
            <li> Was a lot better than I thought it would be. Thank you so much. Will be getting more from this seller</li>
            <li> Works just like the original one!!</li>
            <li> Late with delivery but that could be due to the weather.  Other than that the product fits the need I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It did not arrived as pictured. I only got the cushion.  I was counting on it for sleeping that night.  Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> This works great!!!  I will definitely reorder on here.</li>
            <li> Finally a mask that fits at a great price!  I have spent so much money on leaky masks that made my face hurt.  This one is great.</li>
            <li> Even thought the product fits well.  The construction is weak so that the brackets which hold the head strap will break with the slightest tug.  One night I was thankful we had electrical tape to repair the unit.  Products these days are designed to fall apart.</li>
            <li> Just like the original one I got with my machine.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical and used my prescription to get a new mask along with ordering one of these.  The product came in with Respironics name on all of it.  I liked it so much I bought one for a family member.  Saves you about 1/3 of prescription.</li>
            <li> Works great. Product as described. Good quality and will order again when I need CPAP equipment. Satisfied with the price!!</li>
            <li> I replaced my original unit with this unit and its&#x27; met most of my expectations, except sometimes it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as snug as my previous one. I got it in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> The apparatus and gel mask provided a good, fairly comfortable seal.  The headpiece is a bit wide and forces one to cinch up a bit tighter all around to make sure it stays in place.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed! Perfect replacement for my broken frame. So glad to be able to find stuff like this on amazon instead of buying from somewhere at 5x the cost even with insurance! Thanks for a great product, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be buying more as they tend not to last long while traveling.</li>

            <li> MAKE IT EXCEPTIONALLY CLEAR JUST EXACTLY THE SIZE!!!!!</li>
            <li> Recommend this for anyone needing supplies, don&#x27;t need to go any where else excellent.  fast shipping and excellent price for any budget</li>
            <li> Happy,happy,happy....</li>
            <li> My best friend is back up and running.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.  The very same part that I&#x27;ve been using and so much cheaper than through my usual medical supply company.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Have not used this item as of yet but believe to be a good backup for what I currently have.</li>
            <li> It came with a different size.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a small size and came S/M size. And it didnt fit to my mother.&lt;br /&gt;I wrote for the seller and nobody answer me.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to know if S/M is the smaller size.</li>
            <li> This is the same mask that I&#x27;d pay trillions of dollars for from a medical distributor. Sure my insurance doesn&#x27;t cover it when I buy it from Amazon, but it&#x27;s like 1/10th the price. Exactly the same mask!</li>
            <li> I am an old school CPap user and needed a new mask.  This is a great replacement.  I ordered the wrong size, but I still use it and will order again.</li>
            <li> I had the same one years ago and it fits well and is quiet. Good quality and cant beet the price.</li>
            <li> Fit was perfect. I have had good sleep, not waking every few hours.</li>
            <li> This mask is as about as good as it gets for me. I like the way they have added a small vent at the top of the hose input.</li>
            <li> The equipment cost a lot less then what I have been paying so I&#x27;m very happy. I didn&#x27;t think I was going to find it for as low as I did.</li>
            <li> Keeps separating at the forhead pivot point</li>
            <li> LOVE IT FOR THE SIZE AND VALUE!</li>
            <li> These nasal masks fit just as good as the name brand but at a third of the cost! I love it!</li>
            <li> The nasal mask was absolutely terrific.  It was a perfect fit and a pleasure to wear.&lt;br /&gt;The mask worked perfectly as I cannot sleep without it....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the delivery time was so quick, I was so surprised to receive it almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I love Shed Med so much I ordered two more.&lt;br /&gt;My husband has a bad habit of slipping off his mask without using the Velcro straps. He has a nasty habit of breaking the forehead rest. He has to jerryrig his mask until I can order new ones. This causes all kinds of noises, so much so, I cannot sleep. (If he would only put it on and take it off properly!) Thank goodness Shed  Med has a reasonable price on this item.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad to see his size back in stock. Thank you Shed Med.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, don&#x27;t be surprised if the cushion and frame are shipped separately.</li>
            <li> Works well..great company to deal with.</li>
            <li> I goofed. I thought I was ordering a face mask and received a nasal mask, the are not interchangeable.</li>
            <li> the plastic piece that holds the straps for the head gear snapped off the first week I had it and so then it was unusable, It was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and is a genuine Respironics replacement part. very happy with purchase and delivery!</li>
            <li> up yours, Obamacare! thanks to the passage of the new healthcare legislation, even stupid nasal masks now require a prescription... glad i was able to acquire this backup without a hassle</li>
            <li> Yup, it&#x27;s a cpap mask.  Comes with the gel portion, which is nice.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mask. It&#x27;s very comfortable. It fits nicely over my nose, but not my mouth. It is small. I prefer it over the one my doctor recommends which is a bit bulky and covers my full face, but buyers should be aware that the vendor only ships out the gel cushion and not the frame so you get only half a mask. They use to resolve this quickly. Now they tell me to work through Amazon, and Amazon does nothing, and appears not to know about this, in my opinion. As a result, I&#x27;ve downgraded my review from five stars to three and now to one, and I probably will not buy from this vendor again. They should stop saying you get the full mask or they should work harder with Amazon to make sure their customers get the full mask. I believe, it is illegal to sell these masks without a prescription and that is probably part of the problem, but this vendor should be truthful with their customers. It is very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Authorities are investigating whether a high-speed police chase in Texas is related to this week&#x27;s shooting death of Colorado&#x27;s prison chief, a sheriff&#x27;s office said</li>
            <li> It attached to my hose easily. The mask is comfortable and fits my nose well. I was happily surprised when it came with head straps and all.</li>
            <li> Fit was perfect. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I needed</li>
