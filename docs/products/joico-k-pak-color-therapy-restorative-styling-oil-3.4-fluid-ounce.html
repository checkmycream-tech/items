            <li> Love this stuff however this last order was not packaged properly and the bottle broke resulting in a big mess and an empty bottle</li>
            <li> I use a tiny bit on dry hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been around a long time</li>
            <li> Helps the ends to not feel dry without it looking oily.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, I don&#x27;t need to use any other products but styling oil for my hair.</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair and style it a little while I&#x27;m blow drying.</li>
            <li> It also cuts down frizz on humid days.</li>
            <li> Helps get the tangles out after shampooing plus does not weigh down or cause my curls to loosen up.</li>
            <li> Once my hair is almost fully dry, I put a small amount of oil in my hand and rub it between my palms.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday when drying my hair, never greasy.  </li>
            <li> No more hair salons for me!&lt;br /&gt;For hundreds and hundreds of dollars</li>
            <li> I have really thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit on the greasier side, and it makes my hair look a little oily, but compared to some of the other oils I&#x27;ve tried, it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>

            <li> nothing like Joico .love it</li>
            <li> Love this stuff however this last order was not packaged properly and the bottle broke resulting in a big mess and an empty bottle</li>
            <li> I have really thick, curly hair. This oil makes my hair soft, manageable and beautiful. My husband even buys it for me while I&#x27;m deployed!</li>
            <li> Great for styling dry hair.</li>
            <li> my wife likes it so much</li>
            <li> Moisturizes without leaving hair greasy.  Smells good too.</li>
            <li> Really makes your hair shine. Great product. It&#x27;s been around a long time and I hope I never can&#x27;t find it.  Thankfully these folks are still selling it..</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. The oil does not leave hair greasy. It leaves hair soft and my hair is bleach platinum blonde. It also cuts down frizz on humid days. Well worth the cost. A little goes a long way. I like to apply to damp hair and style and if I have flyaways I use a tiny bit on dry hair.</li>
            <li> The only oil product that leaves your hair feeling amazing, and DOES NOT make it look oily or feel oily, it just makes your hair feel great!</li>
            <li> Really love this stuff.  Has made my hair feel and look healthier.  Helps the ends to not feel dry without it looking oily.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. This is exactly the same product you would get from a Joico representative!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent product as always and better price than any salon in town.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair instantly silky, soft and more manageable. I always have this product on hand and recommend it to everyone. Been using it for years now!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It is &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; feeling on your hands but once you put it in your hair you can wash your hands.</li>
            <li> I went through a period where I tried several hair oils, from Moroccan oil to argan oil to coconut oil. I love Joico&#x27;s other hair products, so I decided to give this oil a try. It has a light, pleasant smell and it isn&#x27;t too runny or too thick. I blow dry my hair and style it a little while I&#x27;m blow drying. Once my hair is almost fully dry, I put a small amount of oil in my hand and rub it between my palms. Then I comb the oil into my hair with my fingers. This way, the oil gets applied to all my hair, instead of just the top layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Joico styling oil is good for styling hair. Sometimes, I don&#x27;t need to use any other products but styling oil for my hair. It&#x27;s a bit on the greasier side, and it makes my hair look a little oily, but compared to some of the other oils I&#x27;ve tried, it&#x27;s not that bad. Overall, it&#x27;s a good product, but there are better oils out there.</li>
            <li> smells very good! but it was not the best product on my hair</li>
            <li> Very nice, i loved it.</li>
            <li> Great product, but I&#x27;ve recently come to prefer Surface Bassu Oil. It smells better, works better, and has cleaner ingredients.</li>
            <li> No more hair salons for me!&lt;br /&gt;For hundreds and hundreds of dollars, my hair was FRIED.&lt;br /&gt;What has saved my hair????&lt;br /&gt;Many different homemade therapies.... topped off by Joico K-Pak Color Therapy Restorative Styling Oil.&lt;br /&gt;It helped to heal the fry.&lt;br /&gt;And now 1 year later, I use it every day to keep my curly hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Love this oil.  Helps get the tangles out after shampooing plus does not weigh down or cause my curls to loosen up.</li>
            <li> It helps with my frizzy hair and made it look shinny.  I like this product.</li>
