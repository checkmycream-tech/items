            <li>I need a haircut and this makes my hair healthy.  </li>
            <li>I still don&#x27;t use any leave-in conditioner after using this product, and it&#x27;s still my favorite conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I have used this conditioner for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is awesome, but the last time I bought it, it was diluted...</li>

            <li>I have used this product for many many years...</li>
            <li>My hair is much dryer with this brand and more fly away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since found a much better hair care line, Shea Moisture</li>
            <li>The SM Manuka Honey formula (only at Target and Ulta) hydrates and gives me incredible body and shine, and no frizz!!  </li>
            <li>What more can you ask for??  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for years and amazon definitely has the best price.</li>

            <li>This also was a great price (normally $48 for this size).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using Terax since 1988 and it has kept my hair soft and beautiful even with highlights.</li>

            <li>you can tell it&#x27;s working right away!!</li>
            <li>Does not come out too easy</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, but lots of it</li>
            <li>Keeps it frizz free, shiny &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>But it leaves your hair smelling clean, shiny, and strong.</li>
            <li>SM is available at Walgreens, CVS, Walmart, Target, Ulta and Sally&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I do miss the old packaging, I really loved having the pump.</li>
            <li>I purchased this originally while shopping at Ulta.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I have been using this conditioner for the past year and it is excellent as it strengthens the hair to reduce breakage and shedding.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize that I was buying The Crema + keratin conditioner; I thought I was getting the original -- no keratin.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is nothing special at all.  </li>

            <li>I love the smell, this leaves my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>Excellent for curly coarse hair as well fine and light weight it will never weight your hair down, but certainly it will add tones of softness and moist.</li>
            <li>My hair was still parched and it wasn&#x27;t any more manageable than when I used my regular cheap conditioner.  </li>
            <li>You only need to use a little bit at a time and it will work perfectly!</li>
            <li>It turns my coarse hair smooth and frizz free.</li>
            <li>it feels different than most conditioners right in the shower.</li>
            <li>hair feels soft and silky smooth when using this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have to admit, the smell of the product is repugnant when you first apply it.</li>
            <li>Definitely will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>Most girls go through different brands of things, looking for a star.</li>
            <li>And I noticed a difference the first time I used it, unlike with Terax.  </li>
            <li>very nice for thick hair.</li>
            <li>If you braid your hair while it&#x27;s still damp, put a bit of this through the length of your hair, the next morning you will have amazing waves naturally.</li>
            <li>No that my hair (and my psyche) have made a full recovery, I love the way it keeps damage at bay on my slightly highlighted, wavy and heat-tortured</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle worker but it does give me a little more time in between hair cuts and keeps my hair feeling soft and looking smooth.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>The prices you can find on amazon are absolutely unbeatable too.</li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;ve shampooed your hair, squeeze out as much water as you can, and leave on for a minimum of a minute (I leave it in while I shave, etc)</li>
            <li>This stuff is pricey, but works really well.</li>
            <li>I have fine, short hair and it never weighs it down and keeps it really healthy.</li>

            <li>Highly recommend this to anyone needing a hair conditioner.</li>
            <li>Just wish they had a bigger bottle, it&#x27;s worth the price anyhow.</li>
            <li>and it is easily damaged by my blow dryer, curling iron, flat iron, and various color treatments not to mention my well water.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling very soft</li>
            <li>My hair is very long, fine, and I have a Lot of it - if you&#x27;re in the same boat as me, this combo will work well for you.</li>
            <li>Nothing soft and detangle like this conditioner and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cruelty-free, I can use it every day without my hair feeling greasy or like it has lots of build-up in it, and it always leaves my hair feeling soft and easy-to-brush.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my hair soft and silky and has enabled me to keep my length despite ruining my hair with self-hair bleach jobs.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed that I can&#x27;t find the Blue bottle anymore.</li>
            <li>and this tames it completely.  </li>
            <li>Your hair is soft and moisturize.</li>
            <li>I only wish that I could give Terax Crema at least 10 more stars - its absolutely the holy grail of all hair conditioners .</li>
            <li>Worth every penny I spent!</li>
            <li>This made my fine, frizzy hair very soft and required less flat iron time!  </li>
            <li>, that actually gives me excellent results and is less expensive.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for it since it was recommended on the makeupalley.com hair forum numerous times.  </li>
            <li>I live in a very dry climate, and the ends of my hair just dry out quickly.</li>
            <li>When I first ordered this I was very frustrated, because the original Crema in the blue bottle was my favorite conditioner, and this seemed to be different, since it says right on the bottle you should use a leave-in conditioner after using this product.  </li>
            <li>and they assured me that this is exactly the same product as the old conditioner in the blue bottle, but that they simply added the line about using a leave-in conditioner after this product because it helps to protect your hair from damage.   </li>
            <li>SO - if you&#x27;re worried about the new packaging, let me reassure you that this is just the same as it always was, and works just as well.</li>
            <li>Really tamed and moisturized my dry, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair that tends to be dry</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell it works the same though.</li>
            <li>This new bottle is a different product all together, I don&#x27;t know how they can use the same name.</li>
            <li>This seems to be similar to the one in the old dark blue bottle but is sold at a much lower price.  </li>

            <li> SM is much better than Terax and less expensive.  </li>
            <li> am a little bit disappointed with the packaging change, only because I used to order the large bottle with a pump, which seems to be no longer available.  </li>
            <li> We are African American and have thick coarse relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> When I finally used the entire bottle and my hair was no better off, I knew I had been duped!!  </li>
            <li> I have  thick, wavy, hair that is straightened with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I use this about 3x a week, sometimes less.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I have no other way to say it.</li>
            <li> Its thick, but does not way down the hair.</li>
            <li> I also like the Tahitian Noni and the Raw Shea Butter formulas too.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be a sucker for the hype.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thick but that&#x27;s how i like it.</li>
            <li> I had a tough time detangling her hair after using this product because the hair seemed &amp;#34;harder&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner for years, ever since an unfortunate incident at a salon that involved triple-bleaching my hair.  </li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t believe all the stupid hype that Terax is some miracle in a bottle.  </li>
            <li> Really disappointed!</li>
            <li> The keratin version smells awful.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been bald for 15 years so I have no idea what this product is for or how it is used, but my wife says it is a quality product at a discount price.  That makes me happy!</li>
            <li> This is the best of the best. Nothing soft and detangle like this conditioner and unlike many conditioners of this kind is surprisingly light weight. Excellent for curly coarse hair as well fine and light weight it will never weight your hair down, but certainly it will add tones of softness and moist.</li>
            <li> My favorite  moisturizing in years!! I love the smell, this leaves my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling very soft</li>
            <li> I purchased this originally while shopping at Ulta. I&#x27;m always looking for good moisturizer. It was on the clearance rack. Coloring my hair (shoulder blade length) dries it. This conditioner works great for me. Keeps it frizz free, shiny &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> One of the best conditioners out there. I use this in conjunction with Devacurl No Poo wash &amp; John Masters Organics de-tangler. My hair is very long, fine, and I have a Lot of it - if you&#x27;re in the same boat as me, this combo will work well for you.</li>
            <li> hair feels soft and silky smooth when using this conditioner. it feels different than most conditioners right in the shower. you can tell it&#x27;s working right away!!</li>
            <li> hello. This is my new favorite conditioner. I love it. I need a haircut and this makes my hair healthy.  I have  thick, wavy, hair that is straightened with a flat iron. I wash about every 3 days.</li>
            <li> When I first ordered this I was very frustrated, because the original Crema in the blue bottle was my favorite conditioner, and this seemed to be different, since it says right on the bottle you should use a leave-in conditioner after using this product.  HOWEVER, I contacted the company (spoke to an actual person!  a very nice lady who was very patient and thorough with my questions) and they assured me that this is exactly the same product as the old conditioner in the blue bottle, but that they simply added the line about using a leave-in conditioner after this product because it helps to protect your hair from damage.   I still don&#x27;t use any leave-in conditioner after using this product, and it&#x27;s still my favorite conditioner.  It&#x27;s cruelty-free, I can use it every day without my hair feeling greasy or like it has lots of build-up in it, and it always leaves my hair feeling soft and easy-to-brush.  SO - if you&#x27;re worried about the new packaging, let me reassure you that this is just the same as it always was, and works just as well.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have been using this conditioner for the past year and it is excellent as it strengthens the hair to reduce breakage and shedding. We are African American and have thick coarse relaxed hair. My daughter is 8 and her hair is almost to her waist. I had a tough time detangling her hair after using this product because the hair seemed &amp;#34;harder&amp;#34;. After reading these reviews again I added the Life Drops which serve as a detangler/ leave in and it has made all the difference in the WORLD!!!!!!!!!! If you are considering this conditioner you will have the best results if you get the Life Drops as well.</li>
            <li> I have used this conditioner for more than 10 years. It works great for all types of hair. Its thick, but does not way down the hair. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Really tamed and moisturized my dry, frizzy hair.  Love it!  Pricey tho so I watch for when it goes on sale and that&#x27;s when I&#x27;ll buy it.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.  This seems to be similar to the one in the old dark blue bottle but is sold at a much lower price.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner for years, ever since an unfortunate incident at a salon that involved triple-bleaching my hair.  I don&#x27;t think that I will ever switch!  No that my hair (and my psyche) have made a full recovery, I love the way it keeps damage at bay on my slightly highlighted, wavy and heat-tortured hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a little bit disappointed with the packaging change, only because I used to order the large bottle with a pump, which seems to be no longer available.  Nonetheless, it would take a miracle to get this conditioner out of my shower.  The prices you can find on amazon are absolutely unbeatable too.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is awesome, but the last time I bought it, it was diluted... Really disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is my absolute FAVORITE conditioner. I do miss the old packaging, I really loved having the pump. I recommend this conditioner to everyone, it&#x27;s that awesome! I have fine, short hair and it never weighs it down and keeps it really healthy. And Amazon&#x27;s prices can&#x27;t be beat - you&#x27;ll pay close to $50 at Ulta.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that I was buying The Crema + keratin conditioner; I thought I was getting the original -- no keratin. The keratin version smells awful. As far as I can tell it works the same though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairdresser and I have been using terex for several years ,I highly recommend it to all my clients, It is one of the best moisturizer conditioner; not greasy and doesn&#x27;t leave hair limp.</li>
            <li> Amazing conditioner- my hair LOVES it! You only need to use a little bit at a time and it will work perfectly!</li>
            <li> I have to admit, the smell of the product is repugnant when you first apply it. But it leaves your hair smelling clean, shiny, and strong. I straighten my hair often, but when I went for a trim, the lady was amazed about how healthy my hair was. I use this about 3x a week, sometimes less. Definitely will be purchasing more. Just wish they had a bigger bottle, it&#x27;s worth the price anyhow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for 10 years.  It is the best conditioner i&#x27;ve ever used . It keeps my hair soft and silky and has enabled me to keep my length despite ruining my hair with self-hair bleach jobs.</li>
            <li> I have been using Terax since 1988 and it has kept my hair soft and beautiful even with highlights. This new bottle is a different product all together, I don&#x27;t know how they can use the same name. Very dissapointed that I can&#x27;t find the Blue bottle anymore.</li>
            <li> my favorite conditioner... great for thick wavy hair</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many many years...it was brought from Italy and distributed through my hometown of Syracuse, NY.  I have very curly hair that tends to be dry and this tames it completely.  It also smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li> this product is THE BEST for really curly hair!</li>
            <li> very nice for thick hair. it&#x27;s thick but that&#x27;s how i like it.</li>
            <li> I used to use this years ago and loved it.  I&#x27;m not as happy with it now.  I had switched to another brand and then that brand changed so I went back to this brand.  Guess I&#x27;ll have to find another one altogether.  My hair is much dryer with this brand and more fly away.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner ever. Period.</li>
            <li> Most girls go through different brands of things, looking for a star. I&#x27;ve found it in this conditioner. I use it as a leave in as well, that&#x27;s how good it is. Once you&#x27;ve shampooed your hair, squeeze out as much water as you can, and leave on for a minimum of a minute (I leave it in while I shave, etc) The smell isn&#x27;t perfect and I compare it to that blue toilet bowl cleaner. Sorry, I have no other way to say it. If you braid your hair while it&#x27;s still damp, put a bit of this through the length of your hair, the next morning you will have amazing waves naturally. Hope this helped, thank you for reading my review.</li>
            <li> Nothing compares to Terax Crema!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop saying great things about this product. It rocks because it works. It turns my coarse hair smooth and frizz free. Worth every penny I spent! Highly recommend this to anyone needing a hair conditioner.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pricey, but works really well. I live in a very dry climate, and the ends of my hair just dry out quickly. This conditioner, combined with Terax Life Drops has let me keep my hair longer than it&#x27;s been in a long time.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner on the market for those people with dry hair or highlights! I&#x27;ve used this product for many years and have yet to find anything better!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is nothing special at all.  I had high hopes for it since it was recommended on the makeupalley.com hair forum numerous times.  When I didn&#x27;t notice any difference the first few times I used it, I figured I would need to use half the bottle before I saw results.  Well, I did just that, but nothing changed.  My hair was still parched and it wasn&#x27;t any more manageable than when I used my regular cheap conditioner.  When I finally used the entire bottle and my hair was no better off, I knew I had been duped!!  I&#x27;ve since found a much better hair care line, Shea Moisture, that actually gives me excellent results and is less expensive.  The SM Manuka Honey formula (only at Target and Ulta) hydrates and gives me incredible body and shine, and no frizz!!  And I noticed a difference the first time I used it, unlike with Terax.  So don&#x27;t believe all the stupid hype that Terax is some miracle in a bottle.  Don&#x27;t feel like a chump when you finally figure out that you&#x27;ve been had.  Try SM instead.  There&#x27;s a formula for every hair issue and their masks are wonderful too.  SM is available at Walgreens, CVS, Walmart, Target, Ulta and Sally&#x27;s.  I also like the Tahitian Noni and the Raw Shea Butter formulas too.  SM is much better than Terax and less expensive.  What more can you ask for??  I definitely don&#x27;t recommend Terax.  Don&#x27;t be a sucker for the hype.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for years and amazon definitely has the best price. I have fine hair, but lots of it and it is easily damaged by my blow dryer, curling iron, flat iron, and various color treatments not to mention my well water. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker but it does give me a little more time in between hair cuts and keeps my hair feeling soft and looking smooth.</li>
            <li> Excellent products. Excellent service.</li>
            <li> I am a biracial woman and this conditioner is one of the best conditioner&#x27;s on the market!  I love it. Your hair is soft and moisturize. I love the scent. I definitely keep this in my hair care rotation! Buy it and you will be hooked...</li>
            <li> Does not come out too easy</li>
            <li> I only wish that I could give Terax Crema at least 10 more stars - its absolutely the holy grail of all hair conditioners .</li>
            <li> After one use my hair looks like a hair model or a shampoo commercial!&lt;br /&gt;I am definitley buying again. This also was a great price (normally $48 for this size).&lt;br /&gt;The smell is light,not overpowering like shampoos at the drugstore and I do love the smell. I used the shampoo (meile) also which was amazing too!&lt;br /&gt;Love this product!!!</li>
            <li> This used to be my go to conditioner because of its detangling quality, but it seemed different this time. It&#x27;s still good, but I&#x27;m having to use a separate detangler. Not sure why.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner ever! Perfectly detangles hair.</li>
            <li> This made my fine, frizzy hair very soft and required less flat iron time!  I highly recommend this wonderful conditioner!</li>
