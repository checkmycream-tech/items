            <li>Also smells pretty darn good.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I quickly bought the full sized product.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and makes your hair shiny (not greasy looking) and soft.  </li>
            <li>I love how shiny and smooth</li>
            <li>For all day shine, I&#x27;d recommend one of the argan oils for all day shine, the one by Theorie smells especially nice &amp; does not weigh hair down.</li>
            <li>I actually just purchased this product because I liked the smell so much, not because I needed the shine, but it works great either way</li>
            <li>It is the only product great for my hair.</li>
            <li>I love the fresh, herbal scent, too.  </li>
            <li>I use this in conjunction with Bamboo Shine shampoo and the combination keeps my hair looking smooth and shiny and well-groomed.</li>
            <li>This product gave me shine - even after a light coat of hair spray.  </li>
            <li>As soon as i spray this on, my hair becomes shiny and frizz free.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feeling smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>It also feels soft and has good body.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally spend this much money on my hair products, as I am not at all fussy about my hair, but I do love to smell good.</li>
            <li>It definitely provides shine and smells absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>Use lightly at first and then apply more if you need to.  </li>
            <li>product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it on an impulse originally in a sample kit with the rest of the line.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>By the end of the night/day my hair starts to look greasy (even if its clean)</li>
            <li>It really does make your shine, it is a very light mist</li>
            <li>It has almost a sweet grassy clean scent.</li>
            <li>I have bought I truly love the way this product works leaves my hair with a super shine and really leaves my hair frizz free.</li>
            <li>Tried this is a sample size and had to have it in the full size.</li>
            <li>REALLY puts a healthy shine.</li>
            <li>I have 3b/3c fine curly hair and had all but given up on shine products since most make my hair so soft that the curls fall out</li>
            <li>It smooths and makes my hair super shiny.</li>
            <li>This spray is not overly greasy at all and smells like a sweet fresh citrus/herbal.</li>
            <li>This is the new favorite hair product in my home.</li>
            <li>This product really does make hairy shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>Also, spray top of the bottle wasn&#x27;t professionally sealed, but wrapped in tape with hair stuck to it.</li>
            <li>I threw it away as it wasn&#x27;t worth paying for the return.</li>
            <li>Love the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>If you spray too close to your roots you have to wash your hair more frequently.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sprayed it on my hair right before I use my hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Reserving final judgement, but the product was more appealing with the higher quality natural oils it used to have.  </li>
            <li>Great smelling &amp; definitely makes hair luminous without making it greasy but the shine does not last all day.</li>
            <li>but they are very reasonable on Amazon</li>
            <li>Blowouts look better too if you use this on your second day...</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li>I think I finally found my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love Alterna Shampoo and Conditioner, including Ten, Caviar Volume, Caviar Moisture, but this product does not do it for me.</li>
            <li>I got this in a sample box and had to purchase simply because I love how this makes my hair smell.</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t my favorite next to the brown bottle (I can&#x27;t remember the name)</li>
            <li>I honestly saw absolutely no difference in shine in my air.</li>
            <li>I use this with the Bamboo Volume Weightless Whipped Mousee on my short pixie haircut, and it gives a lovely shine in conjunction with the weightless volume from the mousse.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair overly dry, greasy, it smells good and my hair &amp;#34;moves naturally.</li>
            <li>This product solves my problem of fizzy hair perfectly when I spray it, but the effect doesn&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
            <li>Great for after blow dry or flat ironing hair.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh scent and adds a nice sheen to my otherwise dull hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes my hair so much healthier and shinier.</li>
            <li>I have fine, flat hair and am always looking for volume and shine.  </li>
            <li>I spray it lightly before and after using the flat or curly iron.</li>
            <li>First, once you are diagnosed with Celiac, many (if not most) salon products you have been using, are no longer options.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always pretty much fried at the ends, but this shine mist puts the moisture back in.  </li>
            <li>This mist is the only product that gives me that consistently.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly (frizzy!)</li>
            <li>I have extensions and it gives them a pretty sheen and feel all day long.  </li>
            <li>If I use it, I have to hold my breath, spray, run out of the room into a room far away, and then breathe.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not necessary to use much.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this shine spray.</li>
            <li>Natural  </li>
            <li>About 6 total sprays for my whole head.</li>
            <li>A little pricey, but it &#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>OMG love this stuff, i use this almost everyday that i&#x27;m not washing my hair along with dry shampoo</li>
            <li>I like the smell, which is kind of grassy and herbal (but not in weird earth child</li>
            <li>I have super thin hair and it looks fine for a few hours.</li>

            <li> Also, spray top of the bottle wasn&#x27;t professionally sealed, but wrapped in tape with hair stuck to it.</li>
            <li> I threw it away as it wasn&#x27;t worth paying for the return.</li>
            <li> Love the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> If you spray too close to your roots you have to wash your hair more frequently.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sprayed it on my hair right before I use my hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Reserving final judgement, but the product was more appealing with the higher quality natural oils it used to have.  </li>
            <li> Great smelling &amp; definitely makes hair luminous without making it greasy but the shine does not last all day.</li>
            <li> but they are very reasonable on Amazon</li>
            <li> Blowouts look better too if you use this on your second day...</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li> I think I finally found my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love Alterna Shampoo and Conditioner, including Ten, Caviar Volume, Caviar Moisture, but this product does not do it for me.</li>
            <li> I got this in a sample box and had to purchase simply because I love how this makes my hair smell.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t my favorite next to the brown bottle (I can&#x27;t remember the name)</li>
            <li> I honestly saw absolutely no difference in shine in my air.</li>
            <li> I use this with the Bamboo Volume Weightless Whipped Mousee on my short pixie haircut, and it gives a lovely shine in conjunction with the weightless volume from the mousse.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair overly dry, greasy, it smells good and my hair &amp;#34;moves naturally.</li>
            <li> This product solves my problem of fizzy hair perfectly when I spray it, but the effect doesn&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
            <li> Great for after blow dry or flat ironing hair.</li>
            <li> It has a fresh scent and adds a nice sheen to my otherwise dull hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes my hair so much healthier and shinier.</li>
            <li> I have fine, flat hair and am always looking for volume and shine.  </li>
            <li> I spray it lightly before and after using the flat or curly iron.</li>
            <li> First, once you are diagnosed with Celiac, many (if not most) salon products you have been using, are no longer options.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always pretty much fried at the ends, but this shine mist puts the moisture back in.  </li>
            <li> This mist is the only product that gives me that consistently.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly (frizzy!)</li>
            <li> I have extensions and it gives them a pretty sheen and feel all day long.  </li>
            <li> If I use it, I have to hold my breath, spray, run out of the room into a room far away, and then breathe.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not necessary to use much.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this shine spray.</li>
            <li> Natural  </li>
            <li> About 6 total sprays for my whole head.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but it &#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> OMG love this stuff, i use this almost everyday that i&#x27;m not washing my hair along with dry shampoo</li>
            <li> I like the smell, which is kind of grassy and herbal (but not in weird earth child</li>
            <li> I have super thin hair and it looks fine for a few hours.</li>
            <li> I prefer to use a product such as Sedu Anti-Frizz Polishing Treatment which can be applied to damp or dry hair and actually improves the hair condition long-term.</li>
            <li> I use this when I need to use a flat iron.</li>
            <li> Especially in the dry winter months, I think it improved my hair&#x27;s shine.</li>
            <li> I have bone straight, textured, thick asian hair.</li>
            <li> It really helps tame the frizz, without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair and it makes it silky and shiny.  </li>
            <li> This product adds shine and silk to my dry brittle hair.</li>
            <li> I guess your hair has to resemble dry chalk to see a difference.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just have really dry hair?</li>
            <li> I apply it wet and dry.</li>
            <li> 10 minutes later my hair is back to being frizzy and dull.</li>
            <li> A little expensive but worth it!</li>
            <li> It smelled bad, and possibly watered down with some other cheap product.</li>
            <li> and I know it is due to this product but to me</li>
            <li> I color my hair regularly and this can make my hair seem dull at times.</li>
            <li> Imparts shine without making your hair oily or weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> I spray from ear level down.</li>
            <li> My hair will though sometimes have flyaways or be a little frizzy with humidity.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of hair oils, shine formulas, and de-frizzers to just add shine and tame down a few strays-</li>
            <li> but this one beats them all hands down!  </li>
            <li> Once I tried a drug store product and almost died, it looked so greasy and heavy.  </li>
            <li> I use everyday .</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months</li>
            <li> but it is oil based so it does slightly limp your hair out.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy and unfortunately frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> I usually use a little bit of hair spray to style my bangs but this shine takes it&#x27;s place at times.  </li>
            <li> I spayed it very lightly, but I&#x27;ve never used a shine product this horribly greasy.</li>
            <li> It adds shine, however on my color treated hair, it&#x27;s a mere surface coating and doesn&#x27;t offer any further benefits, e.g. moisture.  </li>
            <li> If anything too heavy, and I tend to like heavier hair products as my hair is very thick.</li>
            <li> I absolutely HATE going anywhere with high humidity because controlling my curly locks is a joke, until now.</li>
            <li> This spray is seriously an amzing</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this spray.</li>
            <li> Disgusting.</li>
            <li> This stuff gives shine to your hair, but the fumes are horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am addicted to this product! It definitely provides shine and smells absolutely amazing! A little pricey, but it &#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Great smell and shine. I have extensions and it gives them a pretty sheen and feel all day long.  Now, I do touch mine up once or twice during the day, but you kind of expect it with the elements like heat, wind, etc.  (Vegas is hell on hair, trust me.)  Blowouts look better too if you use this on your second day...All the Bamboo products are awesome for shine and protection!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, nothing miraculous.  If anything too heavy, and I tend to like heavier hair products as my hair is very thick.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t purchase from this company again. The product does not smell the same as in the salon. It smelled bad, and possibly watered down with some other cheap product. Also, spray top of the bottle wasn&#x27;t professionally sealed, but wrapped in tape with hair stuck to it. Disgusting. I threw it away as it wasn&#x27;t worth paying for the return.</li>
            <li> Wonderful Shine mist makes my hair look so beautiful! Adds a healthy shine as well. Love it. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Tried this is a sample size and had to have it in the full size. Smells great and makes your hair shiny (not greasy looking) and soft.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it claims. It will give your hair added shine without making it look greasy. Smells great, too!</li>
            <li> smells great and leave nice shine. I actually just purchased this product because I liked the smell so much, not because I needed the shine, but it works great either way</li>
            <li> Imparts shine without making your hair oily or weighing it down.  Lovely scent too.</li>
            <li> Makes hair looks healthy n shiny</li>
            <li> This stuff smells wonderful and works really well.  I have dry hair and it makes it silky and shiny.  Think I&#x27;ll try the shampoo and conditioner next.</li>
            <li> This stuff gives shine to your hair, but the fumes are horrible. If I use it, I have to hold my breath, spray, run out of the room into a room far away, and then breathe. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used every shine spray under the sun. I think I finally found my favorite. This doesn&#x27;t grease out your hair and is the best smelling hair product ever!!</li>
            <li> This is the second bottle of Bamboo Shine I have bought I truly love the way this product works leaves my hair with a super shine and really leaves my hair frizz free.I hope the company never stops making this.</li>
            <li> Great smelling &amp; definitely makes hair luminous without making it greasy but the shine does not last all day. Needs to be reapplied throughout the day. I don&#x27;t know about you, but I&#x27;m not carrying a bottle of shine spray around with me. For all day shine, I&#x27;d recommend one of the argan oils for all day shine, the one by Theorie smells especially nice &amp; does not weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> This product really does make hairy shiny and smooth. Love the natural ingredients. The scent to me is very pleasant very natural though not perfume like. It has almost a sweet grassy clean scent.</li>
            <li> I love Alterna Shampoo and Conditioner, including Ten, Caviar Volume, Caviar Moisture, but this product does not do it for me. It adds shine, however on my color treated hair, it&#x27;s a mere surface coating and doesn&#x27;t offer any further benefits, e.g. moisture.  I prefer to use a product such as Sedu Anti-Frizz Polishing Treatment which can be applied to damp or dry hair and actually improves the hair condition long-term.</li>
            <li> It was delivery on time , good packing and the product has great quality.  It is the only product great for my hair. does not make my hair oily.</li>
            <li> The salon was selling it for $24.00 a bottle.  I use it on each section of hair just before applying the heated flatiron or curling iron.  Protects my hair and eliminates those frizzy popup strands that result from summer humidity.  I love the fresh, herbal scent, too.  One bottle lasts me about 5 months.</li>
            <li> This product lets me hair shine through!!  Great shine.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! First, once you are diagnosed with Celiac, many (if not most) salon products you have been using, are no longer options. I have tried many of the salon quality products out there that are safe for Celiacs. Alterna Bamboo line is without question the best product I have used.&lt;br /&gt;The shine mist is wonderful to add just a bit of extra shine to your hair, without making it look greasy and stringy. It is awesome. LOVE this product. They also sell it in a travel size, which is great for those of us that are always on the move.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I have no idea if this makes my hair shine or reduces frizz.  I got this in a sample box and had to purchase simply because I love how this makes my hair smell. I don&#x27;t normally spend this much money on my hair products, as I am not at all fussy about my hair, but I do love to smell good.</li>
            <li> I absolutely HATE going anywhere with high humidity because controlling my curly locks is a joke, until now. This product isn&#x27;t my favorite next to the brown bottle (I can&#x27;t remember the name) but it does give a movie star shine to your locks. Love it.</li>
            <li> The best finishing product for my hair, have ordered many times</li>
            <li> I spayed it very lightly, but I&#x27;ve never used a shine product this horribly greasy. i will be returning immediately.</li>
            <li> Great for after blow dry or flat ironing hair. It&#x27;s not necessary to use much. Eliminates any frizz or flyaways.</li>
            <li> Light mist, smells great. Uber shine! Bam!</li>
            <li> This is a holy grail product for me.  I dye my hair, and also use heat tools on it.  It&#x27;s always pretty much fried at the ends, but this shine mist puts the moisture back in.  Once I tried a drug store product and almost died, it looked so greasy and heavy.  I went back to this immediately and will never hesitate to buy it again!  Use lightly at first and then apply more if you need to.  Also smells pretty darn good.</li>
            <li> I use this when I need to use a flat iron. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair overly dry, greasy, it smells good and my hair &amp;#34;moves naturally.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It provides shine, texture&amp;body. I use everyday . It makes your hair look healthy . I color my hair regularly and this can make my hair seem dull at times.</li>
            <li> I love the Alterna Bamboo Shine Luminous Shine Mist! It gives a nice shine to my hair and leaves it soft and nicely conditioned! A little expensive but worth it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how all the reviews could have stated this is a great product.  The smell is overwhelming and not at all pleasant.  Because it is a hair product I will not be able to return.  Not recommended.</li>
            <li> Love. Love. Love this hair product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it on an impulse originally in a sample kit with the rest of the line.  I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of hair oils, shine formulas, and de-frizzers to just add shine and tame down a few strays-but this one beats them all hands down!  I have bone straight, textured, thick asian hair. (It won&#x27;t curl even with a blow torch, you need a perm.)  My hair will though sometimes have flyaways or be a little frizzy with humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like my hair to have a mirror shine, it looks best that way.  This mist is the only product that gives me that consistently.  I like the smell, which is kind of grassy and herbal (but not in weird earth child hippie way, in a sophisticated way)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for anyone, any hair type.  Looks like I just stepped out of a salon.  You will too!</li>
            <li> This product adds shine and silk to my dry brittle hair. I apply it wet and dry. I also use Moroccan oil and It&#x27;s a 10 leave-in conditioner. All of these combined make my hair very healthy and a day doesn&#x27;t go by that someone doesn&#x27;t compliment my it. No joke!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It really does make your shine, it is a very light mist so you don&#x27;t feel like you have put anything in it.  I usually use a little bit of hair spray to style my bangs but this shine takes it&#x27;s place at times.  Great product, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months and I just love this product!! It really helps tame the frizz, without weighing my hair down. It smells nice too!</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with Bamboo Shine shampoo and the combination keeps my hair looking smooth and shiny and well-groomed.</li>
            <li> I honestly saw absolutely no difference in shine in my air. Also it didn&#x27;t feel incredibly but it is oil based so it does slightly limp your hair out. Definitely saw NO difference in shine. I guess your hair has to resemble dry chalk to see a difference.</li>
            <li> Used to have hemp oil and dimethicone, but they have changed the formula.  Reserving final judgement, but the product was more appealing with the higher quality natural oils it used to have.  No idea why they reformulated, but guessing it was cost driven.</li>
            <li> This is the new favorite hair product in my home. My daughter and I now have soft, shiny hair all the time and it smells GREAT!</li>
            <li> This product smell great and leaves your hair shinning without looking greasy.  I spray it lightly before and after using the flat or curly iron.</li>
            <li> I have fine, flat hair and am always looking for volume and shine.  This product gave me shine - even after a light coat of hair spray.  Especially in the dry winter months, I think it improved my hair&#x27;s shine.</li>
            <li> Love it! The best around. REALLY puts a healthy shine. Always get compliments!</li>
            <li> My salon uses this product and was thrilled to find it online and cheaper then the salon price!  I have naturally wavy and unfortunately frizzy hair.  So with this product and a blow dryer it does a great job of getting rid of the frizziness and I get a nice smooth finish to my hair.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this shine spray. I have 3b/3c fine curly hair and had all but given up on shine products since most make my hair so soft that the curls fall out and it is frizzy (tried everything from Fructis to Moroccan Oil). The Bamboo luminous gave my curly hair shine while still maintaining the curl. It also feels soft and has good body. This spray is not overly greasy at all and smells like a sweet fresh citrus/herbal.</li>
            <li> Looking for shinny hear with a great scent too...great product for obtaining shinny hair, great scent too, my salon stylist uses it</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful shine spray.  Always get compliments on my hair is so shinny,&lt;br /&gt;Love it and great price.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product a lot is really good for the hair. The product arrived on time in perfect conditions and it was right what I wanted. I recommend amazon a lot.</li>
            <li> Great product non greasy!  Natural  looking shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sprayed it on my hair right before I use my hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natural looking shine.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly (frizzy!) hair and I received this spray as a sample with another order.  I loved it so much I quickly bought the full sized product.  It has a fresh scent and adds a nice sheen to my otherwise dull hair.</li>
            <li> Brilliant shine, and subtley pleasant frangrance.  I use this with the Bamboo Volume Weightless Whipped Mousee on my short pixie haircut, and it gives a lovely shine in conjunction with the weightless volume from the mousse.</li>
            <li> This product solves my problem of fizzy hair perfectly when I spray it, but the effect doesn&#x27;t last long enough. Still it is a good choice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product more than once. I love how shiny and smooth my hair is when I use it. It smells great too. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I could not afford these products in the retail stores and shops... but they are very reasonable on Amazon and I wanted to try this product.  Great for humid days and the shine is unbelieveable and leaves hair in great condition!!</li>
            <li> OMG love this stuff, i use this almost everyday that i&#x27;m not washing my hair along with dry shampoo it smells amazing! i gets complements on my hair smelling great all the time&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> LOVE this product. Makes hair smell good while providing good shine. I have super thin hair and it looks fine for a few hours. By the end of the night/day my hair starts to look greasy (even if its clean) and I know it is due to this product but to me it&#x27;s worth it. Your hair will look great!!</li>
            <li> As soon as i spray this on, my hair becomes shiny and frizz free. 10 minutes later my hair is back to being frizzy and dull. Maybe I just have really dry hair? Smells nice though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this spray. It smooths and makes my hair super shiny. I also LOVE the smell. This spray is seriously an amzing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair so much healthier and shinier. I spray from ear level down. About 6 total sprays for my whole head. Makes my hair shiny and smooth. If you spray too close to your roots you have to wash your hair more frequently.</li>
            <li> Perfect, I love this spray to finish my look. It helps my hair when it&#x27;s humid too. It smells so good! It&#x27;s the same one my hairstylist uses on my hair. This is the cheapest I could find it with out having to pay for shipping.</li>
            <li> My hair is softer and more manageable.It makes my hair feeling smooth and silky.It smells great and lasts a long time. I highly recommend it. I couldn&#x27;t be happier and now use all the Alterna Bamboo.</li>
