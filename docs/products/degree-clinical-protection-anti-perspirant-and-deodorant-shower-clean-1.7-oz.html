            <li>Love the scent and works even at the gym.</li>

            <li>It even works better than the stuff my doctor prescribed me.</li>

            <li>However, the smell is very strong, its a clean scent, but you can def smell it when you put it on for a bit.</li>
            <li>This has a nice fresh scent.</li>
            <li>, I worry that the scent is too strong, even for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but the others are fine</li>
            <li>From all Degree Clinical Protection deodorant smells, fresh energy is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Um, the scent is so strong that you smell it all day long,,, and not in a good way.  </li>
            <li>For me, it smelled like full on perfume</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking at natural effective deodorants that will help with odor.</li>
            <li>This keeps me dry, for the most part, and it smells nice.  </li>
            <li>keeps me dry and fresh smelling!!! :)</li>
            <li>This product more than lives up to their claims as far as I am concerned!!</li>
            <li>Overall a great product that I highly recommend and suggest anyone give it a try.</li>
            <li>Would I buy Fresh Energy?</li>
            <li>Look elsewhere for an effective deodorant, but please get natural as much as you can.</li>
            <li>Fresh energy smells like a floral perfume with a hint of jasmine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only kind I&#x27;ll buy anymore.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not against fragrance - it&#x27;s not unpleasant, it&#x27;s just too much.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try and see if this commercial deodorant was more top notch than just a regular Degree deodorant/antiperspirant  </li>
            <li>I have tried many commercial deodorant/antiperspirant brands to help with odor and sweat.  </li>
            <li>While I LOVE this deodorant and bought it before from CVS, the product I received from Amazon did not work and did not smell the same.</li>
            <li>Much better than the regular degree.</li>
            <li>(The first container worked)&lt;br /&gt;Test</li>
            <li>all containers first thing.</li>
            <li>Works Great!!!I can always feel confident that even after several hours it&#x27;s still working.</li>
            <li>I do wish they would come out with a clear stick or gel as this does get on my clothes, but it washes out without any special treatment.  </li>
            <li>I personally like that, but maybe someone who doesn&#x27;t want to smell strongly of a clean, fresh smelling deodorant smell might not.</li>
            <li>Keeps me dry &amp; confident all day.</li>
            <li>It makes you feel confident and keeps you completely dry for any event, even under stress.  </li>
            <li>I tried everything and nothing was working good or long enough for my.</li>
            <li>So I did some research and decided to try a clinical strength, which has a higher concentration of active ingredients that clog underarm pores (or something like that, maybe a bit more scientific).</li>
            <li>I work as a flight attendant and with all the lifting and reaching I do in close proximity to others</li>
            <li>This really covers up odor without leaving the horrid body odor and fragrance smell combo.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot either</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m using too much (??).  </li>
            <li>This really gets me through the day without feeling like I need a shower.</li>
            <li>and it worked, but it wore off too fast.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant stays for the whole time</li>
            <li>I live in extremely hot and humid south Texas.</li>
            <li>bought a pack of two, one worked fine, the next one lost the top half of the stick and</li>
            <li>my usual kind.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong like it is trying so hard to make you smell good and too much of a good thing can become a bad thing.  </li>
            <li>the fragrance is soft and really comes out when i workout or sweat but manages to keep the dampness under control and no BO at all.</li>
            <li>The other one seems to be working okay, but I am hoping it does not dry up as well.</li>
            <li>Usually I buy a different kind though, but I thought it try this one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the Fresh Energy scent is unnecessarily strong and irritating.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to smells, you will want to look for an unscented version.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give off nearly as much scent as regular degree.</li>
            <li>The deodorant feels kind of like a thick creamy lotion that moisturizers the skin while keeping it dry</li>
            <li>I like the soft solid type of application.  </li>
            <li>It really keeps you dry and smelling greaty all day long.</li>
            <li>My old deodorant ran out about 3/4 through my long 14 hour work shift - this deodorant lasts the entire day!</li>

            <li> In fact, it works so well, the one of the two pack went missing shortly after a visit from my daughter.  </li>
            <li> I received the double pack in the mail and 1 of the deodorants was dried up and would not even roll up.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used this deodorant and won&#x27;t use any other.</li>
            <li> I never had a problem in the past, I&#x27;m a small woman (early 20s)</li>
            <li> half the deod contents spilled out and are now unusable.</li>
            <li> unfortunately this particular scent triggered my asthma</li>
            <li> Dove, Secret, Ban, Arrid, Lady Stick, Arm and Hammer, Mitchum, Teen Spirit, etc.</li>
            <li> Too late to return it.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise the deodorant works well.</li>
            <li> but I recently started having really bad body odor.</li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t work, will stick to Secret clinical</li>
            <li> My hormones have been out of whack and unfortunately it can cause body odor.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it and it didn&#x27;t block all of the odor unfortunately.</li>
            <li> and it just wasn&#x27;t cutting it.</li>
            <li> I never feel sweaty and I sweat really bad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s overpowering and I am very unhappy with it.</li>
            <li> I hate to say it</li>
            <li> I really hate the deodorants that smell like baby powder.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s awful.</li>

            <li> If you are a &amp;#34;sweater&amp;#34; like me, you will find that Degree Clinical is remarkably effective with its 20% aluminum zirconium tetrachlorowhatever. TMI warning: If I don&#x27;t wear deodorant, I start emanating that musty, spicy armpit smell within an hour. Yes, it&#x27;s awful. Without antiperspirant, my underarms sweat like sinners in church. So, for someone like me to say that this works means that it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the Fresh Energy scent is unnecessarily strong and irritating. I&#x27;m not against fragrance - it&#x27;s not unpleasant, it&#x27;s just too much. If you are sensitive to smells, you will want to look for an unscented version. I LOVE how well this works but the scent gives me a headache. I work as a flight attendant and with all the lifting and reaching I do in close proximity to others, I worry that the scent is too strong, even for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy again? In a heartbeat. Would I buy Fresh Energy? No.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it. Smells great and seems to stop the funk and sweat very nicely.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try and see if this commercial deodorant was more top notch than just a regular Degree deodorant/antiperspirant  I have tried many commercial deodorant/antiperspirant brands to help with odor and sweat.  Dove, Secret, Ban, Arrid, Lady Stick, Arm and Hammer, Mitchum, Teen Spirit, etc. Even Avon roll-ons.  You have to apply it at night but sometimes, I apply it in the morning if I forgot or wanted more protection in odor and sweat.  The smell is strong like it is trying so hard to make you smell good and too much of a good thing can become a bad thing.  For me, it smelled like full on perfume and I don&#x27;t want to have to smell like anything, good or bad!  And when the smell wore off and was mixed with sweat, it reminded me of a fishy farty smell.  I was so embarrassed and wanted to hide when I was in public with this on!!!  I&#x27;m not interested in buying aluminum deodorants/antiperspirants anymore for my health.  I&#x27;m looking at natural effective deodorants that will help with odor. Since yesterday, I bought crystal deodorant and spray.  Deodorants help with smell, not with sweat.  I rather sweat and not smell than to sweat and smell at the same time.   Look elsewhere for an effective deodorant, but please get natural as much as you can.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and works even at the gym.</li>
            <li> unfortunately this particular scent triggered my asthma so I had to throw all three away but the others are fine</li>
            <li> From all Degree Clinical Protection deodorant smells, fresh energy is my favorite. Fresh energy smells like a floral perfume with a hint of jasmine. And it&#x27;s a great deodorant to combat sweat.</li>
            <li> Great item, great price, great shipping from a great dealer.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I live in extremely hot and humid south Texas. This is the best deodorant I have found for controlling wetness. I like the soft solid type of application.  The deodorant feels kind of like a thick creamy lotion that moisturizers the skin while keeping it dry</li>
            <li> Love it! Works great!</li>
            <li> I have no idea why but all of a sudden I just started producing more sweat and its stinky! I never had a problem in the past, I&#x27;m a small woman (early 20s) and I never really had to worry about it. I was using dove prior to this and I was having to apply multiple times a day and it just wasn&#x27;t cutting it. So I did some research and decided to try a clinical strength, which has a higher concentration of active ingredients that clog underarm pores (or something like that, maybe a bit more scientific). Well, anyways they recommend you put it on before you go to bed and in the morning. I have not had odor since! However, the smell is very strong, its a clean scent, but you can def smell it when you put it on for a bit. I personally like that, but maybe someone who doesn&#x27;t want to smell strongly of a clean, fresh smelling deodorant smell might not.</li>
            <li> I got this in a two pack.  I like it.  It works well for me.  In fact, it works so well, the one of the two pack went missing shortly after a visit from my daughter.  Hmmm.  Gotta buy more! Better price than a Wal-Mart too.  LUV Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is not the actual product. While I LOVE this deodorant and bought it before from CVS, the product I received from Amazon did not work and did not smell the same.</li>
            <li> I received the double pack in the mail and 1 of the deodorants was dried up and would not even roll up.  The other one seems to be working okay, but I am hoping it does not dry up as well.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant I have found. I sweat a lot an this keeps me dry all the time. Great price also.</li>
            <li> I hate to say it but I recently started having really bad body odor. My hormones have been out of whack and unfortunately it can cause body odor. I tried everything and nothing was working good or long enough for my. So I decided to give this a try. I&#x27;m glad I did. I now don&#x27;t have to worry if anyone can smell me. This really covers up odor without leaving the horrid body odor and fragrance smell combo. It last all day too. It smell nice and refreshing. It also doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot either so this will last a fairly long time. Overall a great product that I highly recommend and suggest anyone give it a try. I received at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> this has been the only product I&#x27;ve used for at least the last 3 years and it works really well. Much better than the regular degree. It doesn&#x27;t give off nearly as much scent as regular degree.</li>
            <li> I almost exclusively use degree. I like their clinical strength deoderant. Usually I buy a different kind though, but I thought it try this one. I didn&#x27;t like it and it didn&#x27;t block all of the odor unfortunately. I&#x27;ll still be using degree clinical but my usual kind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this deodorant and won&#x27;t use any other. (from the wife)</li>
            <li> I am very sweaty and this deodorant does a great job. I would reccomend it to anyone who is extra sweaty.</li>
            <li> This product more than lives up to their claims as far as I am concerned!! This product is awesome....keeps me dry and fresh smelling!!! :)</li>
            <li> This gives me the protection that I&#x27;m looking for.  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  I like what this does for me.</li>
            <li> This truly is an antiperspirant as well as a deodorant.  It doesn&#x27;t just mask the smell of sweating but actually decreases the amount you sweat.  My old deodorant ran out about 3/4 through my long 14 hour work shift - this deodorant lasts the entire day! I would definitely recommend it to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant. It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ll use. Keeps me dry &amp; confident all day.</li>
            <li> Great product at a good price!</li>
            <li> Only deodorant that works for me.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from hydrosis since I was a kid.  I sweat alot and I have no medical issues to explain why.  Some of us just sweat alot.  This keeps me dry, for the most part, and it smells nice.  I do wish they would come out with a clear stick or gel as this does get on my clothes, but it washes out without any special treatment.  Going sleeveless can be a challenge with it getting on the lower armpit area of a shell/blouse and it sometimes flakes off.  Maybe I&#x27;m using too much (??).  I like the scent and protection this provides.</li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t work, will stick to Secret clinical</li>
            <li> The second container won&#x27;t roll up.  I can&#x27;t use it.  It&#x27;s defective.  Too late to return it.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise the deodorant works well. (The first container worked)&lt;br /&gt;Test all containers first thing.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t roll up so I cannot use it! Why would I like it if I cannot even use it.</li>
            <li> Good deodorant and very reasonable.</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant and I have tried a lot.  You won&#x27;t find it cheaper than this and the scent is nice.</li>
            <li> works well, and it&#x27;s very good for anyone that has sensitive skin. Re-purchasing again !!&lt;br /&gt;Works for more than 24 hours which is perfect for anyone who is always on the move.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant I will ever use! I sweat like a monster, and this keeps away the pit stains and the stink. It even works better than the stuff my doctor prescribed me.</li>
            <li> This really gets me through the day without feeling like I need a shower. I never feel sweaty and I sweat really bad so this is great. I love it!</li>
            <li> It really keeps you dry and smelling greaty all day long. I really hate the deodorants that smell like baby powder. This has a nice fresh scent.</li>
            <li> DEGREE WOMAN&#x27;S CLINICAL ANTIPERSPIRANT IS THE BEST DEODERANT I HAVE EVER USED.  I was using a big name one for years and it worked, but it wore off too fast.  This deodorant stays for the whole time I was out and about (morning into evening).  It has a pleasant scent and doesn&#x27;t ruin my clothes. It makes you feel confident and keeps you completely dry for any event, even under stress.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> this is a great product over all. the fragrance is soft and really comes out when i workout or sweat but manages to keep the dampness under control and no BO at all. it&#x27;s the best stuff...never going back to dove&#x27;s clinical protection</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this deoderant! It&#x27;s the only kind I&#x27;ll buy anymore. If you&#x27;re looking for something to keep you from always sweating everywhere, this is the product for you! And it smells great all day.</li>
            <li> bought a pack of two, one worked fine, the next one lost the top half of the stick and half the deod contents spilled out and are now unusable.</li>
            <li> Works Great!!!I can always feel confident that even after several hours it&#x27;s still working.Great product and will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Um, the scent is so strong that you smell it all day long,,, and not in a good way.  It&#x27;s overpowering and I am very unhappy with it.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
