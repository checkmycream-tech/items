            <li>My best regards, Martorella.</li>
            <li>I was very, very impressed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and will buy another one when this one needs to be replaced.</li>

            <li>The quality of the product is very good</li>
            <li>my 44 age is very good looking</li>
            <li>I am very fair &amp; have dry/sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>this is a good option!  </li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>I purchased this roller over others because I just wanted the roller, not added serums, and this one had mostly excellent reviews at a fair price.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even imagine how great my skin would look if I used this the maximum 5 times a week.</li>
            <li>, I love it, apply vitamin C serum.immedatly after, it&#x27;s amazing !!!!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any visible results yet, but it felt good and did not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesnt hurt but it doesn&#x27;t feel good, either.</li>
            <li>I have good skin,but i am 44,so tried it from wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I was very happy to receive it so quickly.</li>
            <li>AMAZING results.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the awesome product!</li>
            <li>I see it when I look at photos of myself, my face has nice renewed firmess</li>
            <li>I liked it.  </li>
            <li>but i honestly dont know</li>
            <li>After 1st treatment my skin changed color,like refreshed nice looking skin and wrinkles on forehead was diminished</li>
            <li>then I apply my vitamin/mositure creams (I am using coconut oil &amp; loving that) &amp; go to bed.  </li>
            <li>Comes in a super great case and also with instructions if you need them.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m doing my best to avoid any direct sunlight while microneedling.  </li>
            <li>A lot of people described the feeling as \\&quot;annoying\\&quot; and I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure what that meant until I used it.</li>
            <li>My skin looked amazingly healthy and glowing.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t use it as often as I should to get a better result.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even suggested it to some girlfriends of mine : ).</li>
            <li>I love this...</li>
            <li>I have to get a prescription for lidocaine to use the 1.0 dermaroller, it hurts :)</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be able to use this product safely.  </li>
            <li>I have been completely satisfied with its quality and results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is usually very sensitive, but this routine works beautifully.</li>
            <li>It felt pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I want to try the one more pricey and see the differences, but the needles on this roller are thicker than the cheaper one, which is hurt a lot and lead to bleed easily.  </li>
            <li>Amazing results after the first use.  </li>
            <li>Bio-oil is good by its self but the derma-roller punctures the scar tissue, allowing the Bio-oil to reach deeper into the skin than it normally would.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous about using this needle length, but it seems to be working great!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve seen huge improvement in those areas as well.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this kind of dermaroller (microneedle) for some months and the results are really satisfactory.</li>
            <li>I bought it to use over my lips to smooth the wrinkles</li>
            <li>I do a light roll about six times in each direction all over my face.  </li>
            <li>Please, accept one additional 1.00mm roller for free as our apology for this situation.   </li>
            <li>On one side the scarring is completely filled in..</li>
            <li>So by the 3rd week I felt that 2 times per week works great.  </li>
            <li>I bought 3 of these, it is especially good for the skin, the pores of the skin fit Wan, my sister used and noted the results hold</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using some type of topical numbing cream to achieve the best results.  </li>
            <li>Hang in there, the results are worth it!</li>
            <li>Boy, it has NOT disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and was securely packaged.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 41 with relatively good skin (often told I look 5-10 years younger)...</li>
            <li>wisely;  I use this 2x a month only, and I see results.</li>
            <li>It is not painful to me,just i can fill it.</li>
            <li>I have some discoloration scars as well that are not as quick to disappear, but honestly I was not expecting any results this early on.</li>
            <li>The device worked great - no bent needles or other issues.</li>
            <li>Using the microneedle before a chemical peel is intense, so really only someone who has been experienced with peels should attempt using them together.  </li>
            <li>I used it on my stretch marks that i got while pregnant.</li>
            <li>If I come across anything in particular that helps, I&#x27;ll be sure to add an update to this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, I cleanse and exfoliate ([[ASIN:B003TG9C74</li>
            <li>I also rolled my forehead and my smile lines</li>
            <li>Yes, it hurts like a mofo but its SO worth it.  </li>
            <li>The microneedle was delivered quickly and was exactly what they promised.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Please do your own research before using, this is not a product to use daily, be smart.</li>
            <li>I watched many videos and read many reviews on derma needling, so when I received it, I knew what I was expecting but was still a little scared to use it.</li>
            <li>First off, this arrived within 3 days of ordering.</li>
            <li>I noticed results the morning after first use.</li>
            <li>and it gives any topical more bang for their buck.  </li>
            <li>After years of cosmetic surgeons informing me that there is nothing that can be done about my scars resulting from cystic acne, there is a product that really works!  </li>
            <li>and if it will help get rid of stretch marks, I can definitely handle it.  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>only suggestion is to put a note on the case as to needle size if you buy more than one.  </li>
            <li>I plan on wearing a bikini this summer and between this roller and the gym it just might be possible:-)</li>
            <li>I waited a whole year to review this, just to really give adequate time to observe results.  </li>
            <li>Great item if it was sharp but now going to have to chalk this up as wasted money and look for a better brand.</li>
            <li>I heard positive things about micro needling and decided to try it.</li>
            <li>I used a variety of moisturizers but mainly pure cocoa butter (or a cocoa butter blend that I made up with rosehip seed oil).  </li>
            <li>Maybe take a few aspirin and enjoy a strong margarita before you use it..</li>
            <li>I have a very high pain tolerance.</li>
            <li>I plan on ordering another size roller very soon.</li>
            <li>Shipping was extremely fast also.</li>
            <li>This really does work it just depends on how you treat your skin afterwards.</li>
            <li>This product is available with various mm size microneedles.  </li>
            <li>The roller feels like my skin is being scratched and I cannot apply much pressure at all.  </li>
            <li>Granted, the wrinkles weren&#x27;t very noticeable to anyone else</li>
            <li>Maybe it works if you can really torture yourself that much to do it repeatedly.</li>
            <li>The redness is much lighter and the skin is smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but if not, the results so far are well worth the cost of this device.</li>
            <li>This does absolutely nothing to get rid of stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I used this once a week for about 6 months straight.  </li>
            <li>Just go slow, follow the directions, and don&#x27;t apply more pressure than you are comfortable with.</li>
            <li>I think my results would have been even better if I used it on a regular basis, but I got busy and didnt have time, I&#x27;m going to continue using it</li>
            <li>Yes, it is not the most comfortable experience, like an uncomfortable pricking, most would probably benefit from topical lidocaine or numbing gel, but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li>Ouch, works great, but be careful, very sharp needles.</li>
            <li>i used the roller on it as instrusted but found that it actually made the area rolled more scar like (red and leathery)</li>
            <li>If you read all the instructions first, they recommend not using it more than one time a week as it usually takes collagen about 10 days to heal / recover</li>
            <li>but it seems to be of decent quality.</li>
            <li>This particular derma roller had high reviews.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about using this little device...</li>
            <li>but im very self conscious of it.</li>
            <li>but that was too much for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I barely roll it on my skin for the first few minutes, then when my masochistic endorphins kick in I can apply a bit more pressure.</li>
            <li>akin to dragging sandpaper over a wound simply for the fun of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and then it looks normal again.  </li>
            <li>In the morning everything looks perfectly normal..</li>
            <li>I have used other rollers which were much gentler on my skin, and it could be that smaller mm microneedles would be better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dianne Oliver</li>
            <li>I can definitely tell my products sink in deeper right after I use the derma roller.</li>
            <li>I did receive an email and a phone call from New Spa trying to correct this situation.   </li>
            <li>We will prepare and thoroughly inspect a replacement NEW SPA Microneedle Skin Care System 1.50mm for you and ship it to you at once.</li>
            <li>I use the 1.0 for my face/neck as this is a new process.  </li>
            <li>The microneedle roller was exactly what I was looking for to take my skin to the next level.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used it 3 times over the past week and while I&#x27;m sure no one else can see a difference, I can see difference already.  </li>
            <li>Let me be clear-</li>
            <li>but I had two very noticeable lines across my forehead, and a line between my eyebrows that decided to set up shop sometime in the last year or so.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say in another two-four months, I should have them completely gone.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be working so far.</li>
            <li>It worked to fade some old acne scars I had on the side of one cheek.</li>
            <li>I was a bit nervous when I first received, but I did my internet research and watched several instructional videos on youtube prior to using.</li>
            <li>I use no other moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>The dents in my face are barely visible!  </li>
            <li>Needles are fine and sharp...not dull like the cheaper ones.</li>
            <li>After about 5 minutes I can apply enough pressure to get a little bit of that &#x27;popping&#x27; sound others have mentioned... but never enough to draw blood.</li>
            <li>Completely and totally GONE.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The directions said it can last up to 3 months with frequent use</li>
            <li>The reason why experts recommend to only use it 1 or 2x a month is that your skin needs time to heal after using, you can damage your skin if you use it too frequently</li>
            <li>For me the most painful part is afterwards when the skin feels like it has a mild sunburn.</li>
            <li>So once i clean my face i use this after and roll only on spots with blemishes or dark spots so that i can open up my pores and apply my facial products.</li>
            <li>I have a large, red depressed scar on my cheek from getting several cysts in the same area, several months in a row.  </li>
            <li>Even after 6 months of only using it a couple random times, the amazing results have not gone away.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is possibly the most irritating, counter-intuitive feeling in the world...</li>
            <li>, I do not want my skin to bleed for health reasons, I am worried about possibly scarring my skin, therefore I use a slow but light hand when I roll.</li>
            <li>This product is of way higher quality than another one I bought from an ebay seller a few years back.</li>
            <li>I bought it to help remove mild acne scars, in particular a few of small pitted scars and some discoloration scars.    </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This product is available with various mm size microneedles.  </li>
            <li> The roller feels like my skin is being scratched and I cannot apply much pressure at all.  </li>
            <li> Granted, the wrinkles weren&#x27;t very noticeable to anyone else</li>
            <li> Maybe it works if you can really torture yourself that much to do it repeatedly.</li>
            <li> The redness is much lighter and the skin is smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but if not, the results so far are well worth the cost of this device.</li>
            <li> This does absolutely nothing to get rid of stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I used this once a week for about 6 months straight.  </li>
            <li> Just go slow, follow the directions, and don&#x27;t apply more pressure than you are comfortable with.</li>
            <li> I think my results would have been even better if I used it on a regular basis, but I got busy and didnt have time, I&#x27;m going to continue using it</li>
            <li> Yes, it is not the most comfortable experience, like an uncomfortable pricking, most would probably benefit from topical lidocaine or numbing gel, but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> Ouch, works great, but be careful, very sharp needles.</li>
            <li> i used the roller on it as instrusted but found that it actually made the area rolled more scar like (red and leathery)</li>
            <li> If you read all the instructions first, they recommend not using it more than one time a week as it usually takes collagen about 10 days to heal / recover</li>
            <li> but it seems to be of decent quality.</li>
            <li> This particular derma roller had high reviews.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about using this little device...</li>
            <li> but im very self conscious of it.</li>
            <li> but that was too much for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I barely roll it on my skin for the first few minutes, then when my masochistic endorphins kick in I can apply a bit more pressure.</li>
            <li> akin to dragging sandpaper over a wound simply for the fun of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and then it looks normal again.  </li>
            <li> In the morning everything looks perfectly normal..</li>
            <li> I have used other rollers which were much gentler on my skin, and it could be that smaller mm microneedles would be better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dianne Oliver</li>
            <li> I can definitely tell my products sink in deeper right after I use the derma roller.</li>
            <li> I did receive an email and a phone call from New Spa trying to correct this situation.   </li>
            <li> We will prepare and thoroughly inspect a replacement NEW SPA Microneedle Skin Care System 1.50mm for you and ship it to you at once.</li>
            <li> I use the 1.0 for my face/neck as this is a new process.  </li>
            <li> The microneedle roller was exactly what I was looking for to take my skin to the next level.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it 3 times over the past week and while I&#x27;m sure no one else can see a difference, I can see difference already.  </li>
            <li> Let me be clear-</li>
            <li> but I had two very noticeable lines across my forehead, and a line between my eyebrows that decided to set up shop sometime in the last year or so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say in another two-four months, I should have them completely gone.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be working so far.</li>
            <li> It worked to fade some old acne scars I had on the side of one cheek.</li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous when I first received, but I did my internet research and watched several instructional videos on youtube prior to using.</li>
            <li> I use no other moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> The dents in my face are barely visible!  </li>
            <li> Needles are fine and sharp...not dull like the cheaper ones.</li>
            <li> After about 5 minutes I can apply enough pressure to get a little bit of that &#x27;popping&#x27; sound others have mentioned... but never enough to draw blood.</li>
            <li> Completely and totally GONE.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The directions said it can last up to 3 months with frequent use</li>
            <li> The reason why experts recommend to only use it 1 or 2x a month is that your skin needs time to heal after using, you can damage your skin if you use it too frequently</li>
            <li> For me the most painful part is afterwards when the skin feels like it has a mild sunburn.</li>
            <li> So once i clean my face i use this after and roll only on spots with blemishes or dark spots so that i can open up my pores and apply my facial products.</li>
            <li> I have a large, red depressed scar on my cheek from getting several cysts in the same area, several months in a row.  </li>
            <li> Even after 6 months of only using it a couple random times, the amazing results have not gone away.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is possibly the most irritating, counter-intuitive feeling in the world...</li>
            <li> , I do not want my skin to bleed for health reasons, I am worried about possibly scarring my skin, therefore I use a slow but light hand when I roll.</li>
            <li> This product is of way higher quality than another one I bought from an ebay seller a few years back.</li>
            <li> I bought it to help remove mild acne scars, in particular a few of small pitted scars and some discoloration scars.    </li>
            <li> On the other side (the side that was worse) its about 90% better.  </li>
            <li> No major downtime, the areas get red and then subside overnight.  </li>
            <li> Now I have used it only 3 times in about a week and a half and the pitted scars I have are nearly gone.</li>
            <li> This product really works, and the price is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I have been trying for years to get rid of these old acne scars with no success.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, if you have stretch marks or some minor wrinkles you want to get rid of, I definitely recommend this!!  </li>
            <li> Proactiv Solution Deep Cleansing Wash 24 Oz]]), rinse and pat dry</li>
            <li> What a complete and utter waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not bad, not really painful, just annoying.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 1.00mm, and feel it is still too long.  </li>
            <li> My skin is plumper and the minor acne and pick marks are fading away.</li>
            <li> My opinions on this are that, if you have deeper stretch marks or if you&#x27;ve had them for a long time (like me...  </li>
            <li> I spent about a month reading various articles and reviews and watching YouTube videos before deciding to try this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After about a month of use on these minor wrinkles (about 5 times used), the wrinkles are gone!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had deep stretch marks on my stomach after having my son 2.5 years ago and after I  used this a only few times they were already dissapearing.</li>
            <li> so you know when to purchase your next one as needles wear down.</li>
            <li> The first time, I used a numbing cream and after the initial shock of putting needles in my face, it got easier and wasn&#x27;t too uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> well....it messed up my face :(...made my scars more noticeable plus gave me an infection the 2nd time using it...</li>
            <li> I have used this Derma Roller once last friday on my post pregnancy stretch marks along with bio-oil and just used it a second time this past friday</li>
            <li> I just roll..it does hurt a little (especially) the forehead area..</li>
            <li> But it works, plain and simple.</li>
            <li> I am not a candidate for laser resurfacing, due to my olive complexion.  </li>
            <li> I started out rolling once a week, then tried every other day the next&lt;</li>
            <li> Will see in time if this is a new secret weapon.</li>
            <li> My derm assured me that the retin a would improve the indentations, but after a year and a half I had seen very minimal improvement.  </li>
            <li> 3 dark spots from acne have already disappeared after using this product for 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I roll slowly 4 x in the 4 directions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal criss-cross), lifting each time before moving to the next area.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my stretch marks after reading the previous reviews.  </li>
            <li> My stretch marks are about half the size they used to be.  </li>
            <li> and I can see a slight improvement in the texture of my stratch marks already (YAY).</li>
            <li> I never press down too firmly when I roll</li>
            <li> This little bugger HURTS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over two months now on one area of stretch marks</li>
            <li> If squeaks a little</li>
            <li> I just had a breakout a few days ago</li>
            <li> so I have to wait before I can use it again, but I will update in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> So, my skin isn&#x27;t dried out by this process which can happen as the skin heals.  </li>
            <li> And if you use it on your hands (and perhaps your face) keeping it well moisturized for atleast a few days helps a lot too.  </li>
            <li> Upon inspection of the &amp;#34;needles&amp;#34;... I realized that quite a few of them were bent/damaged.  </li>
            <li> Then grit your teeth and press down hard..</li>
            <li> went dull after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> and it caused my hands to get small wrinkles all over it.  </li>
            <li> no more redness..just smoother, firmer skin.</li>
            <li> At least in my case, I use it to combat my baldness, during three times a week I massage the scalp with this device for about two minutes and then apply the minoxidil solution.</li>
            <li> I suggest you don&#x27;t use any makeup or anything on our skin for at least 36 hrs afterward.</li>
            <li> I know it takes at least 3 treatments, 6 weeks apart to allow collagen to be produced, so I&#x27;ll post again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had any scratches or holes in my skin like some people have complained about.  </li>
            <li> It sounded scary and dangerous and I also didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on getting it done professionally.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no good way to say it...</li>
            <li> Very delicate material .</li>
            <li> I expected it to be painful</li>
            <li> I am writing this review as I hope to help some customers who may be confused about it.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li> but I also expected results and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> However, it is a little painful to use the roller in this area</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can be a little painful</li>
            <li> This hurts like crazy and saw no results</li>
            <li> WRONG!  </li>
            <li> This was uncomfortable to use, but it works!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a very pleasant feeling but it isn&#x27;t horrible either</li>
            <li> If you look at videos of micro needling, some are very scary with some women trying to join the zombie apocalypse.</li>
            <li> but once you get going it&#x27;s not too bad.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s painful!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks horribly sun burned for about 2 hours</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this kind of dermaroller (microneedle) for some months and the results are really satisfactory. At least in my case, I use it to combat my baldness, during three times a week I massage the scalp with this device for about two minutes and then apply the minoxidil solution. I think this product has helped me to increase the effectiveness of all topical that I spread over my scalp,    My best regards, Martorella.</li>
            <li> First off, this arrived within 3 days of ordering. I was very happy to receive it so quickly. I purchased this roller over others because I just wanted the roller, not added serums, and this one had mostly excellent reviews at a fair price. I bought it to help remove mild acne scars, in particular a few of small pitted scars and some discoloration scars.    I watched many videos and read many reviews on derma needling, so when I received it, I knew what I was expecting but was still a little scared to use it. Just go slow, follow the directions, and don&#x27;t apply more pressure than you are comfortable with. A lot of people described the feeling as \\&quot;annoying\\&quot; and I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure what that meant until I used it. Not bad, not really painful, just annoying. For me the most painful part is afterwards when the skin feels like it has a mild sunburn. I applied vitamin e and triple antibiotic, which helped.    I noticed results the morning after first use. My skin looked amazingly healthy and glowing. Now I have used it only 3 times in about a week and a half and the pitted scars I have are nearly gone. I can&#x27;t even imagine how great my skin would look if I used this the maximum 5 times a week. I have some discoloration scars as well that are not as quick to disappear, but honestly I was not expecting any results this early on. I just had a breakout a few days ago so I have to wait before I can use it again, but I will update in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and was securely packaged.  I would buy this product from this seller again.</li>
            <li> The quality of the product is very good and it is well packaged so it doesn&#x27;t get damaged during shipment.  I bought it to use over my lips to smooth the wrinkles and I have seen some improvement.  However, it is a little painful to use the roller in this area so I don&#x27;t use it as often as I should to get a better result.</li>
            <li> i used the roller on a facail scar i have that i cover with makeup, it is not deep but im very self conscious of it. i used the roller on it as instrusted but found that it actually made the area rolled more scar like (red and leathery) i would not advise using this on scars.</li>
            <li> The microneedle roller was exactly what I was looking for to take my skin to the next level.  On a fairly regular basis I have been giving myself chemical peels to help with scarring/breakouts, but needed a boost to speed up my results.  The microneedle roller is that boost I needed.  I use the roller on my face/chest/back followed with either a chemical peel or my skincare products.  Using the microneedle before a chemical peel is intense, so really only someone who has been experienced with peels should attempt using them together.  The roller definitely has let all my skincare products work way deeper into my skin and it gives any topical more bang for their buck.  I highly recommend using some type of topical numbing cream to achieve the best results.  The microneedle was delivered quickly and was exactly what they promised.  I plan on ordering another size roller very soon.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no good way to say it... This little bugger HURTS. I barely roll it on my skin for the first few minutes, then when my masochistic endorphins kick in I can apply a bit more pressure. After about 5 minutes I can apply enough pressure to get a little bit of that &#x27;popping&#x27; sound others have mentioned... but never enough to draw blood. It is possibly the most irritating, counter-intuitive feeling in the world... akin to dragging sandpaper over a wound simply for the fun of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my wrinkles are GONE. I&#x27;m 41 with relatively good skin (often told I look 5-10 years younger)... but I had two very noticeable lines across my forehead, and a line between my eyebrows that decided to set up shop sometime in the last year or so. All of them are now gone. Completely and totally GONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, it hurts. But it works, plain and simple. For what it&#x27;s worth, I cleanse and exfoliate ([[ASIN:B003TG9C74 Proactiv Solution Deep Cleansing Wash 24 Oz]]), rinse and pat dry, then after rolling I apply [[ASIN:B004NYMQ88 A&amp;D Ointment, 4-Ounce (Pack of 2)]]. My skin is usually very sensitive, but this routine works beautifully.</li>
            <li> This product is of way higher quality than another one I bought from an ebay seller a few years back. Comes in a super great case and also with instructions if you need them. Shipping was extremely fast also. Thanks for the awesome product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had deep stretch marks on my stomach after having my son 2.5 years ago and after I  used this a only few times they were already dissapearing. I was very, very impressed. I&#x27;ve even suggested it to some girlfriends of mine : ).</li>
            <li> I love this...patience is key after rolling. I suggest you don&#x27;t use any makeup or anything on our skin for at least 36 hrs afterward. But thats just because of my experience. This really does work it just depends on how you treat your skin afterwards.</li>
            <li> I used prescription numbing cream. I can&#x27;t imagine doing this process without it. I like the results. I know it takes at least 3 treatments, 6 weeks apart to allow collagen to be produced, so I&#x27;ll post again. The device worked great - no bent needles or other issues. I&#x27;m hoping to see some results on my neck and around my mouth.</li>
            <li> I use this with no numbing cream.  I do a light roll about six times in each direction all over my face.  My face becomes very red afterwards for about 3 hours.  There is some stinging but is gone by the next day.  I always do at night and usually don&#x27;t go outside for a day.  When I do go out, I put SPF 50 on my face.  But I&#x27;m doing my best to avoid any direct sunlight while microneedling.  I use petroleum jelly on my face every night for about 2 hours.  Wash it off and my skin is moisturized.  I use no other moisturizer.  So, my skin isn&#x27;t dried out by this process which can happen as the skin heals.  I&#x27;ll use this product for 3 months and get rid of the needle and by another.  The directions said it can last up to 3 months with frequent use and I&#x27;m doing this once a week.  Mind you, I have no bleeding like seen in some videos.  I don&#x27;t have one drop of blood on my face.  3 dark spots from acne have already disappeared after using this product for 2 weeks.  I&#x27;m hoping it reduces some cheek scarring that I got in college from having severe eczema on my face.</li>
            <li> I heard positive things about micro needling and decided to try it. This particular derma roller had high reviews. Everyone seems to have a different opinion on needle length but I decided on 1.0. It is advised to use this length only once every two weeks and I&#x27;ve used mine twice. If you look at videos of micro needling, some are very scary with some women trying to join the zombie apocalypse. Please don&#x27;t do that to yourself. It&#x27;s not necessary in order to gain results. Let me be clear- it hurts. The first time, I used a numbing cream and after the initial shock of putting needles in my face, it got easier and wasn&#x27;t too uncomfortable. The second time I decided maybe I didn&#x27;t need the numbing cream. WRONG!  So I stopped and applied it. I have a very high pain tolerance. I&#x27;m no baby, but I&#x27;m telling you to get some lidocaine! When you are finished you will look like you have a sunburn on your face. It feels like one too but it&#x27;s gone the next morning. I can definitely tell my products sink in deeper right after I use the derma roller. Follow the instructions for cleaning it to avoid infection. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and will buy another one when this one needs to be replaced.</li>
            <li> This product is available with various mm size microneedles.  I ordered the 1.00mm, and feel it is still too long.  The roller feels like my skin is being scratched and I cannot apply much pressure at all.  I have used other rollers which were much gentler on my skin, and it could be that smaller mm microneedles would be better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dianne Oliver</li>
            <li> Very delicate material . This hurts like crazy and saw no results</li>
            <li> I bought 3 of these, it is especially good for the skin, the pores of the skin fit Wan, my sister used and noted the results hold</li>
            <li> I have used the .0,5 I have to get a prescription for lidocaine to use the 1.0 dermaroller, it hurts :)&lt;br /&gt;But, derma needling works, I love it, apply vitamin C serum.immedatly after, it&#x27;s amazing !!!!</li>
            <li> Have used this for one month twice a week. I&#x27;m 58 and notice the difference already. My skin is plumper and the minor acne and pick marks are fading away.</li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous when I first received, but I did my internet research and watched several instructional videos on youtube prior to using. I am writing this review as I hope to help some customers who may be confused about it.&lt;br /&gt;Use wisely;  I use this 2x a month only, and I see results. I see it when I look at photos of myself, my face has nice renewed firmess and I am 42. The reason why experts recommend to only use it 1 or 2x a month is that your skin needs time to heal after using, you can damage your skin if you use it too frequently, you actually see the results in firmess about 7-10 days after using. Also it softens the skin, and improves skin tone. My laughlines have softened. I never press down too firmly when I roll, I do not want my skin to bleed for health reasons, I am worried about possibly scarring my skin, therefore I use a slow but light hand when I roll. My skin is slightly red after using but recovers in about 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;Please do your own research before using, this is not a product to use daily, be smart.</li>
            <li> went dull after just a few uses. Great item if it was sharp but now going to have to chalk this up as wasted money and look for a better brand.</li>
            <li> After years of cosmetic surgeons informing me that there is nothing that can be done about my scars resulting from cystic acne, there is a product that really works!  I have been using it for about 2 weeks, and there is about a 75% improvement already!  The dents in my face are barely visible!  I am not a candidate for laser resurfacing, due to my olive complexion.  I have also tried dermal fillers and microdermabrasion.  This product really works, and the price is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I liked it.  It felt pretty good.  I haven&#x27;t seen any visible results yet, but it felt good and did not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> This was uncomfortable to use, but it works! I used it on my stretch marks that i got while pregnant. Nothing helped fade my stretch marks like this did! I think my results would have been even better if I used it on a regular basis, but I got busy and didnt have time, I&#x27;m going to continue using it though.&lt;br /&gt;I use it for 5-10 minutes on my stomach, and then I apply bio-oil to the treated skin. I still have my stretch marks, but they have faded since I started doing this. Bio-oil is good by its self but the derma-roller punctures the scar tissue, allowing the Bio-oil to reach deeper into the skin than it normally would.&lt;br /&gt;It can be a little painful but beauty is pain! Hang in there, the results are worth it!</li>
            <li> My face started to droop after I lost some weight after pregnancy, and I was convinced that Sculptra or Fat injections were my only hope to decrease the nasolabial folds that were starting to form.  I&#x27;m 32.  I have been using this for a week combined with a Growth Factor serum and have noticed that the areas of concern have started to plump and miraculously fill.  Yes, it is not the most comfortable experience, like an uncomfortable pricking, most would probably benefit from topical lidocaine or numbing gel, but the results are worth it. Tolerable for me.  No major downtime, the areas get red and then subside overnight.  Will see in time if this is a new secret weapon.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my stretch marks after reading the previous reviews.  If you read all the instructions first, they recommend not using it more than one time a week as it usually takes collagen about 10 days to heal / recover / whatever.  So, I&#x27;ve tried to use this regularly.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over two months now on one area of stretch marks so I can compare.  The area that I&#x27;ve been using it on has definitely improved.  My stretch marks are about half the size they used to be.  I&#x27;d say in another two-four months, I should have them completely gone.  My opinions on this are that, if you have deeper stretch marks or if you&#x27;ve had them for a long time (like me...  I&#x27;ve had them about 20 years), you may want to get one with longer needles (1.5mm or 2mm perhaps).  It&#x27;s not a very pleasant feeling but it isn&#x27;t horrible either and if it will help get rid of stretch marks, I can definitely handle it.  &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used this on my hands because I used a lotion once that I was allergic to and it caused my hands to get small wrinkles all over it.  Granted, the wrinkles weren&#x27;t very noticeable to anyone else but they bothered me.  After about a month of use on these minor wrinkles (about 5 times used), the wrinkles are gone!  I found that moisturizing your skin thoroughly after each treatment is beneficial.  And if you use it on your hands (and perhaps your face) keeping it well moisturized for atleast a few days helps a lot too.  I used a variety of moisturizers but mainly pure cocoa butter (or a cocoa butter blend that I made up with rosehip seed oil).  If I come across anything in particular that helps, I&#x27;ll be sure to add an update to this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you have stretch marks or some minor wrinkles you want to get rid of, I definitely recommend this!!  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Maybe it works if you can really torture yourself that much to do it repeatedly.</li>
            <li> So once i clean my face i use this after and roll only on spots with blemishes or dark spots so that i can open up my pores and apply my facial products. Seems to be working so far.</li>
            <li> I like it, it does the job.  I&#x27;ve only had it for over a month. If squeaks a little but it seems to be of decent quality. Time will tell 😁</li>
            <li> Amazing results after the first use.  Needles are fine and sharp...not dull like the cheaper ones.</li>
            <li> I just received my Microneedle roller today.  I am very disappointed.  Upon inspection of the &amp;#34;needles&amp;#34;... I realized that quite a few of them were bent/damaged.  I won&#x27;t be able to use this product safely.  I will be returning this item and will not be reordering.  UPDATE:  I did receive an email and a phone call from New Spa trying to correct this situation.   The email read as follows:  We will prepare and thoroughly inspect a replacement NEW SPA Microneedle Skin Care System 1.50mm for you and ship it to you at once. Please, accept one additional 1.00mm roller for free as our apology for this situation.   I wanted to add their efforts to my review in all fairness to the company.  They do go out of their way to try and satisfy their customers.</li>
            <li> My aesthetician kept hassling me about trying this.  It sounded scary and dangerous and I also didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on getting it done professionally.  I spent about a month reading various articles and reviews and watching YouTube videos before deciding to try this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it 3 times over the past week and while I&#x27;m sure no one else can see a difference, I can see difference already.  I have a large, red depressed scar on my cheek from getting several cysts in the same area, several months in a row.  The redness is much lighter and the skin is smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesnt hurt but it doesn&#x27;t feel good, either. My skin looks horribly sun burned for about 2 hours and then it looks normal again.  I&#x27;ve not had any scratches or holes in my skin like some people have complained about.  I roll slowly 4 x in the 4 directions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal criss-cross), lifting each time before moving to the next area.  I used Retin-A for the month before starting this since this is what i had read online but i honestly dont know why- maybe just extra exfoliation and collagen production?  After rolling, I used SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic which is an antioxidant.  Hopefully, I continue seeing improvement but if not, the results so far are well worth the cost of this device.</li>
            <li> well....it messed up my face :(...made my scars more noticeable plus gave me an infection the 2nd time using it...and i followed ALL the instructions</li>
            <li> This does absolutely nothing to get rid of stretch marks. I expected it to be painful and it was, but I also expected results and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Helped with my acne scarring.</li>
            <li> I did extensive reviewing and research before purchasing this product.  I use the 1.0 for my face/neck as this is a new process.  This product is not the cheapest, but not the most expensive.  I have been completely satisfied with its quality and results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only suggestion is to put a note on the case as to needle size if you buy more than one.  Perhaps also date of purchase so you know when to purchase your next one as needles wear down.</li>
            <li> I have good skin,but i am 44,so tried it from wrinkles.It is not painful to me,just i can fill it.After 1st treatment my skin changed color,like refreshed nice looking skin and wrinkles on forehead was diminished lets say on 25%.I used it already about 5 times and i can see the difference.I don&#x27;t think i will be look at 30 even i&#x27;ll keep doing it every day,but...my 44 age is very good looking 44.I can recommend it to everybody who care about his look.&lt;br /&gt;Also i ordered Matrixyl 3000 with Hyaluronic acid for treatments.good luck!</li>
            <li> Hurts like heck, but you get into the groove.. It worked to fade some old acne scars I had on the side of one cheek. You have to stick with it. Maybe take a few aspirin and enjoy a strong margarita before you use it.. Then grit your teeth and press down hard.. Roll away!!! Skin looks prettier and smoother after a day of recovery. Who da thunk it??!!!</li>
            <li> What a complete and utter waste of money. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Save your hard-earned money.</li>
            <li> I want to try the one more pricey and see the differences, but the needles on this roller are thicker than the cheaper one, which is hurt a lot and lead to bleed easily.  Not recommended at all!</li>
            <li> Ouch, works great, but be careful, very sharp needles.</li>
            <li> I waited a whole year to review this, just to really give adequate time to observe results.  Boy, it has NOT disappointed.  I had moderate acne for about 7 years and finally got it under control with medication and retin a.  I don&#x27;t break out anymore, but I was left with \\&quot;boxcar\\&quot; scarring on both sides of my face, running along my cheek bones.  My derm assured me that the retin a would improve the indentations, but after a year and a half I had seen very minimal improvement.  Even doing 20% TCA peels didn&#x27;t touch it.  I used this once a week for about 6 months straight.  AMAZING results.  On one side the scarring is completely filled in.. On the other side (the side that was worse) its about 90% better.  I also rolled my forehead and my smile lines and I&#x27;ve seen huge improvement in those areas as well.  Even after 6 months of only using it a couple random times, the amazing results have not gone away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cleanse, then roll, then apply my retin a.  Yes, it hurts like a mofo but its SO worth it.  If you are on the fence about doing something like this at home... BUY IT... You will NOT be dissapointed!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this Derma Roller once last friday on my post pregnancy stretch marks along with bio-oil and just used it a second time this past friday and I can see a slight improvement in the texture of my stratch marks already (YAY). I plan on wearing a bikini this summer and between this roller and the gym it just might be possible:-)</li>
            <li> This is so awesome. I have been trying for years to get rid of these old acne scars with no success. I used this microneedle and it actually worked. I have recommended this to several people. It is a must have</li>
            <li> Works but it&#x27;s painful!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about using this little device...so I did a lot of reasearch before I took the leap!  I have been \\&quot;rolling\\&quot; for about 3 weeks now and I am seeing a difference in the firmness of my skin.  I started out rolling once a week, then tried every other day the next&lt;br /&gt;week, but that was too much for my sensitive skin.  So by the 3rd week I felt that 2 times per week works great.  I do not use&lt;br /&gt;a topical numbing cream...I just roll..it does hurt a little (especially) the forehead area..but once you get going it&#x27;s not too bad.  It feels like a sunburn afterwards...then I apply my vitamin/mositure creams (I am using coconut oil &amp; loving that) &amp; go to bed.  In the morning everything looks perfectly normal..no more redness..just smoother, firmer skin. I am very fair &amp; have dry/sensitive skin.  I was a little nervous about using this needle length, but it seems to be working great!  PS I am 50 &amp; trying to fight the aging process without using fillers, etc. injected into my body..this is a good option!  Hope this helps!! Good luck!</li>
            <li> Would purchase again.</li>
