    <ol>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, very happy with the purchase</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Best on the market!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially great if you have hair on your chest like I do, because it doesn&#x27;t get caught up int</li>
            <li>Jergens is the best self tanner, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>and that cannot be replicated, but this is the best cancer-free option.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even used it on my face and am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Well I have to say I am impressed.</li>
            <li>Best self tanner around.</li>
            <li>Went on so beautifully, but as it faded it peeled in areas looking like pregnancy stretch marks!  </li>
            <li>Works great .</li>
            <li>I use it 2 or 3 times a week after a shower, and I&#x27;m happy with the resulting color.</li>
            <li>great product, don&#x27;t hesitate</li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li>Good price and great product.</li>
            <li>Makes me look and feel good even in winter.</li>
            <li>it is a good brown skin tone..</li>
            <li>So I bought a good exfoliating product and gloves, and scrubbed my skin well.</li>
            <li>Everything about this tanner is quite good.</li>
            <li>I loved the tan I get from self tanners but not that \\&quot;tanner\\&quot; smell.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why they don&#x27;t put in a good scent like floral or citrus or anything to mask the tanning smell.....</li>
            <li>Then after I applied this foaming tanning moisturizer, I was very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>It works best right after I shower, so that the lotion doesn&#x27;t absorb before I&#x27;m finished rubbing it in.</li>
            <li>I love this tanning moisturizer!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years and absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love my tan!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>Love the color it gives me!</li>
            <li>It was really amusing.</li>
            <li>Also, you can see the color developing within minutes or an hour after you put it on, which is nice.</li>
            <li>Nice color</li>
            <li>Not too orange, and goes on really nicely.  </li>
            <li>Great for a quick fix on a tan.</li>
            <li>tan very easily,</li>
            <li>This is very easy to use no streaks.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect and leave you with a tan as natural as the sun could give you.</li>
            <li>It comes in a couple of strengths -- I&#x27;m pretty fair-skinned and the &amp;#34;Medium to Tan&amp;#34; works great for me.  </li>
            <li>The smell is not overly powerful and is pleasant.</li>
            <li>I purchased this foaming self tanner to try in hopes it&#x27;d be better than most and more affordable.</li>
            <li>I have tried sooo many sunless tanners over the years, and I will never use anything</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite sunless tanners.</li>
            <li>I have tried many others and this is in my top picks.</li>
            <li>But the latest batch I bought here was expired so it won&#x27;t</li>
            <li>and I LOVE the lotion.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite self tanner.</li>
            <li>I think I like the lotion better</li>
            <li>, I feel like you can get it more even.</li>
            <li>but overall it&#x27;s great !!</li>
            <li>To me the smell is okay</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d get a better bargain just going to Wal-Mart or Target.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed their lotion for that.</li>
            <li>It seemed interesting and I thought it would work something like St. Tropez mousse, though I&#x27;d never tried it.</li>
            <li>So that was mostly my fault.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the most olive tone</li>
            <li>As I use this on my neck mostly and on my body, water gets in close proximity to my face when I wash it.</li>
            <li>Their face lotion/tanner, however, does wonders, smells fantastic, and feels luxurious!</li>
            <li>All around better.</li>
            <li>he hair like a lotion does, but still penetrates better than a spray.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but if you have light skin do not use it!</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li>Make sure to ware gloves or wash (more like scrub) your hands.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite of all the sunless tanning products out there.  </li>
            <li>Make sure they ship you the correct &amp;#34;version&amp;#34; of this product though.  </li>
            <li>; Jergins is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried MANY self tanners before.</li>
            <li>Love the foam application.</li>
            <li>Does have a scent, but nothing overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I thoroughly have enjoyed.</li>
            <li>I have the self tanning lotion from Jerkins and like it much better than the foam.</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 more cans.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s usually a great product which has been discontinued and replaced with a highly perfumed version.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave streaks or splotches around knees or elbows.</li>
            <li>i really love this brand, because it tans well and does not have sunless smell, also it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great for building natural color!</li>
            <li>But after 3 nights of using this product you will have a great natural looking NO STREAK color.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned but use the medium on my legs and get a tanned look fast.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for someone who already has a tan really....</li>
            <li>Takes a bit of time to develop the tan and it easily becomes orange.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to apply the foam.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and no orange skin.</li>
            <li>other great thing about this product is that it honestly doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li>it consistently gives you a nice glow year round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seems fine on light skin that is lightly tanned.</li>
            <li>I think my skin would probably fall into the Light to Medium Skin tones, but I always like to use the darker option to get faster results.</li>
            <li>The mouse form of the tanner is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This is a good product, after trying many, this one actually does not turn orange....</li>
            <li>So... so far so good.</li>
            <li>His advice was to be sure and exfoliate my skin first.</li>
            <li>I can put it on my clean skin and there is no change in color, ever.</li>
            <li>foam is very light and dries fast.</li>
            <li>I will keep using the product for the usage as a foundation for makeup on my face and continue to use it on my legs and arms, since I wear shorts and short sleeved tops  most of the year as I live in a state that has a very warm climate.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the foaming moisturizer for a week now and it still feels full.</li>
            <li>The foam goes on really easy and smooth anyway, but the oil assisted with making the color very even.  </li>
            <li>But, most of the time, I&#x27;m just too lazy to spend all that time self-tanning, so I just use the Jergen&#x27;s because it is, by far, the best of them all as a stand-alone.</li>
            <li>Using this product will produce a tanned appearance although it does have an orange tint to it, the color lasts weeks on your body but will fade rather quickly if you use it on your face.</li>
            <li>Fast &amp; Easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, my 1-2-3 approach gives me really, really, REALLY amazing results that last about a week without touch-ups.  </li>
            <li>I am in LOVE with this natural glow foam.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy with decent smell.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice color overall.</li>
            <li>It was worth a try, but its biggest flaw I cannot get over.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You don&#x27;t see any color right away.</li>
            <li>This product is priced right &amp; keeps my &amp;#34;farmer&#x27;s tan&amp;#34; glowing all summer.</li>
            <li>Use right after shower.  </li>
            <li>I seem to only need 1 application per week to keep a nice light glow so that my skin is not &amp;#34;winter white&amp;#34;, plus, I am not getting any harmful rays like I used to do when I was young.</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t using it to enhance a better tanner product don&#x27;t use it...not worth the orange or the brown splotchy marks that last for weeks.</li>
            <li>It gives me that natural tanned look and it is so easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I was pretty embarrassed.</li>
            <li>My skin just feels soft and smooth</li>
            <li>When you first put this foam on you won&#x27;t smell anything.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I suggest maybe a more darkening formula in the ingredients so it will work equally as well on whatever surface</li>
            <li>Unless my experiences with this foam become better in the future for some reason, I will stick to their lotion formulas instead of this.</li>
            <li>From now I will most likely use their face lotion on my neck and this on my body where I need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li>I love this easy way to keep from looking too pale.</li>
            <li>Now I enjoy this one because it eventually feels like it&#x27;s more dried than the lotion ever did</li>
            <li>I tried to really blend it much better this time around my arms and wrists, but still ended up with obvious demarcation lines.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a natural, easy to apply self tanner.</li>
            <li>This foam is the first product I have used that REALLY does sink in.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Color was nice but not dark enough until it starts to build up&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color you get is a true natural glow.</li>
            <li>When I first tried this on my pale skin, it worked pretty well, but my skin looked kind of blotchy.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and the look is natural and not orangey.</li>
            <li>Such an easy at home solution for those averse to tanning beds and/or sunning.  </li>
            <li>but it is tolerable, a bottle will last a good long while.</li>
            <li>The color faded on me streaky and patchy in certain areas.</li>
            <li>Dries super fast with no sticky feeling and leaves a natural looking tan..</li>
            <li>My favorite part is how much longer it seems to last - the lotion wasn&#x27;t lasting a full 2 weeks for a bottle.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well and is decently priced.</li>
            <li>For my use of this (areas that are around water such as arms and neck), this is a huge downside to this tanner.</li>
            <li>There is no lingering sticky feeling, only a light silky feel to my skin.</li>
            <li>I never get streaks and it&#x27;s always very even.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper than in the drug stores.</li>
            <li>I do not have a need to tan absolutely all of myself and tend to focus on areas--this is not the tanner for that.</li>
            <li>I since returned this product (as I really doubted I would be drawn to use it continuously) and purchased the Revitalizing lotion.</li>
            <li>I also should note that I use nitrile exam gloves to do all of my self-tanning, because no amount of any miracle product and scrubbing REALLY gets all that stuff off your palms.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like this self tanner.</li>
            <li>It dries fast.</li>
            <li>: I had applied it once more and was very careful with the water splashing and hand washing</li>
            <li>So sad, because initially a beautiful tan.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of color and the tone of the color with just the first application.</li>
            <li>The foam does not squish down into a more lathery consistency like hair mousse does.</li>
            <li>I have a yellow/olive complexion and I feel this gives me a decent color match.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s harder to blend than their lotion as you have less time to work this one in and make sure you faded it out nicely where the self tanner stops and 2) when this comes in contact with water after you apply it, the self tanner will come off in that section and leave you with a white spot!</li>
            <li>I had trouble at first because I would squirt out some, it would puff up and become a giant ball of foam (usually more than I had wanted for that small area), and then I&#x27;d have to quickly spread it around more area than I needed.</li>
            <li>As long as you give it adequate amount to dry before getting to any water, this product should work fine.</li>
            <li>and it will produce a much more natural looking dark tan that will get raves.</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to buying the new version that is supposed to have no odor, although I don&#x27;t find the odor of this formula to be offensive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that other sunless tanners that claim they don&#x27;t smell, including the jergen&#x27;s natural glow lotion, do smell, and are way too strong for me to tolerate.</li>
            <li>first used this over winter break and by the time i got back to work, people asked where I had gone.</li>
            <li>I like to do two layers the first night,  and so on for the next two nights depending in the color I get from it.  </li>
            <li>It does smell better than other tanning moisturizers I&#x27;ve used, but it definitely isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; smelling or even &amp;#34;odorless&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>So far the color looks really natural (more on the brown side than the gold/orange side) and I have no streaks or uneven patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I also lose my tan quickly in the winter and get pretty pale.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a \\&quot;harder, stay puffed as you&#x27;re trying to blend\\&quot; type of foam which is quite strange and makes using this a bit of a challenge compared to just their lotion for me.</li>
            <li>This is SO fast, and dries so quickly that my only complaint is that it sometimes dries TOO quickly.</li>
            <li>Stinks but super effective</li>
            <li>I looked like I didn&#x27;t scrub in many places on my body after letting scum accrue over days and days.</li>
            <li>The color is really natural</li>
            <li>There is no worse feeling to me than putting on a pair of pants when there is ANY residue left on my legs.</li>
            <li>Within one use of using the foaming Natural Glow for Medium to Tan Skin</li>
            <li>I have found natural glow to work well if a lot of the product is applied.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>(I only really ever did my neck to even out my neck color with the rest of me).</li>
            <li>but it still ended up very patchy and obvious around my wrists where I had to wash my hands/palms after applying this.</li>
            <li>I follow-up with the Jergen&#x27;s Natural Glow in the darker tone</li>
            <li>I also used the Natural glow Firming lotion on my butt and tummy.</li>
            <li>After my shower, I dried off, put on a light coat of Neutrogena sesame oil and then put on this foam.</li>
            <li>I combined it with the Jergens Natural Glow Express Body Moisturizer for Medium to Tan Skin as another reviewer suggested and it works well.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m blonde, green eyed, and lily white but remarkably tanned pretty dark back in the day), applied all over.  </li>
            <li>I usually put this on a couple hours before I&#x27;m planning to take a shower to avoid wearing the smell all day, and it still tans fine with my strategy.</li>
            <li>There is minimal smell at first and almost nothing once it dries.</li>
            <li>It dries very fast, I use it every other day and people ask me all the time if I go to the tanning salon.</li>
            <li>Even the lotions that say they dry quick don&#x27;t really dry.</li>
            <li>Then I move on to the next leg, do the same thing, and repeat the process until I&#x27;ve done my whole body.</li>
            <li>This self tanner is one of the best in the least expensive brands.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, and starts showing results in a few hours.</li>
            <li>I have tried the jergen&#x27;s daily natural glow lotion and it was just way too sticky for me.</li>
            <li>I have been using Natural Glow Foaming Daily Moisturizer for a while..</li>
            <li>Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised, I will definitely keep this on hand!</li>
            <li>It also left my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>in all, as I was psyched in loving this self tanner initially, it failed my ratings after the build up issue.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But if you can get past the faint smell, it really does leave a nice color!</li>
            <li>I chose this review because the product worked and it lasted much longer than I expected!</li>
            <li>After a few days- it started to wear down but to me, this wasn&#x27;t worth the money for that very reason.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had quite a few skin cancers removed, after spending way too much time in the sun without sun block, when I was young and oblivious.</li>
            <li>it gets a little funny as it wears off....</li>
            <li>Because I wash my face usually at least 2 times a day, my neck had many streaks going down from water washing away the tanner over the course of washings.</li>
            <li>I had been using the Firming Natural Glow lotion for a long time as those bottles last forever if you aren&#x27;t tanning your entire body with it</li>
            <li>Because the main area of use for me of the self tanners is my neck, this is a big problem for me and made this not worth it.</li>
            <li>I imagine a lot of the self tanner comes off during a shower for this reason which can be a good or bad thing.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>

            <li> It&#x27;s especially great if you have hair on your chest like I do, because it doesn&#x27;t get caught up int</li>
            <li> Jergens is the best self tanner, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> and that cannot be replicated, but this is the best cancer-free option.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even used it on my face and am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Well I have to say I am impressed.</li>
            <li> Best self tanner around.</li>
            <li> Went on so beautifully, but as it faded it peeled in areas looking like pregnancy stretch marks!  </li>
            <li> Works great .</li>
            <li> I use it 2 or 3 times a week after a shower, and I&#x27;m happy with the resulting color.</li>

            <li> Makes me look and feel good even in winter.</li>
            <li> it is a good brown skin tone..</li>
            <li> So I bought a good exfoliating product and gloves, and scrubbed my skin well.</li>
            <li> Everything about this tanner is quite good.</li>
            <li> I loved the tan I get from self tanners but not that \\&quot;tanner\\&quot; smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why they don&#x27;t put in a good scent like floral or citrus or anything to mask the tanning smell.....</li>
            <li> Then after I applied this foaming tanning moisturizer, I was very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> It works best right after I shower, so that the lotion doesn&#x27;t absorb before I&#x27;m finished rubbing it in.</li>
            <li> I love this tanning moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love my tan!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> Love the color it gives me!</li>
            <li> It was really amusing.</li>
            <li> Also, you can see the color developing within minutes or an hour after you put it on, which is nice.</li>
            <li> Nice color</li>
            <li> Not too orange, and goes on really nicely.  </li>
            <li> Great for a quick fix on a tan.</li>
            <li> tan very easily,</li>
            <li> This is very easy to use no streaks.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect and leave you with a tan as natural as the sun could give you.</li>
            <li> It comes in a couple of strengths -- I&#x27;m pretty fair-skinned and the &amp;#34;Medium to Tan&amp;#34; works great for me.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not overly powerful and is pleasant.</li>
            <li> I purchased this foaming self tanner to try in hopes it&#x27;d be better than most and more affordable.</li>
            <li> I have tried sooo many sunless tanners over the years, and I will never use anything</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite sunless tanners.</li>
            <li> I have tried many others and this is in my top picks.</li>
            <li> But the latest batch I bought here was expired so it won&#x27;t</li>
            <li> and I LOVE the lotion.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite self tanner.</li>
            <li> I think I like the lotion better</li>
            <li> , I feel like you can get it more even.</li>
            <li> but overall it&#x27;s great !!</li>
            <li> To me the smell is okay</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d get a better bargain just going to Wal-Mart or Target.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed their lotion for that.</li>
            <li> It seemed interesting and I thought it would work something like St. Tropez mousse, though I&#x27;d never tried it.</li>
            <li> So that was mostly my fault.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the most olive tone</li>
            <li> As I use this on my neck mostly and on my body, water gets in close proximity to my face when I wash it.</li>
            <li> Their face lotion/tanner, however, does wonders, smells fantastic, and feels luxurious!</li>
            <li> All around better.</li>
            <li> he hair like a lotion does, but still penetrates better than a spray.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but if you have light skin do not use it!</li>
            <li> I love the product.</li>
            <li> Thank you for such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Make sure to ware gloves or wash (more like scrub) your hands.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite of all the sunless tanning products out there.  </li>
            <li> Make sure they ship you the correct &amp;#34;version&amp;#34; of this product though.  </li>
            <li> ; Jergins is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried MANY self tanners before.</li>
            <li> Love the foam application.</li>
            <li> Does have a scent, but nothing overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I thoroughly have enjoyed.</li>
            <li> I have the self tanning lotion from Jerkins and like it much better than the foam.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 more cans.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usually a great product which has been discontinued and replaced with a highly perfumed version.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave streaks or splotches around knees or elbows.</li>
            <li> i really love this brand, because it tans well and does not have sunless smell, also it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for building natural color!</li>
            <li> But after 3 nights of using this product you will have a great natural looking NO STREAK color.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned but use the medium on my legs and get a tanned look fast.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for someone who already has a tan really....</li>
            <li> Takes a bit of time to develop the tan and it easily becomes orange.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to apply the foam.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and no orange skin.</li>
            <li> other great thing about this product is that it honestly doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li> it consistently gives you a nice glow year round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seems fine on light skin that is lightly tanned.</li>
            <li> I think my skin would probably fall into the Light to Medium Skin tones, but I always like to use the darker option to get faster results.</li>
            <li> The mouse form of the tanner is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, after trying many, this one actually does not turn orange....</li>
            <li> So... so far so good.</li>
            <li> His advice was to be sure and exfoliate my skin first.</li>
            <li> I can put it on my clean skin and there is no change in color, ever.</li>
            <li> foam is very light and dries fast.</li>
            <li> I will keep using the product for the usage as a foundation for makeup on my face and continue to use it on my legs and arms, since I wear shorts and short sleeved tops  most of the year as I live in a state that has a very warm climate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the foaming moisturizer for a week now and it still feels full.</li>
            <li> The foam goes on really easy and smooth anyway, but the oil assisted with making the color very even.  </li>
            <li> But, most of the time, I&#x27;m just too lazy to spend all that time self-tanning, so I just use the Jergen&#x27;s because it is, by far, the best of them all as a stand-alone.</li>
            <li> Using this product will produce a tanned appearance although it does have an orange tint to it, the color lasts weeks on your body but will fade rather quickly if you use it on your face.</li>
            <li> Fast &amp; Easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, my 1-2-3 approach gives me really, really, REALLY amazing results that last about a week without touch-ups.  </li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this natural glow foam.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy with decent smell.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice color overall.</li>
            <li> It was worth a try, but its biggest flaw I cannot get over.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You don&#x27;t see any color right away.</li>
            <li> This product is priced right &amp; keeps my &amp;#34;farmer&#x27;s tan&amp;#34; glowing all summer.</li>
            <li> Use right after shower.  </li>
            <li> I seem to only need 1 application per week to keep a nice light glow so that my skin is not &amp;#34;winter white&amp;#34;, plus, I am not getting any harmful rays like I used to do when I was young.</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t using it to enhance a better tanner product don&#x27;t use it...not worth the orange or the brown splotchy marks that last for weeks.</li>
            <li> It gives me that natural tanned look and it is so easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I was pretty embarrassed.</li>
            <li> My skin just feels soft and smooth</li>
            <li> When you first put this foam on you won&#x27;t smell anything.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I suggest maybe a more darkening formula in the ingredients so it will work equally as well on whatever surface</li>
            <li> Unless my experiences with this foam become better in the future for some reason, I will stick to their lotion formulas instead of this.</li>
            <li> From now I will most likely use their face lotion on my neck and this on my body where I need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li> I love this easy way to keep from looking too pale.</li>
            <li> Now I enjoy this one because it eventually feels like it&#x27;s more dried than the lotion ever did</li>
            <li> I tried to really blend it much better this time around my arms and wrists, but still ended up with obvious demarcation lines.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a natural, easy to apply self tanner.</li>
            <li> This foam is the first product I have used that REALLY does sink in.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Color was nice but not dark enough until it starts to build up&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color you get is a true natural glow.</li>
            <li> When I first tried this on my pale skin, it worked pretty well, but my skin looked kind of blotchy.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and the look is natural and not orangey.</li>
            <li> Such an easy at home solution for those averse to tanning beds and/or sunning.  </li>
            <li> but it is tolerable, a bottle will last a good long while.</li>
            <li> The color faded on me streaky and patchy in certain areas.</li>
            <li> Dries super fast with no sticky feeling and leaves a natural looking tan..</li>
            <li> My favorite part is how much longer it seems to last - the lotion wasn&#x27;t lasting a full 2 weeks for a bottle.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well and is decently priced.</li>
            <li> For my use of this (areas that are around water such as arms and neck), this is a huge downside to this tanner.</li>
            <li> There is no lingering sticky feeling, only a light silky feel to my skin.</li>
            <li> I never get streaks and it&#x27;s always very even.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper than in the drug stores.</li>
            <li> I do not have a need to tan absolutely all of myself and tend to focus on areas--this is not the tanner for that.</li>
            <li> I since returned this product (as I really doubted I would be drawn to use it continuously) and purchased the Revitalizing lotion.</li>
            <li> I also should note that I use nitrile exam gloves to do all of my self-tanning, because no amount of any miracle product and scrubbing REALLY gets all that stuff off your palms.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this self tanner.</li>
            <li> It dries fast.</li>
            <li> : I had applied it once more and was very careful with the water splashing and hand washing</li>
            <li> So sad, because initially a beautiful tan.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of color and the tone of the color with just the first application.</li>
            <li> The foam does not squish down into a more lathery consistency like hair mousse does.</li>
            <li> I have a yellow/olive complexion and I feel this gives me a decent color match.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s harder to blend than their lotion as you have less time to work this one in and make sure you faded it out nicely where the self tanner stops and 2) when this comes in contact with water after you apply it, the self tanner will come off in that section and leave you with a white spot!</li>
            <li> I had trouble at first because I would squirt out some, it would puff up and become a giant ball of foam (usually more than I had wanted for that small area), and then I&#x27;d have to quickly spread it around more area than I needed.</li>
            <li> As long as you give it adequate amount to dry before getting to any water, this product should work fine.</li>
            <li> and it will produce a much more natural looking dark tan that will get raves.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to buying the new version that is supposed to have no odor, although I don&#x27;t find the odor of this formula to be offensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that other sunless tanners that claim they don&#x27;t smell, including the jergen&#x27;s natural glow lotion, do smell, and are way too strong for me to tolerate.</li>
            <li> first used this over winter break and by the time i got back to work, people asked where I had gone.</li>
            <li> I like to do two layers the first night,  and so on for the next two nights depending in the color I get from it.  </li>
            <li> It does smell better than other tanning moisturizers I&#x27;ve used, but it definitely isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; smelling or even &amp;#34;odorless&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> So far the color looks really natural (more on the brown side than the gold/orange side) and I have no streaks or uneven patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I also lose my tan quickly in the winter and get pretty pale.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a \\&quot;harder, stay puffed as you&#x27;re trying to blend\\&quot; type of foam which is quite strange and makes using this a bit of a challenge compared to just their lotion for me.</li>
            <li> This is SO fast, and dries so quickly that my only complaint is that it sometimes dries TOO quickly.</li>
            <li> Stinks but super effective</li>
            <li> I looked like I didn&#x27;t scrub in many places on my body after letting scum accrue over days and days.</li>
            <li> The color is really natural</li>
            <li> There is no worse feeling to me than putting on a pair of pants when there is ANY residue left on my legs.</li>
            <li> Within one use of using the foaming Natural Glow for Medium to Tan Skin</li>
            <li> I have found natural glow to work well if a lot of the product is applied.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> (I only really ever did my neck to even out my neck color with the rest of me).</li>
            <li> but it still ended up very patchy and obvious around my wrists where I had to wash my hands/palms after applying this.</li>
            <li> I follow-up with the Jergen&#x27;s Natural Glow in the darker tone</li>
            <li> I also used the Natural glow Firming lotion on my butt and tummy.</li>
            <li> After my shower, I dried off, put on a light coat of Neutrogena sesame oil and then put on this foam.</li>
            <li> I combined it with the Jergens Natural Glow Express Body Moisturizer for Medium to Tan Skin as another reviewer suggested and it works well.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m blonde, green eyed, and lily white but remarkably tanned pretty dark back in the day), applied all over.  </li>
            <li> I usually put this on a couple hours before I&#x27;m planning to take a shower to avoid wearing the smell all day, and it still tans fine with my strategy.</li>
            <li> There is minimal smell at first and almost nothing once it dries.</li>
            <li> It dries very fast, I use it every other day and people ask me all the time if I go to the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> Even the lotions that say they dry quick don&#x27;t really dry.</li>
            <li> Then I move on to the next leg, do the same thing, and repeat the process until I&#x27;ve done my whole body.</li>
            <li> This self tanner is one of the best in the least expensive brands.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, and starts showing results in a few hours.</li>
            <li> I have tried the jergen&#x27;s daily natural glow lotion and it was just way too sticky for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using Natural Glow Foaming Daily Moisturizer for a while..</li>
            <li> Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised, I will definitely keep this on hand!</li>
            <li> It also left my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> in all, as I was psyched in loving this self tanner initially, it failed my ratings after the build up issue.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But if you can get past the faint smell, it really does leave a nice color!</li>
            <li> I chose this review because the product worked and it lasted much longer than I expected!</li>
            <li> After a few days- it started to wear down but to me, this wasn&#x27;t worth the money for that very reason.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had quite a few skin cancers removed, after spending way too much time in the sun without sun block, when I was young and oblivious.</li>
            <li> it gets a little funny as it wears off....</li>
            <li> Because I wash my face usually at least 2 times a day, my neck had many streaks going down from water washing away the tanner over the course of washings.</li>
            <li> I had been using the Firming Natural Glow lotion for a long time as those bottles last forever if you aren&#x27;t tanning your entire body with it</li>
            <li> Because the main area of use for me of the self tanners is my neck, this is a big problem for me and made this not worth it.</li>
            <li> I imagine a lot of the self tanner comes off during a shower for this reason which can be a good or bad thing.</li>
            <li> I am fairly pale myself, so I used the one for medium skin tones just to set a result much faster.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an average toned skin white female (not pale skinned)</li>
            <li> /&gt;After past products leaving me scrounging with streaked body parts, I was really reluctant to put this on my face.</li>
            <li> last too long if you used for your body</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27; t used long enough to notice a tan</li>
            <li> It gave me a very nice color the first day or day and a half (and I almost felt a bit bad for my extremely negative review)</li>
            <li> , I think it smells like cheez-its, either way, if you&#x27;ve used sunless tanner before you know exactly what I mean.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few self tanners that gives me a natural, lasting tan.</li>
            <li> If you use way too much it leaves a slight stickiness, but still significantly less sticky than any lotion.</li>
            <li> The foam means it&#x27;s dripless, and it&#x27;s hard to apply too much in one spot.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, as long as you don&#x27;t overdo it, it leaves no stickiness.</li>
            <li> I spent the last 2 weeks applying the foam and lotion twice a day</li>
            <li> I am a natural redhead with pale skin.  </li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected, don&#x27;t bother!</li>
            <li> I feel totally dry.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> I take care to distribute it evenly, then let it absorb and dry before getting dressed.</li>
            <li> It gives you a deep color that actually lasts for quite a few days after just one application without having to touch it up (that is, unless you splash water on it before it fully develops).</li>
            <li> The old odor you couldn&#x27;t get away from in the past isn&#x27;t there with Jergens.</li>
            <li> If there is any left, I rub down my shoulders.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You are left feeling slightly sticky but that literally lasts minutes.</li>
            <li> I suppose this just isn&#x27;t the product for me or perhaps I should have gotten the lighter color so these lines would be less obvious.</li>
            <li> I had learned from previous experience that having oil on prior to application of ANY tanning product will help keep your feet, ankles, knees and elbows and hands from looking darker than your legs and arms and prevently streaking too.</li>
            <li> If only a small amount is applied such as on the face, there is really not a very visible difference in the \\&quot;glow\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> and I say a little coloration but nothing drastic enough to call it a tan.</li>
            <li> the product that I expected did not perform.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a few different self tanners over the years and this one was recommended by a coworker</li>
            <li> Instead it just tries to be odorless but</li>
            <li> Be careful putting it on your knees, elbows, and ankles, and exfoliate often.</li>
            <li> but then the following days, it just faded and developed poorly on me.</li>
            <li> If you smell the foam itself you will smell a faint classic self tanner smell... but mixed into some yummy smells.</li>
            <li> I do not want to tan in the sun or in a suntan parlor due to the cancer concerns.</li>
            <li> It left me streaky :/</li>
            <li> I had looked at my neck in daylight the other day</li>
            <li> The product insists on &amp;#34;no sunless tanner odor&amp;#34;, and some of the other reviews seem to support that.</li>
            <li> There is a scent, but it is minimal and less offensive than other sunless tanner products.</li>
            <li> Within a few hours you will start to notice a bit of that characteristic sunless tanner smell.</li>
            <li> Even though you will eventually notice that smell, I find it to be a lot less strong/noticeable than other sunless</li>
            <li> Only negative is It lacks the emollient qualities of a cream.</li>
            <li> As dark as I self-tan, it still isn&#x27;t visibly noticeable on my hands.  </li>
            <li> Never orange, never too dark.</li>
            <li> I start with Tan Towels and rub myself down all over.  </li>
            <li> By the time I&#x27;m done (less than 5 minutes from the time I started)</li>
            <li> This one does offer faster drying and less of a smell than the lotion.</li>
            <li> I did notice one time at the gym that I was getting a little too dark for winter</li>
            <li> It goes on fully covering without the mess.</li>
            <li> I put a little blob on one of my legs/arms/whatever, and rub it in until it&#x27;s dry---this literally takes less than 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> I tried to use a little less than a ping pong ball size mousse dollop if i can get my finger off the trigger in time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s annoying, but I certainly can&#x27;t blame jergen&#x27;s for that, since it&#x27;s not actually the product that smells.</li>
            <li> This is definately not a moisturizer and the &#x27;glow&#x27; was severely missing.  </li>
            <li> I have used it a few times.  </li>
            <li> When you stop using it it comes off unevenly, making it look like some sort of skin cancer.</li>
            <li> so why waste your money on it?  </li>
            <li> It did not moisturize my skin at all, if anything it dried it out.</li>
            <li> Smell is minimal, doesn&#x27;t feel thick on your skin, works as it should.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the tanning lotion smells and the Jergens lotion does have a bit of a smell, but I grew used to that and don&#x27;t mind it at all anymore.  </li>
            <li> I was using the regular lotion, and was frustrated with how long it took both to put on and to dry.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m so pale and pasty.  </li>
            <li> Plain and simple:&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not true!</li>
            <li> In fact I have already recommended it to a few of my friends for an upcoming wedding!</li>
            <li> The smell just has a faint chemical smell to it, but it doesn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
            <li> Water almost completely takes this self tanner off which is quite inconvenient for me.</li>
            <li> Always at night a few hours before bed because they stink!  </li>
            <li> The only thing bad thing is the smell, which really isn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using self tanners for at least 5 years.  </li>
            <li> I will say you have to use it at least two nights in a  row to notice a hint of color.  </li>
            <li> it is no better !</li>
            <li> Recommended for those who want subtle color...use it 3 times a week, or even every day...</li>
            <li> This stuff has an aroma that is not great</li>
            <li> Broken cap, lost some foam during shipment, does not tan, product may be old.&lt;br /&gt;Ro</li>
            <li> so unfortunately there is no sunless tanner that won&#x27;t produce that smell, unless it&#x27;s not working.  </li>
            <li> I finish with the Fake Bake, applied all over.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as the lotion but the tan from the lotion lasts longer.</li>
            <li> Really bad the longer the DHA wears on but it works.</li>
            <li> Too bad.  </li>
            <li> stinks like crap.</li>
            <li> hate the feel of any lotion on my skin.</li>
            <li> and it gives me a horrible headache.  </li>
            <li> And this tanner did not have that God awful smell.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff has an aroma that is not great but it is tolerable, a bottle will last a good long while. Using this product will produce a tanned appearance although it does have an orange tint to it, the color lasts weeks on your body but will fade rather quickly if you use it on your face. I recommend you use this product in conjunction with the sun...maybe 1-3 hours and it will produce a much more natural looking dark tan that will get raves.</li>
            <li> This is definately not a moisturizer and the &#x27;glow&#x27; was severely missing.  I didn&#x27;t get the point of using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an average toned skin white female (not pale skinned) so I purchased the medium to tan skin tone color. I purchased this foaming self tanner to try in hopes it&#x27;d be better than most and more affordable. Here were my results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Affordable&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;Dries quickly&lt;br /&gt;Streak free&lt;br /&gt;Light- non, clogging (or so it seemed for me- I didn&#x27;t use this on my face)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Color was nice but not dark enough until it starts to build up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t last too long if you used for your body&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After three applications (and showers) there was tons of build up and the build up would turn a bronze-orange color. I looked like I didn&#x27;t scrub in many places on my body after letting scum accrue over days and days. I was pretty embarrassed. I even tried scrubbing it off. After a few days- it started to wear down but to me, this wasn&#x27;t worth the money for that very reason. I don&#x27;t want something that is going to build up and cause me to look like I was playing with children&#x27;s paints or in a dirt pile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, as I was psyched in loving this self tanner initially, it failed my ratings after the build up issue. So I gave it a 2 star rating.</li>
            <li> I love this tanning moisturizer! I was using the regular lotion, and was frustrated with how long it took both to put on and to dry. This is SO fast, and dries so quickly that my only complaint is that it sometimes dries TOO quickly. It works best right after I shower, so that the lotion doesn&#x27;t absorb before I&#x27;m finished rubbing it in. There is minimal smell at first and almost nothing once it dries. There is no lingering sticky feeling, only a light silky feel to my skin. My favorite part is how much longer it seems to last - the lotion wasn&#x27;t lasting a full 2 weeks for a bottle. I&#x27;ve been using the foaming moisturizer for a week now and it still feels full. The color is really natural - I can&#x27;t see any difference from the lotion. Love it!</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this natural glow foam. I have tried sooo many sunless tanners over the years, and I will never use anything but this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate the feel of any lotion on my skin. Even the lotions that say they dry quick don&#x27;t really dry. There is no worse feeling to me than putting on a pair of pants when there is ANY residue left on my legs. I have tried the jergen&#x27;s daily natural glow lotion and it was just way too sticky for me. Even a lot of sunless tanner aerosol sprays leave a stickiness. This foam is the first product I have used that REALLY does sink in. I put a little blob on one of my legs/arms/whatever, and rub it in until it&#x27;s dry---this literally takes less than 30 seconds. Then I move on to the next leg, do the same thing, and repeat the process until I&#x27;ve done my whole body. By the time I&#x27;m done (less than 5 minutes from the time I started) I feel totally dry. If you use way too much it leaves a slight stickiness, but still significantly less sticky than any lotion. Otherwise, as long as you don&#x27;t overdo it, it leaves no stickiness. My skin just feels soft and smooth, it doesn&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s any product on it. I still avoid getting dress for about 15 minutes just because I&#x27;m convinced my clothes will somehow cause streaks or unevenness...but I think that is just me being paranoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other great thing about this product is that it honestly doesn&#x27;t smell. I&#x27;ve found that other sunless tanners that claim they don&#x27;t smell, including the jergen&#x27;s natural glow lotion, do smell, and are way too strong for me to tolerate. When you first put this foam on you won&#x27;t smell anything. Within a few hours you will start to notice a bit of that characteristic sunless tanner smell. Some people think it smells like pancakes, I think it smells like cheez-its, either way, if you&#x27;ve used sunless tanner before you know exactly what I mean. That smell comes from the reaction of the sunless tanners with your skin. so unfortunately there is no sunless tanner that won&#x27;t produce that smell, unless it&#x27;s not working.  It&#x27;s annoying, but I certainly can&#x27;t blame jergen&#x27;s for that, since it&#x27;s not actually the product that smells. Even though you will eventually notice that smell, I find it to be a lot less strong/noticeable than other sunless tanners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tan very easily, but I also lose my tan quickly in the winter and get pretty pale. I think my skin would probably fall into the Light to Medium Skin tones, but I always like to use the darker option to get faster results. Within one use of using the foaming Natural Glow for Medium to Tan Skin I noticed a difference. Now I&#x27;m up to three uses and it&#x27;s enough of a difference for others to notice too.  So far the color looks really natural (more on the brown side than the gold/orange side) and I have no streaks or uneven patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> Works great! No streaks. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I am a natural redhead with pale skin.  Once or twice a week application is just enough to keep me from looking like a corpse.  It doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as the lotion but the tan from the lotion lasts longer.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite sunless tanners. It works pretty well and is decently priced. I have tried many others and this is in my top picks.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few self tanners that gives me a natural, lasting tan. I love the foam consistency, and it doesn&#x27;t have that overpowering, fake tan smell. It&#x27;s easy to apply and I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave streaks or splotches around knees or elbows. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a natural, easy to apply self tanner.</li>
            <li> Fast &amp; Easy to apply.  Dries immediately. Goes on foamy - like shaving cream. I never get streaks and it&#x27;s always very even.  I&#x27;m fair skinned but use the medium on my legs and get a tanned look fast.  Only negative is It lacks the emollient qualities of a cream.</li>
            <li> stinks like crap. Really bad the longer the DHA wears on but it works. It dries very fast, I use it every other day and people ask me all the time if I go to the tanning salon. Stinks but super effective</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and absolutely love it!  But the latest batch I bought here was expired so it won&#x27;t &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; like it&#x27;s supposed to.  The bottles have a code on them which I contacted the manufacturer about; they deciphered the code as being expired.  Too bad.  It&#x27;s usually a great product which has been discontinued and replaced with a highly perfumed version.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, very happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> Works great . It&#x27;s a smaller bottle than if store boughten though</li>
            <li> I gave this product 4 stars because it gets the job done just as well as the lotion and I LOVE the lotion.  I gave it only four stars instead of five because of the smell!  Ick.  I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the tanning lotion smells and the Jergens lotion does have a bit of a smell, but I grew used to that and don&#x27;t mind it at all anymore.  This stuff though has a hair spray smell (the sprayed on smell) that just doesn&#x27;t go away... and it gives me a horrible headache.  I definitely will stick to the lotion from now on.</li>
            <li> I have been using Natural Glow Foaming Daily Moisturizer for a while..I do not want to tan in the sun or in a suntan parlor due to the cancer concerns. I have found natural glow to work well if a lot of the product is applied. If only a small amount is applied such as on the face, there is really not a very visible difference in the \\&quot;glow\\&quot;. I will keep using the product for the usage as a foundation for makeup on my face and continue to use it on my legs and arms, since I wear shorts and short sleeved tops  most of the year as I live in a state that has a very warm climate. I suggest maybe a more darkening formula in the ingredients so it will work equally as well on whatever surface it is applied on the body and in a shorter period of time...I also feel a lot of the product is needed to achieve results desired..I will continue to use the product because it is non greasy and does offer a moisturizing element.</li>
            <li> I have used it a few times.  I&#x27;m going to wait a bit longer then continue to try it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite self tanner. Dries super fast with no sticky feeling and leaves a natural looking tan.. I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> It left me streaky :/ I think I like the lotion better, I feel like you can get it more even.</li>
            <li> A multitude of my nursing friends tipped me off to this lotion. Makes me look and feel good even in winter.</li>
            <li> the product that I expected did not perform. I can put it on my clean skin and there is no change in color, ever. I feel that I was ripped off and mislead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a few different self tanners over the years and this one was recommended by a coworker so I gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks like a mini hair mousse bottle and comes out just the same. I tried to use a little less than a ping pong ball size mousse dollop if i can get my finger off the trigger in time. The smell is not overly powerful and is pleasant. I rub my hands together and the white foam begins spreads over my palms. I close my eyes and rub it into my face. I get into my hairline, eyelids, ears, neck, back of my neck, and i rub it into the skin under my facial hair in case i want to shave off my sideburns and not have white stripes. If there is any left, I rub down my shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t see any color right away. You are left feeling slightly sticky but that literally lasts minutes. I put it on before i put my shirt on and by the time i&#x27;ve picked out a shirt, it&#x27;s dry. I&#x27;ve not had anything discolor from rubbing against anywhere I had applied the foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first used this over winter break and by the time i got back to work, people asked where I had gone. It was really amusing. I did notice one time at the gym that I was getting a little too dark for winter so I cut back. You do have to continually use the product every few days if you really want to maintain a deeper color; however, for a glow and keeping Casper away, sporadic use has been enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After past products leaving me scrounging with streaked body parts, I was really reluctant to put this on my face. Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised, I will definitely keep this on hand!</li>
            <li> Takes a bit of time to develop the tan and it easily becomes orange. When you stop using it it comes off unevenly, making it look like some sort of skin cancer. I use Fake Bake Flawless and during the summertime I use this the morning after Fake Bake to add a deeper color, or to stretch out my tan during the middle of the week. If you aren&#x27;t using it to enhance a better tanner product don&#x27;t use it...not worth the orange or the brown splotchy marks that last for weeks.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, after trying many, this one actually does not turn orange....it is a good brown skin tone.. it gets a little funny as it wears off.... but overall it&#x27;s great !!&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t pay for the big money stuff... it is no better !</li>
            <li> I chose this review because the product worked and it lasted much longer than I expected! I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a natural looking tan. In fact I have already recommended it to a few of my friends for an upcoming wedding!</li>
            <li> I happened to get this at a retail store, but plan to buy it from Amazon in the future. When I first tried this on my pale skin, it worked pretty well, but my skin looked kind of blotchy. On a regular visit to my dermatologist, I told him I was using this product. His advice was to be sure and exfoliate my skin first. So I bought a good exfoliating product and gloves, and scrubbed my skin well. Then after I applied this foaming tanning moisturizer, I was very pleased with the result. To me the smell is okay and it&#x27;s easy to apply the foam. I take care to distribute it evenly, then let it absorb and dry before getting dressed. I use it 2 or 3 times a week after a shower, and I&#x27;m happy with the resulting color. I&#x27;ve had quite a few skin cancers removed, after spending way too much time in the sun without sun block, when I was young and oblivious. I love this easy way to keep from looking too pale. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This product is priced right &amp; keeps my &amp;#34;farmer&#x27;s tan&amp;#34; glowing all summer. Blends in w/ some age-spotting damage I have on my arms, too.</li>
            <li> Broken cap, lost some foam during shipment, does not tan, product may be old.&lt;br /&gt;Ro</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected, don&#x27;t bother! You&#x27;d get a better bargain just going to Wal-Mart or Target.</li>
            <li> Seems fine on light skin that is lightly tanned. If you do not scrub your skin well it will create blotches that are darker than others area&#x27;s and be obvious. Goes on easy with decent smell.</li>
            <li> This self tanner is one of the best in the least expensive brands. It dries quickly and the look is natural and not orangey. I will be ordering again. Much cheaper than in the drug stores.</li>
            <li> Everything about this tanner is quite good. It absorbs quickly, and starts showing results in a few hours. I am fairly pale myself, so I used the one for medium skin tones just to set a result much faster. The only thing bad thing is the smell, which really isn&#x27;t that bad. The smell just has a faint chemical smell to it, but it doesn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
            <li> I had been using the Firming Natural Glow lotion for a long time as those bottles last forever if you aren&#x27;t tanning your entire body with it (I only really ever did my neck to even out my neck color with the rest of me). I enjoyed their lotion for that. I had run out recently and wanted to repurchase from this brand as it had served me well and had done what I wanted. I read reviews for this and decided to give this foaming one a try. It seemed interesting and I thought it would work something like St. Tropez mousse, though I&#x27;d never tried it. I can say that the two probably do not compare in any way! This product comes out as a white foam that can take a while to get used to using. I had trouble at first because I would squirt out some, it would puff up and become a giant ball of foam (usually more than I had wanted for that small area), and then I&#x27;d have to quickly spread it around more area than I needed. The foam does not squish down into a more lathery consistency like hair mousse does. It&#x27;s more of a \\&quot;harder, stay puffed as you&#x27;re trying to blend\\&quot; type of foam which is quite strange and makes using this a bit of a challenge compared to just their lotion for me. This gave me some streaks and obvious self tanner lines (you could see where I stopped the application). So that was mostly my fault. It gives a nice color overall. It&#x27;s not the most olive tone but it&#x27;s not orange either. I have a yellow/olive complexion and I feel this gives me a decent color match. Also, you can see the color developing within minutes or an hour after you put it on, which is nice. Now, the biggest cons for me would be that 1) it&#x27;s harder to blend than their lotion as you have less time to work this one in and make sure you faded it out nicely where the self tanner stops and 2) when this comes in contact with water after you apply it, the self tanner will come off in that section and leave you with a white spot! As I use this on my neck mostly and on my body, water gets in close proximity to my face when I wash it. I had looked at my neck in daylight the other day and I could just see how streaky the water had made it look! Water almost completely takes this self tanner off which is quite inconvenient for me. I accidentally splashed some on my stomach and have been going around with white spots in the middle of my now very tanned stomach for a few days. I imagine a lot of the self tanner comes off during a shower for this reason which can be a good or bad thing. For my use of this (areas that are around water such as arms and neck), this is a huge downside to this tanner. It gives you a deep color that actually lasts for quite a few days after just one application without having to touch it up (that is, unless you splash water on it before it fully develops). Now I enjoy this one because it eventually feels like it&#x27;s more dried than the lotion ever did which remained sticky the entire time it was on  you. This one does offer faster drying and less of a smell than the lotion. As long as you give it adequate amount to dry before getting to any water, this product should work fine. Unless my experiences with this foam become better in the future for some reason, I will stick to their lotion formulas instead of this. It was worth a try, but its biggest flaw I cannot get over. Their face lotion/tanner, however, does wonders, smells fantastic, and feels luxurious! From now I will most likely use their face lotion on my neck and this on my body where I need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I had applied it once more and was very careful with the water splashing and hand washing but it still ended up very patchy and obvious around my wrists where I had to wash my hands/palms after applying this. It gave me a very nice color the first day or day and a half (and I almost felt a bit bad for my extremely negative review) but then the following days, it just faded and developed poorly on me. I do not have a need to tan absolutely all of myself and tend to focus on areas--this is not the tanner for that. I tried to really blend it much better this time around my arms and wrists, but still ended up with obvious demarcation lines. The color faded on me streaky and patchy in certain areas. Because I wash my face usually at least 2 times a day, my neck had many streaks going down from water washing away the tanner over the course of washings. Because the main area of use for me of the self tanners is my neck, this is a big problem for me and made this not worth it. I suppose this just isn&#x27;t the product for me or perhaps I should have gotten the lighter color so these lines would be less obvious. I since returned this product (as I really doubted I would be drawn to use it continuously) and purchased the Revitalizing lotion. Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li> Love it! Best on the market!! I would never buy another brand. This is it for the money and quality.</li>
            <li> The mouse form of the tanner is fantastic. It cuts the amount you actually have to use, the time to apply it to your skin, and the speed that you can put clothes on. All around better. It&#x27;s especially great if you have hair on your chest like I do, because it doesn&#x27;t get caught up int he hair like a lotion does, but still penetrates better than a spray. It&#x27;s perfect and leave you with a tan as natural as the sun could give you.</li>
            <li> i really love this brand, because it tans well and does not have sunless smell, also it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Jergens is the best self tanner, in my opinion.  I am looking forward to buying the new version that is supposed to have no odor, although I don&#x27;t find the odor of this formula to be offensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but if you have light skin do not use it! You will look like you&#x27;ve been rolling in a doritos bag! It&#x27;s good for someone who already has a tan really....</li>
            <li> Such an easy at home solution for those averse to tanning beds and/or sunning.  Nice color; I know what I look like with a tan and that cannot be replicated, but this is the best cancer-free option.  I sometimes do a &#x27;threesome&#x27;:  I start with Tan Towels and rub myself down all over.  I follow-up with the Jergen&#x27;s Natural Glow in the darker tone (I&#x27;m blonde, green eyed, and lily white but remarkably tanned pretty dark back in the day), applied all over.  I finish with the Fake Bake, applied all over.  I use the FB last since it has the temporary bronzer.  I also should note that I use nitrile exam gloves to do all of my self-tanning, because no amount of any miracle product and scrubbing REALLY gets all that stuff off your palms.  As dark as I self-tan, it still isn&#x27;t visibly noticeable on my hands.  (Sun from driving?)  Anyway, my 1-2-3 approach gives me really, really, REALLY amazing results that last about a week without touch-ups.  But, most of the time, I&#x27;m just too lazy to spend all that time self-tanning, so I just use the Jergen&#x27;s because it is, by far, the best of them all as a stand-alone.</li>
            <li> I love the product.It gives me that natural tanned look and it is so easy to apply.Thank you for such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> This sunless tanner is almost foolproof. The foam means it&#x27;s dripless, and it&#x27;s hard to apply too much in one spot. The old odor you couldn&#x27;t get away from in the past isn&#x27;t there with Jergens. The tan builds as you apply the foam. I&#x27;ve even used it on my face and am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using self tanners for at least 5 years.  Always at night a few hours before bed because they stink!  It&#x27;s like a chore to tan 4 times a week but I&#x27;m so pale and pasty.  This is very easy to use no streaks.  I will say you have to use it at least two nights in a  row to notice a hint of color.  But after 3 nights of using this product you will have a great natural looking NO STREAK color.  I like to do two layers the first night,  and so on for the next two nights depending in the color I get from it.  Use right after shower.  Put lotion in elbows wrists and knees and feet.  Love my tan!</li>
            <li> I spent the last 2 weeks applying the foam and lotion twice a day and I say a little coloration but nothing drastic enough to call it a tan.</li>
            <li> Well I have to say I am impressed. I loved the tan I get from self tanners but not that \\&quot;tanner\\&quot; smell. And this tanner did not have that God awful smell. If you smell the foam itself you will smell a faint classic self tanner smell... but mixed into some yummy smells. And after it goes on, no smell at all!!! I have applied once. So... so far so good. Make sure to ware gloves or wash (more like scrub) your hands. Even tho I washed them 2X during application they are noticeably tanner then the rest of my body. I also used the Natural glow Firming lotion on my butt and tummy. No smell with that one at all. FX it does the firming trick too.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite of all the sunless tanning products out there.  Not too orange, and goes on really nicely.  Smelly but not horrid.  Make sure they ship you the correct &amp;#34;version&amp;#34; of this product though.  It comes in a couple of strengths -- I&#x27;m pretty fair-skinned and the &amp;#34;Medium to Tan&amp;#34; works great for me.  I feel that the &amp;#34;light to medium&amp;#34; stuff does almost nothing -- so why waste your money on it?  Anyway, yeah, the &amp;#34;Medium to Tan&amp;#34; Jergins is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Best self tanner around. Easy to apply and no orange skin.</li>
            <li> Went on so beautifully, but as it faded it peeled in areas looking like pregnancy stretch marks!  So sad, because initially a beautiful tan.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foam is very light and dries fast. There is a scent, but it is minimal and less offensive than other sunless tanner products. The color you get is a true natural glow. Never orange, never too dark. Recommended for those who want subtle color...use it 3 times a week, or even every day...it consistently gives you a nice glow year round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended for those who want a darker tan look. If you want to bump up the color once in a while when using Jergens foam, I&#x27;d recommend the medium shade Sun Laboratories lotion.</li>
            <li> Love this! Definitely getting this again. No streaks and I&#x27;ve tried MANY self tanners before. This stuff really works. Love the color it gives me!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for building natural color! Love the foam application. Does have a scent, but nothing overwhelming. I thoroughly have enjoyed.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this self tanner. It did not moisturize my skin at all, if anything it dried it out. I have the self tanning lotion from Jerkins and like it much better than the foam.</li>
            <li> great product, don&#x27;t hesitate</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of color and the tone of the color with just the first application. After my shower, I dried off, put on a light coat of Neutrogena sesame oil and then put on this foam. I had learned from previous experience that having oil on prior to application of ANY tanning product will help keep your feet, ankles, knees and elbows and hands from looking darker than your legs and arms and prevently streaking too. The foam goes on really easy and smooth anyway, but the oil assisted with making the color very even.  I seem to only need 1 application per week to keep a nice light glow so that my skin is not &amp;#34;winter white&amp;#34;, plus, I am not getting any harmful rays like I used to do when I was young. I ordered 2 more cans. Good price and great product.</li>
            <li> The product insists on &amp;#34;no sunless tanner odor&amp;#34;, and some of the other reviews seem to support that. But it&#x27;s not true! It does smell better than other tanning moisturizers I&#x27;ve used, but it definitely isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; smelling or even &amp;#34;odorless&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t understand why they don&#x27;t put in a good scent like floral or citrus or anything to mask the tanning smell..... Instead it just tries to be odorless but that doesn&#x27;t quite work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you can get past the faint smell, it really does leave a nice color! I usually put this on a couple hours before I&#x27;m planning to take a shower to avoid wearing the smell all day, and it still tans fine with my strategy.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Smell is minimal, doesn&#x27;t feel thick on your skin, works as it should. Be careful putting it on your knees, elbows, and ankles, and exfoliate often.</li>
            <li> This works well but takes a bit longer than the body mosturizer. It also has a stronger smell. I combined it with the Jergens Natural Glow Express Body Moisturizer for Medium to Tan Skin as another reviewer suggested and it works well. Great for a quick fix on a tan. Remember to apply evenly and wash hands thoroughly</li>
            <li> This item does what it says. It dries fast. It goes on fully covering without the mess. It also left my skin soft.  I haven&#x27; t used long enough to notice a tan but I will update later.</li>
