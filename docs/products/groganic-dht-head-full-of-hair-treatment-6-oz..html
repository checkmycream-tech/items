            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to use Mineral Oil/Petroleum, full strength on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Head full of hair?</li>
            <li>The product did come quickly, so that was a plus.</li>
            <li>; it was just thin &amp; I experienced a lot of shedding, so I cut it to my shoulders to even it out &amp; have healthy ends, etc...  </li>
            <li>This stuff works really well on my granddaughter head keeps her hair nice and soft</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering some more.</li>
            <li>I love all their products if only I could be confident enough to take a picture but my hair grew a lot</li>
            <li>I have tried this it does  exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>Helps with hair growth Good for wraps and just everyday use.</li>
            <li>I first purchased this product, because I&#x27;ve experienced hair loss (smooth bald spot) in my crown area due to a too tight hairstyle.</li>
            <li>right because 2 years later my edges have filled in on both sides of my head.</li>
            <li>This really works, I bought it after using keranique and that made my hair fall out.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Groganics!</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>I hasn&#x27;t really work as yet</li>
            <li>and it was much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I use this on my scalp every other day and it has a very clean smell.</li>
            <li>Is it the many questionable reviews that say they LOVE IT?</li>
            <li>hair still grows at normal speed</li>
            <li>My hair is STRONGER, thicker, fuller, &amp; I have a lot of new growth ( I haven&#x27;t measured yet, I&#x27;m going to wait about 2 months).  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;freeze\\&quot; shampoos &amp; conditioner also works wonders &amp; leaves your hair SOFT!  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>A year or so later, you cannot even notice that I had a bald spot and my hair is MUCH thicker and healthier.</li>
            <li>So far On the Spot, The Conditioner, and Growing wild seems to b growing</li>
            <li>With each family photo or book club picture moment I would sing this old song \\&quot;Patches\\&quot; by blues singer Clarence Carter, because that is what I saw staring back at me.</li>
            <li>but when I look at my mothers family many of the woman have thin hair and their edges are even thinner.</li>
            <li>The only con is that if you use too much, your hair will become oily and weighed down.</li>

            <li> Well, long story short.</li>
            <li> and it is actually damaging my hair giving it a fried appearance and making my long hair break at the root.</li>
            <li> They product I use now actually makes my had too dry.</li>
            <li> My hair definitely does not shed like it was; regular shedding &amp; not much at all!  </li>
            <li> The order actually came faster then expected.</li>
            <li> I see improvement and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, definitely recommended fro daily usage, would probably buy again</li>
            <li> I felt like I needed the topical hair dress while on other days the spray or gel would do.</li>
            <li> I have tried several other products to regrow the hair loss on my hairline areas,</li>
            <li> But it was the opposite it made my hair fall out even when mixing it with the other groganicproducts.</li>
            <li> Made my hair dry and brittle..</li>
            <li> I thought it might be my work hat since I wear it all the time, and then wear hats on my off time, but from what I read, that doesn&#x27;t make you loose hair.</li>
            <li> I now have a few baby locs on the left and right.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You have to use it regularly for a few months, but it does work.</li>
            <li> I recently in may found out that my vitamin D level was 18 and It really had my middle to the front of my hair which fell our really bad</li>
            <li> Regardless, I got this and a couple of other hair products, and my hair stopped falling out drastically.</li>
            <li> tried the other product and my hair stopped falling out again.</li>
            <li> and I only use a small amount.  </li>
            <li> and she is using mine and in less than a month there is improvement in her hair and edges.my hair is thicker than before and is regaining its length</li>
            <li> used one of the products everyday, somedays</li>
            <li> It also makes your hair heavy when working with it</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added a small amount of this to my moisturizer/growth aide.  </li>
            <li> in my usual concoction.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for the past year and it works for me.  </li>
            <li> I really would like my money back very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very few stores carry this product, so when I found it online</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had thick hair and this product has made it even thicker.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of walking around with these bald spots.</li>
            <li> No more Patches!!!</li>
            <li> I hope i&#x27;m wrong, but there must be some &amp;#34;capes&amp;#34; posting for this damn company.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It actually bothered me a lot of how nasty my hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;i read about this crap on one of the banners.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s my signal to not go &amp;#34;full board&amp;#34; with this crap.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This really works, I bought it after using keranique and that made my hair fall out. This is growing it back.</li>
            <li> I have been using for a month now and it smells nice and makes my hair soft but i havent noticed any growth..hair still grows at normal speed but i will continue to use because it makes my hair feel nice</li>
            <li> I have been using the entire Groganics hair system for about 3 weeks &amp; I&#x27;m amazed!  My hair definitely does not shed like it was; regular shedding &amp; not much at all!  My hair is STRONGER, thicker, fuller, &amp; I have a lot of new growth ( I haven&#x27;t measured yet, I&#x27;m going to wait about 2 months).  The \\&quot;freeze\\&quot; shampoos &amp; conditioner also works wonders &amp; leaves your hair SOFT!  Using the Groganics system on a DAILY BASIS produces the BEST RESULTS!  I wash &amp; deep condition my hair twice a week as some of the daily hair products are a bit oily, however they do show RESULTS!  I also use the vitamins, but I only take one a day as my hair does grow rapidly; it was just thin &amp; I experienced a lot of shedding, so I cut it to my shoulders to even it out &amp; have healthy ends, etc...  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Groganics!</li>
            <li> I use this on my scalp every other day and it has a very clean smell. I use it with the Featherlite conditioner and the growthick shampoo.</li>
            <li> Ive used this product for a month and can see a difference in the amount of scalp showing at the crown and front hairline. This really works. Ive tried EVERY product on the market and this is giving me the best results. :)</li>
            <li> This  suffer  work  thank you</li>
            <li> When I use it I notice that I get a headache I hasn&#x27;t really work as yet I recently in may found out that my vitamin D level was 18 and It really had my middle to the front of my hair which fell our really bad and I have been taking the supplements it&#x27;s been helping with my symptoms but the hair part I have been struggling with</li>
            <li> This product smells and feels good, and doesnt leave a greasy or oily buildup on the scalp or hair, so far I love it.</li>
            <li> Great herbal aroma and moist feeling.my cousin had problems with her edges and she is using mine and in less than a month there is improvement in her hair and edges.my hair is thicker than before and is regaining its length</li>
            <li> I Love this product. Leaves hair soft and manageable. Helps with hair growth Good for wraps and just everyday use. Strengthens  and leaves hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li> love the product line</li>
            <li> I hope i&#x27;m wrong, but there must be some &amp;#34;capes&amp;#34; posting for this damn company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i read about this crap on one of the banners.  Tried looking up the ingredients and could not find them for the life of me.  But their description: Exotic berries/fruit/nuts from Brazil and Australia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, here&#x27;s the ingredients list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water: That must come from Australia&lt;br /&gt;Mineral Oil: That too, must come from Australia&lt;br /&gt;Olive Oil: Oh, THAT&#x27;S what the BRAZILIANS use.. who knew??&lt;br /&gt;Petroleum:  okay... Brazil/Australia, local diesel engine&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin E: That gets a pass&lt;br /&gt;Propylene Glycol: Nice food additive for livestock (now we&#x27;re talkin&#x27;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stearic Acid, Lanolin, Saw Palmetto (The DHT blocker #9 on the ingredients list), Cammomile extract, oat extract, and fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added a small amount of this to my moisturizer/growth aide.  I didn&#x27;t want to use Mineral Oil/Petroleum, full strength on my hair.  Thus, 1 or 2 TBSP. in my usual concoction.  Woke up this morning with a zit on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Ouch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s my signal to not go &amp;#34;full board&amp;#34; with this crap.</li>
            <li> Head full of hair is amazing hair cream. I enjoy the results from this hair treatment.</li>
            <li> this product didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well on my granddaughter head keeps her hair nice and soft</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  It&#x27;s been about a month and it&#x27;s working,</li>
            <li> For years I have had thinning edges, then oneday while in my local beauty supply store I brought this product along with the Spray and topical treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used one of the products everyday, somedays I felt like I needed the topical hair dress while on other days the spray or gel would do. I guess I did something right because 2 years later my edges have filled in on both sides of my head. I now have a few baby locs on the left and right.&lt;br /&gt;I have had locs since 2001, but prior to locs I had a perm. I use to think the perms damaged my hair but when I look at my mothers family many of the woman have thin hair and their edges are even thinner. I was tired of walking around with these bald spots. With each family photo or book club picture moment I would sing this old song \\&quot;Patches\\&quot; by blues singer Clarence Carter, because that is what I saw staring back at me. But now all of that is gone, I have hair growing and flowing at my edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if this product works alone or was helped by my diet and exercise,but it has made me a happier person and I like what I see when I take pictures. No more Patches!!!</li>
            <li> I first purchased this product, because I&#x27;ve experienced hair loss (smooth bald spot) in my crown area due to a too tight hairstyle. Within a couple of days of using this cream, I noticed stubble. A year or so later, you cannot even notice that I had a bald spot and my hair is MUCH thicker and healthier. The only con is that if you use too much, your hair will become oily and weighed down.</li>
            <li> I DON&#x27;T LIKE CREAM DRESSINGS ON MY HEAD. SO, I ORDERED THE GRO-N-WILD. LOVE IT. MAKES MY HEAD TIGGLE.I NOTICED MY HAIR ISN&#x27;T BREAKING OFF LIKE IT WAS. WILL CONTINUE TO USE ALL THE PRODUCTS TO SEE IF THIS HELPS MY ALOPECIA.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a month now, have not seen any change.</li>
            <li> Well, long story short. I started loosing a lot of hair in the shower. I thought it might be my work hat since I wear it all the time, and then wear hats on my off time, but from what I read, that doesn&#x27;t make you loose hair. Regardless, I got this and a couple of other hair products, and my hair stopped falling out drastically. I decided to use this product only, since it was cheaper, and I thought it was working. Well, my hair started falling out again in a couple of weeks. I&#x27;m decided to stop using it since it was so freaking greasy. It actually bothered me a lot of how nasty my hair felt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the other product and my hair stopped falling out again. I guess I found out that it was it all along. If you don&#x27;t mind a greasy head, you could try this out, and it might work. Everyone is different. But I guess you&#x27;ll have some sort of side affect using anything. They product I use now actually makes my had too dry. Go figure.</li>
            <li> Made my hair dry and brittle..There was no improvement in my hair condition. I really would like my money back very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for the past year and it works for me.  I&#x27;ve always had thick hair and this product has made it even thicker.  Very few stores carry this product, so when I found it online I was happy  and it was much cheaper.  I will definitely be ordering some more.</li>
            <li> I love all their products if only I could be confident enough to take a picture but my hair grew a lot</li>
            <li> This product is super great a true miracle have been using it for over a month beautiful result I recommend it to my sister she is in love with it</li>
            <li> I read all the good reviews and bought the product have used it for about two weeks and it is actually damaging my hair giving it a fried appearance and making my long hair break at the root.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product but I haven&#x27;t saw any results. I&#x27;m still hopeful. Stay tuned for an update!!!</li>
            <li> Soothers your head like tiny massages.</li>
            <li> Has done Nothing at all. Head full of hair? hmmm. Whay do I keep falling for these things? Is it the many questionable reviews that say they LOVE IT? When I look at them, seems like this is all they&#x27;ve loved, ever!&lt;br /&gt;Come on people.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really great product.. You have to use it regularly for a few months, but it does work. I have tried several other products to regrow the hair loss on my hairline areas, nothing else worked. I used this product and initially I didn&#x27;t see anything, but after a while I started to see fuzz growing in to those areas, and it still growing. The order actually came faster then expected. Will reorder from this seller again for this product.</li>
            <li> i read the reviews i was excited it feels good to the head. But it was the opposite it made my hair fall out even when mixing it with the other groganicproducts. So far On the Spot, The Conditioner, and Growing wild seems to b growing it make it strong. But yet to use shampoo, and Scalp treatment will tell u view soon.</li>
            <li> I have tried this it does  exactly what it says. It works</li>
            <li> I see improvement and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, definitely recommended fro daily usage, would probably buy again&lt;br /&gt;dd</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen &amp;#34;fuller hair&amp;#34; with this product.  It also makes your hair heavy when working with it and I only use a small amount.  The product did come quickly, so that was a plus.</li>
