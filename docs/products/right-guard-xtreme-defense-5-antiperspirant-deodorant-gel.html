            <li>brand and type is perfect for me and my body chemistry.</li>
            <li>My sensitivity to smells and this one&#x27;s perfectly muted, but</li>

            <li>Great scent.</li>
            <li>Right Guard makes the best deodorant and in my and my girlfriends opinion this is the best scent.  </li>
            <li>If you want deodorant or antiperspirant that blocks off odor and sweat AND doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes, by all means do NOT buy this antiperspirant or any kind of deodorant or antiperspirant that has aluminum compounds!</li>

            <li>Great product and am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>He was very glad he got 6 at one time.</li>
            <li>My favorite deodorant in a convenient six pack!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>no complaints of any kind.  </li>
            <li>&amp; i&#x27;m loving it...</li>
            <li>This is the best antiperspirant I have tried by far.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s THAT STRONG!</li>
            <li>Love the scent,</li>
            <li>Buy in bulk to get a better price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it does that</li>
            <li>My favorite antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>and I wish amazon would do more to protect their costumers from getting ripped off by these companies.</li>
            <li>my husbands favorite deodorant</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the 15% more as they discribe in the description.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and great price</li>
            <li>My favorite deodorant/anti perspirant</li>
            <li>I have never had a deodorant do that for me, since I sweat a LOT and most deodorants wash away on me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice light &amp; clean scent.</li>
            <li>but what you don&#x27;t know until you put it on, it EXTREMELY STRONG perfumed scent.</li>
            <li>Look for something, either online by researching or at a pharmacy store, that&#x27;s aluminum free.</li>
            <li>Very economical, but really...it&#x27;ll be years before I need deodorant again.</li>
            <li>i love this deodorant my arm pits never smelt better, thanks right guard!</li>
            <li>Best deodorant, hands down!!!</li>
            <li>Not so with this one, which lasts long and has a pleasant muted odor.  </li>
            <li>Do not just buy any kind of deodorant or antiperspirant at any pharmacy store without reading the active ingredients and just because it&#x27;s more convenient.</li>
            <li>I had used this deodorant (when the active ingredient was Aluminum Zirconium Pentachlorohydrex GLY 17.6% - like the one in the picture which had &amp;#34;Official Deodorant of the NBA&amp;#34; on the cap) with great success.</li>
            <li>It smells good, keeps me reasonably dry, does not itch, etc.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good value package of deodorant this is a decent deal, though if you are looking for the cooling action of some of the right guard line of products, these don&#x27;t have it.</li>
            <li>Despite the &amp;#34;72 hour&amp;#34; protection, it&#x27;s actually a much more mild formula than most other rightguards I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>And most important, it keeps odor under control all day, and even into the next day!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not exactly sweating or doing anything to test how good this product works.  </li>
            <li>JUST RIGHT IF YOU LIKE THIS BRAND.</li>
            <li>This is key, because I find most to be far too strong.  </li>
            <li>Will recommend to anyone interested in this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for year, never fails.  </li>
            <li>this is my first time using it</li>
            <li>Just be aware that this is the gel, not the stick</li>
            <li>I have been using this exact deodorant for years.</li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t be able to detect the slightest hint of body odor until even the following day if I didn&#x27;t shower on a given day.</li>
            <li>Many different brands and many different kinds in those brands.</li>
            <li>It is nice to be able to order several at a time, without the need to waste time at the grocery store.</li>
            <li>The scent is not as strong as the same ones I purchase in the store.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll need to use soap and a washcloth and really scrub.  </li>
            <li>i will buy again thanks</li>
            <li>Product is pretty good, although not necessarily as good as what I&#x27;ve found in the store.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product, but be careful about color transfer.</li>
            <li>Each had a flaw such as gels creating an hard spot on clothing, most solids showing white on clothing, or just not giving good protection</li>
            <li>With this, you turn the knob to the amount you want, but if you apply even the slightly pressure to the dispenser, it squeezes more out.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this..</li>
            <li>This new formula is nothing like the old, in my experience.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it to stay dry.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive with deodorants.</li>
            <li>After an intense workout, you might need to reapply, but even then you&#x27;re not necessarily smelling of BO,</li>
            <li>only complaint I have is that, like many deodorants, this one leaves some white/yellowish marks in the pits of your shirts.  </li>
            <li>three random girls tell me I smell really good when the only thing I had on was this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll get back to that action when I run out of my 6 pack</li>
            <li>Goes on pretty dry and lasts all day long (4am-10pm).</li>
            <li>It is a shame, because I really like the &amp;#34;Arctic Refresh&amp;#34; scent, but am now on the search for another deodorant with Aluminum Zirconium Pentachlorohydrex GLY as the active ingredient.</li>
            <li>Regularly washing your laundry keeps it under control, of course, but there are a few shirts I only wash rarely</li>
            <li>It leaves a STRONG lady perfume smell behind.</li>
            <li>and I know there are plenty of sham prices on certain goods</li>
            <li>However, now they have changed the formula - the new active ingredient is Aluminum Zirconium Trichlorohydrex GLY 16.0%.</li>

            <li> It last&#x27;s all day long.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that keeps us dry.  </li>
            <li> Goes on well, smells good, lasts a while, but the stupid stuff comes out at the bottom where you spin the stick lengthener.  </li>
            <li> my underarms feel dry &amp; odourless..</li>
            <li> I never had a single Speed Stick scent I didn&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li> I always stayed very dry</li>
            <li> , then turn the knob a little for the next time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really not much to say about this.  </li>
            <li> I showered and put it on, not realizing they had changed the active ingredient in the formula, and went to dance class for an hour.</li>
            <li> Needs to be slightly thicker</li>
            <li> just a slightly odd</li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s just a minor complaint though.  </li>
            <li> How are people dumb enough to fall for that?</li>
            <li> , none were damaged or missing caps..  </li>
            <li> For the past 20 years I have used Speed Stick Gel</li>
            <li> No more pit stains and no looking like a junkie.</li>
            <li> I feel sorry for anyone who actually pays this 40 dollar price tag..</li>
            <li> with the wrong deodorant, I either sweat too much with the wrong one, or it itches like hell, or burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is strong and awful.  </li>
            <li> Now I just squeeze it hard to get then</li>
            <li> Sadly it is getting much harder to find in stores</li>
            <li> no more stinky me !!  </li>
            <li> It can be difficult to wash off in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I hate this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never find out as I&#x27;m never buying this crap again.</li>
            <li> The dispenser is an awful design.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received several compliments from females on the smell of this deodorant.  It smells good and I don&#x27;t have any issues with perspiration.  It does not irritate me either.  I see no flaws. Therefore, I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars.  I recommend this deodorant, along with another.  (You should switch it up, so that your body doesn&#x27;t get adjusted)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a couple a years and recently I began to notice that this stuff has actually been staining my clothes! I&#x27;ve been doing some research now and found that aluminum-compound based antiperspirants actually does not react well with sweat and will actually end up staining your clothes! Here is my advice. If you want deodorant or antiperspirant that blocks off odor and sweat AND doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes, by all means do NOT buy this antiperspirant or any kind of deodorant or antiperspirant that has aluminum compounds! Look for something, either online by researching or at a pharmacy store, that&#x27;s aluminum free. Do not just buy any kind of deodorant or antiperspirant at any pharmacy store without reading the active ingredients and just because it&#x27;s more convenient.</li>
            <li> Really not much to say about this.  Love the scent, no complaints of any kind.  Lasts all day and then some.</li>
            <li> Nice light &amp; clean scent. So far I haven&#x27;t noticed any white residue on my dark shirts. Goes on pretty dry and lasts all day long (4am-10pm).</li>
            <li> I am sensitive with deodorants. with the wrong deodorant, I either sweat too much with the wrong one, or it itches like hell, or burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brand and type is perfect for me and my body chemistry. It smells good, keeps me reasonably dry, does not itch, etc. Good product for me.</li>
            <li> For the past 20 years I have used Speed Stick Gel 24/7 Antiperspirant.  Sadly it is getting much harder to find in stores so I picked this up as an alternative to try (and keep as a backup when I get my Speed Stick).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The smell is strong and awful.  I never had a single Speed Stick scent I didn&#x27;t like.  I hate this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;- The gel is too gooey.  Needs to be slightly thicker&lt;br /&gt;- The dispenser is an awful design.  With my Speed Stick, I simply click up the amount I want and apply.  With this, you turn the knob to the amount you want, but if you apply even the slightly pressure to the dispenser, it squeezes more out.  Now I just squeeze it hard to get then amount I want, then turn the knob a little for the next time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s winter so I&#x27;m not exactly sweating or doing anything to test how good this product works.  I&#x27;ll never find out as I&#x27;m never buying this crap again.</li>
            <li> Goes on well, smells good, lasts a while, but the stupid stuff comes out at the bottom where you spin the stick lengthener.  Not something you want on your fingers every time you use it.</li>
            <li> JUST RIGHT IF YOU LIKE THIS BRAND. SAME STUFF AS THE STORE AND YOU WONT RUN OUT FOR QUITE A WHILE.</li>
            <li> This product should not be called a deodorant but an odorant! It leaves a STRONG lady perfume smell behind. It had to re-showers to get the odor off of me. I had to wash my undershirt two times to remove the smell. If you don&#x27;t want to smell, don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> Right Guard makes the best deodorant and in my and my girlfriends opinion this is the best scent.  I have had three random girls tell me I smell really good when the only thing I had on was this deodorant.  AAA+++</li>
            <li> Great product and am completely satisfied. No issues whatsoever. Will recommend to anyone interested in this product. Will do business again with.</li>
            <li> The Power Stripe stains my white undershirts blue!!! Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product, but be careful about color transfer.</li>
            <li> Im a fat, double-chinned sweater and this stuff is great.  No more pit stains and no looking like a junkie.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for year, never fails.  Buy in bulk to get a better price.  This way if the world ends you should have extra.</li>
            <li> I bought this since it was on sale and it&#x27;s promises 72 hr protection. I&#x27;m sure it does that but what you don&#x27;t know until you put it on, it EXTREMELY STRONG perfumed scent. I can&#x27;t help thinking everyone is looking at me it&#x27;s THAT STRONG!</li>
            <li> My favorite antiperspirant.  Despite the &amp;#34;72 hour&amp;#34; protection, it&#x27;s actually a much more mild formula than most other rightguards I&#x27;ve tried.  This is key, because I find most to be far too strong.  They tend to irritate my nose throughout the day.  Not so with this one, which lasts long and has a pleasant muted odor.  After an intense workout, you might need to reapply, but even then you&#x27;re not necessarily smelling of BO, just a slightly odd scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that, like many deodorants, this one leaves some white/yellowish marks in the pits of your shirts.  Regularly washing your laundry keeps it under control, of course, but there are a few shirts I only wash rarely and I have to expedite them to get the stains out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s just a minor complaint though.  My sensitivity to smells and this one&#x27;s perfectly muted, but containing scent makes it the only one for me!</li>
            <li> Best deodorant, hands down!!!</li>
            <li> no more stinky me !!  A great price for 6 of these.. they come sealed in plastic, none were damaged or missing caps..  highly recommend this..</li>
            <li> Yay, Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this deodorant.  I can&#x27;t find this stuff in stores, so I bought the 5-pack.  Very economical, but really...it&#x27;ll be years before I need deodorant again.</li>
            <li> Just like being in the Arctic, I guess.</li>
            <li> Share this bulk buy with my 17 YO son and we both like this type of stick.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant ever,  period!</li>
            <li> i love this deodorant my arm pits never smelt better, thanks right guard! last all day too.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a good value package of deodorant this is a decent deal, though if you are looking for the cooling action of some of the right guard line of products, these don&#x27;t have it. I guess I&#x27;ll get back to that action when I run out of my 6 pack</li>
            <li> this is my first time using it &amp; i&#x27;m loving it...my underarms feel dry &amp; odourless..i feel good all day...</li>
            <li> Product is pretty good, although not necessarily as good as what I&#x27;ve found in the store. Just be aware that this is the gel, not the stick</li>
            <li> I have no idea why anyone would pay $40 for a 6 pack. If you go to any Walmart (including online) a 2 pack is $5.97. Buy 3 of those and there&#x27;s your 6 pack, but for only $17.76. And if you order online its like 5 bucks for shipping which still only brings the total to just about $23 which is still almost a $20 saving from this Amazon price. I shop Amazon a lot and I know there are plenty of sham prices on certain goods and I wish amazon would do more to protect their costumers from getting ripped off by these companies. I feel sorry for anyone who actually pays this 40 dollar price tag.. It seems to me someone just went to Walmart and bought the twin packs and then sold them on amazon for a 100% mark-up. How are people dumb enough to fall for that?</li>
            <li> my husbands favorite deodorant</li>
            <li> All the men in my family have issues with sweaty arm pits.  This is the only product that keeps us dry.  It works great and smells good. It can be difficult to wash off in the shower.  You&#x27;ll need to use soap and a washcloth and really scrub.  It&#x27;s worth it to stay dry.</li>
            <li> The scent is not as strong as the same ones I purchase in the store.</li>
            <li> Bought for my son can not find this brand and smeel in the stores. Cheaper buying in here than in the stores. He was very glad he got 6 at one time.</li>
            <li> This is the best antiperspirant I have tried by far. It last&#x27;s all day long. One will last for about a month.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the 15% more as they discribe in the description. Is good essence i will buy again thanks</li>
            <li> I have been using this exact deodorant for years. It is nice to be able to order several at a time, without the need to waste time at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these 4 years ago. It&#x27;s the only that can &amp;#34;hold me&amp;#34; while practicing sports. My team mates are grateful xD</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great price</li>
            <li> My favorite deodorant in a convenient six pack! I love it! Also quite a bit cheaper than buying it by the stick at the store. 10/10 Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I had used this deodorant (when the active ingredient was Aluminum Zirconium Pentachlorohydrex GLY 17.6% - like the one in the picture which had &amp;#34;Official Deodorant of the NBA&amp;#34; on the cap) with great success. I always stayed very dry and I wouldn&#x27;t be able to detect the slightest hint of body odor until even the following day if I didn&#x27;t shower on a given day. However, now they have changed the formula - the new active ingredient is Aluminum Zirconium Trichlorohydrex GLY 16.0%. I showered and put it on, not realizing they had changed the active ingredient in the formula, and went to dance class for an hour. When leaving class, I could already smell myself. This new formula is nothing like the old, in my experience. It is a shame, because I really like the &amp;#34;Arctic Refresh&amp;#34; scent, but am now on the search for another deodorant with Aluminum Zirconium Pentachlorohydrex GLY as the active ingredient.</li>
            <li> My favorite deodorant/anti perspirant</li>
            <li> And I have tried a lot! Many different brands and many different kinds in those brands. Each had a flaw such as gels creating an hard spot on clothing, most solids showing white on clothing, or just not giving good protection all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this has proven to work splendidly for me. No white residue on clothing. Great scent. And most important, it keeps odor under control all day, and even into the next day! I have never had a deodorant do that for me, since I sweat a LOT and most deodorants wash away on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have subscribed and saved, as this will be my deodorant from now on.</li>
