            <li>Love the product and shipping was great!!</li>
            <li>Good perfume, best value is the 1.7 ounce bottle :-)</li>
            <li>good perfume</li>
            <li>Good stuff, my lady loved it.</li>
            <li>She loved it.</li>
            <li>I have loved and used this scent for almost 4 years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this product for my daughter for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Her husband liked her using the product, smells good.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume!</li>
            <li>The perfume is very good, price was pretty good too.  </li>
            <li>but I never smell it on her lol its so light</li>
            <li>I liked the scent of it.</li>
            <li>I liked Code when I was at the department store, and I liked the samples I took home.</li>
            <li>It was a nice understated musky but feminine scent.</li>
            <li>the smell isn&#x27;t very strong</li>
            <li>or it&#x27;s just an amazing scent :)</li>
            <li>I ordered it because it was her favorite</li>
            <li>It is a great smell and very seductive.</li>
            <li>I think when I get some more money I&#x27;m going to buy some more.</li>
            <li>I have two people in mind who would love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>because usuallyI pay alot more at a department store.</li>
            <li>I have purchased it many, many times.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the box appeared to be fine, though.</li>
            <li>perhaps this was sold by someone in the reselling industry, but they could have done a better job at not scaring their customers right off the bat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did because it is my new favourite scent!  </li>
            <li>would recommend it again to anyone needing a great perfume that subltle and not  overwhelming.</li>
            <li>so i emailed amazon to make sure that if there were any problems, it would be recognized and taken care of and they assured me that there would be no problems with returns for a matter such as this.     </li>
            <li>This is the first time that&#x27;s ever happened.  </li>
            <li>Current price seems more reasonable.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it as much as I thought, its pretty strong initially but airs out as the day progresses...</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>buy this through Amazon for very rapid and dependable delivery</li>
            <li>By all account this product was well received by Wendy and was also appreciated as a gift.</li>
            <li>i was interested in buying this, so i went to my usual department store and it was not in and as i have had very good experiences with amazon, as well as the fact they are usually quite fast with shipping, i decided to order here.</li>
            <li>and I was sent another bottle which is maybe a little better.</li>
            <li>The bottle was new and in a nex box.</li>
            <li>I wonder if the scent gets damaged in transit due to the very hot weather?</li>
            <li>/&gt;a very elite lasting odor.</li>

            <li> (the only thing i would have wanted to know was the actual seller since this probably wasnt armani at the point of sale, just so i could ask the questions i was curious about)</li>
            <li> I loooove this perfume and get compliments every single time I wear it...</li>
            <li> i am thankful, though, that it did seem to be the actual product and that the quality was that of the department store that i typically shop at.</li>
            <li> i immediately became frustrated because it was uneven and didn&#x27;t seem to even stick to itself and kind of just fell off.</li>
            <li> I was getting tired of my normal perfumes, saw this and decided to take a chance.  </li>
            <li> 5 stars, if you have any other suggestions email me please.</li>
            <li> When I asked around, I learned the scent was soft and delicate... immediate purchase!</li>
            <li> but I mean you get what you pay for from the size to how long it lasts</li>
            <li> Just a little pricier.</li>
            <li> It smells terrific, but I wonder if I have a bad batch because the scent does not last an hour.  </li>
            <li> A Christmas gift for my wife, I don&#x27;t usually pick clothes or a perfume that she&#x27;s not familiar with, but she loves it !</li>
            <li> i am still not sure why the wrap was the way it was, but the box, bottle, scent &amp; quality seemed to be on-point.</li>
            <li> Men seem to be standing closer than usual.</li>
            <li> The box is fake too.</li>

            <li> This was a gift for my mother. I ordered it because it was her favorite and she could not find it anymore. Came as advertised and she was happy with gift. Shipped fast. Recommend</li>
            <li> I learned of this product when it appeared on a Christmas wish list for my niece. When I asked around, I learned the scent was soft and delicate... immediate purchase!</li>
            <li> The perfume is very good, price was pretty good too.  Was delivered on time.</li>
            <li> i was interested in buying this, so i went to my usual department store and it was not in and as i have had very good experiences with amazon, as well as the fact they are usually quite fast with shipping, i decided to order here. i had heard horror stories about products like this not coming from a legitimate retailer &amp; i was concerned about the fact that i was ordering perfume online so i emailed amazon to make sure that if there were any problems, it would be recognized and taken care of and they assured me that there would be no problems with returns for a matter such as this.     when i received the package, i opened it to find that the shrink wrap was not that of a department store. i immediately became frustrated because it was uneven and didn&#x27;t seem to even stick to itself and kind of just fell off. the box appeared to be fine, though. i even looked online at images of what the box and bottle were supposed to look like and checked all the labels to make sure it was made by armani and it did not appear to be a fake.     i am still not sure why the wrap was the way it was, but the box, bottle, scent &amp; quality seemed to be on-point. perhaps this was sold by someone in the reselling industry, but they could have done a better job at not scaring their customers right off the bat. i am thankful, though, that it did seem to be the actual product and that the quality was that of the department store that i typically shop at. (the only thing i would have wanted to know was the actual seller since this probably wasnt armani at the point of sale, just so i could ask the questions i was curious about)</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product for my daughter for Christmas. It was a great price.</li>
            <li> I received a gift set that included eau de parfum, shower gel and body lotion.  It smells terrific, but I wonder if I have a bad batch because the scent does not last an hour.  This is the first time that&#x27;s ever happened.  I even tried showering with the gel, applied the body lotion and finished with the parfum.  In two hours I couldn&#x27;t smell it at all.  I am going to try a tester from my local department store and see if that lasts.  If so I&#x27;ll know it was a fluke.</li>
            <li> I was getting tired of my normal perfumes, saw this and decided to take a chance.  I&#x27;m so glad I did because it is my new favourite scent!  I get compliments daily on it!  Smells great, great price</li>
            <li> good perfume but I mean you get what you pay for from the size to how long it lasts the smell isn&#x27;t very strong I bought it for my girlfriend and she says she wears it all the time but I never smell it on her lol its so light</li>
            <li> Good stuff, my lady loved it. Good perfume, best value is the 1.7 ounce bottle :-) 5 stars, if you have any other suggestions email me please.</li>
            <li> I loooove this perfume and get compliments every single time I wear it...they all ask \\&quot;what are you wearing\\&quot;?? It must go well with my body chemistry or it&#x27;s just an amazing scent :) Buy it!!</li>
            <li> Got it for my sister in law.     She loved it. My brother has the men&#x27;s version so it went well to match in.     I liked the scent of it. Just a little pricier. I think I bought it at $60 a while ago. Current price seems more reasonable.</li>
            <li> A Christmas gift for my wife, I don&#x27;t usually pick clothes or a perfume that she&#x27;s not familiar with, but she loves it !</li>
            <li> I liked Code when I was at the department store, and I liked the samples I took home. It was a nice understated musky but feminine scent. When I ordered it online, it smelled different--too musky without the femininity. I wrote to Amazon and I was sent another bottle which is maybe a little better. I wonder if the scent gets damaged in transit due to the very hot weather?</li>
            <li> Men seem to be standing closer than usual. It is a great smell and very seductive.</li>
            <li> Everything went great...Love the product and shipping was great!! Would do it this way again.</li>
            <li> I have loved and used this scent for almost 4 years.&lt;br /&gt; It is so GREAT! AND MANY COMPLIMENTS!&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to purchase and DEFINATLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
            <li> This perfume is awesome. I think when I get some more money I&#x27;m going to buy some more. I have two people in mind who would love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! Great price because usuallyI pay alot more at a department store. The bottle was new and in a nex box. Im very happy.</li>

            <li> Armani Code by Giorgio Women Eau De Parfume Spray is a very light delightful fragrance that is correct for every occasion and has&lt;br /&gt;a very elite lasting odor. I have purchased it many, many times.&lt;br /&gt;I have been asked for the name as others have wished to purchase also.&lt;br /&gt;I buy this through Amazon for very rapid and dependable delivery&lt;br /&gt;to my home</li>
            <li> By all account this product was well received by Wendy and was also appreciated as a gift. Her husband liked her using the product, smells good.</li>
            <li> I just want to warn you guys that this parfume is fake!The smell goes away after 30min.very disapointed.The box is fake too.Think twice before you buy it!</li>
            <li> Great price for perfume!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it again to anyone needing a great perfume that subltle and not  overwhelming.</li>
