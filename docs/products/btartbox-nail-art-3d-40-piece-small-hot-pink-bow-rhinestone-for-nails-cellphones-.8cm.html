            <li> Excellent! The bow size is exactly what I wanted, not to big and not to small. Everyone is asking me where I got them. A+</li>
            <li> The powder was open and all over the inside of the bag the glitter was open to it was just tossed in a bag and shipped</li>
            <li> The # in my package was not up to what was been told so I will not recommend it for anybody.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny. My toes couldn&#x27;t be cuter</li>
