            <li>Mineral oil works great with my 4c hair type!  </li>
            <li>It feels great and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>Great for greasing the scalp when wearing braids.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>The smell has greatly improved.</li>
            <li>It is a great product for hair growth.</li>
            <li>Once again, great product.  </li>
            <li>Nice!</li>
            <li>the smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li>I noticed hair growth in desired area within 14-21 days and product also has pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>Loved this product for My daughter hair</li>
            <li>I would purchase again, this would also be good for kids hair too .</li>
            <li>Both Glovers and Virgin users claim them to be good at eliminating dandruff as well</li>
            <li>which makes me guess that sulfur or peppermint must be good at eliminating dandruff.  </li>
            <li>It smells good.</li>
            <li>I love the tingle!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like magic!  </li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just amazing to see how some products work for some and not others.     </li>
            <li>Nice product for the ladies.</li>
            <li>It does smell nice.</li>
            <li>This product did make my hair feel softer; and the product is very light in texture.</li>
            <li>I like the product, looking forward to ordering more.</li>
            <li>AND I LOVE THAT FEELING ON MY SCALP.</li>
            <li>and it is not greasy which I truly enjoyed.</li>
            <li>I do love the tingling feel and it works in making my hair feel softer but when am I suppose to see a difference with the hair growth part?  </li>
            <li>Its ok.  </li>
            <li>Amazon sold it to me for a outstanding price.</li>
            <li>After reading reviews, I decided to order some and am glad I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this along with Sulfur 8 and enjoying the results.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in love and plan on purchasing more of this.</li>
            <li>I am more than pleased with my results.</li>
            <li>The tingle I felt was more like reassurance that it was doing what it&#x27;s suppose to as opposed to \\&quot;Oh s</li>
            <li>Great product, I&#x27;ve tried everything from Dr miracle, Wild growth, Doo grow and many more products with no results.</li>
            <li>I do understand how some cannot stand the smell of a product which makes one not want to use it.......which has happened to me as well, but it&#x27;s more tolerable than the original Glover&#x27;s which by the way I do like the smell of.  </li>
            <li>For the bit that I did use it for, it was easy to apply, but I have found something else to use to help instead.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong, but not unbearable.</li>
            <li>And it really does have a nice tingling effect.</li>
            <li>Great stuff mixed with Sulfur 8 or glovers ointment.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to finally see growth at the front of my hair.     </li>
            <li>It seems like a product that was popular with older guys in the sixties and seventies, and never got updated.  </li>
            <li>I suppose the label was good enough to impress.  </li>
            <li>That being said, this is not bad.  </li>
            <li>Not bad on the nose.  </li>
            <li>Okay first off, some people may not use petroleum, which would discourage them from using this product, but Some things are for certain people and not everything works for everyone.</li>
            <li>What attracted me to it was the shea butter, coconut oil and other ingredients popular for the promotion of long, healthy hair, but I cannot use it again because the strong odor hurts my chest and sinuses.</li>
            <li>Another grease that smells exactly like this but contains a lot more peppermint and subsequently (burn/heat) is Virgin Hair.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s at a inch in most places at the back, but the front seemed as though it was at a standstill.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the mn with essential oils mega tek and so many others.</li>
            <li>and I am able to braid the middle now, and the rest of my hair grew as well.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you why I purchased Glover&#x27;s Growth Blends for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I took a chance and bought it at a beauty supply store the first time.  </li>
            <li>Its not too heavy, light weight and easy for the hair and scalp to absorbe.</li>
            <li>and they are the first 2 main ingredients listed on the packaging.  </li>
            <li>Amazing stuff help my edges grow back second time ordering it.</li>
            <li>I really like glover&#x27;s growth blends herbal.</li>
            <li>I have also noticed that my scalp is much clearer.  </li>
            <li>This product really helps.</li>
            <li>and it is just too much.</li>
            <li>Does this stuff really work?</li>
            <li>Idk if it really grows hair because of the smell I don&#x27;t want to use it</li>
            <li>AND THE PRICE IS REASONABLE TOO.</li>
            <li>It was never too much like Dr. Miracle&#x27;s line (I find it to be too much tingle).  </li>
            <li>It guided my tight coiled natural hair to a very healthy state.  </li>
            <li>I am natural and have been natural since Dec 2008 with many setbacks to include 4 big chops.......</li>
            <li>I have very kinky, afro textured hair, that i wear natural (dont ues heat).</li>
            <li>Light, does not weigh hair down and really works.</li>
            <li>I have used Glover&#x27;s all my life but this is new to me</li>
            <li>FOR THE FIRST TIME I MUST TELL EVERYONE I HAVE SHORT HAIR</li>
            <li>I like it much better than the other one designed for Dry Scalps.  </li>
            <li>My hair grew lot and make my hair soft.</li>
            <li>It does make your hair soft.  </li>
            <li>I just tried this product, and i have no itching or flakes so far</li>
            <li>Switch out the usual plain mineral oil for Glover&#x27;s, which includes additional growth aiding ingredients, and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>It is greasy, which I don&#x27;t mind too much, but it boasts of being no-drip, which is not true at all.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Its light enough to put a little on pressed hair without making it stiff.</li>
            <li> I installed yarn braids on December 12 2014 and normally only keep my braids in about a month in a half and noticed the back of my hair grows really fast.....</li>
            <li> It is not appealing to a modern, female market, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I would have liked to stick with the product longer to see if it aids hair growth, but the odour was just too unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> I give this product only four stars for now until I take out my yarn braids, then I will come back and give an update on my growth.</li>
            <li> im hoping that my hair grows down my back.</li>
            <li> HER HAIR IS DOWN HER BACK.  </li>
            <li> down to a twa type big chops!</li>
            <li> It tends to get very dry and break.</li>
            <li> ,whenever i went out in public when i was little girl people would saw&amp;#34;what is that smell&amp;#34;so</li>
            <li> Not much to say at all about the product.</li>
            <li> If its hot, it becomes liquid and if its very cold it becomes thick, but still smooth.</li>
            <li> I started applying the Glover&#x27;s the day I received it, which was last week by applying very little thoughout my scalp once a day and massaging it in for about 5 min or so.     </li>
            <li> I purchased two of the glover&#x27;s, one was the Herbal and the other one is the tea tree formula.</li>
            <li> Not, not worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Glovers &amp; Sulfur 8 mix along with my current hair regimen for at least a couple months now</li>
            <li> I can see where some of the hair that was breaking off and falling out is slowly coming back.  </li>
            <li> but im hoping its goin to make my hair grow when i take my box braids down, when it grows i will write another review</li>
            <li> I purchased this about a week and a half ago online.</li>
            <li> i just put little on my scalp and hair about two weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I remember this product when i was a little girl(about 10 years</li>
            <li> ALONG WITH THIS PRODUCT I USE A LITTLE CASTOR OIL</li>
            <li> For the past several weeks, I have been making a few small parts and dabbing small amounts of this oil around the hairline.  </li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t have that harsh sulfer smell of the traditonal Glover&#x27;s oil either</li>
            <li> This formula is just like at least 3 other hair grease formulas</li>
            <li> SHE HAS BEEN USING IT FOR THE PAST THREE MONTHS</li>
            <li> I would buy it again just to try it at least for a few months to see if there is truly a difference with hair growth.</li>
            <li> The menthol was predominant at first, then the awful smell of sulphur totally came out.  </li>
            <li> I USED THIS PRODUCT FOR MY EDGES, WHICH WERE VERY THIN FROM DIFFERENT HAIRSTYLES.</li>
            <li> At least for my hair.</li>
            <li> Spots where there was a lot of slow growth would speed up a bit upon applying this herbal growth formula.  </li>
            <li> This stuff stinks.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells horrible and is too thick.</li>
            <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t as bad as some say.</li>
            <li> I used glovers when I was a kid and hated the smell (it did grow my hair)</li>
            <li> It took me days to get the nasty smell out of my hair!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> It grows your hair fast!&lt;br /&gt;I say use this product once a day and use it for braids only.</li>
            <li> I really like glover&#x27;s growth blends herbal. My hair grew lot and make my hair soft. i just put little on my scalp and hair about two weeks ago. i will keep using this product cause it make my hair grew faster.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells horrible and is too thick. It took me days to get the nasty smell out of my hair!!! Not, not worth it.</li>
            <li> Item was as described and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Loved this product for My daughter hair</li>
            <li> My hair stylist told me to buy this product.  I have some thinning spots around the edges of my hair as a result of surgery/medication.  For the past several weeks, I have been making a few small parts and dabbing small amounts of this oil around the hairline.  My hair has stopped shedding and I am seeing a big improvement in my scalp.  I also suffer from psoriasis and dermatitis.  I can see where some of the hair that was breaking off and falling out is slowly coming back.  I have also noticed that my scalp is much clearer.  I prefer to use the Glover&#x27;s products rather than the prescription meds because they contain scalp thinning steriods.  This product doesn&#x27;t have that harsh sulfer smell of the traditonal Glover&#x27;s oil either so I can use it daily and not offend my coworkers.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for husbands receding hairline and balding. he likes it, it seems to have helped with growth only in the areas that have hair. The smell is strong, but not unbearable.</li>
            <li> I have very kinky, afro textured hair, that i wear natural (dont ues heat). It tends to get very dry and break. This product really helps. Its not too heavy, light weight and easy for the hair and scalp to absorbe. And it really does have a nice tingling effect. Its light enough to put a little on pressed hair without making it stiff. I noticed that it changes in consistency depending on the temp of the room. If its hot, it becomes liquid and if its very cold it becomes thick, but still smooth. Great for greasing the scalp when wearing braids.</li>
            <li> I used to use this and it is just too much. I used glovers when I was a kid and hated the smell (it did grow my hair) and I wanted to help growth. For the bit that I did use it for, it was easy to apply, but I have found something else to use to help instead.</li>
            <li> I remember this product when i was a little girl(about 10 years old)my mother told me that product would make my hair grow if i kept using it,but back then it smelled sooooo bad,she told me to mix it with hairdressing,it did but i just could not stay the smell.so i stop using it,whenever i went out in public when i was little girl people would saw&amp;#34;what is that smell&amp;#34;so i would just walk away because i knew that it was the glover&#x27;s that i had put in my hair,so i just stop using it.i wish to this day i had never stop.i hope the smell is not the same from back in the day.but what i used was in the bottle.i will start back using it again.always listen to your mother because she knows</li>
            <li> Great stuff mixed with Sulfur 8 or glovers ointment. It works Try It!</li>
            <li> Does this stuff really work? I just bought this product and im hoping that my hair grows down my back.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff help my edges grow back second time ordering it.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 3-stars.  I like it much better than the other one designed for Dry Scalps.  This product did make my hair feel softer; and the product is very light in texture. I also like the smell.  I would purchase again, this would also be good for kids hair too .</li>
            <li> I like the product, looking forward to ordering more.</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks. Smells like sulfur. Idk if it really grows hair because of the smell I don&#x27;t want to use it</li>
            <li> Nice! Nice product for the ladies. My wifw loves this product as it compliments her body chemestry. Next I need to get some stuff for myself. lol</li>
            <li> THE BEST IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY.  I TRIED THIS PRODUCT TWO WEEKS AGO AND MY HAIR IS GROWING. MY DAUGHTER HAIR HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO HER EARS SHE HAS BEEN USING IT FOR THE PAST THREE MONTHS HER HAIR IS DOWN HER BACK.  YOU CAN&#x27;T BEAT THIS!  FOR THE FIRST TIME I MUST TELL EVERYONE I HAVE SHORT HAIR AND NOW I COULD SEE HOW MY HAIR HAS GROWN IN TWO WEEKS.  TRY IT.  AND THE PRICE IS REASONABLE TOO.</li>
            <li> This product is a magnificant buy. I have purchased it for my grandmother, a friend of mine, as well as myself. It works!!!!</li>
            <li> It really helped grow my hair a few inches I deeply recommend this to anyone ... I might have to start buying a lot !!!</li>
            <li> I USED THIS PRODUCT FOR MY EDGES, WHICH WERE VERY THIN FROM DIFFERENT HAIRSTYLES. THIS PRODUCT HAS MADE MY EDGES NOTICEABLY THICKER AND ALONG WITH THIS PRODUCT I USE A LITTLE CASTOR OIL AS WELL. THIS PRODUCT MAKES YOUR SCALP FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE PEPPERMENT ON YOUR SCALP AND I LOVE THAT FEELING ON MY SCALP. IT MAKES YOUR HEAD FEEL TINGLY.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of childhood!</li>
            <li> I did notice a difference. It seems to be working and it is not greasy which I truly enjoyed.</li>
            <li> Have not noticed any difference.</li>
            <li> Great Herbal grow formula!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for two weeks now and I am still waiting to see the difference in hair growth.  I do love the tingling feel and it works in making my hair feel softer but when am I suppose to see a difference with the hair growth part?  I would buy it again just to try it at least for a few months to see if there is truly a difference with hair growth.</li>
            <li> Its ok.  This formula is just like at least 3 other hair grease formulas I know where 99% of the ingredients are the same in all of the products that people on Amazon swear grows hair.    The only 2 ingredients that people always rave about that grows hair are Sulfur and peppermint.  This product smells like both and feels like both and they are the first 2 main ingredients listed on the packaging.  Another grease that smells exactly like this but contains a lot more peppermint and subsequently (burn/heat) is Virgin Hair.  Both Glovers and Virgin users claim them to be good at eliminating dandruff as well which makes me guess that sulfur or peppermint must be good at eliminating dandruff.  They also are claimed especially by the Dominicans and Nigerians to be a miracle hair growth solution.  [[ASIN:B005XL6EVU Virgin Hair Fertilizer Anti Dandruff &amp; Conditioning Cream 150G]]    That being said, this is not bad.  It does make your hair soft.  I dont know about growth yet as I just bought it, but it cant do any harm if it has these two ingredients.  The smell does stay with you for a longggg time.  I think it took me 3 days before the smell subsided.</li>
            <li> Great product.!  Not bad on the nose.  The smell has greatly improved. I have seen some improvement on my damage hair and in the bald spot that I had in the back.</li>
            <li> I bought the item for my 78 year-old aunt, who remembers her grandmother using it on her hair when she was a child.  She loves it!</li>
            <li> I just tried this product, and i have no itching or flakes so far and it smells like peppermints but im hoping its goin to make my hair grow when i take my box braids down, when it grows i will write another review</li>
            <li> It is a great product for hair growth. Amazon sold it to me for a outstanding price.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my hair.. Not much to say at all about the product. The smell wasn&#x27;t as bad as some say.</li>
            <li> I would have liked to stick with the product longer to see if it aids hair growth, but the odour was just too unpleasant.  The menthol was predominant at first, then the awful smell of sulphur totally came out.  It smelled like matches.  It is greasy, which I don&#x27;t mind too much, but it boasts of being no-drip, which is not true at all.  That presented a bit of a problem with application.  I do not like the packaging. It is not appealing to a modern, female market, in my opinion. It seems like a product that was popular with older guys in the sixties and seventies, and never got updated.  What attracted me to it was the shea butter, coconut oil and other ingredients popular for the promotion of long, healthy hair, but I cannot use it again because the strong odor hurts my chest and sinuses.</li>
            <li> Okay first off, some people may not use petroleum, which would discourage them from using this product, but Some things are for certain people and not everything works for everyone. I can truly say this product works for me. After reading reviews, I decided to order some and am glad I did. I&#x27;ve been using this along with Sulfur 8 and enjoying the results. Yes I have seen results , but at the same time you have to be patient. I&#x27;ve been using this Glovers &amp; Sulfur 8 mix along with my current hair regimen for at least a couple months now and I&#x27;m in love and plan on purchasing more of this. I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone looking for growth and doesn&#x27;t have a problem with petroleum.</li>
            <li> This product does work! At least for my hair. I purchased this about a week and a half ago online. But not through Amazon. I was so happy to finally see growth at the front of my hair.     I installed yarn braids on December 12 2014 and normally only keep my braids in about a month in a half and noticed the back of my hair grows really fast.....it&#x27;s at a inch in most places at the back, but the front seemed as though it was at a standstill. I started applying the Glover&#x27;s the day I received it, which was last week by applying very little thoughout my scalp once a day and massaging it in for about 5 min or so.     Then today being Sunday 4 Jan 2015 I decided to wash my hair, and have definitely noticed the front is finally sprouting out. The only thing I can contribute to my growth is the Glover&#x27;s herbal gro formula. I am more than pleased with my results. I do hope by the end of Jan when I take out these old yarn braids that I will have an inch to almost 2 inches of growth. I purchased two of the glover&#x27;s, one was the Herbal and the other one is the tea tree formula. I do remember my mother did use Glover&#x27;s mane on my scalp when I was a teenager because I had severe psorisis and every time I tried to use a comb and rake it out my scalp bled.     But when my mother used the Glover&#x27;s on my entire scalp it actually healed and my hair grew. A lot of people cannot tolerate the mineral oil and the petro in the ingredients but it works for me. I am natural and have been natural since Dec 2008 with many setbacks to include 4 big chops.......down to a twa type big chops! It&#x27;s just amazing to see how some products work for some and not others.     I&#x27;ve tried the mn with essential oils mega tek and so many others. I give this product only four stars for now until I take out my yarn braids, then I will come back and give an update on my growth. I just want to keep and retain my length finally. I know this stuff works and the smell is pleasant. I do understand how some cannot stand the smell of a product which makes one not want to use it.......which has happened to me as well, but it&#x27;s more tolerable than the original Glover&#x27;s which by the way I do like the smell of.  I hope this helps someone out there.</li>
            <li> Used once, but will be using often starting today.</li>
            <li> I suffer from Alopecia in the middle of my head, no hair has grown in that area for 2 years., I started using this product on my scalp for about seven weeks and I am able to braid the middle now, and the rest of my hair grew as well. Great product, I&#x27;ve tried everything from Dr miracle, Wild growth, Doo grow and many more products with no results.</li>
            <li> This is too greasy for my liking. It is made with petroleum too. I won&#x27;t buy this again. It does smell nice.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you why I purchased Glover&#x27;s Growth Blends for the first time.  I suppose the label was good enough to impress.  I took a chance and bought it at a beauty supply store the first time.  It guided my tight coiled natural hair to a very healthy state.  Spots where there was a lot of slow growth would speed up a bit upon applying this herbal growth formula.  I love the tingle!  It was never too much like Dr. Miracle&#x27;s line (I find it to be too much tingle).  The tingle I felt was more like reassurance that it was doing what it&#x27;s suppose to as opposed to \\&quot;Oh s*, what is it doing to my scalp!!?\\&quot;.  Anyway, I feel I ought to review the product because otherwise, how else are potential users supposed to know it works so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of naturals speak against mineral oil and petroleum but I&#x27;m quite contrary.  Mineral oil works great with my 4c hair type!  I just apply it liberally, spritz my hair with water thereafter, and leave it alone to allow it to do it&#x27;s growth thing.  That&#x27;s all.  It&#x27;s like magic!  Switch out the usual plain mineral oil for Glover&#x27;s, which includes additional growth aiding ingredients, and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> Light, does not weigh hair down and really works. I noticed hair growth in desired area within 14-21 days and product also has pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> It smells good. I recently purchased the item  and I have recently started to use this product. I have no recommendation.</li>
            <li> It feels great and smells wonderful. I have used Glover&#x27;s all my life but this is new to me and I love it!</li>
            <li> Once again, great product.  Have recommended this product to friends and family.</li>
