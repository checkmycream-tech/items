            <li>love, love, love this top coat!!!!</li>
            <li>It is great to put over glitter polish to help smooth the surface.</li>
            <li>Amazing for me.</li>
            <li>its a great top coat polish...if anyone is looking for a top coat</li>
            <li>The good news is that it goes on smooth and dries VERY quickly.</li>
            <li>Quick drying and free of the chemicals i am allergic to, happy to be able to wear polish again</li>
            <li>Ok, so I&#x27;m going to start off by saying that i was in love with seche vite about a year ago.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cause shrinkage either, like seche vite does, and works with ALL nail polishes, unlike OPI which only seems to work best with OPI polishes.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I bought this top coat in hopes to find a safer replacement to Seche Vite.</li>
            <li>I wanted to buy a non toxic top coat, knowing that I am always touching my face and preparing food.</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure I was using a non toxic top coat.</li>
            <li>This is awesome &amp; makes your polish shine &amp; last!!!</li>
            <li>Love it:)</li>
            <li>I Love this top coat works</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the brush &amp;</li>
            <li>Nubar Diamond Seal &amp; Shine Top Coat was not something to brag about.</li>
            <li>I love this top coat.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite top coats.</li>
            <li>Thjis top coat is better about that.  </li>
            <li>This is now the only top coat that I use!!!</li>
            <li>Seems to work great on all the new polishes I&#x27;ve tried, not so great on my really old ones.  </li>
            <li>I switched to this after learning of all of the foul, toxic things that were in my old brand of choice for topcoats and this has been great.  </li>
            <li>happy with all so far.</li>
            <li>I bought this top coat because it is free of Formaldehyde, Toluene and DBP.  </li>
            <li>love Nubar polishes in general - they all go on smooth and look great.  </li>
            <li>Love the cruelty free &amp; 3 free chemicals, though.</li>
            <li>the bottle is easy to hold.</li>
            <li>B001QRD4W2 butter LONDON Hardwear PD Quick Top Coat-0.4 oz]]).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s job is to protect the awesome manicure underneath - and add a little shine (unless you use a matte finish).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smooth finish.</li>
            <li>I purchased this brand because it was recommended to be free of the evil-three.</li>
            <li>It shines great and last about a week.</li>
            <li>I enjoy that this keeps my manicure looking beautiful for as long as it does.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve stockpiled bottles of this stuff because I love it so much!</li>
            <li>So far I am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Well I&#x27;m here to say that the person who said that is so right!</li>
            <li>Just what I need in a top coat, plenty of shine and dries really</li>
            <li>I wear mostly red and coral nail polish and most top coats I have tried pick up quite a bit of the polish on the brush when I put on the first layer of top coat.  </li>
            <li>I searched high and low for a good top coat</li>
            <li>got here quick</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and truly protects my manicure.  </li>
            <li>There is no shrink back on the nail as many top coats have.</li>
            <li>and it was better than the brand new bottle of Nubar.      </li>
            <li>When I went to use the Diamont top coat, it was much thicker than it had been upon first being used.  </li>
            <li>I also like that it dries fast and strong.</li>
            <li>now!I havent been able to find anything else so far that compares!</li>
            <li>Last pedicure lasted more than a week, with no chipping!</li>
            <li>The very best shine and dry fast clear nail polish</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and really creates a high-shine mirror finish!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It dries super fast and leaves a super shiny gloss over my nail polish.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great, fast dry topcoat!</li>
            <li>But if you had to make a choice on what type of clear coat to go with then this one would be just fine.</li>
            <li>Dries supper fast and really protects your polish!!  </li>
            <li>and they mentioned that they used this particular top coat and liked it much better than that other one, that this one does not shrink at the tips like the other one does.</li>
            <li>The ONLY top coat I use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s really all I need!</li>
            <li>After using it several times, I can say I&#x27;m not a fan of this top coat.</li>
            <li>Definitely will not be purchasing this top coat again.</li>
            <li>The top coat is no different</li>
            <li>I wanred to try a different top coat</li>
            <li>topcoat goes on pretty viscous, so I&#x27;d recommend not using a brush-full.</li>
            <li>Works great on fingernails and toenails, when given enough time to dry, and not applied prematurely over color.</li>
            <li>I agree with all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this top coat a try after having shrinkage problems with other fast dry topcoats, and I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li>On my quest for a good top coat similar to Seche Vite (which becomes too thick and unusable halfway through the bottle), I decided to try Nubar&#x27;s Diamont Seal &amp; Shine based on a blogger&#x27;s recommendation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s largely utilitarian.  </li>
            <li>Fast drying.</li>
            <li>But this time, I really don&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li>dries fast which causes  premature shrinkage</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not much to say about a top coat.  </li>
            <li>Extremely fast drying, and adds lots of shine.  </li>
            <li>Then, well, I really don&#x27;t know what happened.  </li>
            <li>The price was reasonable and the brand speaks for its self.</li>
            <li>it was a fast delivery as well..</li>
            <li>i  really recommend this one ...</li>
            <li>You absolutely must get this though if you are getting the Nubar brand nail polish, though.</li>
            <li>I looked and I looked, and tried TONS of different top coats - from drugstore brands to professional brands like OPI.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this polish, I was pretty pleased with the ease of application, as well as the results, which were very close to being on par with my more expensive, only-buy-when-it-won&#x27;t-break-the-bank, luxury brand polish ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t actually realize that this was a quick dry top coat until I used it.</li>
            <li>Before buying a topcoat I had done quite a bit of research and finally settled on this one -- and was definitely not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Other top coats just don&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>This top coat dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t shrink, at least not in my experience.</li>
            <li>For all those seche lovers who want something a bit more safer and less toxic, THIS IS IT.</li>
            <li>This is super shiny and makes a manicure last forever.  </li>
            <li>But my heart is definitely won over and I will buy more bottles of Nubar Diamont in the future.</li>
            <li>High shine.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get all the high ratings on this product.</li>
            <li>I KNOW I closed it securely.  </li>
            <li>I feel good knowing that it&#x27;s not full of toxins like some of the other polish brands.</li>
            <li>Again, amazing for me, as I am extremely active, and generally have problems getting fingers to last a day with no chipping.</li>
            <li>if it makes my manicures last longer though, they seem to chip at pretty much the same rate with topcoat as without.</li>
            <li>As it was over the Holidays, I needed to switch up my nail color after only a few days -under a week, for sure.  </li>
            <li>I had an old Essie top coat at my desk, thick and goopy, used it to save my manicure</li>
            <li>You have to try it, with nubar base coat to believe how awesome this set is.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Diamont does all of the above, plus leaves your nails glossy and dries super fast - which is a bonus because I have little patience to sit around for hours waiting for my mani to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have tried many top coats, and along with some of those came disappointment!</li>
            <li>It dries instantly and has a high gloss.</li>
            <li>It has a slightly stronger odor than I expected but it did not linger and I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get as thick as other quick dry top coats.</li>
            <li>Although Seche vite does dry half way through the bottle its still 1000 times better than Nubar in drying time and overall shine.    </li>
            <li>I was weary at first to try this because other people swear by SV.</li>
            <li>I used it as a base coat for my toes and so far so good!</li>
            <li>This top coat keeps my dark nails dark at the tips for at least 4 days without chips, and my light nails light at the tips for at least 7 days without shrinking and peeling.</li>
            <li>Wait til your nail polish is completely dry before using it, or else you may pull it off when applying the topcoat!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>For the first few uses it worked great, but after a few weeks the formula got so thick and goopy that it would mess up my nails.</li>
            <li>It dried super quickly, and resulted in a rock hard mirror finish!</li>

            <li> The first time I used this polish, I was pretty pleased with the ease of application, as well as the results, which were very close to being on par with my more expensive, only-buy-when-it-won&#x27;t-break-the-bank, luxury brand polish ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t actually realize that this was a quick dry top coat until I used it.</li>
            <li> Before buying a topcoat I had done quite a bit of research and finally settled on this one -- and was definitely not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Other top coats just don&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> This top coat dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t shrink, at least not in my experience.</li>
            <li> For all those seche lovers who want something a bit more safer and less toxic, THIS IS IT.</li>
            <li> This is super shiny and makes a manicure last forever.  </li>
            <li> But my heart is definitely won over and I will buy more bottles of Nubar Diamont in the future.</li>
            <li> High shine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get all the high ratings on this product.</li>
            <li> I KNOW I closed it securely.  </li>
            <li> I feel good knowing that it&#x27;s not full of toxins like some of the other polish brands.</li>
            <li> Again, amazing for me, as I am extremely active, and generally have problems getting fingers to last a day with no chipping.</li>
            <li> if it makes my manicures last longer though, they seem to chip at pretty much the same rate with topcoat as without.</li>
            <li> As it was over the Holidays, I needed to switch up my nail color after only a few days -under a week, for sure.  </li>
            <li> I had an old Essie top coat at my desk, thick and goopy, used it to save my manicure</li>
            <li> You have to try it, with nubar base coat to believe how awesome this set is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Diamont does all of the above, plus leaves your nails glossy and dries super fast - which is a bonus because I have little patience to sit around for hours waiting for my mani to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have tried many top coats, and along with some of those came disappointment!</li>
            <li> It dries instantly and has a high gloss.</li>
            <li> It has a slightly stronger odor than I expected but it did not linger and I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get as thick as other quick dry top coats.</li>
            <li> Although Seche vite does dry half way through the bottle its still 1000 times better than Nubar in drying time and overall shine.    </li>
            <li> I was weary at first to try this because other people swear by SV.</li>
            <li> I used it as a base coat for my toes and so far so good!</li>
            <li> This top coat keeps my dark nails dark at the tips for at least 4 days without chips, and my light nails light at the tips for at least 7 days without shrinking and peeling.</li>
            <li> Wait til your nail polish is completely dry before using it, or else you may pull it off when applying the topcoat!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> For the first few uses it worked great, but after a few weeks the formula got so thick and goopy that it would mess up my nails.</li>
            <li> It dried super quickly, and resulted in a rock hard mirror finish!</li>
            <li> It made the polish real shinny and slick but next day i had some chips already.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure exactly how long it took, because they were done by the time I checked.</li>
            <li> and I wondered how long it would really last.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> I expected it to take a while to dry because of all the stuff under it, some of which was still a bit soft and not dry, but my nails were completely dry and the polish was hard and shiny within minutes.</li>
            <li> Not only that, it cut down my manicure time by half (only 2 days or so).</li>
            <li> I tried to use it anyway, but it was such a mess</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and doesnt clump up and get nasty.</li>
            <li> Before, my nail polish would start chipping the next day, but now I can go at least three days before having to touch up the tips (I type a lot at work, so that area is constantly in contact with the keyboard).&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I put on one base coat, two coats of color, two coats of flakies, and finally this top coat.</li>
            <li> , I switched to the other brand after just two nails.  </li>
            <li> Whether it was a fluke or not, I&#x27;ll try some other brands before giving Diamont another go.</li>
            <li> Takes forever to dry, once dried, nails feel tacky.</li>
            <li> I bought the base coat, colors and top coat.....</li>
            <li> and I was let down by masses of them.</li>
            <li> Other colors offered through them blows it out of the water!</li>
            <li> Not sure why this topcoat takes forever to dry????</li>
            <li> While it does provide shine and it does seem to make the manicure last a little longer, the formula is too thick and gloppy.</li>
            <li> and I ordered here to replace OPI to be less toxic.</li>
            <li> On some of my polishes it doesn&#x27;t pick up any color, but even when it does pick up the color, it picks up less.  </li>
            <li> Fingernails, usually 3-4 days - with minimal touch up.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> &quot; It had those streamer-things dripping off (which mucked up the top of the bottle where the cap screws on -grrrr!-), and the brush was stuck in some wonky shape.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I have a bad habit of screwing the wand-caps on too tightly so they&#x27;re often near impossible to open the next time I go to use them.  </li>
            <li> I usually have marks in my nail polish before the day is over, but not this time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure</li>
            <li> No more shrinkage!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves a dull finish with streaking.    </li>
            <li> I bought this because my Seche Vite had gone goopy and hard to handle without using thinner every time.</li>
            <li> Well, at least two weeks.  </li>
            <li> I mean, the stuff had turned almost \\&quot;gunky.\\</li>
            <li> Confusing!</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, a few months ago I found out about all the horrible things in seche vite that may possibly lead to cancer or reproductive problems (google it!).</li>
            <li> but this made it worse.</li>
            <li> Not really happy with the product</li>
            <li> Therefore, as sad as it was, I had to leave my seche behind.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wake up with weird marks on my nails</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anything wrong with the bottle...</li>
            <li> The bad news is the price.</li>
            <li> I also like the Nubar base coat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> High shine. Fast drying. No shrinkage. Smooth finish. Doesn&#x27;t get as thick as other quick dry top coats. The ONLY top coat I use. Intagram @lft0fcntr.</li>
            <li> This really has a very nice shine to it, very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Not sure why this topcoat takes forever to dry???? I&#x27;ve used this before and recall being happy with it. But this time, I really don&#x27;t care for it. It stays tacky, even 2hours later. Confusing! Love the cruelty free &amp; 3 free chemicals, though. But won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I&#x27;m going to start off by saying that i was in love with seche vite about a year ago. It dried super quickly, and resulted in a rock hard mirror finish! HOWEVER, a few months ago I found out about all the horrible things in seche vite that may possibly lead to cancer or reproductive problems (google it!). Therefore, as sad as it was, I had to leave my seche behind.  I looked and I looked, and tried TONS of different top coats - from drugstore brands to professional brands like OPI. However, nothing dried as fast as seche did; I would always wake up in the morning with marks all over my nails after painting them the last evening HOURS before I went to sleep.  After looking at reviews, I bought nubar and have never been happier. For all those seche lovers who want something a bit more safer and less toxic, THIS IS IT. It dries quickly and really creates a high-shine mirror finish! I don&#x27;t wake up with weird marks on my nails now!I havent been able to find anything else so far that compares! It doesn&#x27;t cause shrinkage either, like seche vite does, and works with ALL nail polishes, unlike OPI which only seems to work best with OPI polishes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get all the high ratings on this product. It&#x27;s horrible. Takes forever to dry, once dried, nails feel tacky. Leaves a dull finish with streaking.    Although Seche vite does dry half way through the bottle its still 1000 times better than Nubar in drying time and overall shine.    I had an old Essie top coat at my desk, thick and goopy, used it to save my manicure and it was better than the brand new bottle of Nubar.      Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time. Dries supper fast and really protects your polish!!  Great product!  Buy more than one and save!!</li>
            <li> It is like glass shied on your nails...I put a coat on after doing my manicure and then about every 4 days afterward...keep my polish on for about 3 weeks.  You have to try it, with nubar base coat to believe how awesome this set is.</li>
            <li> This is super shiny and makes a manicure last forever.  Well, at least two weeks.  It is great to put over glitter polish to help smooth the surface.</li>
            <li> This is some of the best nail polish from Nubar that I have ever had. I used to use Sally Hansen and this does not even compare. This stuff is great and doesnt clump up and get nasty. Lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brand because it was recommended to be free of the evil-three. I like it. It has a slightly stronger odor than I expected but it did not linger and I&#x27;m okay with that. I used it as a base coat for my toes and so far so good! I like it and will continue to use. I feel good knowing that it&#x27;s not full of toxins like some of the other polish brands.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Works great on fingernails and toenails, when given enough time to dry, and not applied prematurely over color. Will be adding to my regular rotation of products. Last pedicure lasted more than a week, with no chipping! Amazing for me. Fingernails, usually 3-4 days - with minimal touch up. Again, amazing for me, as I am extremely active, and generally have problems getting fingers to last a day with no chipping.</li>
            <li> dries fast which causes  premature shrinkage</li>
            <li> Just what I need in a top coat, plenty of shine and dries really fast.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s really all I need!</li>
            <li> I bought this top coat in hopes to find a safer replacement to Seche Vite. I heard great reviews for it so I went ahead and bought it. For the first few uses it worked great, but after a few weeks the formula got so thick and goopy that it would mess up my nails. Not only that, it cut down my manicure time by half (only 2 days or so). I tried to revive it by putting thinner in it but this made it worse. Looks like I&#x27;m going back to Seche again or trying Posche.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t actually realize that this was a quick dry top coat until I used it. I put on one base coat, two coats of color, two coats of flakies, and finally this top coat. I expected it to take a while to dry because of all the stuff under it, some of which was still a bit soft and not dry, but my nails were completely dry and the polish was hard and shiny within minutes. I&#x27;m not sure exactly how long it took, because they were done by the time I checked. I usually have marks in my nail polish before the day is over, but not this time. I am going to stock up on this.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase. I wanted to buy a non toxic top coat, knowing that I am always touching my face and preparing food. I wanted to make sure I was using a non toxic top coat. It shines great and last about a week.</li>
            <li> On my quest for a good top coat similar to Seche Vite (which becomes too thick and unusable halfway through the bottle), I decided to try Nubar&#x27;s Diamont Seal &amp; Shine based on a blogger&#x27;s recommendation. After using it several times, I can say I&#x27;m not a fan of this top coat. While it does provide shine and it does seem to make the manicure last a little longer, the formula is too thick and gloppy. Application is a royal pain in the butt and it eats through the layers of nail polish leaving holes in the color. Definitely will not be purchasing this top coat again.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say about a top coat.  It&#x27;s largely utilitarian.  It&#x27;s job is to protect the awesome manicure underneath - and add a little shine (unless you use a matte finish).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diamont does all of the above, plus leaves your nails glossy and dries super fast - which is a bonus because I have little patience to sit around for hours waiting for my mani to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Nubar polishes in general - they all go on smooth and look great.  The top coat is no different</li>
            <li> Extremely fast drying, and adds lots of shine.  Seems to work great on all the new polishes I&#x27;ve tried, not so great on my really old ones.  I&#x27;m not really sure if it makes my manicures last longer though, they seem to chip at pretty much the same rate with topcoat as without.</li>
            <li> I switched to this after learning of all of the foul, toxic things that were in my old brand of choice for topcoats and this has been great.  Great shiny finish that lasts about a week for just one application and without all of the bad-for-you fumes.</li>
            <li> Quick drying and free of the chemicals i am allergic to, happy to be able to wear polish again</li>
            <li> This is awesome &amp; makes your polish shine &amp; last!!! Even after 5 days...still shiny! Love it:)</li>
            <li> love, love, love this top coat!!!!</li>
            <li> It didnt work all that well for me. I still got chipping</li>
            <li> This is now the only top coat that I use!!! Gives even the cheapest of nail polishes the staying power I need!!!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this polish, I was pretty pleased with the ease of application, as well as the results, which were very close to being on par with my more expensive, only-buy-when-it-won&#x27;t-break-the-bank, luxury brand polish ([[ASIN:B001QRD4W2 butter LONDON Hardwear PD Quick Top Coat-0.4 oz]]).  Then, well, I really don&#x27;t know what happened.  It&#x27;s never happened before.  As it was over the Holidays, I needed to switch up my nail color after only a few days -under a week, for sure.  When I went to use the Diamont top coat, it was much thicker than it had been upon first being used.  I mean, the stuff had turned almost \\&quot;gunky.\\&quot; It had those streamer-things dripping off (which mucked up the top of the bottle where the cap screws on -grrrr!-), and the brush was stuck in some wonky shape.  I tried to use it anyway, but it was such a mess, I switched to the other brand after just two nails.  I didn&#x27;t notice anything wrong with the bottle...no crack in the cap or anything, and I KNOW I closed it securely.  In fact, I have a bad habit of screwing the wand-caps on too tightly so they&#x27;re often near impossible to open the next time I go to use them.  Whether it was a fluke or not, I&#x27;ll try some other brands before giving Diamont another go.</li>
            <li> I Love this top coat works great looks shiny on your nails got here quick and I would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> I found this product on vacation. They used Nubar in a &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; spa on me and I wondered how long it would really last. It lasted longer than my loved OPI....and I ordered here to replace OPI to be less toxic. I am very happy with Nubar. I bought the base coat, colors and top coat.....happy with all so far.</li>
            <li> Used it for years.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this top coat a try after having shrinkage problems with other fast dry topcoats, and I&#x27;m so glad I did! I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;It dries super fast and leaves a super shiny gloss over my nail polish. And the best part? No more shrinkage!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve stockpiled bottles of this stuff because I love it so much! I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great, fast dry topcoat!</li>
            <li> Awesome shine that competes with Seche Vite, &amp; a inexpensive, non-toxic alternative to Seche Vite.  I love the brush &amp; the bottle is easy to hold. I agree with all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Nubar Diamond Seal &amp; Shine Top Coat was not something to brag about. Other colors offered through them blows it out of the water! But if you had to make a choice on what type of clear coat to go with then this one would be just fine. The price was reasonable and the brand speaks for its self.</li>
            <li> I wanred to try a different top coat and i was very pleased with this product, it makes your polish super shiny,and keeps your mani perfect longer...it was a fast delivery as well..i am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to regular nail polish so I use this company&#x27;s products and am very happy with them.</li>
            <li> Loved it!!!..its a great top coat polish...if anyone is looking for a top coat i  really recommend this one ...</li>
            <li> I bought this because my Seche Vite had gone goopy and hard to handle without using thinner every time. This top coat dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t shrink, at least not in my experience. It also doesn&#x27;t smell (Unlike SV, ugh) !! I was weary at first to try this because other people swear by SV. But my heart is definitely won over and I will buy more bottles of Nubar Diamont in the future.</li>
            <li> The best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.  It dries quickly and truly protects my manicure.  I also like the Nubar base coat.</li>
            <li> It made the polish real shinny and slick but next day i had some chips already. Not really happy with the product</li>
            <li> I searched high and low for a good top coat and I was let down by masses of them. Then I read a review from a blog and they mentioned that they used this particular top coat and liked it much better than that other one, that this one does not shrink at the tips like the other one does. Well I&#x27;m here to say that the person who said that is so right! This top coat keeps my dark nails dark at the tips for at least 4 days without chips, and my light nails light at the tips for at least 7 days without shrinking and peeling. I love this top coat. I will continue to use this till it does not do the job I expect it to. I appreciate that this is quality and does not cost a lot to buy. I enjoy that this keeps my manicure looking beautiful for as long as it does. I believe this is the best!</li>
            <li> The very best shine and dry fast clear nail polish</li>
            <li> Before buying a topcoat I had done quite a bit of research and finally settled on this one -- and was definitely not disappointed. This is a manicure-saver. Before, my nail polish would start chipping the next day, but now I can go at least three days before having to touch up the tips (I type a lot at work, so that area is constantly in contact with the keyboard).&lt;br /&gt;This topcoat goes on pretty viscous, so I&#x27;d recommend not using a brush-full. Wait til your nail polish is completely dry before using it, or else you may pull it off when applying the topcoat!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, highly recommended. Wish I had found it sooner!</li>
            <li> I have tried many top coats, and along with some of those came disappointment! But this product has become one of my favorites, and I would defiantly purchase it again!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t buy this along with the Nubar nail polish of your liking, you WILL regret it. The good news is that it goes on smooth and dries VERY quickly. The bad news is the price. You absolutely must get this though if you are getting the Nubar brand nail polish, though. Other top coats just don&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite top coats. It dries instantly and has a high gloss. There is no shrink back on the nail as many top coats have. That is a big plus!!</li>
            <li> I bought this top coat because it is free of Formaldehyde, Toluene and DBP.  So far I am very pleased with it.  I wear mostly red and coral nail polish and most top coats I have tried pick up quite a bit of the polish on the brush when I put on the first layer of top coat.  Thjis top coat is better about that.  On some of my polishes it doesn&#x27;t pick up any color, but even when it does pick up the color, it picks up less.  I also like that it dries fast and strong.</li>
