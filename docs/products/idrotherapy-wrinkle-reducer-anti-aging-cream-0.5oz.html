            <li>That was until I bought this amazing product.  </li>
            <li>and I can honestly say I have no idea what the hype was for these treatments.</li>
            <li>I love it, my skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Idrotherapy for 3 months and it has consistently been a great product all that time.</li>
            <li>Ok, gays.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This product has a lovely feel to it</li>
            <li>Okay, so I ended up paying over the $99.99 for the product.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>Hang on to your money for a better choice. :)</li>
            <li>Not so sure -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s not something a woman would do.</li>
            <li>This cream feels so smooth and refreshing on your skin.</li>
            <li>They asked me in which class/grade I am :) Of course, I refused (I&#x27;m happily married :) I just wanted one cosmetic experiment to do.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe that I should need to read all the fine print to discover these items.  </li>
            <li>Product came up on my PC and all this flashing &amp;#34;order free trail&amp;#34; &amp;#34;rush my order&amp;#34;  kept coming up in the screen.  </li>
            <li>The product was &#x27;free&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>After a month of continued dedicated use of Idrotherapy, my wrinkles that i was thinking were permanent are not present unless my face is in one of its expressive moments again.  </li>
            <li>is so reasonable for this great product and shipping is fast.</li>
            <li>and I am starting to see good results.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly a great product, it saved us a bundle on the assortment of other stuff she would otherwise use...</li>
            <li>I have seen a definitive difference pretty quickly after using it.  </li>
            <li>But I do know that the dreaded \\&quot;crows feet\\&quot; seem to have dwindled which is exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>The first time no one had noticed me.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and smooth and you can see the lines have disappeared.  </li>
            <li>Recently i have noticed that the lines were not going away and looking more permanent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read the other reviews and it seems no one else is really fond of these products, so, don&#x27;t be fooled by one amazing review.</li>
            <li>has definitely not reduced my fine lines</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>After another week (almost a month)of trying this product, I really hadn&#x27;t see any difference over what I was already using.  </li>
            <li>It really works</li>
            <li>can’t believe how young I look!!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, as this is a whole new phase of my life.  </li>
            <li>Like many other people who have fallin&#x27; into this trap of FRAUD!!</li>
            <li>very dubious.&lt;br /&gt;Their marketing is not only misleading but a fraud in the making.&lt;br /&gt;Through an online advertisement I requested a free sample where supposedly I only had to pay the shipping charge.</li>
            <li>I’m 50 years old now, but literally I can walk through high school hallways and no one can tell the difference between me and students!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, why is a man rating a product whose primary target market is middle aged women?</li>
            <li>Use natural products.</li>
            <li>A COMPLETE RIP OFF.  </li>
            <li>To my surprise, they made inappropriate charges to my VISA which I had not previously authorised.</li>
            <li>They are not effective, or not much as to be some kind of wonder, or even they could damage your skin.</li>
            <li>This is the first, I mean literally the first time, I am giving a review</li>
            <li>And the reason I say HE is because I have read his other product reviews (all Mobilis products)and found that he rated Xength X1 Male Performance Enhancer with 5 stars stating it&#x27;s the \\&quot;real deal\\&quot;.</li>

            <li> That is my secret, which I am now sharing with you, because I am some kind sorry for you being fooled.&lt;br /&gt;There are only two products that I use (four years, twice daily): Stevia Rebaudiana liquid concentrate and Opuntia ficus-indica seed oil.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>

            <li> this is my little subtle face lift in a jar and makes me feel  fantastic</li>
            <li> Have been using for almost 2 months absolutely no visible difference in my skin has definitely not reduced my fine lines</li>
            <li> I am in my late 30&#x27;s, have 3 children and the lines are starting to show!  I having been using this product for about 3 weeks on my \\&quot;crows feet\\&quot; and have noticed a difference.  I have used the product according to instructions.  I would recommend this product and will use again.</li>
            <li> Having been a sun worshipper my entire life - I am sad to say - crows feet started walking all over my eyes :(  That was until I bought this amazing product.  I have seen a definitive difference pretty quickly after using it.  I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, as this is a whole new phase of my life.  But I do know that the dreaded \\&quot;crows feet\\&quot; seem to have dwindled which is exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve been using Idrotherapy for 3 months and it has consistently been a great product all that time. This cream feels so smooth and refreshing on your skin. I use it exclusively because it makes my skin look so good.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon always has this product and the price is so reasonable for this great product and shipping is fast.Thanks</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a few weeks ago, it came promptly in the mail and I have already noticed a difference.  I will be recommending this product to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Idrotherapy for the wrinkles starting to appear around my eyes from being in the sun, squinting...etc over the years.  I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now and I am starting to see good results.  My lines are less deep and less noticeable.  I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Ok, gays. I accidentally stumbled here and for some reason I would like to leave a comment. This is the first, I mean literally the first time, I am giving a review (in fact, this is an advice) not about this product but about how to care your face skin.&lt;br /&gt;Forget about pharmaceutic products. They are not effective, or not much as to be some kind of wonder, or even they could damage your skin. Use natural products. That is my secret, which I am now sharing with you, because I am some kind sorry for you being fooled.&lt;br /&gt;There are only two products that I use (four years, twice daily): Stevia Rebaudiana liquid concentrate and Opuntia ficus-indica seed oil.&lt;br /&gt;You can’t believe how young I look!!! No wrinkles at all and face is taut and shiny. I’m 50 years old now, but literally I can walk through high school hallways and no one can tell the difference between me and students!!!&lt;br /&gt;Actually, I have done twice. The first time no one had noticed me. Next time (5 months ago) I want to draw attention to myself so I put on the head an orange/white turban. Five high-school girls in just half an hour wanted a date with me. They asked me in which class/grade I am :) Of course, I refused (I&#x27;m happily married :) I just wanted one cosmetic experiment to do.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I have to add that I am also practicing martial arts and Qigong, which also rejuvenate, but these products I mentioned are the keys.&lt;br /&gt;So, guys (and ladies too), use these products what I recommend, and you will see for yourself, trust me. Good luck!</li>
            <li> Like many other people who have fallin&#x27; into this trap of FRAUD!! I myself have been a victim of same.  Product came up on my PC and all this flashing &amp;#34;order free trail&amp;#34; &amp;#34;rush my order&amp;#34;  kept coming up in the screen.  To get you to avoid looking at the terms and conditions ( if u do not return product after 1month u will be charged €99.00). Scam scam and product does not work as they say it does. Will be bringing this to the courts.</li>
            <li> It is a scam.  It doesn&#x27;t work at all.  There hasn&#x27;t been the slightest change.  What is worse, the phone number given on their web site is not assigned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating -10</li>
            <li> Idrotherapy.com is a total fraud and their products and prices very dubious.&lt;br /&gt;Their marketing is not only misleading but a fraud in the making.&lt;br /&gt;Through an online advertisement I requested a free sample where supposedly I only had to pay the shipping charge. To my surprise, they made inappropriate charges to my VISA which I had not previously authorised. I have reported the police.&lt;br /&gt;Now I hope that Amazon takes knowledge of this and stop exhibiting and selling their products.</li>
            <li> This cream does not show any signs of improvement at all.  It makes your skin feel tight but no&lt;br /&gt;difference in the appearance.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My skin feels so soft and smooth and you can see the lines have disappeared.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Idrotherapy&#x27;s advertising is misleading.  The product was &#x27;free&#x27;.  When I received the package, I found out that I had signed up for automatic monthly renewals.  I cancelled the automatic shipments and then was told I needed to return the product or be charge $40.  I don&#x27;t believe that I should need to read all the fine print to discover these items.  I don&#x27;t do business with companies like this.</li>
            <li> I love it, my skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for about a week now do not like it. Seems to dry my skin out it does nothing for my skin at all I would return it but I don&#x27;t like doing things like that.  Really expensive also for the little dot in the jar.[[ASIN:B0086B2DLE Idrotherapy Wrinkle Reducer (0.5 oz)]]</li>
            <li> This product has a lovely feel to it but I don&#x27;t see the results that others are raving about.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Idrotherapy product after an advertisement popped up on my computer.  The advertisement stated that you could purchase a trial Idrotherapy for $3.98, and after 18 days if you didn&#x27;t cancel your order they would charge you $99.99.  Okay, so I ended up paying over the $99.99 for the product. After another week (almost a month)of trying this product, I really hadn&#x27;t see any difference over what I was already using.  When I called to cancel the Idrotherapy I was told that if I continued buying the product, and not cancel, they would charge me only $29!  There is a big difference between $100.00 and $29. So needless to say this company is a rip off and because of this I will not be buying any beauty product on line again without thoroughly checking it out first.  This was an expensive lesson.</li>
            <li> I love this product It really works well I have definitely seen a difference after using it  for a week.</li>
            <li> I used the idrotherapy with Essene of Argan Oil as advertised but the wrinkles are still there.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product and it doesn&#x27;t work. I have seen no results at all. It is a lot of money for something that I feel is inferior to in store products. Hang on to your money for a better choice. :)</li>
            <li> Not so sure - I spent a lot and did not find much results - I am a bit disappointed</li>
            <li> Did not see any results after using this product especailly for the price. Think way over priced.. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Has anyone else noticed that Kokiri1976 rates all of Mobilis&#x27; products with 5 stars? Gee, I wonder who HE works for? And the reason I say HE is because I have read his other product reviews (all Mobilis products)and found that he rated Xength X1 Male Performance Enhancer with 5 stars stating it&#x27;s the \\&quot;real deal\\&quot;. I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s not something a woman would do. So, why is a man rating a product whose primary target market is middle aged women? I&#x27;ve read the other reviews and it seems no one else is really fond of these products, so, don&#x27;t be fooled by one amazing review. Take the time to weigh the good reviews against the poor reviews before you give obvious scam artists your hard earned money!!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for over 5 weeks now and do not like it. Seems to dry on my skin and feels \\&quot;cakey\\&quot;.  It also didn&#x27;t seem to do anything for my skin. Really expensive and ineffective.</li>
            <li> I bought some of this for my wife as she has Rosacia and sensative skin so she can&#x27;t use just anything...She tried it out and it did not flare her condition up, as a matter of fact it helped her out greatly and she swears by it now, recommending it to all of her friends and family...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly a great product, it saved us a bundle on the assortment of other stuff she would otherwise use...</li>
            <li> i got this product for my forehead.  I tend to wrinkle my forehead, my face is very expressive.  Recently i have noticed that the lines were not going away and looking more permanent.  After a month of continued dedicated use of Idrotherapy, my wrinkles that i was thinking were permanent are not present unless my face is in one of its expressive moments again.  Thank you for this product.</li>
            <li> NO STARS DESERVED......A COMPLETE RIP OFF.  FOUR PAYMENTS DEDUCTED ILLEGALLY AND ONLY ONE PRODUCT OF THE CREAM AND ONE OF THE ARGAN OIL SENT.&lt;br /&gt;REPORTED THEM TO CONSUMER AFFAIRS IN AUSTRALIA.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now used two jars in conjunction with Idrotherapy cream and I can honestly say I have no idea what the hype was for these treatments. No noticeable difference to my skin or wrinkles</li>
