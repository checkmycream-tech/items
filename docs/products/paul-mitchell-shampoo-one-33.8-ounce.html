            <li>All I&#x27;ve used on my remaining hair for more than a decade.</li>

            <li>My favorite shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I choose this product because my husband and I have used this shampoo for about 6 years and have come to really love it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok considering the money and the size.</li>
            <li>The authentic product is 5 star, but the product I bought from amazon market place seller was not.</li>

            <li>I was very happy with my purchase, and I will be back.  </li>
            <li>Love the product but also love the price i paid for it.</li>
            <li>one is great for fine, normal, colored hair.&lt;br /&gt;leaves</li>
            <li>It cleans well, lathers up easily, and does not appear to leave a residue on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not always easy to find in shops.  </li>
            <li>This was an easy way to get my go-to shampoo at a discount.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t cause build up like cheap shampoos can do.</li>
            <li>gentle and leaves hair feeling healthy and smooth.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if this is a true Paul Mitchell product</li>
            <li>This size is a good saving and last 2 months</li>
            <li>Super product for fresh clean hair.</li>
            <li>It does not create a whole lot of suds which is fine with me.</li>
            <li>We lost our local outlet store for Paul Mitchell shampoos and salons charge amazing markups.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s such a nice shampoo, I don&#x27;t even need as much conditioner as I used to with off brand shampoos.</li>
            <li>Okay to use on a daily basis, but you need to use a conditioner along with it.</li>
            <li>My favorite Paul Mitchell daily shampoo.</li>
            <li>It had been a while since I used this shampoo, so I did not realize it at first, but this bottle I bought is almost certainly a counterfeit</li>
            <li>I got my first bottle of this shampoo for free from a friend last year, and I&#x27;ve been buying it ever since.</li>
            <li>Also that is why I purchase the LARGE size bottle.  </li>
            <li>This is a high quality product, consistently so, and reasonably priced at around $20 delivered with Prime.</li>
            <li>Either they have changed the formula or this is not the real</li>
            <li>It does not build up much.</li>
            <li>I looked everywhere for a reasonable price on Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Shampoo One, and Amazon solved the problem again.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery--just what I wanted</li>
            <li>Although I like to have some volume to my hair, I&#x27;ve found that I&#x27;m better off to get that volume by using some type of mousse or other type of volumizer than shampoos that promise to add volume to my hair.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance of this shampoo is not the same as the original that I purchased in a retail setting.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels better than other shampoos.  </li>
            <li>shampoo leaves my hair feeling silky clean and doesn&#x27;t make it feel flat at all.  </li>
            <li>I was able to purchase the 33.8 ounce bottle, and that will last me an entire six months.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells much more of coconut and the consistency is different, plus it leaves my hair flat and dull.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but in the long run is worth it</li>
            <li>It could be my imagination, but when I use those types of shampoos, I feel as though my hair is more difficult to get clean and on occasion, I wind up with an itchy head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair type (fine, blonde, long), but</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat the value in such a large bottle.</li>
            <li>so I was surprised to see t here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>had I actually received the real thing.</li>
            <li>Not a heavy shampoo</li>
            <li>Will stick to my old shampoo  Hair Loss/ Regrowth Shampoo -Enhanced</li>
            <li>The product I received was much thinner in consistency, had a different aroma and did not lather up the way it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>First problem, the printing started washing off the bottle when it got wet in the shower.</li>
            <li>We used to be able to purchase the large size here in our home town but the stores and other shops only carry the small size, or not at all.  </li>
            <li>Be careful buying this from a reseller on amazon - Paul Mitchell is very selective about who their retailers are.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased a new bottle of the same product from a salon and the difference is night and day.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather up very well and it leaves my hair a tangled mess, like a mop.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather up very well and it leaves my hair a tangled mess, like a mop.</li>
            <li> I purchase the large size and decant it into small bottles for the shower area.</li>
            <li> No build up of shampoo on your hair that will weight it down if you are frequently shampoo your hair.</li>
            <li> This product is one he can use every day if necessary and it doesn&#x27;t dry his hair out.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for a long time.</li>
            <li> Same product I would buy at the local store, but slightly cheaper and bought with the convenience of Amazon.  </li>
            <li> other less expensive shampoos have worked much better for me; namely Nexxus, Abba, and Matrix.</li>
            <li> Only con:  a little pricey</li>
            <li> decided to give it a try, I don&#x27;t like the way it makes our hair flat and a little oily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so we have it in a wall dispenser with the  detangler and 2 other  products for ease of use.</li>
            <li> and I realized it after I saw some of the other reviews.</li>
            <li> A very low price is usually an indicator of either counterfeit or stolen merchandise.</li>
            <li> I also purchased the pump, as the bottle is quite large, and difficult to pick up.  </li>
            <li> It seems to work well with southern California hard water chemistry.  </li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair with three small increments of shampoo because you really only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this shampoo a few days ago</li>
            <li> I am wondering if this might be a copy because of the heavy coconut fragrance.  </li>
            <li> and refunds are not available for this item.</li>
            <li> A waste of $20.</li>
            <li> Of all the shampoos I&#x27;ve used, this one is up in the top three worst of all for me.</li>
            <li> A small amount gives a lot of lather and sticks to your hair so you can wash it well.</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell Shampoo One is extremely causative and less expensive here than what it retails for in Sephora.</li>
            <li> We have hard water and it still lathers up well.</li>
            <li> Also, this bottle lasts me at least three to four months, even with two girls using it.</li>
            <li> As a man, I feel that if a man smells like any cosmetic product, that&#x27;s a bad thing.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this most of the time on my hair.</li>
            <li> We both like this product so we have it in a wall dispenser with the  detangler and 2 other  products for ease of use.</li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t beat Paul Mitchell products.  I&#x27;ve been using them for decades and will continue to use and recommend them.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this shampoo a few days ago and I love the way it makes my head and hair feel.  Although I like to have some volume to my hair, I&#x27;ve found that I&#x27;m better off to get that volume by using some type of mousse or other type of volumizer than shampoos that promise to add volume to my hair.  It could be my imagination, but when I use those types of shampoos, I feel as though my hair is more difficult to get clean and on occasion, I wind up with an itchy head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo leaves my hair feeling silky clean and doesn&#x27;t make it feel flat at all.  I love this product and my head doesn&#x27;t itch at all.</li>
            <li> Works great.  This bottle is the same stuff as the salons, but delivers to the house.  No build up of shampoo on your hair that will weight it down if you are frequently shampoo your hair.</li>
            <li> I started using Paul Mitchell products in the 80&#x27;s when I discovered he will not allow testing on animals. I have been using it ever since. It&#x27;s been kind to my hair and I am often complimented on how healthy my hair looks.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years. I&#x27;ve got oily hair and shampoo every 3 days. That should say something. Just found it with Amazon prime.</li>
            <li> this is the only shampoo i use. gentle and leaves hair feeling healthy and smooth.  i will continue to purchase this item.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for a long time. It cleans well, lathers up easily, and does not appear to leave a residue on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients (don&#x27;t you wish Amazon would list ingredients for this stuff like Drugstore.com does? I got these ingredients from Drugstore.com - couldn&#x27;t find this info on Amazon or even the Paul Mitchell Web site): Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamide MEA, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Panthenol, Bisamino PEG/PPG 41/3 Aminoethyl PG Propyl Dimethicone, Hedychium Coronarium Extract (White Ginger), PEG 12 Dimethicone, Bisamino PEG/PPG 41/3 Aminoethyl PG Propyl Dimethicone, Algae (Seaweed) Extract, Aloe Vera (Aloe Barbadensis) Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Roman Chamomile) Flower Extract, Lawsonia Inermis (Henna) Extract (Henna), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Extract (Jojoba), Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract (Rosemary), PEG 12 Dimethicone, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat Germ) Oil (Wheat), Polyquaternium 11, Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid, Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Magnesium Chloride, Magnesium Nitrate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Benzyl Alcohol, Coumarin</li>
            <li> We used to use Paul Mitchell products for years, my kids even used their kid&#x27;s &amp;#34;no tears&amp;#34; shampoo when they were small.&lt;br /&gt;We always bought it from the salon so I was surprised to see t here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give it a try, I don&#x27;t like the way it makes our hair flat and a little oily.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if this is a true Paul Mitchell product so be warned.&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy Paul Mitchell products from Amazon anymore.</li>
            <li> I bought a tiny sample (3.5 oz) of this shampoo to try out. It smells great - like pina colada - and that&#x27;s why I bought it. But that&#x27;s where the pros stop. It doesn&#x27;t lather up very well and it leaves my hair a tangled mess, like a mop. Of all the shampoos I&#x27;ve used, this one is up in the top three worst of all for me. Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair type (fine, blonde, long), but other less expensive shampoos have worked much better for me; namely Nexxus, Abba, and Matrix.</li>
            <li> The fragrance of this shampoo is not the same as the original that I purchased in a retail setting.  I am wondering if this might be a copy because of the heavy coconut fragrance.  It was also was not factory sealed.</li>
            <li> My favorite for years.  Leaves my hair healthy and shining.  Not always easy to find in shops.  I purchase the large size and decant it into small bottles for the shower area.</li>
            <li> Forgot how good it was when i was in my 20&#x27;s.  Now that i&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s my hair is more controllable.</li>
            <li> I got my first bottle of this shampoo for free from a friend last year, and I&#x27;ve been buying it ever since. I love this shampoo. It smells great and leaves my hair feeling clean. I usually wash my hair with three small increments of shampoo because you really only need a little bit. A small amount gives a lot of lather and sticks to your hair so you can wash it well. Because it&#x27;s such a nice shampoo, I don&#x27;t even need as much conditioner as I used to with off brand shampoos. Since using this, my hair is softer, shinier, and healthier than before. Also, this bottle lasts me at least three to four months, even with two girls using it. You can&#x27;t beat the value in such a large bottle.</li>
            <li> As a man, I feel that if a man smells like any cosmetic product, that&#x27;s a bad thing. This is unscented and works great. All I&#x27;ve used on my remaining hair for more than a decade.</li>
            <li> It had been a while since I used this shampoo, so I did not realize it at first, but this bottle I bought is almost certainly a counterfeit and I realized it after I saw some of the other reviews. Even after washing my hair twice this shampoo leaves my hair greasy and looking unwashed and the letters on the bottle have all washed off. Would have been a great bargain had I actually received the real thing.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for many years. Either they have changed the formula or this is not the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;It smells much more of coconut and the consistency is different, plus it leaves my hair flat and dull.&lt;br /&gt;I will be calling Paul Mitchell to report this and hope it&#x27;s an isolated incident.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo.  I like the way it rinses out.  It smells good.  It seems to work well with southern California hard water chemistry.  This is a high quality product, consistently so, and reasonably priced at around $20 delivered with Prime.</li>
            <li> Used it for years for myself and my husband.</li>
            <li> I choose this product because my husband and I have used this shampoo for about 6 years and have come to really love it.  Also that is why I purchase the LARGE size bottle.  We used to be able to purchase the large size here in our home town but the stores and other shops only carry the small size, or not at all.  Great product for our hair.  Thank you</li>
            <li> This is the shampoo I always use.  I love how my hair feels and the smell is yummy!</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell is always a good and safe product to buy.  I like this shampoo because I can use it daily or not as often and my hair will still feel good.  Not a heavy shampoo so works great on fine hair.</li>
            <li> I still lose hair after using it. It&#x27;s ok considering the money and the size. Will stick to my old shampoo  Hair Loss/ Regrowth Shampoo -Enhanced w/ Ketoconazole DHT Inhibitor,</li>
            <li> It is an excellent shampoo.  My hair looks and feels better than other shampoos.  It does not create a whole lot of suds which is fine with me.</li>
            <li> The authentic product is 5 star, but the product I bought from amazon market place seller was not. First problem, the printing started washing off the bottle when it got wet in the shower. Never had that happen before. The product I received was much thinner in consistency, had a different aroma and did not lather up the way it&#x27;s supposed to. I recently purchased a new bottle of the same product from a salon and the difference is night and day. Be careful buying this from a reseller on amazon - Paul Mitchell is very selective about who their retailers are. A very low price is usually an indicator of either counterfeit or stolen merchandise.</li>
            <li> Finally I&#x27;ve find the perfect shampoo for my hair. Perfect for daily use. This size is a good saving and last 2 months</li>
            <li> We lost our local outlet store for Paul Mitchell shampoos and salons charge amazing markups. This was an easy way to get my go-to shampoo at a discount.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve loved paul mitchell products for years.&lt;br /&gt;shampoo one is great for fine, normal, colored hair.&lt;br /&gt;leaves hair with nice feeling.&lt;br /&gt;i love the cocanut smell, reminds me of summer.</li>
            <li> Same product I would buy at the local store, but slightly cheaper and bought with the convenience of Amazon.  I have very fine hair and this shampoo works well for it.  It does not build up much.</li>
            <li> Super product for fresh clean hair.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.My hair is shiny and healthy/</li>
            <li> and refunds are not available for this item. A waste of $20. I would not buy from Atlas Pros Choice again.</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell Shampoo One is extremely causative and less expensive here than what it retails for in Sephora. Good Deal.</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere for a reasonable price on Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Shampoo One, and Amazon solved the problem again.  I was able to purchase the 33.8 ounce bottle, and that will last me an entire six months.  I also purchased the pump, as the bottle is quite large, and difficult to pick up.  I was very happy with my purchase, and I will be back.  Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;SJZ</li>
            <li> Love the product but also love the price i paid for it. Such a good deal for a good shampoo!</li>
            <li> Bought this many time before - love the coconut scent and it makes my hair feel great. We have hard water and it still lathers up well.</li>
            <li> Okay to use on a daily basis, but you need to use a conditioner along with it.</li>
            <li> My favorite Paul Mitchell daily shampoo. Doesn&#x27;t cause build up like cheap shampoos can do.</li>
            <li> great product...smells nice and great price...better than the store bought stuff...and its animal cruelty free...PM has 2 b a geat guy</li>
            <li> Fast delivery--just what I wanted</li>
            <li> My husband has course, wavy, &amp;#34;Italian&amp;#34; hair and has to have a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;build up&amp;#34;.  This product is one he can use every day if necessary and it doesn&#x27;t dry his hair out.  He has tried numerous brands and this is the one he likes.  Only con:  a little pricey but in the long run is worth it</li>
            <li> A fair price with quick delivery.</li>
