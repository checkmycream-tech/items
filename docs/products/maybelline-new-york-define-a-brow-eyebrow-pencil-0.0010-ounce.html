    <ol>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>and what are you going to do when you want the perfect color and can&#x27;t get it elsewhere?)</li>
            <li>I am not recommending you shave off your eyebrows today, buy this pencil, and it will draw on perfect eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Maybelling Define a brow is an awesome product.</li>
            <li>My cousin was very happy with the price.  </li>
            <li>Excellent service and product!</li>
            <li>They look great and she loves this pencil to make them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m saying that if you DO decide to do this, this pencil works great.</li>
            <li>is great for me.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy to have the product I want and the added convenience.</li>
            <li>People are noticing my eyes and commenting how great they look!All</li>
            <li>I wish I could find one that would be as good as this one.</li>
            <li>I am glad I found this!</li>
            <li>The product says it is waterproof, and it was very easy to wipe off with one swipe of my finger.  </li>
            <li>When I found it on line and it was able to be delivered to me at home, I was thrilled.</li>
            <li>I have very light blond hair</li>
            <li>and I have difficulty finding very light brown pencils.</li>
            <li>This is the best product for blondes, and I will hope maybelline brings out another similar product!</li>
            <li>Maybelline doesn&#x27;t make this any more.  </li>
            <li>but I am glad I was able to snag a couple before they all disappeared.  </li>
            <li>It is the perfect color with no red undertones.</li>
            <li>It allows me to create a much more defined brow.</li>
            <li>&amp; I have never been so satisfied with a brow pencil as I am with this.</li>
            <li>Love the color</li>
            <li>The light blonde is the perfect shade for my brows.</li>
            <li>My hair is light ash blonde &amp; this color is perfect.</li>
            <li>It came very quickly and was just what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply in feathery strokes.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy and stays?</li>
            <li>Interesting but true title.</li>
            <li>I have dark blond/light brown hair and this pencil is the perfect color for me and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  </li>
            <li>I use this to fill in some places were hair is thinned out or missing, and the results are absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li>Light.</li>
            <li>I agree with the reviewer who cautioned that the tip breaks off very easily, even when you don&#x27;t turn it up very high</li>
            <li>Very happy with this product, light blonde is a hard color to find in an eyebrow pencil, this one works great</li>
            <li>The consistency was perfect- easy to apply, not greasy and not too hard.</li>
            <li>The shade is great and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>I assume the the marketplace dealer that provided my eyebrow pencils rapidly and exactly as ordered but for lots more money than Walmart charges (when they have it...</li>
            <li>There are some still around, but at three times the original price.  </li>
            <li>My brow color is very light and the light blonde is the best choice for adding a little color to them.</li>
            <li>If I ever tried one,I would quickly wash them off.</li>
            <li>Works better than a normal brow</li>
            <li>I am a natural blonde,which means my eyebrows are very light.</li>
            <li>It just gives my brows a more natural look.</li>
            <li>(light blonde is the perfect color for a grey-haired 70 year old woman with formerly dark blond hair).</li>
            <li>The drawback is that clumps of it can break off if you twist too much of it out at once, and it gets used up quickly.</li>
            <li>I bought my first Define-A-Brow eyebrow pencil at Walmart for probably around $6.00.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li>Only eyebrow pencil I ever liked since it&#x27;s light enough</li>
            <li>I like the color, but it can break easily if you are not careful.</li>
            <li>I really like the Define-A-Brow product and the light blonde color</li>
            <li>Stays on well, doesn&#x27;t streak, and fills in sparse brows very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks everybody.</li>
            <li>Could not find my color (light blonde) in any store so had to resort to internet.  </li>
            <li>It really defines my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Again, I love the product and love the speed with which it was delivered, but as I said, I&#x27;m confused.</li>
            <li>I dye my eyebrows a medium blonde shade to match my colored hair, and this is the first pencil I&#x27;ve found that actually goes on BLONDE and blends in gorgeously with the eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Most colors are too dark for blonds;  This one isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Before you shop Amazon for this particular item, check with CVS.</li>
            <li>It is twice as much as I normally pay for this product,  </li>
            <li>I hope I will always be able to find this shade, and I really wish other companies would make a truly blonde pencil.</li>
            <li>I like this brow color because it is light enough for use on medium blonde brows.</li>
            <li>I go through these frequently and living in New Mexico, this is not a color the stores carry.</li>
            <li>She is really amazing at doing makeup and you hardly notice her eyebrows are even different.</li>
            <li>Lots of lighter colors of more expensive pencils have a greenish tinge to them, but this has no tinge of green - just a great dark blond color.</li>
            <li>I was curious to try out an eyebrow pencil especially for light blonde hair.</li>
            <li>There are so few self-sharpening pencils with a light blonde shade...</li>
            <li>But, at least it was available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I also love how thin the pencil is.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> due to an eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> and I bought it here &#x27;cause the blonde is hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> This product was nearly as hard as the brown filler, and it tended to clump in the hairs and looked messy</li>
            <li> I hard a finding this again after using it for years.</li>
            <li> It might work for someone with thick eyebrows.</li>
            <li> ... FRUSTRATING.  </li>
            <li> Its hard to find a neutral blond color that works with out looking artificial.</li>
            <li> Wish they were a little cheaper becasue after I bought them, I found them at Walmart a $1.00 cheaper! :-(</li>
            <li> Difficult to apply and to twist up.</li>
            <li> Sorry Maybelline discontinued this color</li>
            <li> but the cost is getting expensive.</li>
            <li> Too bad it&#x27;s now discontinued.</li>
            <li> I hated how artificial they made my eyebrows look.</li>

            <li> I like the color, but it can break easily if you are not careful. The big comb on the end is just that - too big. It might work for someone with thick eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It came very quickly and was just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I keep coming back to Maybelline, but they do break easier than they used to when using.</li>
            <li> I like this brow color because it is light enough for use on medium blonde brows. It&#x27;s easy to apply in feathery strokes. The drawback is that clumps of it can break off if you twist too much of it out at once, and it gets used up quickly.</li>
            <li> Difficult to apply and to twist up.</li>
            <li> I needed the product but the local stores in my little town were out of it.  It is twice as much as I normally pay for this product,  Next, time my local stores have this in stock I will buy several.  But, at least it was available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about this eyebrow pencil. The shade is great and lasts all day long. I even find myself using the built-in brow comb occasionally. Great product!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product, light blonde is a hard color to find in an eyebrow pencil, this one works great</li>
            <li> I bought my first Define-A-Brow eyebrow pencil at Walmart for probably around $6.00. Then they stopped selling the color I wanted (light blonde is the perfect color for a grey-haired 70 year old woman with formerly dark blond hair). So I shopped Walgreens and found it for about $8.00. When they no longer carried my color in the two towns where I shop, I went online and found it through Amazon. So I ordered four of them at a time at about $11.00 apiece. When they came, they each had a sticker which said,&amp;#34;This item is intended for sale at CVS/pharmacy Store #9193 1380 43rd St. (with no city listed). If found at other outlets call 866-439-8724.&amp;#34; So I called that number (a CVS fraud line). They told me they would look into it. This has been several weeks now and I haven&#x27;t heard back. I assume the the marketplace dealer that provided my eyebrow pencils rapidly and exactly as ordered but for lots more money than Walmart charges (when they have it...and what are you going to do when you want the perfect color and can&#x27;t get it elsewhere?), actually obtained the pencils from CVS. How else to explain the four stickers? So maybe next time I&#x27;ll just find a CVS pharmacy and hope they carry the color that Walmart and Walgreens stopped carrying. Again, I love the product and love the speed with which it was delivered, but as I said, I&#x27;m confused. Before you shop Amazon for this particular item, check with CVS.</li>
            <li> Most colors are too dark for blonds;  This one isn&#x27;t.  And I can&#x27;t find it in the stores.  Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li> Only eyebrow pencil I ever liked since it&#x27;s light enough and I don&#x27;t have to sharpen it. Too bad it&#x27;s now discontinued.</li>
            <li> Thank you for having some of these discontinued eyebrow pencils in stock!  This is the best product for blondes, and I will hope maybelline brings out another similar product!</li>
            <li> Interesting but true title. My friend shaved off her eyebrows and draws them in. They look great and she loves this pencil to make them. She is really amazing at doing makeup and you hardly notice her eyebrows are even different. I am not recommending you shave off your eyebrows today, buy this pencil, and it will draw on perfect eyebrows. I&#x27;m saying that if you DO decide to do this, this pencil works great.</li>

            <li> I bought this for my Mom who is a blond...she loves it!!!</li>
            <li> the stores I have access to do not carry the lt. blonde eyebrow pencil,. I have used the Maybelline Define A Brow for years and want nothing else. When I found it on line and it was able to be delivered to me at home, I was thrilled. I am so happy to have the product I want and the added convenience. Thanks everybody.</li>
            <li> Maybelling Define a brow is an awesome product. Could not find my color (light blonde) in any store so had to resort to internet.  Thank you! Will be ordering again soon.  Diane. Johnson</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand why it is being discontinued</li>
            <li> The light blonde is the perfect shade for my brows. My brows are almost invisible without this liner. It is the perfect color with no red undertones. I also love how thin the pencil is. It allows me to create a much more defined brow. It just gives my brows a more natural look. The only down side is, there is not much pencil. I go through these frequently and living in New Mexico, this is not a color the stores carry.</li>
            <li> I hard a finding this again after using it for years. My brow color is very light and the light blonde is the best choice for adding a little color to them. Wish they wouldn&#x27;t discontinue it.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy and stays? Works better than a normal brow pencil.&lt;br /&gt;Just filling the tw en Ty word min</li>
            <li> Almost every &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; eyebrow pencil I have ever tried actually goes on taupe or brown, from Avon and Anastasia to Revlon and Lancome.  I dye my eyebrows a medium blonde shade to match my colored hair, and this is the first pencil I&#x27;ve found that actually goes on BLONDE and blends in gorgeously with the eyebrows. I use this to fill in some places were hair is thinned out or missing, and the results are absolutely perfect. Use short, feathery strokes for a lighter blonde look, or pencil it on thicker if you want it to be a bit darker.  I hope I will always be able to find this shade, and I really wish other companies would make a truly blonde pencil.</li>
            <li> Wish they still made this!!</li>
            <li> There are so few self-sharpening pencils with a light blonde shade...thank you Maybelling!</li>
            <li> My cousin was very happy with the price.  Thank you.  Went to reorder again an. Five. Stars was out of the. Light. Blonde</li>
            <li> Its hard to find a neutral blond color that works with out looking artificial. This pencil provides enough definition to do the job.</li>
            <li> This product was nearly as hard as the brown filler, and it tended to clump in the hairs and looked messy</li>
            <li> My hair is light ash blonde &amp; this color is perfect. I still can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s discontinued. I used this for years &amp; I have never been so satisfied with a brow pencil as I am with this. I wish I could find one that would be as good as this one.</li>
            <li> I have never been a fan of eyebrow pencils.If I ever tried one,I would quickly wash them off.I hated how artificial they made my eyebrows look.I am a natural blonde,which means my eyebrows are very light.I was curious to try out an eyebrow pencil especially for light blonde hair.I tried it,and it blended so nice and doesn&#x27;t look at all artificial.It really defines my eyebrows.People are noticing my eyes and commenting how great they look!All due to an eyebrow pencil.I am glad I found this!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a problem with the color, but with the lack of amount of product and the lack of staying power.  The product says it is waterproof, and it was very easy to wipe off with one swipe of my finger.  I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Excellent service and product!</li>
            <li> The only thing my daughter uses. Wish they were a little cheaper becasue after I bought them, I found them at Walmart a $1.00 cheaper! :-(</li>
            <li> I agree with the reviewer who cautioned that the tip breaks off very easily, even when you don&#x27;t turn it up very high ... FRUSTRATING.  Love the color and I bought it here &#x27;cause the blonde is hard to find in stores.  But I&#x27;m going to look for another product in the future.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have very light blond hair and I have difficulty finding very light brown pencils. This color works well with my hair color.</li>
            <li> I wish I could still find this but the cost is getting expensive.</li>
