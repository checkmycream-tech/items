            <li>, it is perfect for long hair.</li>
            <li>Well made perfect size for long hair</li>
            <li>I have fine hair but a lot of it.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and the balls on the end of the bristles don&#x27;t comb it</li>

            <li>This brush goes through my hair smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Haha, I really liked the gel grip</li>
            <li>Scratch free bristles.  </li>
            <li>Great, comfortable handle, nice quantity of bristlea that are not too flimsy but not too hard.</li>
            <li>Exactly as pictured and the bristles don&#x27;t break easily.</li>
            <li>The feature which really catapults this brush over its competitors is the super comfortable gel handle.</li>

            <li>Love the soft handle, and it works very well for my hair.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>This bruch was exactly what I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li>The soft gel grip is extremely comfortable.</li>
            <li>Soft on the scalp and a comfortable handle.</li>
            <li>Love these brushes and I have multiple!</li>
            <li>- this was my first gel grip hairbrush</li>
            <li>I really like this brush</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t like buying a hairbrush unless I can see it and feel it, but this was precisely what I wanted -- a good half-round brush with bristle tips that don&#x27;t hurt my scalp or snag my long hair.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a decent brush with the gelly grip</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Easily keeps me tangle free when used on wet hair and does not over groom or flatten my hair when I use after round brush ( also conair gel handle brush) hair drying.</li>
            <li>The reason igot the second brush was becaise my teenage daughter stole my original one</li>
            <li>First experience buying hair products online was definitely a plus in this case.</li>
            <li>I love the brush part too because it isn&#x27;t too soft and isn&#x27;t too hard on the scalp.</li>
            <li>Soft squishy handles.  </li>
            <li>OK, it&#x27;s a lot thick.</li>
            <li>It might be good for thin hair, or naturally straight hair, but for thick hair with a lil curl to it, this brush leaves you wanting a little more.</li>
            <li>so I had to search for a new one online and finally found it</li>
            <li>wish I had gotten to choose the color of my hairbrush before I bought it, as I really didn&#x27;t want a pink hairbrush.</li>

            <li> I love this hairbrush!  The back of the brush is hard plastic without  the rubber cushioning at the base of the head which has a tendency to rip and tear over time. The bristles are semi-rigid with ball tips which allows for effective brushing  and tangle removal while still being comfortable on the scalp.

            <li> Ordered as a cat brush. My cat loves it. ;-)</li>
            <li> Love this brush!!  I have thin frizzy hair and have a hard time finding a brush that doesn&#x27;t rip my hair out.  This brush goes through my hair smoothly.  Most excellent!!!</li>

            <li> Great. Soft on the scalp and a comfortable handle. Love these brushes and I have multiple!</li>
            <li> Very comfortable handle and feel good bristles. My favorite brush ever. I have fine hair but a lot of it. Easily keeps me tangle free when used on wet hair and does not over groom or flatten my hair when I use after round brush ( also conair gel handle brush) hair drying. Handle snapped off after about 5 years of use. I said \\&quot;darn it\\&quot; &amp; bought another  just like it.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and the balls on the end of the bristles don&#x27;t comb it</li>
            <li> The hairbrush is really nice and feels good on my scalp. It&#x27;s a hairbrush that works - what else can you say about it? Haha, I really liked the gel grip - this was my first gel grip hairbrush and I&#x27;ve liked it a lot. The bristles feel very strong, yet flexible enough to bend (not break) if you brush too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had gotten to choose the color of my hairbrush before I bought it, as I really didn&#x27;t want a pink hairbrush. Five stars if that changes, but otherwise it is a nice hairbrush. I like it. The price was good and it works as described.

            <li> Great brushes. Soft squishy handles.  Scratch free bristles.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this brush!!  Works well with my hair dryer!</li>
            <li> I have used a brush like this for years and sought this one as a replacement.  I love the soft gel handle.</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured and the bristles don&#x27;t break easily.I had one of these Conair brushes for years until I lost it so I had to search for a new one online and finally found it, Works great for people like me with long/coarse hair.</li>
