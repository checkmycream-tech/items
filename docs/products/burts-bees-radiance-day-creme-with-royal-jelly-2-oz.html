            <li>Very effective</li>
            <li>Love how this feels on my skin and smells great!</li>
            <li>At the time the product was very good, notably the Radiance line of Day &amp; Night cremes.</li>
            <li>My mother has also started to use this cream and is having equally good results with it</li>
            <li>really good</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t made me break out, and my skin is fairly breakout-prone in the winter.  </li>
            <li>this stuff seems to be working nicely-this was a good buy.</li>
            <li>Again I&#x27;m impressed on how light it is considering it is a cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m assuming this is good since it is Burt&#x27;s Bees, but it was a gift</li>
            <li>The cream takes a good 10-seconds longer to soak into the skin compared to over the counter creams like Oil of Olay</li>
            <li>Just as good as the $30 dollar and up creams.  </li>
            <li>This cream feels so good on my skin.</li>
            <li>smell, and have always loved Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
            <li>the way there are some good products they still make, but</li>
            <li>The texture is light and perfect.</li>
            <li>Non greasy and feels good on your skin.  </li>
            <li>Any one can try and you will see good results.</li>
            <li>any one has recommendations for a good face hydrating creme, let me know.</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>Neutrogena&#x27;s Healthy radiance is another great option plus it has SPF.</li>
            <li>But it is better as I feel a sense of joy</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>I am sure it will fit perfectly to my needs.</li>
            <li>it just works better!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say how much I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this cream!</li>
            <li>It seems like some people have come upon &amp;#34;bad batches&amp;#34; of this face cream, beause I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I have written a post about the Burt&#x27;s Bees apricot scrub as well, this is kind of joined with that review.  </li>
            <li>at your own risk.</li>
            <li>Nice, fluffs up the skin to diminish wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It makes a nice foundation for my make-up.</li>
            <li>It goes on non-greasy, and keeps my face nice and supple all day.  </li>
            <li>It is especially useful for people who struggle with acne.</li>
            <li>I have advocated the products to many people and have made many convert!</li>
            <li>This Cream has a Nice very light scent to&lt;br /&gt;It.</li>
            <li>Love this product - i highly recommend its a wonderful moisturizer for all day wear.</li>
            <li>Is Burt&#x27;s Bees no longer the amazing company that started in Raleigh, NC many years ago?</li>
            <li>Really cheap and smells good.</li>
            <li>Light feel &amp; good fragrence.</li>
            <li>It is light, smells good, and keeps my skin moist without being greasy.</li>
            <li>So far the best moisturizer ever used.</li>
            <li>PLEASE explain the truth to what has happened to my tried and true products?!?!</li>
            <li>I am excited about trying more Burt&#x27;s Bees products, if they all continue to be this good.</li>
            <li>but it is very smooth and even.  </li>
            <li>It gives me a nice smooth skin.</li>
            <li>I am really very exited to use it, yay and happy</li>
            <li>I am in love.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>I love burts bees</li>
            <li>Now it is overwhelming with an isopropyl alcohol scent and burns my skin.</li>
            <li>Between these three products, I have have thrown away more than $50.</li>
            <li>although it&#x27;s labelled &amp;#34;day cream&amp;#34;, i took it as night cream often:)</li>
            <li>I love this cream.  </li>
            <li>As for the radiance aspect, I can&#x27;t say my skin is more radiant or not.  </li>
            <li>And to top it off, after using it for a couple of days</li>
            <li>I bought two more online</li>
            <li>Which was okay</li>
            <li>TO  MOST  </li>
            <li>So Cal, I need a bit more moisturizer than this product.</li>
            <li>Love Burt&#x27; Bees products.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li>eh, I usu love burts bees</li>
            <li>Feels good, smells good and it&#x27;s all natural.  </li>
            <li>Love it, the product speaks for itself, there&#x27;s nothing that works as well as Burts Bee&#x27;s Day, and night creams, I use all of their products.</li>
            <li>We are glad to have found it.</li>
            <li>love this skin cream.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Love all Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
            <li>The smell is okay.</li>
            <li>It does not smell like you are in a field of flowers or surrounded by mangoes like most beauty products do, but I am okay with that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love witch hazel.</li>
            <li>If that doesnâ€™t work, I will gladly reorder this</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so SMOOTH!</li>
            <li>I also love all the benefits it has.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure by now we all know the lovely product that is coconut oil.</li>
            <li>Even longer if you take better care of them.</li>
            <li>There are a lot of varieties of different ingredients added to the sponges, so I am sure you can find one that works best for your skin.</li>
            <li>we be more hooked on processed sugar if we feed our skin with it?</li>
            <li>Makes me feel that much more confident about myself.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite day cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and non-greasy - my skin loves putting it on in the morning!</li>
            <li>Very happy face feels soft and  smooth</li>
            <li>I really love this day creme.</li>
            <li>The old formula was awesome and you could see and feel the true radiance...</li>
            <li>Nice clean smell.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of most Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s products, but the fragrance of this is quite strong and doesn&#x27;t agree with my skin or my nose.</li>
            <li>the rest of Burt Bees products are pretty good.</li>
            <li>I hope you return to the original formulations, and please let me know when you do!</li>
            <li>And as I said, it absorbs very quickly which I love.</li>
            <li>my skin is dry the day cream is wonderful</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t think of a more natural product that I trusted impeccably.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, this is one of my favorite perfumes</li>
            <li>Most importantly, it suits my skin well.</li>
            <li>My skin has never been more smooth in my life.</li>
            <li>And I can already tell it helps make my skin more smooth.</li>
            <li>Really love this product - it is light and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Great beauty product made using natural bee wax.</li>
            <li>I tend to go for more of a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; smell like Neutrogena original face wash and after applying this on</li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly into your skin and the smell goes away once it does.</li>
            <li>I strongly encourage you all to try it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but the grips seem really good and the boot itself seems like it will definitely keep my feet warm.</li>
            <li>I have experience this kind of issue first time.</li>
            <li>However, by comparison, this still is a fine product by any standards.  </li>
            <li>I had to quickly wash it off!  </li>
            <li>great night time product also, especially for those who need gluten free cosmetics.</li>
            <li>I have always been a huge fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees products, and this skin cream is no exception.  </li>
            <li>quite comfortable with it on face.</li>
            <li>Skin feels smooth and supple.</li>
            <li>SMOOTH  </li>
            <li>The jar doesn&#x27;t smell great, but it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m walking around smelling gross all day; all traces are gone within a couple minutes of application.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a light moisturizer it should do the trick.</li>
            <li>was using Kate Sommerville&#x27;s oil free moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Hey If it&#x27;s FREE its for me.  </li>
            <li>It makes a fantastic lotion.</li>
            <li>Does not feel like a smooth cream.</li>
            <li>I miss what this company stood for and the all natural good for me products.</li>
            <li>Smells good and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Love the whole Radiance line - and this is my favorite product in it.  </li>
            <li>On top of this, it gives my skin just the right amount of moisture without making it greasy...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores like previously used products and has a nice light feel and pleasant - not overbearing - scent.</li>
            <li>; it just smelled kinda strong, not bad.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Eye Cream for my face (it made the delicate skin around my eyes break out but was great everywhere else), and the strong smell of lanolin in the eye cream worked fine with the smell of whatever-it-is</li>
            <li>The consistency is a perfect balance of wet and creamy (more on the wet side, which feels so nice on overdried skin).</li>
            <li>I am not in love with it, because it leaves your skin feeling greasy at first.</li>
            <li>They changed the formula--when I wrote to complain about this, they explained that it had something to do with removing borax (sodium borate) from the original formula and replacing it with others.  </li>
            <li>This cream smells pretty good, although my granddaughter doesn&#x27;t care for it, and does a decent job of moisturizing for the money.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had such great success with the apricot scrub</li>
            <li>It soaks into the skin quickly, and is light and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>more importantly, it&#x27;s helping to even out the tone of my skin, and even gives it a gentle glow.  </li>
            <li>I have used a lot of different creams over the years and this is the best one so far.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my face soft without making it oily and a jar last me six months, which is great!</li>
            <li>My face feels super smooth and silky and I&#x27;ve noticed my crows feet have diminished since I started using it.</li>
            <li>I find them to definitely be a positive addition to my skincare routine and will be buying more.</li>
            <li>Goes on light, doesn&#x27;t take very much!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  gotten hard to find in my area so this is the perfect answer.</li>
            <li>BUT, the smell in sickeningly sweet.</li>
            <li>Spreads on differently then the nighttime version but still good</li>
            <li>and I love it, and my skin is so much clearer.  </li>
            <li>(I used to be able to use a jar for a year, now I need literally twice as much).  </li>
            <li>Even w/my combination skin, it made me have mild</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer, and the price is much better on Amazon than at my local stores.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping also.</li>
            <li>This is the best overall daily moisturizer I have used.</li>
            <li>It soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li>Absorbs rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>Wish there was a little bit more arch support, but I like the boots because they fit under the jeans easily or could be worn with leggings on a warmer day to show off the cute buckles.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s better for normal to oily skin type.</li>
            <li>I use a Konjac Sponge for a more natural version of a loofah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so far really loving this routine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Rosehip Oil is my new love when it comes to beauty products.</li>
            <li>but I feel like women in general get sold so much snake oil, so when I find a product that works well AND is priced fairly</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and cannot use most products out there.</li>
            <li>The lotion smells exactly like Ralph Lauren&#x27;s Ralph (the original).</li>
            <li>Have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Day &amp; Night creams with Royal Jelly for several years and really satisfied!</li>
            <li>It is overall a very good facial lotion that works well when applied before makeup.</li>
            <li>Again, there are plenty of websites out there that preach the amazing reasons to use this essential oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As it is, I&#x27;ll be sending them a nice email requesting my money back.      </li>
            <li>It is lightweight and easily absorbed for use under make-up, yet does the job well.</li>
            <li>And to be perfectly honest, the only reason I am using a separate moisturizer for daytime and nighttime is</li>
            <li>Oh wait, did I mention about the fresh fragrance it has.</li>
            <li>Over all, I think they were definitely worth the $33 dollars that I paid for them,</li>
            <li>Have fun</li>
            <li>I find it makes my skin very clean and surprisingly soft.</li>
            <li>right before if you wear coverup on your face.</li>
            <li>And it soaks in well but seems to have a long-lasting moisturizing effect (which is good, because I have dry skin and am allergic to almost every moisturizer except petroleum jelly or pure jojoba oil).  </li>
            <li>Love this kind because its not too thick</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent lots of money looking for something, because I really do believe that at thirty, you have to start taking good care of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However, the eye cream is pretty pricy to use for my whole face, so I ordered the day cream to try as a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One mitigating factor regarding the scent: it fades quickly.  </li>
            <li>thus skin care is very important at this crucial juncture.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, it is in a cute little bottle, and my skin feels ready to tackle the day after using it.</li>
            <li>The first product I used was the Apricot Baby Oil for my then unborn baby.</li>
            <li>My wife noticed it smelled funny, so I asked her to pick up a can at the pharmacy and we&#x27;d compare.  </li>
            <li>I had never tried any of Burt&#x27;s Bees products, I was watching one of the morning programs and they mentioned the lip balm, I happened to be on Amazon and saw this and was running low on my day cream and thought I&#x27;d give it a try, so glad I did</li>
            <li>I love this facial cream!!</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of most ofthe Burts Bees products</li>
            <li>used to love Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s, but they must have changed a lot (possibly all) of their formulas and/or were bought out by another company.</li>
            <li>On the whole, it&#x27;s the kind of product I have been looking for for long.</li>
            <li>*yum*), and decided to try it again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and love it.  </li>
            <li>I began using Burt&#x27;s about 7 years ago when it first hit the market.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a good way to slow down and give your face a good mini-massage until every drop is absorbed.</li>
            <li>My skin is very soft, and I love that it is natural.</li>
            <li>Good facial lotion, the only problem is the odor when I first started using the lotion.</li>
            <li>considering other websites are selling them in the $70-120 range - after all, they are rated to keep your feet warm to -25 degrees.</li>
            <li>It keeps the dryness away without leaving a greasy mess, and absorbs very nicely, leaving my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>I assume they&#x27;re trying to cover up the smell of active ingredients with some kind of fragrance; it&#x27;s not working.  </li>
            <li>Sure enough, this smells nothing like the REAL product.  </li>
            <li>I now have a separate high-SPF facial sunblock that I use, so I thought I would buy the version of this day cream without SPF since I used to love it so much.</li>
            <li>The new \\&quot;99%\\&quot; natural formula does not smell as good or seem to rejuvenate skin like the old \\&quot;98.2%\\&quot; natural formula.</li>
            <li>cream has a nice light scent to it, does not feel heavy, &amp; keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling super soft without looking oily.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly rather than sitting on top of dry skin like some creams, and leaves my face feeling soft and moisturized, but not greasy.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much after I finished my first little jar</li>
            <li>I bought some at my local Walmart and it was just fine.</li>
            <li>It feels refreshing and exactly like any other toner I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This is light enough, but still does the job.</li>
            <li>The real slap in the face was the Tomato toner which I discovered over 10 years ago...</li>
            <li>Amazon is purporting this to be the real thing by utilizing the REAL packaging while distributing a KNOCK OFF.  </li>
            <li>before I go to bed, that works really well for me.</li>
            <li>Did not find much difference as promised.</li>
            <li>I guess there is a reason why the price was so much cheaper than the store...</li>
            <li>and it does absolutely</li>
            <li>So back to the stuff filled with chemicals-</li>
            <li>Thanks Burt &#x27; Bees.</li>
            <li>have very problematic skin, I&#x27;m thirty and still break out.</li>
            <li>two days I noticed that my skin looked really dewy and radiant, something that never happened with the Kate Sommerville.</li>
            <li>I l;ike this cream because it&#x27;s not sticky, but really softens my face and stays on all day.  </li>
            <li>When i received this product, it has the plastic slink wrap around the jar and it was really sticky...</li>
            <li>but this face cream has been a godsend in a very tortuous time for my skin</li>
            <li>so much I&#x27;ve also started using the night cream.</li>
            <li>After application it dries up and disappears very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Failed to impress.</li>
            <li>Absolutely foul.</li>
            <li>I have recently been trying to find a more natural and organic skin care routine.</li>
            <li>There may be more pricey, nicer creams out there, but I am not willing to drop $50 or $60 on them at this point.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve kept using it because it evens my combination skin out and makes it look healthier, much more so than other cremes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I also haven&#x27;t played around with many creams, other than Neutrogena.</li>
            <li>My skin breaks out easily due to the hormonal shifts that being in your 40&#x27;s can bring, and this product never contributes to that tendency, as many others do.</li>
            <li>To make this short, it&#x27;s one of the most sever forms of acne and is incredibly scaring and very difficult to treat.  </li>
            <li>My mom has been using it for years and is almost 50 and doesn&#x27;t have a single wrinkle and her skin looks soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>Next I plan to try and make a more natural hair care routine, and then find natural alternatives for deodorant and toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Not a bad purchase especially for winter times.</li>
            <li>I have remained loyal and faithful until recently.  </li>
            <li>mild enough for my face.</li>
            <li>I understand that popularity dictated larger production scale... but the recent changes seem more profit based rather than customer satisfaction.  </li>
            <li>Havnt tried the older version and so cant compare.</li>
            <li>and my skin does feel softer, which is an acomplishment given my high altitude location</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never spend on the high end day creams again</li>
            <li>If you donâ€™t use toners, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Personally I would buy the product from in store only to make sure you get the real product and not a deffective or old version as with all skin cremes.</li>
            <li>but I also know there is a large segment of people who, when buying natural products, don&#x27;t want to feel like they just been hosed</li>
            <li>Meaning that it doesnâ€™t smell wonderful like a perfume, but the smell isnâ€™t bad and take away from the awesomeness of this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d prefer a more firm cream, night or day.</li>
            <li>I even bought a variety pack to share with my children, and other than the peppermint, they may as well be cheap smelling fruity concoctions.</li>
            <li>This little jar was cutely packaged and promised natural radiance that included royal jelly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The KonjacSponges are a new addition to my routine.</li>
            <li>This item is non greasy and keeps my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>i like it very much, thus have bought several times.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Love this product ing with other Burt&#x27;s Bess products!!!</li>
            <li>First off - this is not the same product sold in the stores - or for that matter what they&#x27;re advertising here on this site!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is lightweight and would work well under makeup but even better as a nightcream because it left my skin extremely oily.</li>
            <li>They are so soft!</li>
            <li>It also had a sort of natural shimmer (or radiance, if you will) that is not replicated in this new product or in the new Night Creme.</li>
            <li>I can see why they did that, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve succeeded in making a new formula that works as well as the old one.</li>
            <li>I will update in a month or so to see if the results are consistent, but so far I cannot recommend this product enough!</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel just right, never oily or dry.</li>
            <li>Stickier than Caudelie or L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s Immortelle creams---don&#x27;t use too much, you just need a little pat of cream to cover your face in the summer and probably more in winter--but it seems to give the same glow as the higher priced skin creams (provided you do a proper skin regiment---exfoliate, use toner to remove dirt from pores, deep pore extractions every few weeks, and a light alpha-hydroxy monthly peel).</li>
            <li>A little too light for my taste.  </li>
            <li>, in fact I think it&#x27;s helped clear my acne up in conjunction with my routine of using philosophy face wash and my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>It seemed that the old formula day cream used to last much longer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be surprised.</li>
            <li>I have been a nearly 20 year Burt&#x27;s Bees Devotee...</li>
            <li>I AM nearly 41...</li>
            <li>Do yourself a a favor - spend the extra dollar at Walgreens and buy the real stuff.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin -try</li>
            <li>I also tend to get red spots around my eyes and apples of cheeks, but haven&#x27;t seen much of that since I began using this product.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to smell do not buy this.</li>
            <li>Wow.. Wish I could give this no stars.</li>
            <li>Daughter-in-law seems to like it and she has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So far, this hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts and my skin doesn&#x27;t look shiny or greasy, just glowy.</li>
            <li>and OH MY are they soft, not greasy, just soft</li>
            <li>And all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I use the Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally agesless Night Creme under this in the morning&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using sensitive skin, it works sometimes</li>
            <li>, my skin has never felt so soft.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin that can be a bit sensitive.</li>
            <li>I only use around 2-3 drops a night to cover my whole face.</li>
            <li>The only downside in my opinion is it does not absorb quite as fast into my skin as the rosehip oil does.</li>
            <li>They are made from a plant root and another natural ingredient.</li>
            <li>I also feel a bit indulgent every time I use them because of how soft they</li>
            <li>The consistency, smell, and results completely took a 180.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not 100% natural?</li>
            <li>I would look into private companies, the way Burt&#x27;s bees started out, look for the modern day</li>
            <li>burt&#x27;s bees type of companies... learn more just through this local site that is fighting for the only organic farm left in rural Maryland/outside DC...</li>
            <li>She is young and has no wrinkles.</li>
            <li>(her skin is much nicer than mine to begin with, but this just really makes it look fresh and delicate).  </li>
            <li>I am disappointed with both - the old version was more creamy and felt much better on my skin.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ll keep using this unless I find something better in a similar price range, and I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s going to happen.</li>
            <li>Truly disappointed, because I believe they were going a natural and pleasant direction when they first started.</li>
            <li>I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees for nearly 18 years -- back when you could only find the product in very specialized health food stores.</li>
            <li>It takes awhile for it to sink in, unlike the expensive moisturizers that blend right in and leave your skin feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I was running low on my Radiance Day Cream, purchased a new jar,</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much at all, even when I have dry scratchy winter skin.  </li>
            <li>First off, a tiny bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>Apparently the royal jelly stimulates collagen growth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly have dry skin, but  living in</li>
            <li>I recently switched to this cream over my old moisturizer</li>
            <li>This facial lotion feels velvety soft on my face.  </li>
            <li>Someone at work left this product (unopened) near the sign in sheet with a note that said - &amp;#34;Help yourself&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>why not a few drops of essential oils instead...</li>
            <li>Not great but not awful.  </li>
            <li>the 10 is big, I probably should have gone with the 9 since there are no half sizes.</li>
            <li>However, I too have some reservations (as many others here have stated) as to whether the old formula has been changed for the worse following their corporate buyout (In 2007, Clorox purchased Burt&#x27;s Bees for $925 million dollars).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m battling moderate adult acne right now, so I use some very drying products on my poor face, and this day cream helps keep my skin from screaming in pain.</li>
            <li>After finally seeing a doctors about it, its starting to clear up</li>
            <li>My wife got this and says she likes it as much as a far more expensive competitor W*L*DA + 2 E&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I use this every day and have very sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li>We bought the same product from other retailers several months and first time we bought the product using the Amazon.</li>
            <li>I started using it several months ago (apparently after the formula change).</li>
            <li>Tingles a bit the first few uses but that goes away.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so soft and takes away dry spots.</li>
            <li>Usually I start using a moisturizer and it ends up getting wasted as I never get satisfied with any.</li>
            <li>Thick as the grease paint that clowns wear, this new formulation of Radiance is absolutely foul--and so is the smell.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my skin, so when it ran out I decided to buy this product, which was over 40 dollars LESS than the big department store brand.&lt;br /&gt;Within</li>
            <li>(my skin is clearer, the acne marks are starting to go away, I have fewer blackheads and whiteheads, the tone and texture of my skin is better) that I decided to give this cream a try to help with my skin&#x27;s slightly dull tone and the slightly drying effect of the scrub.  </li>
            <li>The smell isnâ€™t good or bad.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My mother has also started to use this cream and is having equally good results with it</li>
            <li> really good</li>

            <li> this stuff seems to be working nicely-this was a good buy.</li>
            <li> Again I&#x27;m impressed on how light it is considering it is a cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming this is good since it is Burt&#x27;s Bees, but it was a gift</li>
            <li> The cream takes a good 10-seconds longer to soak into the skin compared to over the counter creams like Oil of Olay</li>

            <li> This cream feels so good on my skin.</li>

            <li> I am very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> Neutrogena&#x27;s Healthy radiance is another great option plus it has SPF.</li>
            <li> But it is better as I feel a sense of joy</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I am sure it will fit perfectly to my needs.</li>
            <li> it just works better!</li>

            <li> Nice, fluffs up the skin to diminish wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It makes a nice foundation for my make-up.</li>
            <li> It goes on non-greasy, and keeps my face nice and supple all day.  </li>

            <li> Is Burt&#x27;s Bees no longer the amazing company that started in Raleigh, NC many years ago?</li>

            <li> I am excited about trying more Burt&#x27;s Bees products, if they all continue to be this good.</li>
            <li> but it is very smooth and even.  </li>
            <li> It gives me a nice smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I am really very exited to use it, yay and happy</li>
            <li> I am in love.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I love burts bees</li>
            <li> Now it is overwhelming with an isopropyl alcohol scent and burns my skin.</li>
            <li> Between these three products, I have have thrown away more than $50.</li>
            <li> although it&#x27;s labelled &amp;#34;day cream&amp;#34;, i took it as night cream often:)</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  </li>
            <li> As for the radiance aspect, I can&#x27;t say my skin is more radiant or not.  </li>
            <li> And to top it off, after using it for a couple of days</li>
            <li> I bought two more online</li>
            <li> Which was okay</li>
            <li> TO  MOST  </li>
            <li> So Cal, I need a bit more moisturizer than this product.</li>
            <li> Love Burt&#x27; Bees products.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> eh, I usu love burts bees</li>
            <li> Feels good, smells good and it&#x27;s all natural.  </li>
            <li> Love it, the product speaks for itself, there&#x27;s nothing that works as well as Burts Bee&#x27;s Day, and night creams, I use all of their products.</li>
            <li> We are glad to have found it.</li>
            <li> love this skin cream.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Love all Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
            <li> The smell is okay.</li>
            <li> It does not smell like you are in a field of flowers or surrounded by mangoes like most beauty products do, but I am okay with that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love witch hazel.</li>
            <li> If that doesnâ€™t work, I will gladly reorder this</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so SMOOTH!</li>
            <li> I also love all the benefits it has.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure by now we all know the lovely product that is coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Even longer if you take better care of them.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of varieties of different ingredients added to the sponges, so I am sure you can find one that works best for your skin.</li>
            <li> we be more hooked on processed sugar if we feed our skin with it?</li>
            <li> Makes me feel that much more confident about myself.</li>
            <li> It is my favorite day cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and non-greasy - my skin loves putting it on in the morning!</li>
            <li> Very happy face feels soft and  smooth</li>
            <li> I really love this day creme.</li>
            <li> The old formula was awesome and you could see and feel the true radiance...</li>
            <li> Nice clean smell.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of most Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s products, but the fragrance of this is quite strong and doesn&#x27;t agree with my skin or my nose.</li>
            <li> the rest of Burt Bees products are pretty good.</li>
            <li> I hope you return to the original formulations, and please let me know when you do!</li>
            <li> And as I said, it absorbs very quickly which I love.</li>
            <li> my skin is dry the day cream is wonderful</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t think of a more natural product that I trusted impeccably.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, this is one of my favorite perfumes</li>
            <li> Most importantly, it suits my skin well.</li>
            <li> My skin has never been more smooth in my life.</li>
            <li> And I can already tell it helps make my skin more smooth.</li>
            <li> Really love this product - it is light and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Great beauty product made using natural bee wax.</li>
            <li> I tend to go for more of a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; smell like Neutrogena original face wash and after applying this on</li>
            <li> It absorbs very quickly into your skin and the smell goes away once it does.</li>
            <li> I strongly encourage you all to try it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the grips seem really good and the boot itself seems like it will definitely keep my feet warm.</li>
            <li> I have experience this kind of issue first time.</li>
            <li> However, by comparison, this still is a fine product by any standards.  </li>
            <li> I had to quickly wash it off!  </li>
            <li> great night time product also, especially for those who need gluten free cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I have always been a huge fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees products, and this skin cream is no exception.  </li>
            <li> quite comfortable with it on face.</li>
            <li> Skin feels smooth and supple.</li>
            <li> SMOOTH  </li>
            <li> The jar doesn&#x27;t smell great, but it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m walking around smelling gross all day; all traces are gone within a couple minutes of application.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a light moisturizer it should do the trick.</li>
            <li> was using Kate Sommerville&#x27;s oil free moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Hey If it&#x27;s FREE its for me.  </li>
            <li> It makes a fantastic lotion.</li>
            <li> Does not feel like a smooth cream.</li>
            <li> I miss what this company stood for and the all natural good for me products.</li>
            <li> Smells good and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Love the whole Radiance line - and this is my favorite product in it.  </li>
            <li> On top of this, it gives my skin just the right amount of moisture without making it greasy...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores like previously used products and has a nice light feel and pleasant - not overbearing - scent.</li>
            <li> ; it just smelled kinda strong, not bad.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Eye Cream for my face (it made the delicate skin around my eyes break out but was great everywhere else), and the strong smell of lanolin in the eye cream worked fine with the smell of whatever-it-is</li>
            <li> The consistency is a perfect balance of wet and creamy (more on the wet side, which feels so nice on overdried skin).</li>
            <li> I am not in love with it, because it leaves your skin feeling greasy at first.</li>
            <li> They changed the formula--when I wrote to complain about this, they explained that it had something to do with removing borax (sodium borate) from the original formula and replacing it with others.  </li>
            <li> This cream smells pretty good, although my granddaughter doesn&#x27;t care for it, and does a decent job of moisturizing for the money.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had such great success with the apricot scrub</li>
            <li> It soaks into the skin quickly, and is light and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li> more importantly, it&#x27;s helping to even out the tone of my skin, and even gives it a gentle glow.  </li>
            <li> I have used a lot of different creams over the years and this is the best one so far.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my face soft without making it oily and a jar last me six months, which is great!</li>
            <li> My face feels super smooth and silky and I&#x27;ve noticed my crows feet have diminished since I started using it.</li>
            <li> I find them to definitely be a positive addition to my skincare routine and will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Goes on light, doesn&#x27;t take very much!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  gotten hard to find in my area so this is the perfect answer.</li>
            <li> BUT, the smell in sickeningly sweet.</li>
            <li> Spreads on differently then the nighttime version but still good</li>
            <li> and I love it, and my skin is so much clearer.  </li>
            <li> (I used to be able to use a jar for a year, now I need literally twice as much).  </li>
            <li> Even w/my combination skin, it made me have mild</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer, and the price is much better on Amazon than at my local stores.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping also.</li>
            <li> This is the best overall daily moisturizer I have used.</li>
            <li> It soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Absorbs rather quickly.  </li>
            <li> Wish there was a little bit more arch support, but I like the boots because they fit under the jeans easily or could be worn with leggings on a warmer day to show off the cute buckles.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s better for normal to oily skin type.</li>
            <li> I use a Konjac Sponge for a more natural version of a loofah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so far really loving this routine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rosehip Oil is my new love when it comes to beauty products.</li>
            <li> but I feel like women in general get sold so much snake oil, so when I find a product that works well AND is priced fairly</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and cannot use most products out there.</li>
            <li> The lotion smells exactly like Ralph Lauren&#x27;s Ralph (the original).</li>
            <li> Have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Day &amp; Night creams with Royal Jelly for several years and really satisfied!</li>
            <li> It is overall a very good facial lotion that works well when applied before makeup.</li>
            <li> Again, there are plenty of websites out there that preach the amazing reasons to use this essential oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As it is, I&#x27;ll be sending them a nice email requesting my money back.      </li>
            <li> It is lightweight and easily absorbed for use under make-up, yet does the job well.</li>
            <li> And to be perfectly honest, the only reason I am using a separate moisturizer for daytime and nighttime is</li>
            <li> Oh wait, did I mention about the fresh fragrance it has.</li>
            <li> Over all, I think they were definitely worth the $33 dollars that I paid for them,</li>
            <li> Have fun</li>
            <li> I find it makes my skin very clean and surprisingly soft.</li>
            <li> right before if you wear coverup on your face.</li>
            <li> And it soaks in well but seems to have a long-lasting moisturizing effect (which is good, because I have dry skin and am allergic to almost every moisturizer except petroleum jelly or pure jojoba oil).  </li>
            <li> Love this kind because its not too thick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent lots of money looking for something, because I really do believe that at thirty, you have to start taking good care of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, the eye cream is pretty pricy to use for my whole face, so I ordered the day cream to try as a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One mitigating factor regarding the scent: it fades quickly.  </li>
            <li> thus skin care is very important at this crucial juncture.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, it is in a cute little bottle, and my skin feels ready to tackle the day after using it.</li>
            <li> The first product I used was the Apricot Baby Oil for my then unborn baby.</li>
            <li> My wife noticed it smelled funny, so I asked her to pick up a can at the pharmacy and we&#x27;d compare.  </li>
            <li> I had never tried any of Burt&#x27;s Bees products, I was watching one of the morning programs and they mentioned the lip balm, I happened to be on Amazon and saw this and was running low on my day cream and thought I&#x27;d give it a try, so glad I did</li>
            <li> I love this facial cream!!</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of most ofthe Burts Bees products</li>
            <li> used to love Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s, but they must have changed a lot (possibly all) of their formulas and/or were bought out by another company.</li>
            <li> On the whole, it&#x27;s the kind of product I have been looking for for long.</li>
            <li> *yum*), and decided to try it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and love it.  </li>
            <li> I began using Burt&#x27;s about 7 years ago when it first hit the market.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a good way to slow down and give your face a good mini-massage until every drop is absorbed.</li>
            <li> My skin is very soft, and I love that it is natural.</li>
            <li> Good facial lotion, the only problem is the odor when I first started using the lotion.</li>
            <li> considering other websites are selling them in the $70-120 range - after all, they are rated to keep your feet warm to -25 degrees.</li>
            <li> It keeps the dryness away without leaving a greasy mess, and absorbs very nicely, leaving my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> I assume they&#x27;re trying to cover up the smell of active ingredients with some kind of fragrance; it&#x27;s not working.  </li>
            <li> Sure enough, this smells nothing like the REAL product.  </li>
            <li> I now have a separate high-SPF facial sunblock that I use, so I thought I would buy the version of this day cream without SPF since I used to love it so much.</li>
            <li> The new \\&quot;99%\\&quot; natural formula does not smell as good or seem to rejuvenate skin like the old \\&quot;98.2%\\&quot; natural formula.</li>
            <li> cream has a nice light scent to it, does not feel heavy, &amp; keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling super soft without looking oily.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly rather than sitting on top of dry skin like some creams, and leaves my face feeling soft and moisturized, but not greasy.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much after I finished my first little jar</li>
            <li> I bought some at my local Walmart and it was just fine.</li>
            <li> It feels refreshing and exactly like any other toner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This is light enough, but still does the job.</li>
            <li> The real slap in the face was the Tomato toner which I discovered over 10 years ago...</li>
            <li> Amazon is purporting this to be the real thing by utilizing the REAL packaging while distributing a KNOCK OFF.  </li>
            <li> before I go to bed, that works really well for me.</li>
            <li> Did not find much difference as promised.</li>
            <li> I guess there is a reason why the price was so much cheaper than the store...</li>
            <li> and it does absolutely</li>
            <li> So back to the stuff filled with chemicals-</li>
            <li> Thanks Burt &#x27; Bees.</li>
            <li> have very problematic skin, I&#x27;m thirty and still break out.</li>
            <li> two days I noticed that my skin looked really dewy and radiant, something that never happened with the Kate Sommerville.</li>
            <li> I l;ike this cream because it&#x27;s not sticky, but really softens my face and stays on all day.  </li>
            <li> When i received this product, it has the plastic slink wrap around the jar and it was really sticky...</li>
            <li> but this face cream has been a godsend in a very tortuous time for my skin</li>
            <li> so much I&#x27;ve also started using the night cream.</li>
            <li> After application it dries up and disappears very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Failed to impress.</li>
            <li> Absolutely foul.</li>
            <li> I have recently been trying to find a more natural and organic skin care routine.</li>
            <li> There may be more pricey, nicer creams out there, but I am not willing to drop $50 or $60 on them at this point.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve kept using it because it evens my combination skin out and makes it look healthier, much more so than other cremes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I also haven&#x27;t played around with many creams, other than Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> My skin breaks out easily due to the hormonal shifts that being in your 40&#x27;s can bring, and this product never contributes to that tendency, as many others do.</li>
            <li> To make this short, it&#x27;s one of the most sever forms of acne and is incredibly scaring and very difficult to treat.  </li>
            <li> My mom has been using it for years and is almost 50 and doesn&#x27;t have a single wrinkle and her skin looks soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> Next I plan to try and make a more natural hair care routine, and then find natural alternatives for deodorant and toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Not a bad purchase especially for winter times.</li>
            <li> I have remained loyal and faithful until recently.  </li>
            <li> mild enough for my face.</li>
            <li> I understand that popularity dictated larger production scale... but the recent changes seem more profit based rather than customer satisfaction.  </li>
            <li> Havnt tried the older version and so cant compare.</li>
            <li> and my skin does feel softer, which is an acomplishment given my high altitude location</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never spend on the high end day creams again</li>
            <li> If you donâ€™t use toners, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Personally I would buy the product from in store only to make sure you get the real product and not a deffective or old version as with all skin cremes.</li>
            <li> but I also know there is a large segment of people who, when buying natural products, don&#x27;t want to feel like they just been hosed</li>
            <li> Meaning that it doesnâ€™t smell wonderful like a perfume, but the smell isnâ€™t bad and take away from the awesomeness of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prefer a more firm cream, night or day.</li>
            <li> I even bought a variety pack to share with my children, and other than the peppermint, they may as well be cheap smelling fruity concoctions.</li>
            <li> This little jar was cutely packaged and promised natural radiance that included royal jelly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The KonjacSponges are a new addition to my routine.</li>
            <li> This item is non greasy and keeps my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li> i like it very much, thus have bought several times.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Love this product ing with other Burt&#x27;s Bess products!!!</li>
            <li> First off - this is not the same product sold in the stores - or for that matter what they&#x27;re advertising here on this site!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is lightweight and would work well under makeup but even better as a nightcream because it left my skin extremely oily.</li>
            <li> They are so soft!</li>
            <li> It also had a sort of natural shimmer (or radiance, if you will) that is not replicated in this new product or in the new Night Creme.</li>
            <li> I can see why they did that, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve succeeded in making a new formula that works as well as the old one.</li>
            <li> I will update in a month or so to see if the results are consistent, but so far I cannot recommend this product enough!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel just right, never oily or dry.</li>
            <li> Stickier than Caudelie or L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s Immortelle creams---don&#x27;t use too much, you just need a little pat of cream to cover your face in the summer and probably more in winter--but it seems to give the same glow as the higher priced skin creams (provided you do a proper skin regiment---exfoliate, use toner to remove dirt from pores, deep pore extractions every few weeks, and a light alpha-hydroxy monthly peel).</li>
            <li> A little too light for my taste.  </li>
            <li> , in fact I think it&#x27;s helped clear my acne up in conjunction with my routine of using philosophy face wash and my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> It seemed that the old formula day cream used to last much longer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be surprised.</li>
            <li> I have been a nearly 20 year Burt&#x27;s Bees Devotee...</li>
            <li> I AM nearly 41...</li>
            <li> Do yourself a a favor - spend the extra dollar at Walgreens and buy the real stuff.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin -try</li>
            <li> I also tend to get red spots around my eyes and apples of cheeks, but haven&#x27;t seen much of that since I began using this product.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to smell do not buy this.</li>
            <li> Wow.. Wish I could give this no stars.</li>
            <li> Daughter-in-law seems to like it and she has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So far, this hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts and my skin doesn&#x27;t look shiny or greasy, just glowy.</li>
            <li> and OH MY are they soft, not greasy, just soft</li>
            <li> And all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I use the Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally agesless Night Creme under this in the morning&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using sensitive skin, it works sometimes</li>
            <li> , my skin has never felt so soft.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that can be a bit sensitive.</li>
            <li> I only use around 2-3 drops a night to cover my whole face.</li>
            <li> The only downside in my opinion is it does not absorb quite as fast into my skin as the rosehip oil does.</li>
            <li> They are made from a plant root and another natural ingredient.</li>
            <li> I also feel a bit indulgent every time I use them because of how soft they</li>
            <li> The consistency, smell, and results completely took a 180.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not 100% natural?</li>
            <li> I would look into private companies, the way Burt&#x27;s bees started out, look for the modern day</li>
            <li> burt&#x27;s bees type of companies... learn more just through this local site that is fighting for the only organic farm left in rural Maryland/outside DC...</li>
            <li> She is young and has no wrinkles.</li>
            <li> (her skin is much nicer than mine to begin with, but this just really makes it look fresh and delicate).  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed with both - the old version was more creamy and felt much better on my skin.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ll keep using this unless I find something better in a similar price range, and I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s going to happen.</li>
            <li> Truly disappointed, because I believe they were going a natural and pleasant direction when they first started.</li>
            <li> I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees for nearly 18 years -- back when you could only find the product in very specialized health food stores.</li>
            <li> It takes awhile for it to sink in, unlike the expensive moisturizers that blend right in and leave your skin feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> I was running low on my Radiance Day Cream, purchased a new jar,</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much at all, even when I have dry scratchy winter skin.  </li>
            <li> First off, a tiny bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Apparently the royal jelly stimulates collagen growth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly have dry skin, but  living in</li>
            <li> I recently switched to this cream over my old moisturizer</li>
            <li> This facial lotion feels velvety soft on my face.  </li>
            <li> Someone at work left this product (unopened) near the sign in sheet with a note that said - &amp;#34;Help yourself&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> why not a few drops of essential oils instead...</li>
            <li> Not great but not awful.  </li>
            <li> the 10 is big, I probably should have gone with the 9 since there are no half sizes.</li>
            <li> However, I too have some reservations (as many others here have stated) as to whether the old formula has been changed for the worse following their corporate buyout (In 2007, Clorox purchased Burt&#x27;s Bees for $925 million dollars).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m battling moderate adult acne right now, so I use some very drying products on my poor face, and this day cream helps keep my skin from screaming in pain.</li>
            <li> After finally seeing a doctors about it, its starting to clear up</li>
            <li> My wife got this and says she likes it as much as a far more expensive competitor W*L*DA + 2 E&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I use this every day and have very sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li> We bought the same product from other retailers several months and first time we bought the product using the Amazon.</li>
            <li> I started using it several months ago (apparently after the formula change).</li>
            <li> Tingles a bit the first few uses but that goes away.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so soft and takes away dry spots.</li>
            <li> Usually I start using a moisturizer and it ends up getting wasted as I never get satisfied with any.</li>
            <li> Thick as the grease paint that clowns wear, this new formulation of Radiance is absolutely foul--and so is the smell.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my skin, so when it ran out I decided to buy this product, which was over 40 dollars LESS than the big department store brand.&lt;br /&gt;Within</li>
            <li> (my skin is clearer, the acne marks are starting to go away, I have fewer blackheads and whiteheads, the tone and texture of my skin is better) that I decided to give this cream a try to help with my skin&#x27;s slightly dull tone and the slightly drying effect of the scrub.  </li>
            <li> The smell isnâ€™t good or bad.</li>
            <li> I do not find the smell bad at all, just different then what I am used to from more normal products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not used it long enough to see a visual difference</li>
            <li> I would only recommend using this cream only if you have dry or flaky skin.</li>
            <li> One bottle last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Long time fan of the entire radiance line.</li>
            <li> Very emollient face cream, I&#x27;ve been using it for several years, everyday in the winter and every other day in the summer.</li>
            <li> In winter my face turns into one big dry skin flake.</li>
            <li> By afternoon, my face was always back to dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week, and my face isn&#x27;t dry around my cheek/chin area anymore.</li>
            <li> It was clumpy around my nose and left redness on my cheeks and made my skin dry out before I even finished my makeup</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having a pretty rough time these past couple of months with my skin.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m never breakout free, but other moisturizers just make things worse.)  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to find a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel really oily or shiny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not very appealing for what should be a somewhat luxurious natural</li>
            <li> I have been using Burt&#x27;s Radiance Day Cream for a long time.  </li>
            <li> They are expected to last around 3 months.</li>
            <li> I use the pink clay facial sponge for my face cleaning.</li>
            <li> and I plan to keep using it as long as I can.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this for aged skin, but I would say that since it does improve the overall appearance of your skin it probably helps in that area.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin overall look less blotchy, and doesn&#x27;t set off extra breakouts.  </li>
            <li> My impression is that these are either fakes, or just plain old shelf items.</li>
            <li> , I guess I hope they fix the scent, and I&#x27;ll keep trying other options occasionally.  </li>
            <li> Also the smell of the product was different from other retailers.</li>
            <li> Protects his skin from  extremely dry Colorado environment.</li>
            <li> I get extremely dry skin all over in the winter and it starts to flake all over my face.</li>
            <li> and I recommend this to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> I suppose , but didn&#x27;t do anything forthe dry areas.</li>
            <li> Living in dry state need both.  </li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and these help.</li>
            <li> I try others that promise amazing things, am disappointed, and always return to this standby.</li>
            <li> I am not normally</li>
            <li> I use this daily after washing my face, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Not much moisture for dry skin.</li>
            <li> All I know is that past &amp;#34;radiance&amp;#34; creams I have used left my skin looking red and flushed, and this product does not.  </li>
            <li> but I wanted a daily face lotion with less chemicals.</li>
            <li> Woods Black Soap with shea butter as a facial cleanser and body wash&lt;br /&gt;Witch</li>
            <li> My skin on my neck was a little dry and this totally moisturized it from just one use.</li>
            <li> I have very, VERY dry skin</li>
            <li> I think go do a few chores like the dishes or starting laundry.</li>
            <li> I used to use it a few years ago, then stopped for a while because it doesn&#x27;t offer any sun protection, which is its only flaw in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Pros: deeply moisturizing without being heavy.  </li>
            <li> I threw it away immediately after opening it, which really never happens.</li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t react overtly to the ingredients, though it is puffier, redder and there is absolutely no sign of smoothing or firming or hydration.</li>
            <li> Minimal amount needed.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using it my face feels soft to the touch and no more flakies!</li>
            <li> Even if your skin doesn&#x27;t break out you will probably have no positive outcome in terms of hydrating your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That may work for less dry skin but doesn&#x27;t cut it for me.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so it lasts.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> The pink clay helps with dry skin and uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> The smell on the other hand is a downside.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t break out like I have with other cremes.</li>
            <li> The jar did not have the Burts Bees label as pictured, only a small label on the bottom of the jar.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Normally I use Clinique&#x27;s Dramatically Different lotion usually</li>
            <li> my makeup would just wear off with other creams, but with this day cream my makeup stays on all day.</li>
            <li> The other reviewers are correct.</li>
            <li> I got the radiace day and night cremes and I am shocked that in two days there is a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price</li>
            <li> Also, the lid of the jar was dusty and was probably years old as it had a metal lid.  </li>
            <li> My skin, after a week of use is beginning to look more youthful and radiant despite this crap its going through.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that immediately after application my skin feels a little filmy, but this goes away about 10 minutes after application</li>
            <li> My skin sags less and my wrinkles are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every department store creme, including some that are over $100 for less than 2 oz.</li>
            <li> in fact, my skin seems less greasy over-all ever since I started using this cream.  </li>
            <li> The Black Soap is a castile soap.</li>
            <li> It has an odd smell, and I don&#x27;t feel like it hydrates all that well</li>
            <li> FRUSTRATING now that Burt&#x27;s Bees is owned by a major corporation, we no longer can trust the products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I prefer to do it this way as it makes less of a mess in my opinion.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot which makes the price a little easier to swallow.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey, but with a product</li>
            <li> and I ordered a 10 because the review here and on other sites said they run small...</li>
            <li> but I have a few lines that started to show on my forehead</li>
            <li> The few times I&#x27;ve put it on in the morning</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That isn&#x27;t heavy.</li>
            <li> I hated this stuff, more than any product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I also have an uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> Instead of leaving my face hydrated, it made my skin feel dried out and flaky.</li>
            <li> however the formulas on several products have recently changed... for the worse... BEWARE!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather have a weird beehive or herbal or medicinal smell than this, which is somewhere in the expired vegetable matter category--not actually foul, but slightly offputting.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was not eligible for a return because it was over the time limit (I ordered earlier than I thought I would need it).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write amazon reviews</li>
            <li> Also usually wind up applying a tad of the night time creme in spot&#x27;s during day.</li>
            <li> It was clearly past</li>
            <li> not exactly sure what it&#x27;s doing to my face,</li>
            <li> She used this cream for 10 days and found it not suitable.</li>
            <li> only thing that went wrong, upon opening the package the lid was broken, and some of the cream leaked out</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for at least three years.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for oily skin because it is thick and will clog pores.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the cream to be thick at all</li>
            <li> everytime I use it as I know I am not putting any weird harsh chemicals on my skin when using it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not pleasant (almost a drying/pore clogging feel?).</li>
            <li> - I find the addition of fragrance unnecessary and disappointing in a natural product, not to mention that I find the fragrance blend to be unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed as I have used this face lotion for several years.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the stores around here stopped carrying the day creme in favor of the day lotion.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> Not only did it give me my worst breakout in my life, it make my skin irritated and inflamed.</li>
            <li> Sorry Burt&#x27;s Bee.</li>
            <li> I do wish it had SPF in it, but understand that this is a difficult compromise for BBs.</li>
            <li> Sad to say, I regret my purchase.</li>
            <li> I was just about traumatized, as dramatic as that sounds, it was that bad.</li>
            <li> The bad: there&#x27;s a weird smell here.  </li>
            <li> It is disappointing b/c</li>
            <li> Buying this creme was a waste of $20.00 and a terrible experience.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why theres bad reviews</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I hate this lotion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I hate the smell!</li>
            <li> I also have eczema, which is especially bad on my face around my eyes and lips, and my skin is sometimes irritated by vitamin E oil; I haven&#x27;t had a problem with this cream at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m especially disappointed with the fragrance</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!  </li>
            <li> It started with horrible cystic breakouts that went on to leave unsightly scars.</li>
            <li> This product smelled so terrible</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using Burt&#x27;s Radiance Day Cream for a long time.  I am very satisfied with it.  It gives me a nice smooth skin.</li>
            <li> not greasy, i dig it.</li>
            <li> I am sure it will fit perfectly to my needs. I am really very exited to use it, yay and happy</li>
            <li> Nourishing for the skin. But somehow I&#x27;m allergic to several ingredient.</li>
            <li> Not much moisture for dry skin. Maybe it&#x27;s better for normal to oily skin type.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this in the head to toe purchase.  I am in love.  You don&#x27;t need a lot which makes the price a little easier to swallow.  My skin is very soft, and I love that it is natural.</li>
            <li> Show me a product from Burt&#x27;s Bees that disappoints and I&#x27;ll be surprised. This is light enough, but still does the job.</li>
            <li> This item is non greasy and keeps my skin very soft.  This item does not add shine to my already shiny skin.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this on his face daily &amp; he loves it. Protects his skin from  extremely dry Colorado environment.</li>
            <li> I got the radiace day and night cremes and I am shocked that in two days there is a huge difference. My skin sags less and my wrinkles are less noticeable. I was using olay before. Even though this creme is thicker it did not clog my pores. I feel very happy about this find. I am going to add an spf to the day creme though. I am 34 thus skin care is very important at this crucial juncture.Apparently the royal jelly stimulates collagen growth. Personally I would buy the product from in store only to make sure you get the real product and not a deffective or old version as with all skin cremes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE the day radiance cream!I saw it in my moms medicine cabinet and decided to try it this winter and I was too amazed at how well it worked. I get extremely dry skin all over in the winter and it starts to flake all over my face. Ive tried regular lotions and Vaseline but it either didn&#x27;t work enough or left my face greasy and shiny. My mom has been using it for years and is almost 50 and doesn&#x27;t have a single wrinkle and her skin looks soft and healthy. I however am only 19 but I use this daily after I wash my face and I use the night cream at bedtime. The smell on the other hand is a downside. It doesn&#x27;t smell wonderful but it doesn&#x27;t smell horrible either, its tolerable. Since I&#x27;ve been using it my face feels soft to the touch and no more flakies! I love burts bees and I recommend this to anyone with dry skin. I will definetely continue using this (:</li>
            <li> I have been a nearly 20 year Burt&#x27;s Bees Devotee... however the formulas on several products have recently changed... for the worse... BEWARE!!  I wrote this to the company...  Hi! I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees for nearly 18 years -- back when you could only find the product in very specialized health food stores. The first product I used was the Apricot Baby Oil for my then unborn baby. I was hooked.  I have used products faithfully since then. I encouraged my mother to carry them in her store in NY. I used include them in packages where I made homemade diapers for friends. I couldn&#x27;t think of a more natural product that I trusted impeccably. I have advocated the products to many people and have made many convert! I have often given my co-workers the lip balm for Christmas, and this year... I couldn&#x27;t believe the variety of balms. I even bought a variety pack to share with my children, and other than the peppermint, they may as well be cheap smelling fruity concoctions. I have remained loyal and faithful until recently.  I was running low on my Radiance Day Cream, purchased a new jar, the scent, texture and product is NOT the same. I purchased the Radience Eye cream... same thing... The real slap in the face was the Tomato toner which I discovered over 10 years ago... mild enough for my face. I swore by it. I switched from Este Lauder to exclusively Burt&#x27;s. Now it is overwhelming with an isopropyl alcohol scent and burns my skin. I can not tolerate it and have started breaking out from the products. I AM nearly 41... I shouldn&#x27;t be breaking out! Between these three products, I have have thrown away more than $50. Not to mention, jars now have plastic tops?? huh??  Then, to add insult to injury, I learned from a friend that Burt&#x27;s was taken over by Johnson and Johnson. That would explain a lot!! Is Burt&#x27;s Bees no longer the amazing company that started in Raleigh, NC many years ago? I understand that popularity dictated larger production scale... but the recent changes seem more profit based rather than customer satisfaction.  PLEASE explain the truth to what has happened to my tried and true products?!?! I am currently on the look out for face products that work with my skin as Burt&#x27;s is no longer the answer. Can I mail you back the products for a refund?? I no longer have the receipts... Why would I have kept them anyway? I trusted the product and have NEVER had to return a product.  I hope you return to the original formulations, and please let me know when you do! I miss what this company stood for and the all natural good for me products.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin. In winter my face turns into one big dry skin flake. I&#x27;ve tried every department store creme, including some that are over $100 for less than 2 oz. By afternoon, my face was always back to dry and flaky. This Burt&#x27;s Bees creme works better than any of the expensive brands for me. I start with a toner, then serum, then this creme under makeup. Unfortunately the stores around here stopped carrying the day creme in favor of the day lotion. That may work for less dry skin but doesn&#x27;t cut it for me. So I&#x27;ll be ordering from Amazon from now on. I can&#x27;t do without it.</li>
            <li> I have written a post about the Burt&#x27;s Bees apricot scrub as well, this is kind of joined with that review.  I have a sever form of acne called nodulocystic acne.  To make this short, it&#x27;s one of the most sever forms of acne and is incredibly scaring and very difficult to treat.  I&#x27;ve had such great success with the apricot scrub (my skin is clearer, the acne marks are starting to go away, I have fewer blackheads and whiteheads, the tone and texture of my skin is better) that I decided to give this cream a try to help with my skin&#x27;s slightly dull tone and the slightly drying effect of the scrub.  This stuff works wonders.  First off, a tiny bit goes a long way.  It soaks into the skin quickly, and is light and non-greasy.  more importantly, it&#x27;s helping to even out the tone of my skin, and even gives it a gentle glow.  On top of this, it gives my skin just the right amount of moisture without making it greasy...in fact, my skin seems less greasy over-all ever since I started using this cream.  I&#x27;ve had this sever form of acne for 12 years now and haven&#x27;t had skin that looks this good since then!  I also use this as a night cream, and it still does the trick.  My mother has also started to use this cream and is having equally good results with it (her skin is much nicer than mine to begin with, but this just really makes it look fresh and delicate).  I am excited about trying more Burt&#x27;s Bees products, if they all continue to be this good.</li>
            <li> i like it very much, thus have bought several times. quite comfortable with it on face. although it&#x27;s labelled &amp;#34;day cream&amp;#34;, i took it as night cream often:)</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  I have used a lot of different creams over the years and this is the best one so far.  I started using it several months ago (apparently after the formula change). I do not find the smell to be offensive, it&#x27;s sort of medicinal, and not perfumey at all, but I can see what others say about it. It works very nicely on my fickle skin.  It keeps the dryness away without leaving a greasy mess, and absorbs very nicely, leaving my skin soft.  As for the radiance aspect, I can&#x27;t say my skin is more radiant or not.  All I know is that past &amp;#34;radiance&amp;#34; creams I have used left my skin looking red and flushed, and this product does not.  There may be more pricey, nicer creams out there, but I am not willing to drop $50 or $60 on them at this point.  For now, this cream works for me.</li>
            <li> This cream smells pretty good, although my granddaughter doesn&#x27;t care for it, and does a decent job of moisturizing for the money.  I am not in love with it, because it leaves your skin feeling greasy at first. It takes awhile for it to sink in, unlike the expensive moisturizers that blend right in and leave your skin feeling smooth and soft.  However, considering it cost about 1/3 the price of my Bobbi Brown moisturizer, I can&#x27;t complain. A little goes a long way, so it lasts.</li>
            <li> Love this product ing with other Burt&#x27;s Bess products!!!</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees has changed the formula. The new \\&quot;99%\\&quot; natural formula does not smell as good or seem to rejuvenate skin like the old \\&quot;98.2%\\&quot; natural formula. Very disappointed as I have used this face lotion for several years.</li>
            <li> First off - this is not the same product sold in the stores - or for that matter what they&#x27;re advertising here on this site!  The advertised \\&quot;creme\\&quot; seems to have shown up on my doorstep as a \\&quot;cream\\&quot; (and is so labeled).  My wife noticed it smelled funny, so I asked her to pick up a can at the pharmacy and we&#x27;d compare.  Sure enough, this smells nothing like the REAL product.  And to top it off, after using it for a couple of days she&#x27;s having a reaction to the product.  Different label, different lid, different packaging - and yet Amazon is purporting this to be the real thing by utilizing the REAL packaging while distributing a KNOCK OFF.  If I was Burt, I&#x27;d be filing a lawsuit tomorrow morning.  As it is, I&#x27;ll be sending them a nice email requesting my money back.      Do yourself a a favor - spend the extra dollar at Walgreens and buy the real stuff.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much after I finished my first little jar I bought two more online (its cheaper here than in stores.) I&#x27;ve kept using it because it evens my combination skin out and makes it look healthier, much more so than other cremes I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m 25 but I have a few lines that started to show on my forehead and they do look fainter now than before I started using it 6 months or so ago. Love this kind because its not too thick so I don&#x27;t break out like I have with other cremes. I know its a &amp;#34;Day creme&amp;#34; but I just put it on once before I go to bed, that works really well for me. The few times I&#x27;ve put it on in the morning it didn&#x27;t blend well with my makeup so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend putting it on right before if you wear coverup on your face.</li>
            <li> My skin on my neck was a little dry and this totally moisturized it from just one use. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for oily skin because it is thick and will clog pores.</li>
            <li> I purchased this during a recent binge on Burt Bees products. This little jar was cutely packaged and promised natural radiance that included royal jelly. The lotion is white and pearly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The lotion smells exactly like Ralph Lauren&#x27;s Ralph (the original). Fortunately, this is one of my favorite perfumes but I also know there is a large segment of people who, when buying natural products, don&#x27;t want to feel like they just been hosed w/perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is lightweight and would work well under makeup but even better as a nightcream because it left my skin extremely oily.I would only recommend using this cream only if you have dry or flaky skin. If you have sensitive skin -try at your own risk. Even w/my combination skin, it made me have mild breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I tend to go for more of a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; smell like Neutrogena original face wash and after applying this on I felt the need to wash my face. It is disappointing b/c the rest of Burt Bees products are pretty good.</li>
            <li> I use this daily after washing my face, a little goes a long way. Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy. Doesn&#x27;t cause any acne, in fact I think it&#x27;s helped clear my acne up in conjunction with my routine of using philosophy face wash and my Clarisonic. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! This is my second jar. Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Nice, fluffs up the skin to diminish wrinkles. Skin feels smooth and supple.</li>
            <li> I finally found a day cream&lt;br /&gt;That isn&#x27;t heavy. This Cream has a Nice very light scent to&lt;br /&gt;It. I notice A Difference In My face. It looks healthier, and supple!!! I use in conjunction with Burt&#x27;s Bee Facial wash and night creme.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer, and the price is much better on Amazon than at my local stores. Quick shipping also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week, and my face isn&#x27;t dry around my cheek/chin area anymore. I also haven&#x27;t played around with many creams, other than Neutrogena. Which was okay I suppose , but didn&#x27;t do anything forthe dry areas. I also tend to get red spots around my eyes and apples of cheeks, but haven&#x27;t seen much of that since I began using this product.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that went wrong, upon opening the package the lid was broken, and some of the cream leaked out</li>
            <li> This is the best overall daily moisturizer I have used. I try others that promise amazing things, am disappointed, and always return to this standby. My skin breaks out easily due to the hormonal shifts that being in your 40&#x27;s can bring, and this product never contributes to that tendency, as many others do. It is lightweight and easily absorbed for use under make-up, yet does the job well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the cream to be thick at all and my skin does feel softer, which is an acomplishment given my high altitude location BUT, the smell in sickeningly sweet. If you are sensitive to smell do not buy this. I am not normally and I think its giving me a bit of a headache.  My skin feels great but I hate the smell!</li>
            <li> I  HAVE  SENSITIVITIES  TO  MOST  FACE  MAKE UP  PRODUCTS ....... THIS  LEAVES  MY  FACE  SMOOTH  ...... NO  REACTIONS ....... AND  MY  LIQUID  MAKE UP  GOES  ON  OVER  IT  WELL .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly have dry skin, but  living in So Cal, I need a bit more moisturizer than this product. I went back to using Oil of Olay after using this product for a couple of months, and I immediately felt the difference; not so when I switched to this product.</li>
            <li> Love Burt&#x27; Bees products. This is one of my favorite products. It soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> eh, I usu love burts bees but wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li> great night time product also, especially for those who need gluten free cosmetics. Spreads on differently then the nighttime version but still good</li>
            <li> Did not find much difference as promised.</li>
            <li> Great cream made my skin feel great</li>
            <li> Have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Day &amp; Night creams with Royal Jelly for several years and really satisfied!</li>
            <li> The bad: there&#x27;s a weird smell here.  I assume they&#x27;re trying to cover up the smell of active ingredients with some kind of fragrance; it&#x27;s not working.  I&#x27;d rather have a weird beehive or herbal or medicinal smell than this, which is somewhere in the expired vegetable matter category--not actually foul, but slightly offputting. I really liked the Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Eye Cream for my face (it made the delicate skin around my eyes break out but was great everywhere else), and the strong smell of lanolin in the eye cream worked fine with the smell of whatever-it-is; it just smelled kinda strong, not bad.  However, the eye cream is pretty pricy to use for my whole face, so I ordered the day cream to try as a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One mitigating factor regarding the scent: it fades quickly.  The jar doesn&#x27;t smell great, but it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m walking around smelling gross all day; all traces are gone within a couple minutes of application.  It&#x27;s just not very appealing for what should be a somewhat luxurious natural product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The really good: it works well.  It hasn&#x27;t made me break out, and my skin is fairly breakout-prone in the winter.  I also have eczema, which is especially bad on my face around my eyes and lips, and my skin is sometimes irritated by vitamin E oil; I haven&#x27;t had a problem with this cream at all.  And it soaks in well but seems to have a long-lasting moisturizing effect (which is good, because I have dry skin and am allergic to almost every moisturizer except petroleum jelly or pure jojoba oil).  It works well under makeup (as a day cream should), hydrating and priming without causing foundation or concealer to crack or run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I guess I hope they fix the scent, and I&#x27;ll keep trying other options occasionally.  But I&#x27;ll keep using this unless I find something better in a similar price range, and I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s going to happen.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but with a product this great you can&#x27;t go wrong.  All Burt&#x27;s Bees products I have used are great.  No disappointments here!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and know it well. The product I received did not smell the same, nor was the texture the same. The jar did not have the Burts Bees label as pictured, only a small label on the bottom of the jar.I bought some at my local Walmart and it was just fine. My impression is that these are either fakes, or just plain old shelf items. Unfortunately I was not eligible for a return because it was over the time limit (I ordered earlier than I thought I would need it). I guess there is a reason why the price was so much cheaper than the store...</li>
            <li> this stuff seems to be working nicely-this was a good buy.</li>
            <li> I hate this lotion. I don&#x27;t know how this is even possible but it leaves my face sticky. I wish I could return this.I have very, VERY dry skin and it does absolutely nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Normally I use Clinique&#x27;s Dramatically Different lotion usually but I wanted a daily face lotion with less chemicals. Burt&#x27;s Bees radiance lotion doesn&#x27;t even smell very good. I am not impressed. Neutrogena&#x27;s Healthy radiance is another great option plus it has SPF. So back to the stuff filled with chemicals- it just works better!</li>
            <li> Cream was congealed and separated in jar.&lt;br /&gt;It was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Again I&#x27;m impressed on how light it is considering it is a cream. I have oily skin my makeup would just wear off with other creams, but with this day cream my makeup stays on all day. Plus I have dermatitis around my nose &amp; around my chin &amp; with this day cream it&#x27;s not irritated, it hasn&#x27;t bothered me since I&#x27;ve been using this product. Thanks Burt &#x27; Bees.</li>
            <li> Wow.. Wish I could give this no stars. I hated this stuff, more than any product I&#x27;ve ever used. Not only did it give me my worst breakout in my life, it make my skin irritated and inflamed. I was just about traumatized, as dramatic as that sounds, it was that bad. Please save yourself some time and money and do NOT buy this!</li>
            <li> We bought the same product from other retailers several months and first time we bought the product using the Amazon. After using the product for 2 time, it created several pimples on the face. Also the smell of the product was different from other retailers. I have experience this kind of issue first time. I thought every retailer is selling from the same vendor but it looks like duplicate product.</li>
            <li> Feels good, smells good and it&#x27;s all natural.  Soothing to the face once it goes on.  I did a monthly shipment.</li>
            <li> Love this product - i highly recommend its a wonderful moisturizer for all day wear. Doesnt cause breakouts awesome results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming this is good since it is Burt&#x27;s Bees, but it was a gift so I have not used it personally.  Daughter-in-law seems to like it and she has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Good facial lotion, the only problem is the odor when I first started using the lotion. It is overall a very good facial lotion that works well when applied before makeup. I would recommend this product for anyone.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful. Hydrates well for dewy skin. The cream takes a good 10-seconds longer to soak into the skin compared to over the counter creams like Oil of Olay but it&#x27;s a good way to slow down and give your face a good mini-massage until every drop is absorbed.Stickier than Caudelie or L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s Immortelle creams---don&#x27;t use too much, you just need a little pat of cream to cover your face in the summer and probably more in winter--but it seems to give the same glow as the higher priced skin creams (provided you do a proper skin regiment---exfoliate, use toner to remove dirt from pores, deep pore extractions every few weeks, and a light alpha-hydroxy monthly peel). Amazon also sells this for cheaper than the $20/jar price at local stores. Wish it had SPF.</li>
            <li> Love it, the product speaks for itself, there&#x27;s nothing that works as well as Burts Bee&#x27;s Day, and night creams, I use all of their products.</li>
            <li> Very emollient face cream, I&#x27;ve been using it for several years, everyday in the winter and every other day in the summer. It keeps my face soft without making it oily and a jar last me six months, which is great!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how much I love it! Really cheap and smells good. Most importantly, it suits my skin well.</li>
            <li> I love this cream! I would have given this 5 stars, but the lid was cracked when it showed up.</li>
            <li> Not great but not awful.  If you are looking for a light moisturizer it should do the trick.</li>
            <li> Love how this feels on my skin and smells great! Can&#x27;t wait to order the night cream to go with it. Makes my skin feel just right, never oily or dry.</li>
            <li> Great product. I use it every day and a little bit goes a long way.  Smells good and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write amazon reviews but I feel like women in general get sold so much snake oil, so when I find a product that works well AND is priced fairly I have to talk it up!&lt;br /&gt;I have very problematic skin, I&#x27;m thirty and still break out. It&#x27;s hard for me to find a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel really oily or shiny. I&#x27;ve spent lots of money looking for something, because I really do believe that at thirty, you have to start taking good care of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I was using Kate Sommerville&#x27;s oil free moisturizer. It cost 65 dollars for 2 oz. I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my skin, so when it ran out I decided to buy this product, which was over 40 dollars LESS than the big department store brand.&lt;br /&gt;Within two days I noticed that my skin looked really dewy and radiant, something that never happened with the Kate Sommerville. So far, this hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts and my skin doesn&#x27;t look shiny or greasy, just glowy. I will update in a month or so to see if the results are consistent, but so far I cannot recommend this product enough!</li>
            <li> I recently switched to this cream over my old moisturizer and I love it, and my skin is so much clearer.  It doesn&#x27;t take much at all, even when I have dry scratchy winter skin.  Tingles a bit the first few uses but that goes away.</li>
            <li> Great non-greasy cream for under makeup</li>
            <li> I have been using the Radiance Night Creme for a while, and the formula seems to have changed, so I tried the Day Creme. I am disappointed with both - the old version was more creamy and felt much better on my skin. It also had a sort of natural shimmer (or radiance, if you will) that is not replicated in this new product or in the new Night Creme. I&#x27;m especially disappointed with the fragrance - I find the addition of fragrance unnecessary and disappointing in a natural product, not to mention that I find the fragrance blend to be unpleasant.</li>
            <li> This facial lotion feels velvety soft on my face.  I&#x27;ve not used it long enough to see a visual difference but it is very smooth and even.  It makes a nice foundation for my make-up.</li>
            <li> Someone at work left this product (unopened) near the sign in sheet with a note that said - &amp;#34;Help yourself&amp;#34;.  I grabbed it immediately, Hey If it&#x27;s FREE its for me.  Anyway - I have not used this on my face, YET, but I have been rubbing it on my hands and OH MY are they soft, not greasy, just soft, I can&#x27;t even explain it, you have to try it to see what I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the $30 dollar and up creams.  My wife got this and says she likes it as much as a far more expensive competitor W*L*DA + 2 E&#x27;s.  And all natural ingredients.  We are glad to have found it.</li>
            <li> This cream feels so good on my skin. This is my second jar. I plan on staying with this product.</li>
            <li> love this skin cream.  It is lightweight and seeps into your skin.  Has a very nice feel to it</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this is the only product I can use.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of most Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s products, but the fragrance of this is quite strong and doesn&#x27;t agree with my skin or my nose.</li>
            <li> Great all nature cream that feels so good on!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why theres bad reviews but this is the best cream I ever had. My face feels awesome after I put it on. I can feel it on all day. Its smells great and I put it on after I wash my face! It never ever breaks me out. I didn&#x27;t know I could get this cheaper on Amazon but it is cheaper than the store. One bottle last me a long time. Like 4 to 5 months.</li>
            <li> I use the Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally agesless Night Creme under this in the morning&#x27;s.  Living in dry state need both.  Wish did have SP Sun protection in it, since I need it.  Have rosacea.  Also usually wind up applying a tad of the night time creme in spot&#x27;s during day.</li>
            <li> for my wife, she likes it</li>
            <li> I have always been a huge fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees products, and this skin cream is no exception.  It goes on non-greasy, and keeps my face nice and supple all day.  However, I too have some reservations (as many others here have stated) as to whether the old formula has been changed for the worse following their corporate buyout (In 2007, Clorox purchased Burt&#x27;s Bees for $925 million dollars).  It seemed that the old formula day cream used to last much longer.  However, by comparison, this still is a fine product by any standards.  I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I use this every day and have very sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. I&#x27;ve been using sensitive skin, it works sometimes</li>
            <li> Not a bad purchase especially for winter times.</li>
            <li> I had never tried any of Burt&#x27;s Bees products, I was watching one of the morning programs and they mentioned the lip balm, I happened to be on Amazon and saw this and was running low on my day cream and thought I&#x27;d give it a try, so glad I did, my skin has never felt so soft. I&#x27;ll never spend on the high end day creams again</li>
            <li> Thick as the grease paint that clowns wear, this new formulation of Radiance is absolutely foul--and so is the smell. The odor will remind you of a moldy antiques store. I used to be a devotee of Burt&#x27;s Bees, but now will be looking elsewhere for a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He uses it religiously, and his skin looks great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No smell, and have always loved Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
            <li> I l;ike this cream because it&#x27;s not sticky, but really softens my face and stays on all day.  There&#x27;s almost no fragrance either.</li>
            <li> Goes on light, doesn&#x27;t take very much! Nice clean smell.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!  Cream was congealed and separated in jar.  I stirred it up but it felt grainy and burned my face - I had to quickly wash it off!  Also, the lid of the jar was dusty and was probably years old as it had a metal lid.  It was clearly past it&#x27;s &#x27;shelf life&#x27;. I&#x27;ve been using BB for years and never had this experience.  The only difference this time was that I bought it online through Amazon.  Sue Bell</li>
            <li> I love this facial cream!! It leaves my face feeling super soft without looking oily. I often just wear this cream instead of makeup because it makes my face look and feel amazing!!!</li>
            <li> Love all Burt&#x27;s Bees products. When i received this product, it has the plastic slink wrap around the jar and it was really sticky... so sticky that grossed me out to open the jar. So 2 stars from me. Sorry Burt&#x27;s Bee.</li>
            <li> I have recently been trying to find a more natural and organic skin care routine. I have combination skin that can be a bit sensitive. I also have an uneven skin tone.For awhile now I have been using this routine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr Woods Black Soap with shea butter as a facial cleanser and body wash&lt;br /&gt;Witch Hazel for a facial toner&lt;br /&gt;Burts Bees Radiance Day Cream as a daytime moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip Oil for a night time moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use an Aztec Clay Mask once a week for a deep clean.&lt;br /&gt;Coconut Oil for an overall body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;And I use a Konjac Sponge for a more natural version of a loofah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so far really loving this routine. And to be perfectly honest, the only reason I am using a separate moisturizer for daytime and nighttime is I already owned he Burts Bees Day Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Black Soap is a castile soap. I find it makes my skin very clean and surprisingly soft. The smell is okay. It smells like...well, soap. It does not smell like you are in a field of flowers or surrounded by mangoes like most beauty products do, but I am okay with that. I do not find the smell bad at all, just different then what I am used to from more normal products. It can also be used to wash your hair, but I have yet to try that. I have however tried it as a cleaner while doing the dishes and I found it worked well as a household cleaner as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love witch hazel. It is a great toner. It feels refreshing and exactly like any other toner I have ever used. But it is better as I feel a sense of joy everytime I use it as I know I am not putting any weird harsh chemicals on my skin when using it. If you donâ€™t use toners, I highly recommend it. There are plenty of websites out there that show all the benefits of using a toner between a cleanser and a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Burts Bees Day Cream. I love the smell, it is in a cute little bottle, and my skin feels ready to tackle the day after using it. I am a big fan of most ofthe Burts Bees products so it makes sense that I like this too. I will however attempt to just use rosehip oil as a moisturizer once this cream is gone, simply because it would be more simplistic to just have 1 and it will save me some money. If that doesnâ€™t work, I will gladly reorder this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip Oil is my new love when it comes to beauty products. It has recently gained popularity when model Miranda Kerr admitted to using it nightly on her skin. The smell isnâ€™t good or bad. Meaning that it doesnâ€™t smell wonderful like a perfume, but the smell isnâ€™t bad and take away from the awesomeness of this product. If you donâ€™t like the smell of it, donâ€™t worry. It absorbs very quickly into your skin and the smell goes away once it does. It makes my skin so SMOOTH! And as I said, it absorbs very quickly which I love. I only use around 2-3 drops a night to cover my whole face. SO it will last quite awhile. I also love all the benefits it has. Again, there are plenty of websites out there that preach the amazing reasons to use this essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure by now we all know the lovely product that is coconut oil. It makes a fantastic lotion. My skin has never been more smooth in my life. The only downside in my opinion is it does not absorb quite as fast into my skin as the rosehip oil does. So I usually put this on first and let it start to work and then do the rest of my routine( hair, brush teeth, face, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Aztec Clay Mask is such a simplistic face mask, yet it works better than any I have every used. It is especially useful for people who struggle with acne. I simply mix it with some Apple Cider Vinegar and put it on. I think go do a few chores like the dishes or starting laundry. I wash it off in the shower. Some donâ€™t prefer to do this, but I havenâ€™t had any problems doing so and I prefer to do it this way as it makes less of a mess in my opinion. I strongly encourage you all to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The KonjacSponges are a new addition to my routine. They are made from a plant root and another natural ingredient. They are expected to last around 3 months. Even longer if you take better care of them. They are so soft! And I can already tell it helps make my skin more smooth. I find them to definitely be a positive addition to my skincare routine and will be buying more. I use the pink clay facial sponge for my face cleaning. The pink clay helps with dry skin and uneven skin tone. There are a lot of varieties of different ingredients added to the sponges, so I am sure you can find one that works best for your skin. I then use the red clay body sponge for the same reasons. I have really dry skin and these help. I also feel a bit indulgent every time I use them because of how soft they are!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this has helped if you are like me and looking to lessen the amount of chemicals you put on your skin. Next I plan to try and make a more natural hair care routine, and then find natural alternatives for deodorant and toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The other reviewers are correct. They definitely changed their formula in a drastic way. The consistency, smell, and results completely took a 180. It now has a chemical smell and not exactly sure what it&#x27;s doing to my face, but it&#x27;s not pleasant (almost a drying/pore clogging feel?). The old formula was awesome and you could see and feel the true radiance...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to love Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s, but they must have changed a lot (possibly all) of their formulas and/or were bought out by another company. I can tell that cheaper and toxic ingredients are now being used in their products. Truly disappointed, because I believe they were going a natural and pleasant direction when they first started. I won&#x27;t be purchasing the Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s brand anymore.</li>
            <li> It seems like some people have come upon &amp;#34;bad batches&amp;#34; of this face cream, beause I love this stuff! I used to use it a few years ago, then stopped for a while because it doesn&#x27;t offer any sun protection, which is its only flaw in my opinion. I&#x27;m battling moderate adult acne right now, so I use some very drying products on my poor face, and this day cream helps keep my skin from screaming in pain. The consistency is a perfect balance of wet and creamy (more on the wet side, which feels so nice on overdried skin). It absorbs quickly rather than sitting on top of dry skin like some creams, and leaves my face feeling soft and moisturized, but not greasy. Now that it&#x27;s spring, I will probably layer some Yes To cucumbers sunscreen with it, but this face cream has been a godsend in a very tortuous time for my skin and I plan to keep using it as long as I can.</li>
            <li> my skin is dry the day cream is wonderful it works well when you are out in sun great under makeup</li>
            <li> I SO WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS AND NOW WILL BE RETURNING TO WHERE I GOT IT FROM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S SO!!! FRUSTRATING now that Burt&#x27;s Bees is owned by a major corporation, we no longer can trust the products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is so sticky and why in the world it&#x27;s not 100% natural? or 99% as it used to be?  at least&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;why the fragrance?  why not a few drops of essential oils instead...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this cream is sticky did I mention?  Sugar is another ingredient that I don&#x27;t understand in creams, hm... it&#x27;s almost like they made a deal to keep us hooked on the white death, like we didn&#x27;t have enough added everywhere we look in our foods&lt;br /&gt;seriously though can  we be more hooked on processed sugar if we feed our skin with it? hm...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;save $5 at iherb site on any product they offer with this code: KAL996&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by the way there are some good products they still make, but I would look into private companies, the way Burt&#x27;s bees started out, look for the modern day burt&#x27;s bees type of companies... learn more just through this local site that is fighting for the only organic farm left in rural Maryland/outside DC... polititians are pushing to level it in favor of yet another soccer field (cover for \\&quot;let&#x27;s get rid of any competition\\&quot; that stands in the way of fat corporations giving us genetically modified foods) [...]</li>
            <li> I was using a similar product from Burt that had sun screen but it was discontinued.  This works well but lacks the sun screen.  Light feel &amp; good fragrence.</li>
            <li> moisture without heavyï¼Œexcept the smell.</li>
            <li> Using all Burts Bees products. After one week notice difference in my facial skin!</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Burts Bees products, and I us the Radiance Day cream for daytime.  It is light, smells good, and keeps my skin moist without being greasy.</li>
            <li> Love it! Makes my skin feel so soft and takes away dry spots. Will continue to use it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I opened the box for this item and the jar did not have a seal, and the cream was leaking everywhere.</li>
            <li> My skin loves this stuff. My face feels super smooth and silky and I&#x27;ve noticed my crows feet have diminished since I started using it. I like it so much I&#x27;ve also started using the night cream.</li>
            <li> So far the best moisturizer ever used. Usually I start using a moisturizer and it ends up getting wasted as I never get satisfied with any. As for this, I look forward to using it every day. The texture is light and perfect. Havnt tried the older version and so cant compare. On the whole, it&#x27;s the kind of product I have been looking for for long. Oh wait, did I mention about the fresh fragrance it has.</li>
            <li> A little too light for my taste.  I&#x27;d prefer a more firm cream, night or day. My skin absorbs it almost instantly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having a pretty rough time these past couple of months with my skin. It started with horrible cystic breakouts that went on to leave unsightly scars. After finally seeing a doctors about it, its starting to clear up but my skin just looked....*UGH*. I remembered using this years ago upon seeing it in target one day (looking for something to make my skin look *yum*), and decided to try it again. My skin, after a week of use is beginning to look more youthful and radiant despite this crap its going through. Makes me feel that much more confident about myself. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Pros: deeply moisturizing without being heavy.  Makes my skin overall look less blotchy, and doesn&#x27;t set off extra breakouts.  (I&#x27;m never breakout free, but other moisturizers just make things worse.)  I don&#x27;t use this for aged skin, but I would say that since it does improve the overall appearance of your skin it probably helps in that area.  Cons: thinner than it used to be (I used to be able to use a jar for a year, now I need literally twice as much).  They changed the formula--when I wrote to complain about this, they explained that it had something to do with removing borax (sodium borate) from the original formula and replacing it with others.  I can see why they did that, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve succeeded in making a new formula that works as well as the old one.</li>
            <li> Have used this cream for years.  Would not use anything else.  Non greasy and feels good on your skin.  Highly recommend.  It&#x27;s  gotten hard to find in my area so this is the perfect answer.</li>
            <li> Long time fan of the entire radiance line.</li>
            <li> Recently I bought Burt&#x27;s day cream for my wife. She is young and has no wrinkles. She used this cream for 10 days and found it not suitable. The cream does not hydrate visibly. Does not feel like a smooth cream. After application it dries up and disappears very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Failed to impress. Not worth the price the vendor asks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t buy again this or similar product from Burt&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and love it.  It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores like previously used products and has a nice light feel and pleasant - not overbearing - scent.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for at least three years. It is a wonderful day cream. It moisturizes perfectly for the day and is not greasy at all. It is my favorite day cream.</li>
            <li> This day cream is now part of my &amp;#34;mommy to be&amp;#34; face routine. I had to recently make some changes to my facial products because a lot of them contained retinol, which should be avoided while pregnant.&lt;br /&gt;This cream has a nice light scent to it, does not feel heavy, &amp; keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li> very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very goodvery good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very goodMy normal size is a 9 or 10 and I ordered a 10 because the review here and on other sites said they run small...the 10 is big, I probably should have gone with the 9 since there are no half sizes. I&#x27;m going to keep it and wear with two pairs of socks. Haven&#x27;t tried outside yet but the grips seem really good and the boot itself seems like it will definitely keep my feet warm. Wish there was a little bit more arch support, but I like the boots because they fit under the jeans easily or could be worn with leggings on a warmer day to show off the cute buckles. Over all, I think they were definitely worth the $33 dollars that I paid for them, considering other websites are selling them in the $70-120 range - after all, they are rated to keep your feet warm to -25 degrees. ***Update, ended up sending them back because the holes for the buckles were not punched all the way (so not adjustable) and even with two pairs of socks they were still quite big. Seems like they have overadjusted for the sizing issue they had before.</li>
            <li> Really love this product - it is light and moisturizing. I do wish it had SPF in it, but understand that this is a difficult compromise for BBs.</li>
            <li> Love the whole Radiance line - and this is my favorite product in it.  It&#x27;s light and non-greasy - my skin loves putting it on in the morning!</li>
            <li> My skin looks great since I&#x27;ve been using this.  Only complaint is that immediately after application my skin feels a little filmy, but this goes away about 10 minutes after application</li>
            <li> Very happy face feels soft and  smooth</li>
            <li> I really love this day creme. I have very sensitive skin and cannot use most products out there. This one feels wonderful and leaves no greasy residue. I will order it again.</li>
            <li> Very effective and this is only product for especially face.Any one can try and you will see good results. Have fun</li>
            <li> It has an odd smell, and I don&#x27;t feel like it hydrates all that well</li>
            <li> Great beauty product made using natural bee wax. My wife loves it. Have been using this product for years now.</li>
            <li> This product smelled so terrible I threw it away immediately after opening it, which really never happens. Perhaps I got an expired/rancid one, but the smell was intolerable. Absolutely foul. I bought it because I used to be a long-time customer of the Radiance Day Cream with SPF 15, but began looking for alternatives when that product was relabeled as only SPF 7. I now have a separate high-SPF facial sunblock that I use, so I thought I would buy the version of this day cream without SPF since I used to love it so much. Somehow it is a completely different product... and totally unusable to me. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! All these products are great.</li>
            <li> I began using Burt&#x27;s about 7 years ago when it first hit the market. At the time the product was very good, notably the Radiance line of Day &amp; Night cremes. I stopped using them two years ago when I lost my job and had to tighten the belt, so to speak, and haven&#x27;t bought BB up until last month. Sad to say, I regret my purchase. The creme is diluted. It no longer has the smoothing, firming properties that of Radiance creme 5-7 years ago. Instead of leaving my face hydrated, it made my skin feel dried out and flaky. It was clumpy around my nose and left redness on my cheeks and made my skin dry out before I even finished my makeup routine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In addition, it causes my skin to break out, specifically my neck. My neck breaks out into hives that scratch and itch like I rubbed poison Oak all over it! My face doesn&#x27;t react overtly to the ingredients, though it is puffier, redder and there is absolutely no sign of smoothing or firming or hydration. Buying this creme was a waste of $20.00 and a terrible experience. Even if your skin doesn&#x27;t break out you will probably have no positive outcome in terms of hydrating your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If any one has recommendations for a good face hydrating creme, let me know. I will never use BB&#x27;s again.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Absorbs rather quickly.  Works well with foundation.  Minimal amount needed.  Holds moisture on skin.  Not greasy feeling.  Would recommend product.</li>
