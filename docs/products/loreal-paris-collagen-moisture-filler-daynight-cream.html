            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love Loreal Collagen Moisture Filler!</li>
            <li>I use this at night and have noticed a tremendous difference in the suppleness of my skin and the price is very good.</li>
            <li>this stuff feels wonderful, so light and silky and the fragrance is not too terribly strong.  </li>
            <li>It feels smooth and luxurious and does a great job hydrating my skin.</li>
            <li>So I start using just the L&#x27;Oreal Collagen Filler under my makeup and the results were amazing.</li>
            <li>AMAZINGLY</li>
            <li>This was a trial purchase but my skin responds more favorably to the L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al Age Perfect Hydra-Perfect Golden Balm.</li>
            <li>I used it for about a month every day 2x a day and can honestly say I didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li>Nicely packaged and came on time.</li>
            <li>nice moisture filler.</li>
            <li>i put it at night time and makes my face feel creamy and nice</li>
            <li>I have always liked L Oreal products.</li>
            <li>THANK YOU KINDLY.</li>
            <li>But the cream feels nice and goes on well.</li>
            <li>a nice cream</li>
            <li>I use it overnight and in the morning my skin is nice and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I wasn’t thrilled about</li>
            <li>nothing is, but it&#x27;s a nice cream for the money.</li>
            <li>and I still am loving it.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice fragrance too.</li>
            <li>If I want to wear perfume, I will choose my own...</li>
            <li>and you cannot wear your own perfume because of that.</li>
            <li>It may be a fairly good moisturizer but nothing more.</li>
            <li>Goes on and stays on nicely.  </li>
            <li>Very good, my friends are all very like it!</li>
            <li>Good moisture cream and so easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal Paris Collagen Moisture Filler Day/Night Cream, 1.7 Fluid Ounce  good service and excellent product.</li>
            <li>Good product, comfortable after apply.</li>
            <li>BUT IT SURE FEELS NICE</li>
            <li>So far, its perfect!  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best!!!</li>
            <li>Wonderful skin cream for &#x27;mature&#x27; skin at an inexpensive cost</li>
            <li>she swears by it and i am able to get it at an amazing price on amazon.</li>
            <li>I was delighted to find these Loreal products at a very good price and believe that I&#x27;ve finally found products that will keep my skin moisturized.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a very good product and she highly recommends it.</li>
            <li>I love using creams and this one by far is awesome.</li>
            <li>I am 34 and have some fine lines; this seems to plump them up!  </li>
            <li>It is very smooth, and although i don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles but the ones that i do, have started to diminish.</li>
            <li>soothing fragrance and the texture is very smooth and creamy.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product; I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time and it works great;</li>
            <li>I love it and will probably buy this again.</li>
            <li>Love it, love the smell and the effect</li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I switched to an Olay product and am having much better results.</li>
            <li>I love this moisture cream.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting to be so pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Ok as night moisturizer I don&#x27;t like the smell and</li>
            <li>MY SKIN FEELS AND LOOKS SO MUCH BETTER SINCE I STARTED USING IT.</li>
            <li>Really love the smell and the texture of this</li>
            <li>The longer I use it, the more I like it -</li>
            <li>Give it a try and see if it works for you :-)</li>
            <li>I love this and even have the GUYS in my house using it</li>
            <li>I love this Collagen by L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can see the difference when I use this product will continue to use until I find something I like better.</li>
            <li>thanks to Amazon.com, I was able to get a great price for it.</li>
            <li>I also am pleased with the price of the cream, which is affordable for those on a budget.</li>
            <li>This cream is one of the better ones I have used.</li>
            <li>It will immediately moisturize skin but the longer you use the more rejuvenated your skin becomes.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will always buy it if I can find it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll need more time to use.</li>
            <li>After using it for a month , mostly every night I didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li>After about 6 week&#x27;s use I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>My skin looks even better.  </li>
            <li>For day time use I put a moisturizing lotion that contains SPF 15 or 18 on top of it</li>
            <li>My skin looks smoother and more plumped out</li>
            <li>but I love that it has no smell.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin nice &amp; smooth, I can tell the difference when I run out.....</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and that is why I appreciate being able to order it from amazon.  </li>
            <li>I love it , use it all the time.</li>
            <li>While it is OK as a night cream, foundation over it gets oily flakes.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I do love the way it feels and how it goes on, but it DID NOT work for me.  </li>
            <li>so I cant say for sure that this to will happen to you also.</li>
            <li>The price is also awesome, especially for the quality of the cream.</li>
            <li>Ok it&#x27;s L&#x27;Oreal</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m able to even go without if I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really glad that I found it and have added it to my regime.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>Love the feel of this cream.</li>
            <li>can someone recommend me more moisturizers</li>
            <li>However, I took a chance with this product and I am glad I did,</li>
            <li>But I fell in love with this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I need more moisture.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it and am so glad i found it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I LOVE L&#x27;OREAL PRODUCTS</li>
            <li>Love my coconut oil</li>
            <li>i recommend the product you can buy it several times excellent bran</li>
            <li>and you can be confident</li>
            <li>Absolutely love......</li>
            <li>My skin feels better when I use.  </li>
            <li>but it makes my skin look better.</li>
            <li>I have been using L&#x27;Oreal Collagen for a couple of years and love it.  </li>
            <li>It hydrates my skin in the best way possible.  </li>
            <li>nothing more to say now</li>
            <li>and it make your face feel fresh and good</li>
            <li>I love everything about this moisture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using so many moisturizes, but nothing helped like this one.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>Been using this for many years now</li>
            <li>This is my favorite line filling lotion.</li>
            <li>my gf&#x27;s favorite cream.  </li>
            <li>love getting it without the worry of running out</li>
            <li>It was lovely.  </li>
            <li>love it...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is around $10 in most places-Target, Walamrt and Walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I do love how it leaves my skin.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s an OK product for over night use,on face and neck.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it around my eyes and the area looked better.  </li>
            <li>I was so pleased to see it online.  </li>
            <li>I am hoping for more.</li>
            <li>The product is okay, but I am trying another one right now that is thinner in texture and provides good coverage.</li>
            <li>this right here is good</li>
            <li>lotion itself is very rich and leaves my skin feeling well moisturized.  </li>
            <li>This is a great face cream and for those of us with more dry skin, it&#x27;s good even under makeup.</li>
            <li>but my skin looks pretty good for my age</li>
            <li>It is a wonderful moisturizer for my dry, drier, driest face!</li>
            <li>Love how smooth it goes on and doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>For a heavier cream, which I need at my age, for night time or for bonus time with extra hydration and smoothness during days at home, I love L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Golden Balm.</li>
            <li>Honesty I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but I wanted to try a good night cream.</li>
            <li>However, it is a face cream reasonably priced and rather good.</li>
            <li>Really does a good job</li>
            <li>It fills those smile and frown lines nicely.</li>
            <li>I have used L&#x27;OREAL products for many years and was not disappointed in this purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products from Loreal and still like this the best.  </li>
            <li>L’oreal in all other regards for your face is awesome.</li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizer and the only thing that might work better is a time machine.</li>
            <li>The product had a nice soft feel &amp; creamy consistency &amp; felt so nice going on I</li>
            <li>If you’re familiar with good eye creams, you really just put a dab of it on the tip of your ring fingers, and lightly dab it in.</li>
            <li>When I put on my foundation (L&#x27;Oreal, of course) it goes on so easily and the texture of my face is velvety smooth.  </li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t reduce fine lines</li>
            <li>and I bought this for my fine forehead wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years, and it always does a fine job of smoothing out wrinkles and nourishing my skin.</li>
            <li>put it over my argan oil that i lightly apply every night on my face , neck and bust area.</li>
            <li>B001V9LUZS Dr. Hauschka Day Cream, Rose, 1.0-Ounce Box]], which costs about four times as much.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all smooth.  </li>
            <li>This product was absolutely amazing and really did the job.</li>
            <li>Not that it was ever cheap.  </li>
            <li>I liked this product because it really moisturizes your skin and rejuvenates.</li>
            <li>Light weight.</li>
            <li>filled in some of the wrinkles that I&#x27;m in the process of getting rid of.</li>
            <li>and I must say that for a moisturizer it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Such a great product for the money...</li>
            <li>Still, since I use it primarily at night it’s not an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really make my skin feel really nice</li>
            <li>So creamy and smooth.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s okay to to suspend the facts and have fun with ads.</li>
            <li>My wife uses this daily and it is great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It makes my face and neck feel so smooth after I put it on.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product hoping it would help primarily with wrinkles /puffiness /dark circles around the eyes .</li>
            <li>it does really work!!!</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend !!!!</li>
            <li>and I very rarely break out anywhere.</li>
            <li>The packaging on this was very pretty, the product smelled nice (not too strong) and it was very creamy.</li>
            <li>Well worth a try for the price!</li>
            <li>After about a week I noticed my skin seemed to have more volume, appeared noticeably more youthful, the constant dryness was gone and my jawline was much more defined.</li>
            <li>really liked the pump version better as it seemed much smoother in texture, and glided on and seemed to absorb into the skin much easier.  </li>
            <li>Love this one from the first time using it.</li>
            <li>Rich but over perfumed.</li>
            <li>Leave my skin fresh and moisture!</li>
            <li>I was looking for something rich for my skin</li>
            <li>I feel it&#x27;s a very good moisturizer which has softened my skin, but I haven&#x27;t seen too much of an improvement in my facial tone yet.</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin, rich feel.  </li>
            <li>I’m really happy about this product, and would recommend it to anyone who has dry skin.</li>
            <li>i did reorder this its a Wonderful cream it leave your skin feeling soft and looking younger too</li>
            <li>remember when I was 25 and was told I should start using hydration creams on my face and to clean my face before going to bed and did not want to do anything preventative.</li>
            <li>My beautiful young Russian girlfriend likes it; that does not mean it is good; she likes to spend my money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll say this L&#x27;oreal product does a great job moisturizing my very dry skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is very dry and it works great for me, someone with oily or acne prone skin may not want to use this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s true that you should wait before applying liquid or even mineral foundation, maybe 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>It smells good and doesn&#x27;t make my face feel all greasy the next day in the morning.</li>
            <li>, wrinkles that I&#x27;m working on diminishing, and was looking for a good overall moisturizer cream.</li>
            <li>It obviously wont get rid of your wrinkles like NuNutrients, but it’s good for if you need some protection from the sun.</li>
            <li>but overall its a good product</li>
            <li>Although the aroma is not bad, it&#x27;s too overpowering to wear</li>
            <li>I use it only at night because it&#x27;s a bit oily looking, but that&#x27;s a good thing at night because my skin feels super moisterized.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal comes in a nice glass container that is short and squat and easy to travel</li>
            <li>This is seriously the best!</li>
            <li>this is a good one, moist not too much fragrance, you feel like you have a soft skin.</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;ve found that might work slightly better (though all I can say for sure is that it works as well) is [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>it would still be super greasy lotion, and b.)</li>
            <li>It absorbs quick and you face does not feel greasy.</li>
            <li>Lo real always produces the best  and richest creams which never feel greasy or heavy .</li>
            <li>Very happy with the product and would definitely continue to order in the future!</li>
            <li>Once I started to use it, I quickly noticed that it isn&#x27;t moisturizing at all</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>first time I used the collagen filler my face felt silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I love these products , and are glad to have  bought them, will continue buying them if offers come up, thanks</li>
            <li>My makeup hasn&#x27;t looked that good in a long time - come to think of it</li>
            <li>No unpleasant odor.  </li>
            <li>This is not a heavy cream, and I believe it does my skin a lot better than L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s day cream that is also in a blue jar because of the better absorption, which means more hydration.</li>
            <li>My new favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin smooth and feels so good even cools down the skin.</li>
            <li>I use all of them and they are all superb for my dry fragile skin.</li>
            <li>I first tried this when I saw how my cousin &#x27;s skin was looking vibrant and more youthful and plumper around her eyes.  </li>
            <li>Been using this product for long while and like it, not greasy and very refreshing as a night cream</li>
            <li>It does feel a bit greasy to me, though, and the contents seem to have separated somewhat, more so now as I near the bottom of the jar.</li>
            <li>awesome..keeps me fresh all day.</li>
            <li>The cream is quickly absorbed into your skin without having a greasy feel.</li>
            <li>I always get compliments on how lovely my 42 year old skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and many products cause my skin to break out, some even after I have used them for years.</li>
            <li>I use this for night moisturizing and so far love it - do feel like 3 days use</li>
            <li>I’ve also noticed that my skin looks more clear and fresh</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 55 years old, so again, it&#x27;s not wrinkle magic...</li>
            <li>Give it a try; the price is right.</li>
            <li>The foundation just glides right on without my face feeling greasy and over-moisturized from the cream.  </li>
            <li>it has just the right of moisture for day and night use.  </li>
            <li>Price was just right</li>
            <li>My skin sucked it right in.</li>
            <li>Like how moisturized my skin feels right after I use it.</li>
            <li>As I apply right before bed, I assume this is eventually rubbed off onto my pillowcase.  </li>
            <li>Also, the price is right.</li>
            <li>It was pretty greasy right away, but over the course of a couple of weeks, a puddle of oil has literally developed on top of the lotion.</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin and break out with acne easily</li>
            <li>I have tried many expensive products, but have never had the great results that I do with this.</li>
            <li>The receiver is in love with this and says she&#x27;s really feels the benefits, which her skin clearly shows.</li>
            <li>It goes on really smoothly, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and I wake up with very soft; moisturized skin.  </li>
            <li>Softened the appearance of fine lines around my mouth, better than some other creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I combine this with other products for a youthful appearance and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>It does not take very much to work properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just received the product, but very much like the consistency and ingredients.</li>
            <li>A little sticky but emollient and good for the price.</li>
            <li>good for my dry skin, makes it feel very soft.</li>
            <li>Works better than many more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>I could feel the difference the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>and this is my first time using any L&#x27;Oreal product.</li>
            <li>Saw a difference the first night.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for in a night</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, been using it for several years.</li>
            <li>Really makes your face rehydrated and fresh.</li>
            <li>First the Loreal Paris serum</li>
            <li>It makes your face feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed!</li>
            <li>I actually love it before I got to sleep for the exact same reasons why I don’t like it around my eyes: the thickness of the cream stays and seeps in while you’re sleeping making you wake up feeling more refreshed and younger.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>so I have used many different moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>I think this is going to be a permanent switch...and absolute keeper!</li>
            <li>I love this product and i have order it several times but his time it about 3 months</li>
            <li>:&amp;#62;)  I use morning Collagen for morning and use Night for night time.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t exactly make me look 35</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When sued and taken to court 12 years ago about these things, the judge said it was all in fun and no one really believes these ads anyhow</li>
            <li>Once more no one stands up for the working class and everything goes to government and big business.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, and it makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>It moisturized so good that eventually it appeared as though the lines and few wrinkles that I had were beginning to fade away.</li>
            <li>I switched to this brand of facial moisture cream and it&#x27;s been great for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Kind of thick and does not spread as easily as pump products.</li>
            <li>Feels good when first applied but not very long lasting.</li>
            <li>not easy finding a good face cream.  </li>
            <li>The smell is soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>product does very little really but is a pretty good moisturizer</li>
            <li>I still have half the container and honestly might just trash it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t honestly say that I see any difference in the number of previous wrinkles</li>
            <li>Fair, the usual, really doesn&#x27;t do what it advertises.</li>
            <li>Has really made a positive improvement to my skin</li>
            <li>plus I love the blue jar), and I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a really nice day and/or night cream that helps make your skin look velvety smooth, moisturized, and a few years younger.  </li>
            <li>I just LOVE this cream, and will never go back to my old creams!</li>
            <li>Seems fine enough but haven&#x27;t been using it all up</li>
            <li>It stings a little, leaves my face kind of greasy.</li>
            <li>Maybe be a little heavy for summer but for the winter it is perfect!</li>
            <li>I have very easy-to-manage skin.</li>
            <li>I really did not notice ANY improvement in skin elasticity or fine-line reduction either.</li>
            <li>If it seems you&#x27;ve put on too much, dab the excess with a paper towel</li>
            <li>I am saving so much money - this cream does it all.</li>
            <li>Really keeps away the wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I do not see any drastic changes really.</li>
            <li>my face really glowed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really tell a difference</li>
            <li>But it does work very well</li>
            <li>Breaking me out but very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream!</li>
            <li>I use this every day and it really helps my sagging neck and face.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast but the packaging dented the box the jar came in.</li>
            <li>My face feels so much softer and it maintains the moisture throughout the day.</li>
            <li>You do not need much of it so use it sparingly.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I tend to really like a lot of Loreal products</li>
            <li>Really moisture cream.</li>
            <li>so very silky on my face.</li>
            <li>I also wear it under makeup, and it works very well.</li>
            <li>but doesn&#x27;t really work...</li>
            <li>I really like L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s collagen products</li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>why does Loreal have to add so much fragrance to their products.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t really expect that.  </li>
            <li>It took about a month to really see the change.</li>
            <li>Recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>It gets very streaky.</li>
            <li>This product is especially good for me when I use it in the winter cold months.</li>
            <li>Very luxurious feeling</li>
            <li>However, there seemed to be only one container available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>have used this collagen cream before and was thrilled when I found it on amazon at such a terrific price.</li>
            <li>Nice smell on the heavy side for moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I use it daily until my skin finally seems to be tending to oily on its own, then stop and use a lighter product for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>Good product, skin firmer and fuller after 1 week of use, and I am a man in late 20s.</li>
            <li>If you mix it with a little Borage Oil right out of the capsule it is even better.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way though, A great value too.</li>
            <li>my face felt softer and more supple without feeling greasy, like other products I have used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a long time, I have mature sensitive skin, and like this as it&#x27;s nice and creamy, without feeling greasy doesn&#x27;t contain scent, so doesn&#x27;t make my skin hurt.</li>
            <li>I have pretty tough skin that can take a good beating without ever breaking out.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a good thick moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have tried many facial products high end, low end, and natural - this one is a true winner.</li>
            <li>love this stuff - wonderful for day or night but will definitely help with dry skin but might be heavy for other skin types</li>
            <li>I have lived too long before  sun protection creams were available.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>This is one product I couldn&#x27;t live without!</li>
            <li>It does not feel the greatest around my eyes, partially because of it very thick.</li>
            <li>The texture is nice and thick, compared to many other runny cremes.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a product that was light, non-greasy, and would help to replenish my dry skin.</li>
            <li>Overall my skin looks younger and just better, but the craziest thing is...</li>
            <li>My pores appeared smaller, my makeup went on sooo smooth and my face had a natural matted look -  </li>
            <li>This is fantastic, my skin is so soft, pores smaller lines are disappearing.</li>
            <li>most likely, a very low amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It seemed that I had to apply quite a bit for facial coverage, and thus the product was used fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>All I want to say is,  I think this particular product is one, I will recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>Even after using Oil of Olay for years, as I got older I started getting wrinkles on my forehead, frown dent in between my eyes, wrinkles developing around my eyes and</li>
            <li>I encourage to use it, but if you are older than that expecting this cream to take your wrinkles away forget about that.</li>
            <li>No less wrinkles, or any cleaning up of the face is evident what-so-ever.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent product for the price.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s available on Amazon prime, and even cheaper if you subscribe to receive it regularly - which, after trying it out first, I&#x27;m definitely going to do.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not heavy like some others I have tried, has helped moisturize my skin overnight without being greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Lightly scented, similar (bit less potent) to Olay original.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream</li>
            <li>Not sure how much it will help overall as it is a collagen moisture filler, but as I have dry skin it definitely moisturizes it, the price at amazon was great, got free shipping also.</li>
            <li>this made my skin definitely better, use it everyday.</li>
            <li>Normally, I use Dermaware</li>
            <li>If you have normal skin</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer and use it everyday.  </li>
            <li>deep laugh lines on the sides of my mouth.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using this long enough to say it has made a difference in the appearance my skin, I do love the way it feels every night before going to bed, My skin feels firmer in the morning.</li>
            <li>Easily applied and does not feel sticky or gooey afterward, but you should let it die down some if you need to cover a blemish with some concealer or it will not adhere.</li>
            <li>prevent new ones.  </li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t noticed any new ones.  </li>
            <li>My new part of regime.</li>
            <li>Especially strong in cold weather.  </li>
            <li>I was actually surprised at how nice and thick the cream was.</li>
            <li>And the fine lines developing down my cheeks are gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin after 6 mos.</li>
            <li>I have t zone breakouts and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft and moisturized in the morning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells, and I didn&#x27;t find that this had one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Completely gone!</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time last night, and this morning, it felt like I was wearing someone else&#x27;s face!!!</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase of the product and first order online.  </li>
            <li>Also, a paraben is not one of the first ingredients listed but one of the last.</li>
            <li>Also at first it seems to work, hydrating the skin and making it supple for several hours.</li>
            <li>Too heavy, and an overwhelmingly strong fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it very long and for right now the juries still out as to whether I would recommend it or not.</li>
            <li>within just a few days you&amp;#34;ll notice a reduction of fine lines.</li>
            <li>This cream is a fabulous day cream because it fills little creases.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used very expensive creams in the past, and this is just as good, and in some cases, better!</li>
            <li>I am 56 years old and getting wrinkles around the eyes.  </li>
            <li>I really like the product I&#x27;m 47 and starting to show lines here</li>
            <li>When I wake in the morning the skin around my eyes is soft and supple.</li>
            <li>Trashed my old moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it for the neck, and stick with my old stand-by, Neutrogena Ageless Essentials Continuous Hydration, for the sensitive face.</li>
            <li>The price was considerably lower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now in my early thirties and struggle with changing aging skin in addition to chronic dryness.</li>
            <li>This product is very comparable at a fourth the cost.</li>
            <li>It makes my face soft  and softens any lines.</li>
            <li>I am 23 years old</li>
            <li>Keeps your skin so soft and supple.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too early to tell if it&#x27;s helping in taking any wrinkles away, but by it just filling it in, helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling extremely soft.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 30s with somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am 72 years old and my face feels so soft and the wrinkles are there but improved.  </li>
            <li>Recommend this cream to everyone, young and old.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Keeps me looking young.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a substore that offers this cream through amazon....</li>
            <li>So far, no breakouts.</li>
            <li>It is one of the few things that make my hands smooth.</li>
            <li>actually I have not found any cream that really works...other than retna  A....</li>
            <li>I did really see a big difference after using it for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I am almost ready to buy my second bottle</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that produces some redness on my cheeks/temples and flaking by my sideburns, and the L’Oreal takes care of both of those problems well.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t seem to have any reactions to it as I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Smoothed out skin and has made my face look smoother and soft</li>
            <li>and I started suffering from dry skin, my facial skin is always shedding specially my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, particularly if you have very dry skin as I do.</li>
            <li>Overall I’d highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li>While it’s not overwhelming at all, I would have preferred it be fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>This cream really moisturizes/reduces wrinkles of my normal to dry facial skin...</li>
            <li>has a very delicate fragrance goes on smoothly and really absorbs into skin well.</li>
            <li>and this is the only thing I have found to keep my face hydrated and soft!</li>
            <li>I am a huge fanatic when it comes to moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Of course the fact that my face is moisturized has helped my skin appear to be smoother in general.</li>
            <li>I recommend it particularly in the winter when skin tends to be dry.</li>
            <li>It helps relax the dry lines and wrinkles that are part of getting older.</li>
            <li>You can barely see evidence of any of the wrinkles around my eyes and forehead.</li>
            <li>This is the 2nd bottle I have used so far.</li>
            <li>I bought two of these and ended up discontinuing use after a few days and switching to a new brand that I like much</li>
            <li>This product helps reduce the dry skin and aging that sun can cause if you are outside too much.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I started getting little fine wrinkles, not very noticeable on my forehead and smiling expression lines.</li>
            <li>the other hand, my skin is really noticeably firmer after 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 30&#x27;s, exercise (and sweat) regularly and still I never get breakouts, not every during hormonal times, yet every time I used this product I broke out in 2-3 big blemishes.</li>
            <li>I am African American, 38 years old</li>
            <li>My wife feels that if you start using this at an early age it help reduce wrinkles and ageing over a long period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I noticed I have a small laugh line I suppose (</li>
            <li>broke my face out for some reason, maybe i used it too much, going to cut down to once a week.</li>
            <li>I am 53 with sensitive skin - dry&#x27;ish in the winter and combo when it&#x27;s humid.  </li>
            <li>For mature senior skin needing long LASTING all day moisture (no oil) - at this price its a no brainer!</li>
            <li>I have had a few more zits than usual around my chin, but it&#x27;s too soon to say if that&#x27;s the cream, stress, or just a coincidence.</li>
            <li>I normally use my plain old cetaphil daily moisturizer, and my skin is never really dry.</li>
            <li>My skin felt soft and well moisturized all day - much longer than with my previous moisturizer, which left my skin dry again by afternoon.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 49 years old and have very dry skin.</li>
            <li>This is a very thick cream, and fairly heavily perfumed - kind of floral/citrus combo.</li>
            <li>On the other side it really help my dry skin.</li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love Loreal Collagen Moisture Filler!</li>
            <li> I use this at night and have noticed a tremendous difference in the suppleness of my skin and the price is very good.</li>
            <li> this stuff feels wonderful, so light and silky and the fragrance is not too terribly strong.  </li>
            <li> It feels smooth and luxurious and does a great job hydrating my skin.</li>
            <li> So I start using just the L&#x27;Oreal Collagen Filler under my makeup and the results were amazing.</li>
            <li> AMAZINGLY</li>
            <li> This was a trial purchase but my skin responds more favorably to the L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al Age Perfect Hydra-Perfect Golden Balm.</li>
            <li> I used it for about a month every day 2x a day and can honestly say I didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li> Nicely packaged and came on time.</li>
            <li> nice moisture filler.</li>
            <li> i put it at night time and makes my face feel creamy and nice</li>
            <li> I have always liked L Oreal products.</li>
            <li> THANK YOU KINDLY.</li>
            <li> But the cream feels nice and goes on well.</li>
            <li> a nice cream</li>
            <li> I use it overnight and in the morning my skin is nice and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I wasn’t thrilled about</li>
            <li> nothing is, but it&#x27;s a nice cream for the money.</li>
            <li> and I still am loving it.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice fragrance too.</li>
            <li> If I want to wear perfume, I will choose my own...</li>
            <li> and you cannot wear your own perfume because of that.</li>
            <li> It may be a fairly good moisturizer but nothing more.</li>
            <li> Goes on and stays on nicely.  </li>
            <li> Very good, my friends are all very like it!</li>
            <li> Good moisture cream and so easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris Collagen Moisture Filler Day/Night Cream, 1.7 Fluid Ounce  good service and excellent product.</li>
            <li> Good product, comfortable after apply.</li>
            <li> BUT IT SURE FEELS NICE</li>
            <li> So far, its perfect!  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful skin cream for &#x27;mature&#x27; skin at an inexpensive cost</li>
            <li> she swears by it and i am able to get it at an amazing price on amazon.</li>
            <li> I was delighted to find these Loreal products at a very good price and believe that I&#x27;ve finally found products that will keep my skin moisturized.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a very good product and she highly recommends it.</li>
            <li> I love using creams and this one by far is awesome.</li>
            <li> I am 34 and have some fine lines; this seems to plump them up!  </li>
            <li> It is very smooth, and although i don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles but the ones that i do, have started to diminish.</li>
            <li> soothing fragrance and the texture is very smooth and creamy.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product; I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time and it works great;</li>
            <li> I love it and will probably buy this again.</li>
            <li> Love it, love the smell and the effect</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I switched to an Olay product and am having much better results.</li>
            <li> I love this moisture cream.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting to be so pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Ok as night moisturizer I don&#x27;t like the smell and</li>
            <li> MY SKIN FEELS AND LOOKS SO MUCH BETTER SINCE I STARTED USING IT.</li>
            <li> Really love the smell and the texture of this</li>
            <li> The longer I use it, the more I like it -</li>
            <li> Give it a try and see if it works for you :-)</li>
            <li> I love this and even have the GUYS in my house using it</li>
            <li> I love this Collagen by L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can see the difference when I use this product will continue to use until I find something I like better.</li>
            <li> thanks to Amazon.com, I was able to get a great price for it.</li>
            <li> I also am pleased with the price of the cream, which is affordable for those on a budget.</li>
            <li> This cream is one of the better ones I have used.</li>
            <li> It will immediately moisturize skin but the longer you use the more rejuvenated your skin becomes.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will always buy it if I can find it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll need more time to use.</li>
            <li> After using it for a month , mostly every night I didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li> After about 6 week&#x27;s use I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> My skin looks even better.  </li>
            <li> For day time use I put a moisturizing lotion that contains SPF 15 or 18 on top of it</li>
            <li> My skin looks smoother and more plumped out</li>
            <li> but I love that it has no smell.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin nice &amp; smooth, I can tell the difference when I run out.....</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and that is why I appreciate being able to order it from amazon.  </li>
            <li> I love it , use it all the time.</li>
            <li> While it is OK as a night cream, foundation over it gets oily flakes.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I do love the way it feels and how it goes on, but it DID NOT work for me.  </li>
            <li> so I cant say for sure that this to will happen to you also.</li>
            <li> The price is also awesome, especially for the quality of the cream.</li>
            <li> Ok it&#x27;s L&#x27;Oreal</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m able to even go without if I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really glad that I found it and have added it to my regime.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> Love the feel of this cream.</li>
            <li> can someone recommend me more moisturizers</li>
            <li> However, I took a chance with this product and I am glad I did,</li>
            <li> But I fell in love with this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I need more moisture.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it and am so glad i found it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I LOVE L&#x27;OREAL PRODUCTS</li>
            <li> Love my coconut oil</li>
            <li> i recommend the product you can buy it several times excellent bran</li>
            <li> and you can be confident</li>
            <li> Absolutely love......</li>
            <li> My skin feels better when I use.  </li>
            <li> but it makes my skin look better.</li>
            <li> I have been using L&#x27;Oreal Collagen for a couple of years and love it.  </li>
            <li> It hydrates my skin in the best way possible.  </li>
            <li> nothing more to say now</li>
            <li> and it make your face feel fresh and good</li>
            <li> I love everything about this moisture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using so many moisturizes, but nothing helped like this one.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> Been using this for many years now</li>
            <li> This is my favorite line filling lotion.</li>
            <li> my gf&#x27;s favorite cream.  </li>
            <li> love getting it without the worry of running out</li>
            <li> It was lovely.  </li>
            <li> love it...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is around $10 in most places-Target, Walamrt and Walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I do love how it leaves my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s an OK product for over night use,on face and neck.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it around my eyes and the area looked better.  </li>
            <li> I was so pleased to see it online.  </li>
            <li> I am hoping for more.</li>
            <li> The product is okay, but I am trying another one right now that is thinner in texture and provides good coverage.</li>
            <li> this right here is good</li>
            <li> lotion itself is very rich and leaves my skin feeling well moisturized.  </li>
            <li> This is a great face cream and for those of us with more dry skin, it&#x27;s good even under makeup.</li>
            <li> but my skin looks pretty good for my age</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful moisturizer for my dry, drier, driest face!</li>
            <li> Love how smooth it goes on and doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel.  </li>
            <li> For a heavier cream, which I need at my age, for night time or for bonus time with extra hydration and smoothness during days at home, I love L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Golden Balm.</li>
            <li> Honesty I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but I wanted to try a good night cream.</li>
            <li> However, it is a face cream reasonably priced and rather good.</li>
            <li> Really does a good job</li>
            <li> It fills those smile and frown lines nicely.</li>
            <li> I have used L&#x27;OREAL products for many years and was not disappointed in this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products from Loreal and still like this the best.  </li>
            <li> L’oreal in all other regards for your face is awesome.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer and the only thing that might work better is a time machine.</li>
            <li> The product had a nice soft feel &amp; creamy consistency &amp; felt so nice going on I</li>
            <li> If you’re familiar with good eye creams, you really just put a dab of it on the tip of your ring fingers, and lightly dab it in.</li>
            <li> When I put on my foundation (L&#x27;Oreal, of course) it goes on so easily and the texture of my face is velvety smooth.  </li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t reduce fine lines</li>
            <li> and I bought this for my fine forehead wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, and it always does a fine job of smoothing out wrinkles and nourishing my skin.</li>
            <li> put it over my argan oil that i lightly apply every night on my face , neck and bust area.</li>
            <li> B001V9LUZS Dr. Hauschka Day Cream, Rose, 1.0-Ounce Box]], which costs about four times as much.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all smooth.  </li>
            <li> This product was absolutely amazing and really did the job.</li>
            <li> Not that it was ever cheap.  </li>
            <li> I liked this product because it really moisturizes your skin and rejuvenates.</li>
            <li> Light weight.</li>
            <li> filled in some of the wrinkles that I&#x27;m in the process of getting rid of.</li>
            <li> and I must say that for a moisturizer it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Such a great product for the money...</li>
            <li> Still, since I use it primarily at night it’s not an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really make my skin feel really nice</li>
            <li> So creamy and smooth.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s okay to to suspend the facts and have fun with ads.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this daily and it is great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It makes my face and neck feel so smooth after I put it on.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping it would help primarily with wrinkles /puffiness /dark circles around the eyes .</li>
            <li> it does really work!!!</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend !!!!</li>
            <li> and I very rarely break out anywhere.</li>
            <li> The packaging on this was very pretty, the product smelled nice (not too strong) and it was very creamy.</li>
            <li> Well worth a try for the price!</li>
            <li> After about a week I noticed my skin seemed to have more volume, appeared noticeably more youthful, the constant dryness was gone and my jawline was much more defined.</li>
            <li> really liked the pump version better as it seemed much smoother in texture, and glided on and seemed to absorb into the skin much easier.  </li>
            <li> Love this one from the first time using it.</li>
            <li> Rich but over perfumed.</li>
            <li> Leave my skin fresh and moisture!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something rich for my skin</li>
            <li> I feel it&#x27;s a very good moisturizer which has softened my skin, but I haven&#x27;t seen too much of an improvement in my facial tone yet.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin, rich feel.  </li>
            <li> I’m really happy about this product, and would recommend it to anyone who has dry skin.</li>
            <li> i did reorder this its a Wonderful cream it leave your skin feeling soft and looking younger too</li>
            <li> remember when I was 25 and was told I should start using hydration creams on my face and to clean my face before going to bed and did not want to do anything preventative.</li>
            <li> My beautiful young Russian girlfriend likes it; that does not mean it is good; she likes to spend my money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll say this L&#x27;oreal product does a great job moisturizing my very dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry and it works great for me, someone with oily or acne prone skin may not want to use this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s true that you should wait before applying liquid or even mineral foundation, maybe 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> It smells good and doesn&#x27;t make my face feel all greasy the next day in the morning.</li>
            <li> , wrinkles that I&#x27;m working on diminishing, and was looking for a good overall moisturizer cream.</li>
            <li> It obviously wont get rid of your wrinkles like NuNutrients, but it’s good for if you need some protection from the sun.</li>
            <li> but overall its a good product</li>
            <li> Although the aroma is not bad, it&#x27;s too overpowering to wear</li>
            <li> I use it only at night because it&#x27;s a bit oily looking, but that&#x27;s a good thing at night because my skin feels super moisterized.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal comes in a nice glass container that is short and squat and easy to travel</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best!</li>
            <li> this is a good one, moist not too much fragrance, you feel like you have a soft skin.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;ve found that might work slightly better (though all I can say for sure is that it works as well) is [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> it would still be super greasy lotion, and b.)</li>
            <li> It absorbs quick and you face does not feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Lo real always produces the best  and richest creams which never feel greasy or heavy .</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product and would definitely continue to order in the future!</li>
            <li> Once I started to use it, I quickly noticed that it isn&#x27;t moisturizing at all</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> first time I used the collagen filler my face felt silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I love these products , and are glad to have  bought them, will continue buying them if offers come up, thanks</li>
            <li> My makeup hasn&#x27;t looked that good in a long time - come to think of it</li>
            <li> No unpleasant odor.  </li>
            <li> This is not a heavy cream, and I believe it does my skin a lot better than L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s day cream that is also in a blue jar because of the better absorption, which means more hydration.</li>
            <li> My new favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin smooth and feels so good even cools down the skin.</li>
            <li> I use all of them and they are all superb for my dry fragile skin.</li>
            <li> I first tried this when I saw how my cousin &#x27;s skin was looking vibrant and more youthful and plumper around her eyes.  </li>
            <li> Been using this product for long while and like it, not greasy and very refreshing as a night cream</li>
            <li> It does feel a bit greasy to me, though, and the contents seem to have separated somewhat, more so now as I near the bottom of the jar.</li>
            <li> awesome..keeps me fresh all day.</li>
            <li> The cream is quickly absorbed into your skin without having a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> I always get compliments on how lovely my 42 year old skin</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and many products cause my skin to break out, some even after I have used them for years.</li>
            <li> I use this for night moisturizing and so far love it - do feel like 3 days use</li>
            <li> I’ve also noticed that my skin looks more clear and fresh</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 55 years old, so again, it&#x27;s not wrinkle magic...</li>
            <li> Give it a try; the price is right.</li>
            <li> The foundation just glides right on without my face feeling greasy and over-moisturized from the cream.  </li>
            <li> it has just the right of moisture for day and night use.  </li>
            <li> Price was just right</li>
            <li> My skin sucked it right in.</li>
            <li> Like how moisturized my skin feels right after I use it.</li>
            <li> As I apply right before bed, I assume this is eventually rubbed off onto my pillowcase.  </li>
            <li> Also, the price is right.</li>
            <li> It was pretty greasy right away, but over the course of a couple of weeks, a puddle of oil has literally developed on top of the lotion.</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin and break out with acne easily</li>
            <li> I have tried many expensive products, but have never had the great results that I do with this.</li>
            <li> The receiver is in love with this and says she&#x27;s really feels the benefits, which her skin clearly shows.</li>
            <li> It goes on really smoothly, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and I wake up with very soft; moisturized skin.  </li>
            <li> Softened the appearance of fine lines around my mouth, better than some other creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I combine this with other products for a youthful appearance and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It does not take very much to work properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just received the product, but very much like the consistency and ingredients.</li>
            <li> A little sticky but emollient and good for the price.</li>
            <li> good for my dry skin, makes it feel very soft.</li>
            <li> Works better than many more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I could feel the difference the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> and this is my first time using any L&#x27;Oreal product.</li>
            <li> Saw a difference the first night.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for in a night</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, been using it for several years.</li>
            <li> Really makes your face rehydrated and fresh.</li>
            <li> First the Loreal Paris serum</li>
            <li> It makes your face feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed!</li>
            <li> I actually love it before I got to sleep for the exact same reasons why I don’t like it around my eyes: the thickness of the cream stays and seeps in while you’re sleeping making you wake up feeling more refreshed and younger.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> so I have used many different moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> I think this is going to be a permanent switch...and absolute keeper!</li>
            <li> I love this product and i have order it several times but his time it about 3 months</li>
            <li> :&amp;#62;)  I use morning Collagen for morning and use Night for night time.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t exactly make me look 35</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When sued and taken to court 12 years ago about these things, the judge said it was all in fun and no one really believes these ads anyhow</li>
            <li> Once more no one stands up for the working class and everything goes to government and big business.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, and it makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> It moisturized so good that eventually it appeared as though the lines and few wrinkles that I had were beginning to fade away.</li>
            <li> I switched to this brand of facial moisture cream and it&#x27;s been great for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Kind of thick and does not spread as easily as pump products.</li>
            <li> Feels good when first applied but not very long lasting.</li>
            <li> not easy finding a good face cream.  </li>
            <li> The smell is soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> product does very little really but is a pretty good moisturizer</li>
            <li> I still have half the container and honestly might just trash it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t honestly say that I see any difference in the number of previous wrinkles</li>
            <li> Fair, the usual, really doesn&#x27;t do what it advertises.</li>
            <li> Has really made a positive improvement to my skin</li>
            <li> plus I love the blue jar), and I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a really nice day and/or night cream that helps make your skin look velvety smooth, moisturized, and a few years younger.  </li>
            <li> I just LOVE this cream, and will never go back to my old creams!</li>
            <li> Seems fine enough but haven&#x27;t been using it all up</li>
            <li> It stings a little, leaves my face kind of greasy.</li>
            <li> Maybe be a little heavy for summer but for the winter it is perfect!</li>
            <li> I have very easy-to-manage skin.</li>
            <li> I really did not notice ANY improvement in skin elasticity or fine-line reduction either.</li>
            <li> If it seems you&#x27;ve put on too much, dab the excess with a paper towel</li>
            <li> I am saving so much money - this cream does it all.</li>
            <li> Really keeps away the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I do not see any drastic changes really.</li>
            <li> my face really glowed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really tell a difference</li>
            <li> But it does work very well</li>
            <li> Breaking me out but very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream!</li>
            <li> I use this every day and it really helps my sagging neck and face.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast but the packaging dented the box the jar came in.</li>
            <li> My face feels so much softer and it maintains the moisture throughout the day.</li>
            <li> You do not need much of it so use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> I tend to really like a lot of Loreal products</li>
            <li> Really moisture cream.</li>
            <li> so very silky on my face.</li>
            <li> I also wear it under makeup, and it works very well.</li>
            <li> but doesn&#x27;t really work...</li>
            <li> I really like L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s collagen products</li>
            <li> Works really well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> why does Loreal have to add so much fragrance to their products.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t really expect that.  </li>
            <li> It took about a month to really see the change.</li>
            <li> Recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> It gets very streaky.</li>
            <li> This product is especially good for me when I use it in the winter cold months.</li>
            <li> Very luxurious feeling</li>
            <li> However, there seemed to be only one container available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> have used this collagen cream before and was thrilled when I found it on amazon at such a terrific price.</li>
            <li> Nice smell on the heavy side for moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I use it daily until my skin finally seems to be tending to oily on its own, then stop and use a lighter product for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Good product, skin firmer and fuller after 1 week of use, and I am a man in late 20s.</li>
            <li> If you mix it with a little Borage Oil right out of the capsule it is even better.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way though, A great value too.</li>
            <li> my face felt softer and more supple without feeling greasy, like other products I have used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a long time, I have mature sensitive skin, and like this as it&#x27;s nice and creamy, without feeling greasy doesn&#x27;t contain scent, so doesn&#x27;t make my skin hurt.</li>
            <li> I have pretty tough skin that can take a good beating without ever breaking out.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a good thick moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have tried many facial products high end, low end, and natural - this one is a true winner.</li>
            <li> love this stuff - wonderful for day or night but will definitely help with dry skin but might be heavy for other skin types</li>
            <li> I have lived too long before  sun protection creams were available.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> This is one product I couldn&#x27;t live without!</li>
            <li> It does not feel the greatest around my eyes, partially because of it very thick.</li>
            <li> The texture is nice and thick, compared to many other runny cremes.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that was light, non-greasy, and would help to replenish my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Overall my skin looks younger and just better, but the craziest thing is...</li>
            <li> My pores appeared smaller, my makeup went on sooo smooth and my face had a natural matted look -  </li>
            <li> This is fantastic, my skin is so soft, pores smaller lines are disappearing.</li>
            <li> most likely, a very low amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It seemed that I had to apply quite a bit for facial coverage, and thus the product was used fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> All I want to say is,  I think this particular product is one, I will recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> Even after using Oil of Olay for years, as I got older I started getting wrinkles on my forehead, frown dent in between my eyes, wrinkles developing around my eyes and</li>
            <li> I encourage to use it, but if you are older than that expecting this cream to take your wrinkles away forget about that.</li>
            <li> No less wrinkles, or any cleaning up of the face is evident what-so-ever.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent product for the price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s available on Amazon prime, and even cheaper if you subscribe to receive it regularly - which, after trying it out first, I&#x27;m definitely going to do.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not heavy like some others I have tried, has helped moisturize my skin overnight without being greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Lightly scented, similar (bit less potent) to Olay original.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream</li>
            <li> Not sure how much it will help overall as it is a collagen moisture filler, but as I have dry skin it definitely moisturizes it, the price at amazon was great, got free shipping also.</li>
            <li> this made my skin definitely better, use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Normally, I use Dermaware</li>
            <li> If you have normal skin</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer and use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> deep laugh lines on the sides of my mouth.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this long enough to say it has made a difference in the appearance my skin, I do love the way it feels every night before going to bed, My skin feels firmer in the morning.</li>
            <li> Easily applied and does not feel sticky or gooey afterward, but you should let it die down some if you need to cover a blemish with some concealer or it will not adhere.</li>
            <li> prevent new ones.  </li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t noticed any new ones.  </li>
            <li> My new part of regime.</li>
            <li> Especially strong in cold weather.  </li>
            <li> I was actually surprised at how nice and thick the cream was.</li>
            <li> And the fine lines developing down my cheeks are gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin after 6 mos.</li>
            <li> I have t zone breakouts and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft and moisturized in the morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells, and I didn&#x27;t find that this had one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Completely gone!</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time last night, and this morning, it felt like I was wearing someone else&#x27;s face!!!</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of the product and first order online.  </li>
            <li> Also, a paraben is not one of the first ingredients listed but one of the last.</li>
            <li> Also at first it seems to work, hydrating the skin and making it supple for several hours.</li>
            <li> Too heavy, and an overwhelmingly strong fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it very long and for right now the juries still out as to whether I would recommend it or not.</li>
            <li> within just a few days you&amp;#34;ll notice a reduction of fine lines.</li>
            <li> This cream is a fabulous day cream because it fills little creases.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used very expensive creams in the past, and this is just as good, and in some cases, better!</li>
            <li> I am 56 years old and getting wrinkles around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> I really like the product I&#x27;m 47 and starting to show lines here</li>
            <li> When I wake in the morning the skin around my eyes is soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Trashed my old moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it for the neck, and stick with my old stand-by, Neutrogena Ageless Essentials Continuous Hydration, for the sensitive face.</li>
            <li> The price was considerably lower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now in my early thirties and struggle with changing aging skin in addition to chronic dryness.</li>
            <li> This product is very comparable at a fourth the cost.</li>
            <li> It makes my face soft  and softens any lines.</li>
            <li> I am 23 years old</li>
            <li> Keeps your skin so soft and supple.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early to tell if it&#x27;s helping in taking any wrinkles away, but by it just filling it in, helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling extremely soft.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30s with somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am 72 years old and my face feels so soft and the wrinkles are there but improved.  </li>
            <li> Recommend this cream to everyone, young and old.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Keeps me looking young.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a substore that offers this cream through amazon....</li>
            <li> So far, no breakouts.</li>
            <li> It is one of the few things that make my hands smooth.</li>
            <li> actually I have not found any cream that really works...other than retna  A....</li>
            <li> I did really see a big difference after using it for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I am almost ready to buy my second bottle</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that produces some redness on my cheeks/temples and flaking by my sideburns, and the L’Oreal takes care of both of those problems well.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t seem to have any reactions to it as I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Smoothed out skin and has made my face look smoother and soft</li>
            <li> and I started suffering from dry skin, my facial skin is always shedding specially my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, particularly if you have very dry skin as I do.</li>
            <li> Overall I’d highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> While it’s not overwhelming at all, I would have preferred it be fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> This cream really moisturizes/reduces wrinkles of my normal to dry facial skin...</li>
            <li> has a very delicate fragrance goes on smoothly and really absorbs into skin well.</li>
            <li> and this is the only thing I have found to keep my face hydrated and soft!</li>
            <li> I am a huge fanatic when it comes to moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Of course the fact that my face is moisturized has helped my skin appear to be smoother in general.</li>
            <li> I recommend it particularly in the winter when skin tends to be dry.</li>
            <li> It helps relax the dry lines and wrinkles that are part of getting older.</li>
            <li> You can barely see evidence of any of the wrinkles around my eyes and forehead.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd bottle I have used so far.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these and ended up discontinuing use after a few days and switching to a new brand that I like much</li>
            <li> This product helps reduce the dry skin and aging that sun can cause if you are outside too much.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I started getting little fine wrinkles, not very noticeable on my forehead and smiling expression lines.</li>
            <li> the other hand, my skin is really noticeably firmer after 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30&#x27;s, exercise (and sweat) regularly and still I never get breakouts, not every during hormonal times, yet every time I used this product I broke out in 2-3 big blemishes.</li>
            <li> I am African American, 38 years old</li>
            <li> My wife feels that if you start using this at an early age it help reduce wrinkles and ageing over a long period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I noticed I have a small laugh line I suppose (</li>
            <li> broke my face out for some reason, maybe i used it too much, going to cut down to once a week.</li>
            <li> I am 53 with sensitive skin - dry&#x27;ish in the winter and combo when it&#x27;s humid.  </li>
            <li> For mature senior skin needing long LASTING all day moisture (no oil) - at this price its a no brainer!</li>
            <li> I have had a few more zits than usual around my chin, but it&#x27;s too soon to say if that&#x27;s the cream, stress, or just a coincidence.</li>
            <li> I normally use my plain old cetaphil daily moisturizer, and my skin is never really dry.</li>
            <li> My skin felt soft and well moisturized all day - much longer than with my previous moisturizer, which left my skin dry again by afternoon.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 49 years old and have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is a very thick cream, and fairly heavily perfumed - kind of floral/citrus combo.</li>
            <li> On the other side it really help my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate and this stuff keeps my eye area from getting too dry.</li>
            <li> I tried Revitalift and due to my sensitive skin, it puffed up my skin and made it red.</li>
            <li> Its not bad but not pleasant either.</li>
            <li> The deep laugh lines are not gone but are a little less deep.</li>
            <li> The L&#x27;Oreal Paris Collagen Moisture Filler made my skin feel softer than usual and also left it moisturized throughout the whole day.</li>
            <li> Have not used daily, so I cannot say it is working, but it does hydrate the skin for a long period of time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but maybe I haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet.</li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> Not bad but not great.  </li>
            <li> With dry winter weather I always feel like I can not get enough moisture on my face.</li>
            <li> She loves it and it is especially needed in the winter times in Indiana where the air is so dry.</li>
            <li> I have not been using it long enough to evaluate its long term effects.</li>
            <li> First - I&#x27;m a 60 y.o. Black female, with a slightly sagging jawline, very dry skin, enlarged pores on nose and cheeks, and loss of volume in my cheeks</li>
            <li> I think we have to be realistic there is no magic cream that will erase them away.</li>
            <li> As a 50-year-old horse trainer I spend a lot of time outside and suffer from very dry skin.</li>
            <li> It came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and use this year round for my face including the eye area.  </li>
            <li> I bought for my daughter, she has used a few times, but says:&amp;#34; so far ,so good&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Can keep for long time</li>
            <li> Those are quite harsh chemical compounds with a drying effect as far as my chemistry knowledge goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can’t say it has taken away my wrinkles, but it has made my skin feel smoother, less dry, and a lot younger than to how my skin felt prior to using it.</li>
            <li> Just throw this in with all the other trash this government lets companies get away with selling while lying to the public.</li>
            <li> and/or anyone looking to combat dry winter weather.  </li>
            <li> dry&#x27;ish areas on the front part of my neck show a noticeable improvement after using this cream for a week.  </li>
            <li> So, I took accutane in my twenties that caused my face to be chronically dry.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to all who have DRY skin.</li>
            <li> I am just trying to find something that won&#x27;t cost me all my retirement money but will keep my dry skin moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Using this product under a sunscreen or under makeup keeps my face from feeling dry throughout the day.</li>
            <li> makes a difference if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> , I use it before bed and it leaves my face with dry patches.</li>
            <li> I use this when the weather is dry and is soothing.</li>
            <li> and I get really dry skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cream that wont make it dry or oily</li>
            <li> I like it because it is heavier for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Nevertheless what I noticed on mine was that it would dry out after a while.</li>
            <li> I only started it these last few nights</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different types of moisturizer, but always come back to using this one, and have just began buying it on subscribe and save..</li>
            <li> I have a line on my neck from looking down constantly and this is erasing it!</li>
            <li> I use the more expensive other creams no to go waste on my feet and hands.</li>
            <li> I even had a different cream just for my under my eyes  previous to buying this cream.  </li>
            <li> I had no problem putting on my make-up over it, although, I wear much less since my daily regime has done wonders for the texture, moisture, wrinkle reduction</li>
            <li> Although the jar is small, about 3 dabs is all I need a night, so it will last quite awhile (my guess is over 1 month, possibly 2).</li>
            <li> My skin feels softer and tends to break out less also being a swimmer this provides much needed moisture from my chlorine dried skin though be careful not to use to much as a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, no breakouts</li>
            <li> the only drawback is that it is a little bit greasy but nothing that will bother</li>
            <li> I like it but only put a little on.</li>
            <li> so I only wear it at night because using it twice a day seemed to make my skin break out a little.</li>
            <li> Hey, people are still buying penis enlargement pills and breast enlargement CREAM, as well as weight loss salt or tablets, pills that attract the opposite sex and over the counter medicines to cure every known disease, and all of them do NOTHING for gods sake except robbing the public of our hard earned money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid there are important ingredients in the oily part.</li>
            <li> I only use it in the evening or before bed because it is heavy.</li>
            <li> fragrance is not very &#x27;aromatic, flowery.&#x27;</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need a lot; a little goes a long ways.  </li>
            <li> Seems a little dab goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and my skin has turned extremely dry and tight feeling.</li>
            <li> If you are going into the sun i would still apply some other product.</li>
            <li> I like to put it on every other day.</li>
            <li> I HAVE THREE OTHER FACE TREATMENTS.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t order this again but go back to my usual purchase.</li>
            <li> I use it both as a night and day cream, under all serums, wrinkle creams and other moisturizers that I use every day.  </li>
            <li> Like all these products this leaves me thinking these are just other names for moisturizers.</li>
            <li> It does not leave an oily feeling like other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> I usually only purchase fragrance-free products because the scented stuff usually irritates my skin either causing redness or breakouts.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say that for any other creams I have tried and that includes the $100 ones.  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers have claimed.</li>
            <li> Minus the overpowering smell, I like the product!</li>
            <li> They have not changed those wrinkles at all, but none of the other fancy creams I have bought either.</li>
            <li> so my face doesn&#x27;t feel tight or dry!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not of poor quality, just not above any other similarly priced moisturizers.</li>
            <li> That makes it harder to use and IMO makes it less desirable since product will migrate along skin into eyes.</li>
            <li> would recommend this face cream for anyone that has been let down by other face cream products.</li>
            <li> This has made a difference in the tight feeling and dryness in only a few days!  </li>
            <li> but it is just an average moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This winter has been especially harsh for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It is very heavy and moisturizing for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin feels and looks moister and the wrinkles around the eyes have become less visable.  </li>
            <li> Of course I do still have my wrinkles just so less visible.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need of it because it&#x27;s thick and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and there so this has help a little.   </li>
            <li> Just a little side note to add I also use loreal youth code eye cream and</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my face greasy, a little went along way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a little pricey for what you get.</li>
            <li> thing I do not like about this is that it can be a little greasy and sticky, so I apply a lot at night</li>
            <li> not original product.</li>
            <li> It is heavy so use caution.</li>
            <li> Few wrinkles</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a few years.</li>
            <li> and it only makes it worse.  </li>
            <li> It also has a shine to it that make it heavy and makes it a bit of a hassle waiting for it to soak in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it, not a directed but as often as I can remember, for a few weeks</li>
            <li> have used this for a few weeks now,</li>
            <li> My wrinkles are not easily noticeable since I&#x27;ve been using this.</li>
            <li> It’s a very slight floral scent.  </li>
            <li> I put it on before bed and It felt thick on my face I could still feel and smell it while laying down .</li>
            <li> This product made my skin itch and bump a little!</li>
            <li> I was a little off!  </li>
            <li> To bad it comes in such small jars, need to buy several at a time.</li>
            <li> I am elderly now so very little bit helps.</li>
            <li> - makes me feel a little claustrophobic and and it doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb very well.  </li>
            <li> I do believe it helps minimize small wrinkles and my skin looks healthier.</li>
            <li> but I need to use a small amount in the morning</li>
            <li> I get caught up paying tons of money for over priced creams that come in small containers that I go through within a month.</li>
            <li> very heavy and caused break-outs</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t unpleasant at all, but if you have a sensitive nose you might want to pass on this product.  </li>
            <li> (Not sure where the negative review about buying it from Target comes from -</li>
            <li> so It is hard for me to find a moisturizer that I like.</li>
            <li> Hard to explain, but it was like a little crater of broken blood vessels.</li>
            <li> the cream is thick does not melt as it says on the box.</li>
            <li> Like I said, its thick</li>
            <li> It is a bit thick, but to me I like thick.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so thick and gooey.</li>
            <li> spend billions on vitamins and things that cure NOTHING at all, but we&#x27;re SO DESPERATE FOR HELP because our medical community and insurance companies robs us blind also and fixes NOTHING EITHER.!Name one disease that medicine cures other than polio</li>
            <li> , I am rate 3 stars due to thickness and the weird smell.</li>
            <li> You might find a less expensive collagen cream at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of products even getting desperate and using Vaseline on my face to keep it from feeling dry!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the cream itself is too heavy for use on my face</li>
            <li> Not good for oily skin</li>
            <li> I used it for about half of a week and developed a horrible stye in both of my eyes and got acne all over my face.  </li>
            <li> I live in Texas and summers are brutal.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have been disappointed in.</li>
            <li> The consistency is thick but is not greasy!</li>
            <li> This is a very thick moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This cream is very thick and creamy.  </li>
            <li> Very thick and has a shine to it.</li>
            <li> I have been using it every night for approximately two years.  </li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> but lately I find that they have become too expensive.</li>
            <li> To say I am disappointed in how long it took to receive this cream is an understatement.  </li>
            <li> After a couple days, it seemed like my wrinkles were getting worse.  </li>
            <li> not good!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t bring myself to spend $50 on an expensive cream, and I&#x27;ve tried tons of drug store creams.</li>
            <li> but it is expensive.</li>
            <li> I received the wrong product</li>
            <li> Have a difficult time finding</li>
            <li> but unfortunately this just wasnt one that worked for me.</li>
            <li> Also, too expensive.</li>
            <li> It was expensive but aren&#x27;t all face creams?</li>
            <li> jumped up the price from $9.x to $17+ which was wrong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit greasy,and makes it difficult to apply makeup over it.</li>
            <li> the one hand, it&#x27;s CRAZY greasy.</li>
            <li> you can not go wrong with Loreal!</li>
            <li> It seems comparable, however about 1/2 hour after application (a very thin coat!)</li>
            <li> I was disappointed</li>
            <li> was so disappointed it didnt work for me.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t disappointed at all with this</li>
            <li> This cream seems awful watery.</li>
            <li> it would look horrible.</li>

            <li> Good product, comfortable after apply.</li>
            <li> this stuff feels wonderful, so light and silky and the fragrance is not too terribly strong.  I am really happy that I gave this a try.</li>
            <li> way too &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; broke out in hives from it</li>
            <li> My wife is neutral about it</li>
            <li> Honesty I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but I wanted to try a good night cream. I am beside myself with the results! Overall my skin looks younger and just better, but the craziest thing is... I&#x27;ve had this spot on my face for years. Hard to explain, but it was like a little crater of broken blood vessels. I never got it checked out and now I can&#x27;t ... Because it&#x27;s gone! Completely gone! After 2 weeks I noticed it looking like it was getting smaller and fading. I still can&#x27;t believe after all these years a $9 skin cream got rid of it. Wish I&#x27;d found this cream sooner!!!</li>
            <li> I love it and will probably buy this again. A little goes a long way though, A great value too.</li>
            <li> Love it, love the smell and the effect</li>
            <li> wonderful moisturizer</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer. Works better than many more expensive brands. It feels smooth and luxurious and does a great job hydrating my skin. I&#x27;m 29 and have combo acne prone skin. This product doesn&#x27;t aggravate my skin.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a moisturizer for winter.  I am 56 years old and getting wrinkles around the eyes.  I have used this product for a week and have found great results. My skin feels and looks moister and the wrinkles around the eyes have become less visable.  Well worth a try for the price!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  I have been using it every night for approximately two years.  I use it only where needed on my face and I use&lt;br /&gt;it sparingly.  IT DOES WORK!  ANNA</li>
            <li> this is a good one, moist not too much fragrance, you feel like you have a soft skin. If you are going into the sun i would still apply some other product. I like to put it on every other day. Sometime i will put it on as i go out at night and will not wash my face before i go to bed. I do not do use make up at all. I really like the product I&#x27;m 47 and starting to show lines here and there so this has help a little.   katia</li>
            <li> I have only been using a week, and can tell a difference.  I am 34 and have some fine lines; this seems to plump them up!  The smell is soft and clean.  I have already recommended to my mom, and she likes it too!  Give it a try; the price is right.</li>
            <li> Very good, my friends are all very like it!</li>
            <li> I have very easy-to-manage skin. I am in my early 30&#x27;s, exercise (and sweat) regularly and still I never get breakouts, not every during hormonal times, yet every time I used this product I broke out in 2-3 big blemishes. I really did not notice ANY improvement in skin elasticity or fine-line reduction either. I switched to an Olay product and am having much better results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 6 months now and CAN NOT BELIEVE THE RESULTS! I&#x27;m 28 and already look younger then I am but I recently moved with my fiance to a different state and knew no one and I got asked several times if I was 25, 21, 22 and even 17!!! I already myself noticed a difference in my skin and how my face felt! I also have very sensitive skin and break out with acne easily and I have no problems with this face cream. Just a little side note to add I also use loreal youth code eye cream and the results too are amazing!</li>
            <li> I love this moisture cream. I use it morning and night. My skin is softer and smoother since using this. I have already ordered a couple of additional bottles, one for me and one for my sister. With dry winter weather I always feel like I can not get enough moisture on my face. I use this around my eyes, on my face and neck. When I wake in the morning the skin around my eyes is soft and supple. I have tried many expensive products, but have never had the great results that I do with this.</li>
            <li> This product goes in well and moisturizes great. I noticed a difference in my skin immediately. I was not expecting to be so pleased with this product. Trashed my old moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Ok as night moisturizer I don&#x27;t like the smell and the cream is thick does not melt as it says on the box. I put it on before bed and It felt thick on my face I could still feel and smell it while laying down . I only started it these last few nights so we will see how it goes, I am rate 3 stars due to thickness and the weird smell.</li>
            <li> AT THIS AGE, DONT THINK IT HELPS BUT IT SURE FEELS NICE</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT NIGHT/DAY CREAM. MY SKIN FEELS AND LOOKS SO MUCH BETTER SINCE I STARTED USING IT. I EVEN WEAR IT UNDER MY MAKEUP.</li>
            <li> This is a very thick moisturizer. Anyone can use it, although I believe it is perfect for 40-somethings (like me) who are developing drier skin and/or anyone looking to combat dry winter weather.  This is moisture that STAYS.  I use morning &amp; night w each application my skin feels nourished &amp; elasticity is improved. This is not an anti wrinkle cream but it definitely plumps up &amp; smooths the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true that you should wait before applying liquid or even mineral foundation, maybe 10 minutes. Like I said, its thick and it LASTS so, to me, it feels like a silky mask of protection against the elements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone only with the exception of those w oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have it delivered to my house monthly thru Subscribe &amp; Save.</li>
            <li> I informed that this package was revived like the photo shows. I need to check if I received my money back. Thank you</li>
            <li> This product made my skin itch and bump a little! I will not be using it again.</li>
            <li> I use this at night and have noticed a tremendous difference in the suppleness of my skin and the price is very good.</li>
            <li> Finally switched from Estee Lauder, for which you can tell they just used cheaper and cheaper ingredients each year while hiking the price each year. I&#x27;ll say this L&#x27;oreal product does a great job moisturizing my very dry skin.</li>
            <li> My beautiful young Russian girlfriend likes it; that does not mean it is good; she likes to spend my money.</li>
            <li> Really love the smell and the texture of this product.&lt;br /&gt;I put it over my argan oil that i lightly apply every night on my face , neck and bust area. The texture is nice and thick, compared to many other runny cremes. Not sure how much it will help overall as it is a collagen moisture filler, but as I have dry skin it definitely moisturizes it, the price at amazon was great, got free shipping also.</li>
            <li> This does what it claims to do.  I don&#x27;t expect at 51 I&#x27;m going to get rid of the lines around my mouth but my skin looks pretty good for my age and hey its all about preservation from here on out.  The smell is pleasant.  It is heavy so use caution.</li>
            <li> This is something I was trying to find. I like the products L&#x27;Oreal make. When I tried this brand I am very satisfied. I use it both day and night. Not too noticeable on my skin. Made for all types of skin types I think, too. I would recommend to my friends if, any were going to use this type of product. Just wish too, that I could purchase in a larger container.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks now.  I could feel the difference the first time I used it.  My skin felt soft and well moisturized all day - much longer than with my previous moisturizer, which left my skin dry again by afternoon.  And the fine lines developing down my cheeks are gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great stuff.  (Not sure where the negative review about buying it from Target comes from - it&#x27;s available on Amazon prime, and even cheaper if you subscribe to receive it regularly - which, after trying it out first, I&#x27;m definitely going to do.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  The longer I use it, the more I like it - and it&#x27;s been over a year now.  The only thing I&#x27;ve found that might work slightly better (though all I can say for sure is that it works as well) is [[ASIN:B001V9LUZS Dr. Hauschka Day Cream, Rose, 1.0-Ounce Box]], which costs about four times as much.  I&#x27;ve started using that during the day and the L&#x27;Oreal product at night.</li>
            <li> This is a very thick cream, and fairly heavily perfumed - kind of floral/citrus combo. It isn&#x27;t unpleasant at all, but if you have a sensitive nose you might want to pass on this product.  Unfortunately the cream itself is too heavy for use on my face - makes me feel a little claustrophobic and and it doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb very well.  However, it is working wonderfully well on my neck!  I am 53 with sensitive skin - dry&#x27;ish in the winter and combo when it&#x27;s humid.  The wrinkled (lined?), dry&#x27;ish areas on the front part of my neck show a noticeable improvement after using this cream for a week.  I will continue to use it for the neck, and stick with my old stand-by, Neutrogena Ageless Essentials Continuous Hydration, for the sensitive face.</li>
            <li> First - I&#x27;m a 60 y.o. Black female, with a slightly sagging jawline, very dry skin, enlarged pores on nose and cheeks, and loss of volume in my cheeks and this is my first time using any L&#x27;Oreal product. OMgoodness! I did not expect this cream to work so well.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the collagen filler my face felt silky smooth. I used it in the a.m. and at night I mixed it with L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift Triple Power. After about a week I noticed my skin seemed to have more volume, appeared noticeably more youthful, the constant dryness was gone and my jawline was much more defined. I didn&#x27;t expect results like that - I was just happy that the dryness was gone and that when I touch my face it felt wonderful.  .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makeup - The Revitalift Triple Power did not go well with my makeup - it flaked, caused my makeup to clump together and roll off. It also made my face to look &#x27;ashy&#x27;. So I start using just the L&#x27;Oreal Collagen Filler under my makeup and the results were amazing. My pores appeared smaller, my makeup went on sooo smooth and my face had a natural matted look -  I spritzed my face to set the makeup &amp; Voilà! My makeup hasn&#x27;t looked that good in a long time - come to think of it neither have I. At 60 y.o. I have tried many facial products high end, low end, and natural - this one is a true winner. Give it a try and see if it works for you :-)</li>
            <li> Have tried it twice now and it work well.</li>
            <li> The receiver is in love with this and says she&#x27;s really feels the benefits, which her skin clearly shows.</li>
            <li> Perfect cream. I will suggest to buy.</li>
            <li> I HAVE THREE OTHER FACE TREATMENTS.  THIS ONE I USE AS A NIGHT CREAM.  AMAZINGLY IT STAYS ON YOUR SKIN.</li>
            <li> I use this every morning so my face doesn&#x27;t feel tight or dry! It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> This is also a wonderful product, as all the L&#x27;Oreal Products are. I love this and even have the GUYS in my house using it.. helps out is the C O L D WINTER WEATHER.........AWESOME.</li>
            <li> This was a trial purchase but my skin responds more favorably to the L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al Age Perfect Hydra-Perfect Golden Balm. I have lived too long before  sun protection creams were available. I won&#x27;t order this again but go back to my usual purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this Collagen by L&#x27;Oreal. I use lots of L&#x27;Oreal products and very happy with them. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I apply this cream in the morning after I cleanse my face and before I retire for the evening.  I saw a difference in the lines around my lips immediately.  I also use it on my neck, around my eyes and on my chest.  I will purchase this product from Amazon again.  The price was considerably lower.</li>
            <li> Love it!! it does really work!!!</li>
            <li> great stuff! work great. will order again</li>
            <li> This cream feels like silk on my face. I absolutely love it!!&lt;br /&gt;I have used this collagen cream before and was thrilled when I found it on amazon at such a terrific price.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for about a year.  Like it a lot.</li>
            <li> This winter has been especially harsh for my sensitive skin.  I switched to this brand of facial moisture cream and it&#x27;s been great for my dry skin.  My skin is softer, not flaky or blotchy.  I&#x27;m very happy with this.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for the same type/brand of creme that used to come in a pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the pump version better as it seemed much smoother in texture, and glided on and seemed to absorb into the skin much easier.  I bought two of these and ended up discontinuing use after a few days and switching to a new brand that I like much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had prior used the pumps for about 2 years and wish that I could find them for the same price I used to buy these.</li>
            <li> this made my skin definitely better, use it everyday. the only drawback is that it is a little bit greasy but nothing that will bother you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this is the only thing I have found to keep my face hydrated and soft! I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I am dissapointed in L&#x27;Oreal. This cream seems awful watery. After i applied my make up, it felt, like a mask pasted on my face. I applied it at night time and l could tell no difference on my face the next morning. So now i am using it as lip moisturizer, which lasts about 2 hours tops.</li>
            <li> Bought this recently to use at night, after I wash my face (with Dove Soap).  It goes on really smoothly, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and I wake up with very soft; moisturized skin.  Hint:  Dot it on especially under the eyes and anywhere that you have wrinkles/dry spots, and massage it into your skin.  If it seems you&#x27;ve put on too much, dab the excess with a paper towel so you don&#x27;t get it on your pillow case.  I also use it on my face after my shower.  Don&#x27;t need a lot; a little goes a long ways.  When I put on my foundation (L&#x27;Oreal, of course) it goes on so easily and the texture of my face is velvety smooth.  The foundation just glides right on without my face feeling greasy and over-moisturized from the cream.  So far, its perfect!  Does what it says and then some.  My skin looks terrific!!!  Very satisfied with my purchase (plus I love the blue jar), and I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a really nice day and/or night cream that helps make your skin look velvety smooth, moisturized, and a few years younger.  I will keep buying this product...top notch cream all the way!!</li>
            <li> I first tried this when I saw how my cousin &#x27;s skin was looking vibrant and more youthful and plumper around her eyes.  I have been buying a more expensive cr&amp;egrave;me also here on amazon.  I can almost buy 4 of these for the one I was buying here at amazon.  This has changed my mind. This cream is doing the same thing to my face as my cousin&#x27;s face. Saw a difference the first night. I even had a different cream just for my under my eyes  previous to buying this cream.  I am saving so much money - this cream does it all. Under eyes, face and neck area.  I use the more expensive other creams no to go waste on my feet and hands. So when it is used up I will no longer get anymore.  This L&#x27;Oreal collagen moisture filler is all I will get from now on. I highly recommend this cream</li>
            <li> I can see the difference when I use this product will continue to use until I find something I like better.</li>
            <li> Terrific product.  Love how smooth it goes on and doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel.  I use it under makeup for face and also the neckline.  Did thorough research and purchasing from Amazon was a good decision.</li>
            <li> My husband swears by this moisturizer! He uses it morning and night. I buy 2-3 at a time. Nice smell on the heavy side for moisturizer. I only use it in the evening or before bed because it is heavy.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin after 6 mos. with another product line I had to try something else. This is fantastic, my skin is so soft, pores smaller lines are disappearing.</li>
            <li> I love this! It did cause me to breakout on my chin but I just don&#x27;t apply it there. It plumps up my skin and makes my eyes and cheek areas glisten. I have t zone breakouts and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great product; I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time and it works great; thanks to Amazon.com, I was able to get a great price for it.</li>
            <li> This cream is a fabulous day cream because it fills little creases.  So when you put on powder foundation it&#x27;s all smooth.  Especially strong in cold weather.  The cream doesn&#x27;t leave the skin greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> This collagen is great it has just the right of moisture for day and night use.  I use it in the morning and evening.  Blends well into your skin</li>
            <li> So, I took accutane in my twenties that caused my face to be chronically dry. I&#x27;m now in my early thirties and struggle with changing aging skin in addition to chronic dryness. I can&#x27;t bring myself to spend $50 on an expensive cream, and I&#x27;ve tried tons of drug store creams. This is by far the best!!! I used it for the first time last night, and this morning, it felt like I was wearing someone else&#x27;s face!!! lol So great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 49 years old and have very dry skin. Normally, I use Dermaware but it is expensive. This product is very comparable at a fourth the cost. I don&#x27;t care for the smell of this. Its not bad but not pleasant either. If not for the smell I would have rated this a five. It hydrates my skin WELL. If you have normal skin this is probably not for you. I would recommend to all who have DRY skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in hopes to see results with the way my skin looks. L&#x27;Oreal Paris is a well known brand name that I feel is trustworthy. I know with aging skin moisturizing my face is important to looking my best and with the use of collagen I felt this would be a good combination to retaining a youthful look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for a couple of days my face felt softer and more supple without feeling greasy, like other products I have used. As I continued to use the cream daily and nightly, I started to see my skin looking fuller where it once was looking sagging and droopy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am amazed at the results I have seen using this product. It absorbs into my skins instead of sitting on the surface of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When used regularly for a period of time L&#x27;Oreal Paris Collagen Moisture Filler Day/Night Cream will provide the results you are looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this face cream for anyone that has been let down by other face cream products. I also am pleased with the price of the cream, which is affordable for those on a budget.</li>
            <li> I use Retina and after awhile, I needs some moisture to plump up the tissue and this cream along with Vitamin C is really great to improve the appearance.</li>
            <li> I have not been using it long enough to evaluate its long term effects. It feels great on my skin and is non greasy.</li>
            <li> I have two very different, contradictory reactions to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the one hand, it&#x27;s CRAZY greasy. I don&#x27;t know how people are saying it&#x27;s not. It was pretty greasy right away, but over the course of a couple of weeks, a puddle of oil has literally developed on top of the lotion. I can swirl it around. If I stir it back in, it separates out again. I could pour it off, but a.) it would still be super greasy lotion, and b.) I&#x27;m afraid there are important ingredients in the oily part. That brings me to the next point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, my skin is really noticeably firmer after 2-3 weeks. My cheeks and jawline have a lot of elasticity and bounce back. This is exactly what I was looking for in a night cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess the million dollar question is whether the oiliness is a problem. I don&#x27;t know. I have had a few more zits than usual around my chin, but it&#x27;s too soon to say if that&#x27;s the cream, stress, or just a coincidence. Time will tell, I suppose.</li>
            <li> This cream is very thick and creamy.  I wake up in the morning with the softest skin.  My skin is very dry and it works great for me, someone with oily or acne prone skin may not want to use this.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream only because of its low price.  Well, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  You don&#x27;t need of it because it&#x27;s thick and a little goes a long way. It is a wonderful moisturizer for my dry, drier, driest face! I use it both as a night and day cream, under all serums, wrinkle creams and other moisturizers that I use every day.  But this cream is the one that keeps my skin well moisturized and supple.  Who knew that this cream would work so well?  I highly recommend it, particularly if you have very dry skin as I do.</li>
            <li> good price, good for my skin!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, been using it for several years. It&#x27;s a good night moisturizer, no rocket science just moisture.</li>
            <li> Was great product my wife she was happy with it and also the offer was great</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin, rich feel.  Does not sting my eyes.  No unpleasant odor.  Use throughout the year except when temperatures go above 90 degrees.  Great under pressed cover-up make up for example Revlon One-Step.</li>
            <li> This cream is one of the better ones I have used. It absorbs quick and you face does not feel greasy.</li>
            <li> This product was absolutely amazing and really did the job. The L&#x27;Oreal Paris Collagen Moisture Filler made my skin feel softer than usual and also left it moisturized throughout the whole day. It moisturized so good that eventually it appeared as though the lines and few wrinkles that I had were beginning to fade away. It will immediately moisturize skin but the longer you use the more rejuvenated your skin becomes. This is a must buy, even for men!</li>
            <li> I have used L&#x27;OREAL products for many years and was not disappointed in this purchase.</li>
            <li> Really keeps away the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I use all of them and they are all superb for my dry fragile skin. Lo real always produces the best  and richest creams which never feel greasy or heavy .</li>
            <li> LOVE!  Thank you!  Day or evening and perfect.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will always buy it if I can find it. It is one of the best moisturizers on the market. Period. I recommend it particularly in the winter when skin tends to be dry. Works especially well after a facial scrub.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for long while and like it, not greasy and very refreshing as a night cream</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and does the trick.  Easily applied and does not feel sticky or gooey afterward, but you should let it die down some if you need to cover a blemish with some concealer or it will not adhere.</li>
            <li> I purchased three different L&#x27;Oreal products to try. I like them all - including this one. I was looking for a product that was light, non-greasy, and would help to replenish my dry skin. It seems to work - but I&#x27;ll need more time to use.</li>
            <li> I do not see any drastic changes really. It is just another moisturizer, with collagen,&lt;br /&gt;but most likely, a very low amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like face products with vitamin C, because I tried one from the Body Shop,&lt;br /&gt;and my face really glowed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 x&#x27;s a week, I take a couple of drops of almond oil,and mix that into my regular Loreal face moisturizer,&lt;br /&gt;using my finger. Really makes your face rehydrated and fresh. You could substitute a good olive oil if you have that on hand.</li>
            <li> It does supply moisture but it is just an average moisturizer. It&#x27;s not of poor quality, just not above any other similarly priced moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Like all these products this leaves me thinking these are just other names for moisturizers. Kind of thick and does not spread as easily as pump products.</li>
            <li> This is a good collagen moisture. It makes my face soft  and softens any lines. Not greasy.</li>
            <li> I bought this from Walmart after I had a slight​ midlife crisis after turning thirty. I never noticed that I had lines in my forehead or around my eyes until then. This product has made my skin a lot softer and I have noticed a decrease in the lines on my forehead but not my eyes. I don&#x27;t like the greasy feeling it leaves though.</li>
            <li> Seems to irritate my skin.  I&#x27;ll stick with my virgin organic&lt;br /&gt;coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Will keep ordering this !</li>
            <li> Im very happy with it</li>
            <li> My skin feels softer and tends to break out less also being a swimmer this provides much needed moisture from my chlorine dried skin though be careful not to use to much as a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the good reviews. After using it for a month , mostly every night I didn&#x27;t notice any difference. It didn&#x27;t work for me!</li>
            <li> I love using creams and this one by far is awesome. It smells good and it feels good. It is a bit thick, but to me I like thick.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of the product and first order online.  Love this one from the first time using it.</li>
            <li> I am using this as a second step in a 3 step ritual.  First the Loreal Paris serum then the collagen cream then the Triple Power Moisturizer.  I am 78 but with very good skin. Few wrinkles but I&#x27;m sagging a bit.  I am just trying to find something that won&#x27;t cost me all my retirement money but will keep my dry skin moisturized.  I&#x27;ve been using Shiseido Benefiance products but not only did they stop making Benefiance it just went out of sight in price even on Amazon. Not that it was ever cheap.  I was delighted to find these Loreal products at a very good price and believe that I&#x27;ve finally found products that will keep my skin moisturized.  Also, a paraben is not one of the first ingredients listed but one of the last. After about 6 week&#x27;s use I am pleased with this product. My skin looks even better.  For day time use I put a moisturizing lotion that contains SPF 15 or 18 on top of it then my make up.  I live in Texas and summers are brutal. My skin looks smoother and more plumped out and I&#x27;m very pleased.   LATER:  Over a year later, I&#x27;m still using this.  I&#x27;ve tried other products from Loreal and still like this the best.  If you mix it with a little Borage Oil right out of the capsule it is even better.</li>
            <li> I received the wrong product but I kept it.  I received Orevitol  I was disappointed but I just kept it but canceled out when they sent me another jar for around 79 dollars.  This is the only product I have been disappointed in.</li>
            <li> This a good crème for night time use because it keeps my skin moisture.</li>
            <li> I am 23 years old and I want to prevent any aging before it is a problem. I am not 17 anymore so I noticed I have a small laugh line I suppose (since I&#x27;m always laughing) so I thought hey I should give this product a try. I used it for about a month every day 2x a day and can honestly say I didn&#x27;t notice any difference. Makes my skin feel a bit oily so I dk if it clogs the pours or not. I still have half the container and honestly might just trash it.</li>
            <li> Great product, this is my 4th time ordering it. It does not leave an oily feeling like other products I have tried. Very happy with the product and would definitely continue to order in the future!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really tell a difference</li>
            <li> I applied this night cream before bed as a moisturizer.  It seemed that I had to apply quite a bit for facial coverage, and thus the product was used fairly quickly.  The product is okay, but I am trying another one right now that is thinner in texture and provides good coverage.</li>
            <li> This is a great night cream.  Use is with Vitamin C serum.  GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;A great nightly moisturizing team.  Great Stuff!</li>
            <li> very heavy and caused break-outs</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer and the only thing that might work better is a time machine.</li>
            <li> This cream really moisturizes/reduces wrinkles of my normal to dry facial skin...I use it not only on face but also on elbows and cuticles.</li>
            <li> too soon to tell if it works or not but I love that it has no smell. Price was just right</li>
            <li> Very thick and has a shine to it. Can&#x27;t wear it alone. But it does work very well just takes time to soak in</li>
            <li> This is the best product on the market! I use this basically as a moisturizer as my primer has SPF in it. Makes my skin nice &amp; smooth, I can tell the difference when I run out.....not good! This is one product I couldn&#x27;t live without!</li>
            <li> Softened the appearance of fine lines around my mouth, better than some other creams I&#x27;ve tried. It does feel a bit greasy to me, though, and the contents seem to have separated somewhat, more so now as I near the bottom of the jar. I&#x27;m still &amp;#34;auditioning&amp;#34; various creams and potions and lotions; I might buy this again.</li>
            <li> awesome..keeps me fresh all day.</li>
            <li> As a 50-year-old horse trainer I spend a lot of time outside and suffer from very dry skin. Using this product under a sunscreen or under makeup keeps my face from feeling dry throughout the day. I have tried a lot of products even getting desperate and using Vaseline on my face to keep it from feeling dry! I won&#x27;t be without this product again!</li>
            <li> good for my dry skin, makes it feel very soft.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a few years. Love it. Have a difficult time finding&lt;br /&gt;It in local stores and that is why I appreciate being able to order it from amazon.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Box is damaged and the jar is not cealed. Not happy. I am reluctant to use it.</li>
            <li> Not good for oily skin and it only makes it worse.  I don&#x27;t like it at all</li>
            <li> I like this item, this item was very good, I am very happy with this item, It came in the promised time.</li>
            <li> Breaking me out but very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I love it , use it all the time. I&#x27;ve been using this cream for over a couple of years.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try to apply make up after using this cream. While it is OK as a night cream, foundation over it gets oily flakes.</li>
            <li> I liked this product because it really moisturizes your skin and rejuvenates. I would recommend this product to all females whether you want look younger or stay younger it&#x27;s perfect for either group.</li>
            <li> My wrinkles are not easily noticeable since I&#x27;ve been using this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as described</li>
            <li> My wife used this cream she is happy, always she buy.</li>
            <li> This is a great face cream and for those of us with more dry skin, it&#x27;s good even under makeup. I use it daily until my skin finally seems to be tending to oily on its own, then stop and use a lighter product for a couple of weeks. I do believe it helps minimize small wrinkles and my skin looks healthier.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Very good feeling on skin.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this and thought it&#x27;d work wonders.  I do love the way it feels and how it goes on, but it DID NOT work for me.  I used it for about half of a week and developed a horrible stye in both of my eyes and got acne all over my face.  I had to get steroids from the doctor to get rid of the stye and my face is still healing from the acne.  Will not be continuing my subscribe and save of this item.</li>
            <li> Wonderful skin cream for &#x27;mature&#x27; skin at an inexpensive cost</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer. Light weight.Nice!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer and use it everyday.  It helps relax the dry lines and wrinkles that are part of getting older.</li>
            <li> It came earlier than expected. It smells good and doesn&#x27;t make my face feel all greasy the next day in the morning. I usually only use it for the night.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t now if it is working.. It stings a little, leaves my face kind of greasy. Also after I purchased it I found out L&#x27;Oreal tests on animals. NO BUENO.</li>
            <li> I have pretty tough skin that can take a good beating without ever breaking out. I have used numerous products on my face but unfortunately this just wasnt one that worked for me. I tried it on 3 different occasions to test if the product was indeed the thing to break my skin out &amp; it was. Everyones skin is different though so I cant say for sure that this to will happen to you also. The product had a nice soft feel &amp; creamy consistency &amp; felt so nice going on I was so disappointed it didnt work for me.</li>
            <li> Great product I love it.</li>
            <li> Keeps your skin so soft and supple.I can use it day or night.Great to wear alone or with sunscreen.Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best! I use it only at night because it&#x27;s a bit oily looking, but that&#x27;s a good thing at night because my skin feels super moisterized. The price is also awesome, especially for the quality of the cream. I&#x27;ve used very expensive creams in the past, and this is just as good, and in some cases, better! I&#x27;ve been using this for about 4 months now, and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my skin. It is very smooth, and although i don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles but the ones that i do, have started to diminish. I just LOVE this cream, and will never go back to my old creams! I highly recommend this cream!</li>
            <li> It is very good product and I use it every night. My skin feels very soft and moisturized in the morning.</li>
            <li> All I want to say is,  I think this particular product is one, I will recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Its not easy finding a good face cream.  But I did.</li>
            <li> Rich but over perfumed. Cannot get in eyes or they will burn! That makes it harder to use and IMO makes it less desirable since product will migrate along skin into eyes. Also made me break out on the chin and I very rarely break out anywhere. Maybe the perfume is the problem. Will now only use on my feet.</li>
            <li> Good product, skin firmer and fuller after 1 week of use, and I am a man in late 20s.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Leave my skin fresh and moisture!</li>
            <li> Ok it&#x27;s L&#x27;Oreal but it&#x27;s so thick and gooey. I like it but only put a little on. Seems fine enough but haven&#x27;t been using it all up yet so I will come back with an answer when the bottle is gone. Nicely packaged and came on time. Seems a little dab goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I like this product but haven&#x27;t seen anysubtle results yet.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this cream all of the time. She loves it and it is especially needed in the winter times in Indiana where the air is so dry. The cream is quickly absorbed into your skin without having a greasy feel. It does not take very much to work properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also spend a lot of time outside watching our grandson play various types of sports. This product helps reduce the dry skin and aging that sun can cause if you are outside too much. It makes your face feel soft and smooth. My wife feels that if you start using this at an early age it help reduce wrinkles and ageing over a long period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very good product and she highly recommends it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an add on from Amazon. I was actually surprised at how nice and thick the cream was. I have very dry skin, no breakouts, wrinkles that I&#x27;m working on diminishing, and was looking for a good overall moisturizer cream. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed at all with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It filled in some of the wrinkles that I&#x27;m in the process of getting rid of. It didn&#x27;t make my face greasy, a little went along way. I had no problem putting on my make-up over it, although, I wear much less since my daily regime has done wonders for the texture, moisture, wrinkle reduction so I&#x27;m able to even go without if I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t find it to be greasy at all. My skin sucked it right in. I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells, and I didn&#x27;t find that this had one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really glad that I found it and have added it to my regime. It&#x27;s too early to tell if it&#x27;s helping in taking any wrinkles away, but by it just filling it in, helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a good thick moisturizer. I also use it on my arms and back of hands. Have noticed that the skin has plumped up some.</li>
            <li> It definitely moisturizes!  I put it on before going to bed.</li>
            <li> It say&#x27;s it is a filler but it doesn&#x27;t fill anything and it is greasy on your skin. Very dissapointed!</li>
            <li> I use this every day and it really helps my sagging neck and face.</li>
            <li> I’m really happy about this product, and would recommend it to anyone who has dry skin. I can’t say it has taken away my wrinkles, but it has made my skin feel smoother, less dry, and a lot younger than to how my skin felt prior to using it. It does not feel the greatest around my eyes, partially because of it very thick. It also has a shine to it that make it heavy and makes it a bit of a hassle waiting for it to soak in. If you’re familiar with good eye creams, you really just put a dab of it on the tip of your ring fingers, and lightly dab it in. This is not an eye cream so don’t use it for that. If you want a good eye cream then go with [[ASIN:B00L3KEIZO NuNutrients]], their cucumber eye cream if you keep it in the fridge feels awesome under and around your eyes. However, if you’re going to be out in the sun a lot, then I’d recommend [[ASIN:B0013OKSAY this inexpensive Aveeno moisturizer]] just beneath your eyes. It obviously wont get rid of your wrinkles like NuNutrients, but it’s good for if you need some protection from the sun. L’oreal in all other regards for your face is awesome. I actually love it before I got to sleep for the exact same reasons why I don’t like it around my eyes: the thickness of the cream stays and seeps in while you’re sleeping making you wake up feeling more refreshed and younger. Overall I’d highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> makes a difference if you have dry skin. nice moisture filler.</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt better!!</li>
            <li> This cream is good, but it feels a litle greasy on my face. I am still using it and hope i get the results i need, arrived in good time and conditions.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft and smooth. I can tell a difference in my skin after 2 weeks of using this product. Would definitely recommended this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Like how moisturized my skin feels right after I use it. Doesn&#x27;t give a oily feel to it which I like. Wish it was in a bigger container.</li>
            <li> love it i did reorder this its a Wonderful cream it leave your skin feeling soft and looking younger too</li>
            <li> I normally use my plain old cetaphil daily moisturizer, and my skin is never really dry. The packaging on this was very pretty, the product smelled nice (not too strong) and it was very creamy. Once I started to use it, I quickly noticed that it isn&#x27;t moisturizing at all, I use it before bed and it leaves my face with dry patches.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of this cream. Have not used daily, so I cannot say it is working, but it does hydrate the skin for a long period of time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is not very &#x27;aromatic, flowery.&#x27; It smells like a regular nivea cream (but a bit stronger.)</li>
            <li> its a good product right now im looking for the perfect moisturizer and this one has been the best yet,  i put it at night time and makes my face feel creamy and nice i have oily skin so i had my doubts, definitely dont wear it at daytime because it will look like you have a greasy face!!! but overall its a good product but i dont know if i will be buying can someone recommend me more moisturizers</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling extremely soft.</li>
            <li> I use this when the weather is dry and is soothing. It makes my face feel great and look great too! Shipping was fast but the packaging dented the box the jar came in. But I would still order again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a month and I must say that for a moisturizer it is fantastic. I am in my early 30s with somewhat sensitive skin. I usually only purchase fragrance-free products because the scented stuff usually irritates my skin either causing redness or breakouts. However, I took a chance with this product and I am glad I did, no problems at all! My face feels so much softer and it maintains the moisture throughout the day. I wear it under my makeup and often before bed. I only gave it 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t seem to &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; as well as the claims would lead you to believe. It hasn&#x27;t reduce fine lines but maybe I haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet. Of course the fact that my face is moisturized has helped my skin appear to be smoother in general. I will be purchasing this product again from Amazon!</li>
            <li> Good moisture cream and so easy to apply.  Makes my skin smooth and feels so good even cools down the skin.</li>
            <li> The product came unsealed and with no box.  Literally just an open jar.  I have never purchased a cream for my face that was not sealed.  Buyer Beware.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have very deep wrinkles on my forehead and have tried everything. It&#x27;s a cosmedic fix but is one of the best line fillers I have found.</li>
            <li> I am a beauty product junkie so I have used many different moisturizers.  But I fell in love with this moisturizer. I used Estee lauder before but lately I find that they have become too expensive. This is an awesome replacement. I have very good skin so I am not looking to lessen wrinkles or even skin tone. I need more moisture. I am African American, 38 years old and I get really dry skin in the winter. I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. I think this is going to be a permanent switch...and absolute keeper!</li>
            <li> Just received the product, but very much like the consistency and ingredients.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I am 72 years old and my face feels so soft and the wrinkles are there but improved.  Recommend this cream to everyone, young and old.  I will continue to use it and am so glad i found it. L&#x27;oreal Collagen Moisture Filler is wonderful.  lucille</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I not only use it on my face but include it on my eyes. You do not need much of it so use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> A good and quality product. It really works.</li>
            <li> I have always liked L Oreal products. This one didn&#x27;t disappoint me. It is all it claims to be. I would recommend this .</li>
            <li> I love these products , and are glad to have  bought them, will continue buying them if offers come up, thanks</li>
            <li> very good - says my wife</li>
            <li> its a nice feeling cream gives good moisture</li>
            <li> This is an excellent cream for anytime.  It is not greasy, absorbs well and makes my skin feel 10 years younger.</li>
            <li> I LOVE L&#x27;OREAL PRODUCTS THEY WORK GREAT, THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT I CONTINUE TO GET THIS PRODUCT OVER THE YEARS. THANK YOU KINDLY. PRICE WAS A GOOD PRICE TOO.</li>
            <li> This smells great and isnt too oily or greasy at all. I am prone to breakouts so It is hard for me to find a moisturizer that I like. No cream is a miracle worker and seems to erase wrinkles &amp; reverse the hands of time but this is a good cream. I tend to really like a lot of Loreal products</li>
            <li> Even after using Oil of Olay for years, as I got older I started getting wrinkles on my forehead, frown dent in between my eyes, wrinkles developing around my eyes and deep laugh lines on the sides of my mouth. I tried Revitalift and due to my sensitive skin, it puffed up my skin and made it red. I tried this product AND IT IS GREAT with impressive results before I even finished the jar. You can barely see evidence of any of the wrinkles around my eyes and forehead. The deep laugh lines are not gone but are a little less deep. It feels great on my skin. I have sensitive skin so I only wear it at night because using it twice a day seemed to make my skin break out a little. I will continue to purchase this product. It has done wonders for my skin. I hope they never change this formula.</li>
            <li> I bought this in CVS, Walgreens, and Walmart... They are all overpriced. Since I use for daily use I always order onlien and save  a lot of money.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and use this year round for my face including the eye area.  My skin loves it!  And it never bothers my eyes.  Can&#x27;t say that for any other creams I have tried and that includes the $100 ones.  You can&#x27;t beat the price on this one!</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have claimed. But the cream feels nice and goes on well. It&#x27;s just a little pricey for what you get. You might find a less expensive collagen cream at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something rich for my skin and I think I have found it!  I&#x27;ve always had oily skin until this last year, turning 50 soon and my skin has turned extremely dry and tight feeling. This is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that has made a difference! Love my coconut oil but it wasn&#x27;t working any longer. This has made a difference in the tight feeling and dryness in only a few days!  Very happy...  :)</li>
            <li> good price good product good presentation i recommend the product you can buy it several times excellent bran and you can be confident</li>
            <li> Really moisture cream. The product itself is good for this price but it&#x27;s too moisture for me,  since I have combination skin.</li>
            <li> Such a great product for the money... Would highly recommend !!!!</li>
            <li> Works well to keep skin moist and supple.</li>
            <li> Great deal! Excellent!</li>
            <li> within just a few days you&amp;#34;ll notice a reduction of fine lines. also great to wear under makeup. non-greasy</li>
            <li> Makes my face too shiny. I think I&#x27;ll give it to my wife.</li>
            <li> Too heavy, and an overwhelmingly strong fragrance.  I had to take it off, so I don&#x27;t know if it works.</li>
            <li> Got it for my Mom as gift, she loved it. Wan&#x27;t more!</li>
            <li> Did not see much different  so I stopped using it after while</li>
            <li> Absolutely love......so very silky on my face. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have a line on my neck from looking down constantly and this is erasing it! I&#x27;ve been using it, not a directed but as often as I can remember, for a few weeks and the difference is definitely noticeable.</li>
            <li> Not heavy like some others I have tried, has helped moisturize my skin overnight without being greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Lightly scented, similar (bit less potent) to Olay original.</li>
            <li> I have always bought L&#x27;Oreal products when it came to &amp;#34;face cream&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;ve never had &amp;#34;problems&amp;#34; with any of their products and I have used almost all.  I find this cream easier to apply and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot.  Day or Night, it works well and smells &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34; also.  I feel it works for me but everyone&#x27;s skin type is different.</li>
            <li> Works well day or night.</li>
            <li> My skin feels better when I use.  Will definitely keep using. I don&#x27;t know if it is diminishing wrinkles but it makes my skin look better.</li>
            <li> Nothing but the best! I&#x27;ve been using L&#x27;Oreal products for years. Keeps me looking young.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly. Feels great under makeup. This is not a heavy cream, and I believe it does my skin a lot better than L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s day cream that is also in a blue jar because of the better absorption, which means more hydration. For a heavier cream, which I need at my age, for night time or for bonus time with extra hydration and smoothness during days at home, I love L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Golden Balm. Now *that* feels good. I also wear it under makeup, and it works very well.</li>
            <li> I have been using L&#x27;Oreal Collagen for a couple of years and love it.  It hydrates my skin in the best way possible.  I always get compliments on how lovely my 42 year old skin looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER--DON&#x27;T DON&#x27;T DON&#x27;T ORDER THIS CREAM FROM BARGAINSTORE11!!! It&#x27;s a substore that offers this cream through amazon....To say I am disappointed in how long it took to receive this cream is an understatement.  I had to contact the seller directly on several occasions.  It took OVER TWO months to get this item from them....</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and many products cause my skin to break out, some even after I have used them for years. So I have had to switch products often. Tried this and like it. I hope I can continue to use it. Not greasy. Does not burn or irritate my skin. So far, no breakouts.</li>
            <li> Since using this, I can see a difference in lines on my face. I will continue using the moisture filler.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris Collagen Moisture Filler Day/Night Cream, 1.7 Fluid Ounce  good service and excellent product. nothing more to say now</li>
            <li> I use this on my face and hands. It is one of the few things that make my hands smooth. I also use this on my face and it goes on very nice and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> a nice cream but doesn&#x27;t really work...actually I have not found any cream that really works...other than retna  A....and I have tried a lot of creams.</li>
            <li> I use this for night moisturizing and so far love it - do feel like 3 days use and I feel and see improvement.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cream that wont make it dry or oily this right here is good i been using it for a week and it make your face feel fresh and good you could see the difference in a week i will buy it again.</li>
            <li> the same for this one ...I love this product and i have order it several times but his time it about 3 months and i still don&#x27;t receive my order. !!</li>
            <li> Also, too expensive. I have used this product nightly for a month and have not noticed any improvement in my skin. I think I&#x27;ll stick with regular coconut oil</li>
            <li> Great product quality and service.</li>
            <li> Made my pores big and my face get pimples.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for my face.  Long lasting.</li>
            <li> Feels good when first applied but not very long lasting. Found I had to reapply a couple of times to feel any effect from it.</li>
            <li> I feel it&#x27;s a very good moisturizer which has softened my skin, but I haven&#x27;t seen too much of an improvement in my facial tone yet. I haven&#x27;t been using it very long and for right now the juries still out as to whether I would recommend it or not.</li>
            <li> I bought for my daughter, she has used a few times, but says:&amp;#34; so far ,so good&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Not bad but not great.  Being used to Neutrogena products I was a little off!  However, it is a face cream reasonably priced and rather good.</li>
            <li> Senior who needs lots of moisture and this age collagen. My go to night moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this moisture.I am 23 and I bought this for my fine forehead wrinkles.I did really see a big difference after using it for 2 weeks. Of course I do still have my wrinkles just so less visible. On the other side it really help my dry skin. I&#x27;ve been using so many moisturizes, but nothing helped like this one. I will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> Minus the overpowering smell, I like the product! I use it overnight and in the morning my skin is nice and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. I live in a very dry climate and this stuff keeps my eye area from getting too dry. I use it at night and it seems to be helping somewhat with the look of my crows feet.</li>
            <li> I really like L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s collagen products but this one is really good. has a very delicate fragrance goes on smoothly and really absorbs into skin well.</li>
            <li> broke my face out for some reason, maybe i used it too much, going to cut down to once a week.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It feels good on my skin and does well under my makeup.  I was hoping that the Collagen would lessen finer wrinkles and (hopefully!) prevent new ones.  I can&#x27;t honestly say that I see any difference in the number of previous wrinkles but I haven&#x27;t noticed any new ones.  I am almost ready to buy my second bottle so I must believe it works.</li>
            <li> I like it because it is heavier for dry skin.  A little sticky but emollient and good for the price.</li>
            <li> the best filler for skin that&#x27;s persistent and pesky.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this night lotion on a whim after my much-loved Neutrogena Ageless Essentials was suddenly dropped from Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save program.  I&#x27;m happy to report that the L&#x27;Oreal is an excellent replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion itself is very rich and leaves my skin feeling well moisturized.  If you put it on liberally, as I do before bed, you’ll have a noticeable sheen.  However, when used during the day, a sparse application does not produce sheen, and still moisturizes well.  I have sensitive skin that produces some redness on my cheeks/temples and flaking by my sideburns, and the L’Oreal takes care of both of those problems well.  I’ve also noticed that my skin looks more clear and fresh overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I wasn’t thrilled about is the fact that the L’Oreal has a fragrance.  It’s a very slight floral scent.  While it’s not overwhelming at all, I would have preferred it be fragrance free.  Still, since I use it primarily at night it’s not an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The L&#x27;Oreal comes in a nice glass container that is short and squat and easy to travel with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, for all its strengths the L’Oreal is a lot cheaper than the Neutrogena too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all… a great value in a great face lotion.</li>
            <li> Works really well.  This is a good product.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a believer that any cream takes away wrinkles.  That being said, I do like this cream.  I don&#x27;t seem to have any reactions to it as I have sensitive skin and I like the way it makes my face feel when I put it on.  I&#x27;m 55 years old, so again, it&#x27;s not wrinkle magic...nothing is, but it&#x27;s a nice cream for the money.</li>
            <li> soothing fragrance and the texture is very smooth and creamy.  it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all so I even apply this cream on and around my eye areas and add an extra layer over my crow feet areas.</li>
            <li> Really does a good job I  noticed the difference. Smoothed out skin and has made my face look smoother and soft</li>
            <li> Great price. Has the consistency of the Nivea in the tin.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and I have actually subscribed to get it on a regular basis. It really make my skin feel really nice</li>
            <li> I happen to be a fan of L&#x27;Oreal and this did not disappoint. The consistency is thick but is not greasy!</li>
            <li> Been using this for many years now and I still am loving it.  I am elderly now so very little bit helps. :&amp;#62;)  I use morning Collagen for morning and use Night for night time.  Works great for me even under my foundation.</li>
            <li> Very good moisture. Can keep for long time</li>
            <li> even moms like me need collagen in order to look presentable.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite line filling lotion. I&#x27;ve been using it for several years now. It is very heavy and moisturizing for my dry skin. It fills those smile and frown lines nicely. It has a nice fragrance too.</li>
            <li> Has really made a positive improvement to my skin</li>
            <li> If I want to wear perfume, I will choose my own...why does Loreal have to add so much fragrance to their products.  Arggghhhh.....It&#x27;s on my face too so that compounds the aroma.  Although the aroma is not bad, it&#x27;s too overpowering to wear and you cannot wear your own perfume because of that.</li>
            <li> my gf&#x27;s favorite cream.  she swears by it and i am able to get it at an amazing price on amazon.</li>
            <li> The cream is affordable, smells nice and has a very pleasant texture. Also at first it seems to work, hydrating the skin and making it supple for several hours. Nevertheless what I noticed on mine was that it would dry out after a while. So the effect doesn&#x27;t last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a look at the ingredients and I could blame all those last 2-3 lines. Those are quite harsh chemical compounds with a drying effect as far as my chemistry knowledge goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was tempted to try this cream because one of my friends had it, but I will not buy it again. I just don&#x27;t like how my skin feels several hours after each use – that is, until I use the cream again. I think it&#x27;s made to seduce you for a moment and then make you use it constantly so that your skin stays somehow fuller.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and as advertised</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, and it always does a fine job of smoothing out wrinkles and nourishing my skin.</li>
            <li> use it at night and it isn&#x27;t greasy and I think I see a difference.  love getting it without the worry of running out</li>
            <li> It was lovely.  It didn&#x27;t exactly make me look 35 but I didn&#x27;t really expect that.  It was expensive but aren&#x27;t all face creams?</li>
            <li> Your skin feel like a silk face everybody aske what I done to have a beautiful skin  you can not go wrong with Loreal!</li>
            <li> love it...great price and great product</li>
            <li> Did not notice any difference with my skin after use. Big fan of L&#x27;Oreal just not this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried a variety of similar products (whatever I can catch on sale), and am currently using this one.  It seems comparable, however about 1/2 hour after application (a very thin coat!) my face still feels greasy.  As I apply right before bed, I assume this is eventually rubbed off onto my pillowcase.  Otherwise it seems comparable to the others I&#x27;ve tried.  Although the jar is small, about 3 dabs is all I need a night, so it will last quite awhile (my guess is over 1 month, possibly 2).</li>
            <li> For mature senior skin needing long LASTING all day moisture (no oil) - at this price its a no brainer!</li>
            <li> I think this is a good night cream for its price.&lt;br /&gt;It is around $10 in most places-Target, Walamrt and Walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this for a few weeks now, even though it does not show sdramatic results on wrinkles, I feel that my skin has been healthier than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I do not like about this is that it can be a little greasy and sticky, so I apply a lot at night but I need to use a small amount in the morning( so it does not cause shiny skin during the day)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> Fair, the usual, really doesn&#x27;t do what it advertises.</li>
            <li> Love this. So creamy and smooth. My new part of regime.</li>
            <li> It causes some irritation on my face.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fanatic when it comes to moisturizers. I get caught up paying tons of money for over priced creams that come in small containers that I go through within a month. This stuff is AMAZING and a great price. I can 100% see a difference in my skin since using it. I am stocking up!</li>
            <li> Does not take wrinkles away or fill anything as it says, I am 39 and have been using it for a couple of months. I do love how it leaves my skin. I use it under my makeup and it makes my skin look flawless. for some season I hit my 38s and I started suffering from dry skin, my facial skin is always shedding specially my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each time I would put my foundation it would look horrible. I ended the problem putting this cream before makeup. Now I did not buy it for this purpose. I bought it because I started getting little fine wrinkles, not very noticeable on my forehead and smiling expression lines. They have not changed those wrinkles at all, but none of the other fancy creams I have bought either. I think we have to be realistic there is no magic cream that will erase them away. I think I have changed my mind and I am using them as a prophylactic therapy to prevent them to keep coming out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember when I was 25 and was told I should start using hydration creams on my face and to clean my face before going to bed and did not want to do anything preventative. If you are still in your 40s and 50s I encourage to use it, but if you are older than that expecting this cream to take your wrinkles away forget about that.</li>
            <li> muy bueno el producto y llego a tiempo, muy responsable el vendedor, me gusta el producto, sin más que decir</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd bottle I have used so far. I like it for night cream and it keeps my face moist.</li>
            <li> Tried this for several months and no results at all. It may be a fairly good moisturizer but nothing more. No less wrinkles, or any cleaning up of the face is evident what-so-ever. Just throw this in with all the other trash this government lets companies get away with selling while lying to the public. Hey, people are still buying penis enlargement pills and breast enlargement CREAM, as well as weight loss salt or tablets, pills that attract the opposite sex and over the counter medicines to cure every known disease, and all of them do NOTHING for gods sake except robbing the public of our hard earned money. And it&#x27;s okay to get away with advertising this junk in this corrupt country on every T.V show and magazine and billboard we see because big business runs THIS COUNTRY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When sued and taken to court 12 years ago about these things, the judge said it was all in fun and no one really believes these ads anyhow so it&#x27;s okay to to suspend the facts and have fun with ads. Once more no one stands up for the working class and everything goes to government and big business.&lt;br /&gt;We spend billions on vitamins and things that cure NOTHING at all, but we&#x27;re SO DESPERATE FOR HELP because our medical community and insurance companies robs us blind also and fixes NOTHING EITHER.!Name one disease that medicine cures other than polio 60 years ago????&lt;br /&gt;This product does very little really but is a pretty good moisturizer and there&#x27;s plenty of those around a lot cheaper than this..</li>
            <li> Lo recomiendo 100% son productos de optima calidad y que se ven los resultados. Los uso con toda confianza y lo mas importante es que siempre tienen un precio accesible</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product on a regular basis. It goes on smoothly, and it makes my skin feel soft. I use it day and night. Also, the price is right.</li>
            <li> Great cream.  I have been using for a couple of years with good results.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It took about a month to really see the change. To bad it comes in such small jars, need to buy several at a time.</li>
            <li> This is my go to moisturizer. Maybe be a little heavy for summer but for the winter it is perfect! My skin loves this and it feels moisturizer for 24 hours without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Totally incredible - even when fighting COPD drugs.  Recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> My wife uses this daily and it is great moisturizer. However recently it was short in Walmart and Amazon jumped up the price from $9.x to $17+ which was wrong. Now Walmart has it back again for $9.x</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a long time, I have mature sensitive skin, and like this as it&#x27;s nice and creamy, without feeling greasy doesn&#x27;t contain scent, so doesn&#x27;t make my skin hurt. I&#x27;ve tried a few different types of moisturizer, but always come back to using this one, and have just began buying it on subscribe and save..</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this long enough to say it has made a difference in the appearance my skin, I do love the way it feels every night before going to bed, My skin feels firmer in the morning. I am going to continue to keep using it.</li>
            <li> I combine this with other products for a youthful appearance and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> My new favorite moisturizer. Use it all the time.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin (the day formula does, as it has sunscreen), and is wearable under makeup.</li>
            <li> I have been trying this on and off for a couple of weeks. I know it states day/night use,but It doesn&#x27;t work for daytime use,on my skin. It&#x27;s a bit greasy,and makes it difficult to apply makeup over it. (Even if I apply it sparingly). I found that my foundation and/or concealer will not \\&quot;fit\\&quot; over the cream.It gets very streaky.After reading the product list,I noticed that the 3rd and 4th ingredients are Glycerin and Shea butter,so it&#x27;s no wonder that it&#x27;s a bit slick.&lt;br /&gt;  I think it&#x27;s an OK product for over night use,on face and neck. It&#x27;s a decent product for the price.</li>
            <li> Oily. Gave me breakout.</li>
            <li> Works well according to my wife!</li>
            <li> not original product.</li>
            <li> love this stuff - wonderful for day or night but will definitely help with dry skin but might be heavy for other skin types</li>
            <li> Goes on and stays on nicely.  Very pleased.  Good price.</li>
            <li> I love Loreal Collagen Moisture Filler! I have been ordering the daytime one for four years now.  It makes my face and neck feel so smooth after I put it on.  This product is especially good for me when I use it in the winter cold months.</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping it would help primarily with wrinkles /puffiness /dark circles around the eyes . After a couple days, it seemed like my wrinkles were getting worse.  But, my forehead and neck showed some improvement. I stopped using it around my eyes and the area looked better.  I am still in search of the undereye product .  Hydroxitone is very good for wrinkles but I seek a creamy moisturizer that won &#x27;t ruin my skin.  I will continue to use this L &#x27;Oreal product for the forehead and neck; I have become a &amp;#34;this one is for ____(fill in the section of the face) &amp;#34;  type of woman.</li>
            <li> It is great! Mosturizing cream for now</li>
            <li> Very luxurious feeling</li>
            <li> I have used collage moisture filler for years and can no longer find it at the local Wal Mart and Walgreen&#x27;s.  I was so pleased to see it online.  However, there seemed to be only one container available on Amazon.  I am hoping for more.</li>
