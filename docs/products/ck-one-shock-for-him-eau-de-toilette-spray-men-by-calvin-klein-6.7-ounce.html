            <li>I have people tell me all the time it smells so good and ask what kind is it</li>

            <li>/&gt;super fast shipping excellent price.</li>
            <li>The one thing I did like about this spray is that the smell does stay with you most of the day which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really nice.</li>

            <li>My wife and I love it.</li>

            <li>This stuff makes my wife of 25 years want to get close to me and that is better than some pharmacutical doses can say.  </li>

            <li>And the fact that the price here in Amazon is surely a bargain for the 6.7 ounce size.</li>
            <li>Enjoy, I know I do!</li>
            <li>Great fragrance and more up to date than my old standby CK1</li>
            <li>I thought the price was very good, especially compared to a mall department store.</li>
            <li>Wow, this scent is a great value.</li>
            <li>this is the best perfume you can give you boyfriend , it smell citric but at the same time it smells sweet .</li>
            <li>at all true!</li>
            <li>Be easy on the sprayer, a lot comes out of the bottle, and this fragrance projects well.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for a relative, brother, his wife suggested it lol.</li>
            <li>Transaction went smoothly.</li>
            <li>This cologne is strong, lasts long and smells great all day.</li>
            <li>there is no spray hose to go inside bottle to just came with a spray cap but with no reach into bottle,so if u want to use it either pour on hands or on fingers.but other then that it smells good!</li>
            <li>smells great and lasts long on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the scent, but the sprayer clogged after the first time it was used.</li>
            <li>I love this particular scent because it has this unique, very fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Generally the entire line of Calvin Klein fragrances are superb!</li>
            <li>The smell is almost sweet like a womans perfume.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when CK ONE, CK SHOCK,  Cool Water, etc. are needed.</li>
            <li>You will enjoy this soon to be discontinued / discontinued unisex fragrance, which is generally a more masculine cologne.</li>
            <li>well, so far so good, i liked it so much, a good different scent and long lasting, keep it up ck...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s becoming a little bit harder to find in the stores around here, so I found it here on Amazon and ordered a couple of delicious bottles.</li>
            <li>If I purchased at a local retailer I could easily exchange it for one that works, but through the mail it&#x27;s not so easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a calm clean sent and the shipping was fast</li>
            <li>Not sweet, fits good for me.</li>
            <li>I bought a bottle of this when it first came out</li>
            <li>I waited a long time to get this fragrance, and I&#x27;m glad I bought</li>
            <li>The answer is absolutely, the real deal!</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for about 4 years and really like it.</li>
            <li>I get stopped all the time by woman telling me they really like the scent.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re wondering, &#x27;Is this the real thing&#x27;?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the authentic Calvin Klein for a lot less money, Amazon is hard to beat in the cologne or perfume market, very satisfied with all purchases in these areas with Amazon.</li>
            <li>If you are going to be outdoors most of the time, you can also do half spray on the chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is  an older guys scent, o.k.</li>
            <li>it looses that older man hint</li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The scent does smell good- very similar to polo double black in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>i think that is imposible to amazon contolit the originality of the product and this is an example , for me is a cheap clone ,,the fragance industry is a dark world ...</li>
            <li>however it has a little character and strong element in it.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I had just discarded the empty bottle, so I removed the old sprayer and attached it to the new bottle.</li>
            <li>I had a small sample bottle of this spray, and I liked it, so I decided to buy a larger bottle of this product.  </li>
            <li>My suggestion would be to purchase this if you like polo double black as this is a much better value.</li>
            <li>It arrived well packaged, but was missing an important piece--the sprayer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had numerous compliments from strangers telling me &amp;#34;I smell really good&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend this cologne to people who like colognes that are not subtle and last all day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read comments where the large ck colognes (6.7) don&#x27;t last long.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve read comments where the large ck colognes (6.7) don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> However, after several weeks usage, I found I was not enjoying the smell as much.  </li>
            <li> I smelled CK One Shock for Her long before I decided to buy CK One Shock for Him, and these scents are VERY different.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it&#x27;s not my favorite scent, and at 1st it does have a hint of that older man polo scent.</li>
            <li> The scent reminds me of the old green Polo.</li>
            <li> and specifically I read a comment where they compare the scent to Polo (the old school green one).</li>
            <li> and she actually gets upset when I wear other scents.  </li>
            <li> an d still slightly smells on cloths next day</li>
            <li> Not quite what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Dangerous scent for married men!!</li>
            <li> A half spray on each arm and a half spray on the neck should be enough.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> i was a little hesitant to order after reading a few reviews saying that the bigger bottle smelled like &amp;#34;polo&amp;#34; or was &amp;#34;watered</li>
            <li> my lady AND every other lady LOVES it too !</li>
            <li> Bought this cologne for my husband and he wears it everyday!</li>
            <li> The problem I found out the hard way is that the item is impossible to return if defective.</li>
            <li> Do not let the ugly bottle fool you.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent fragance from Calvin Klein, very original and smells so good. highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Had it before- I really like it. Not sweet, fits good for me. Wife always sez- You smell good. What could be better?</li>
            <li> my lady AND every other lady LOVES it too ! LOL !!</li>
            <li> I have people tell me all the time it smells so good and ask what kind is it</li>
            <li> THE GREATEST  WATCH ALL THE LADIES THOUGH.  IT ATTRACTS LIKE BEES TO HONEY</li>
            <li> Great fragrance and more up to date than my old standby CK1 The price was 1/2 what I would have had to pay at a department store for 1/2 the size.</li>
            <li> This cologne is strong, lasts long and smells great all day. My wife and I love it. I got it for my father as a present. It is noticeable to passerby&#x27;s and he gets a lot of complements. The price for the quantity was very good. I would recommend this cologne to people who like colognes that are not subtle and last all day.</li>
            <li> The problem I found out the hard way is that the item is impossible to return if defective. After just three weeks the spray nozzle stopped working and I have a year or more of product to use. If I purchased at a local retailer I could easily exchange it for one that works, but through the mail it&#x27;s not so easy.</li>
            <li> My Mom and I had picked this out for my Dad awhile ago, but we had never purchased it anywhere. I found the big bottle here for cheaper than the smallest size we found at the store. Great buy! Great price. I bought it as a Christmas present. Smells soooo good!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a relative, brother, his wife suggested it lol. He and she both like it, so it was a hit with them. I thought the price was very good, especially compared to a mall department store. It&#x27;s the authentic Calvin Klein for a lot less money, Amazon is hard to beat in the cologne or perfume market, very satisfied with all purchases in these areas with Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about 4 years and really like it. they do a great job forquick delivery.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my wife of 25 years want to get close to me and that is better than some pharmacutical doses can say.  It&#x27;s a calm clean sent and the shipping was fast</li>
            <li> Smells good, at first it was kind of &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; for my liking, however wife loves it and she actually gets upset when I wear other scents.  I get stopped all the time by woman telling me they really like the scent.  Dangerous scent for married men!!</li>
            <li> The size of the bottle is great for the price. The scent reminds me of the old green Polo. It is  an older guys scent, o.k. though.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this when it first came out and it&#x27;s my favorite cologne. It&#x27;s becoming a little bit harder to find in the stores around here, so I found it here on Amazon and ordered a couple of delicious bottles. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> this stuff is awesome and it is a deal, I recommend it to everyone who has a severe addiction to cologne</li>
            <li> I LOVE HOW THIS SMELLS ON MY HUSBAND. MY HUSBAND ALSO LOVES THAT I ALWAYS ATTACK HIM :o) EVERYONE ALSO COMPLIMENTS HIM. WE ARE HAPPY</li>
            <li> Wow, this scent is a great value. Do not let the ugly bottle fool you. This is a great scent. I smelled CK One Shock for Her long before I decided to buy CK One Shock for Him, and these scents are VERY different. For one, CK One Shock for Her lasts only an hour or two on my girlfriend. CK One Shock for Him lasts about 4 or 5 hours on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is great. Be easy on the sprayer, a lot comes out of the bottle, and this fragrance projects well. A half spray on each arm and a half spray on the neck should be enough. If you are going to be outdoors most of the time, you can also do half spray on the chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great value. You can find this online around 20-25 dollars for 6.7 ounces if you shop around. I waited a long time to get this fragrance, and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent: 4/5&lt;br /&gt;Projection: 3.5/5&lt;br /&gt;Longevity:3/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy/Try/Pass: Buy. For $20, it&#x27;s a great fall/winter scent.</li>
            <li> CK SHOCK for him another good fragance by CK, is a sweety smell that people always ask what you are wearing.</li>
            <li> there is no spray hose to go inside bottle to just came with a spray cap but with no reach into bottle,so if u want to use it either pour on hands or on fingers.but other then that it smells good!</li>
            <li> We try all the different CK One brands as they come out.  Nice to see one that has a women&#x27;s scent and also a men&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne for my husband. It arrived well packaged, but was missing an important piece--the sprayer. Luckily, I had just discarded the empty bottle, so I removed the old sprayer and attached it to the new bottle. The product should have been checked properly before shipping it. Thank you.</li>
            <li> this is the best perfume you can give you boyfriend , it smell citric but at the same time it smells sweet . i love it</li>
            <li> This men&#x27;s fragrance is surely a winner. Generally the entire line of Calvin Klein fragrances are superb! I love this particular scent because it has this unique, very fresh scent. And the fact that the price here in Amazon is surely a bargain for the 6.7 ounce size. If you&#x27;re wondering, &#x27;Is this the real thing&#x27;? The answer is absolutely, the real deal! You will enjoy this soon to be discontinued / discontinued unisex fragrance, which is generally a more masculine cologne. Enjoy, I know I do!</li>
            <li> Smells all dayy an d still slightly smells on cloths next day</li>
            <li> i think that is imposible to amazon contolit the originality of the product and this is an example , for me is a cheap clone ,,the fragance industry is a dark world ...but im gonna useit when im comeback after the lauch hour in my job (speccialy when i decide eat a chinnese food)</li>
            <li> i was a little hesitant to order after reading a few reviews saying that the bigger bottle smelled like &amp;#34;polo&amp;#34; or was &amp;#34;watered down.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not at all true! smells great and lasts long on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;super fast shipping excellent price.</li>
            <li> I had a small sample bottle of this spray, and I liked it, so I decided to buy a larger bottle of this product.  However, after several weeks usage, I found I was not enjoying the smell as much.  The smell is almost sweet like a womans perfume.  I have since switched back to Hugo Boss.  The one thing I did like about this spray is that the smell does stay with you most of the day which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read comments where the large ck colognes (6.7) don&#x27;t last long. and specifically I read a comment where they compare the scent to Polo (the old school green one). Honestly, it&#x27;s not my favorite scent, and at 1st it does have a hint of that older man polo scent. Yet once on you...it looses that older man hint and it&#x27;s really nice. I&#x27;ve had numerous compliments from strangers telling me &amp;#34;I smell really good&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(F.Y.I - A fan of Issey Miyake, Lacoste, Hugo, Diesel)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not on my top 3 list, but for the $ it&#x27;s a GREAT deal. Perhaps a cologne you would want when your like myself. Always like to have some cologne on (even after a shower, lol). Yet your saving your Favorites for dates, parties, bars, etc. That&#x27;s when CK ONE, CK SHOCK,  Cool Water, etc. are needed. CK SHOCK has stepped to the front of the line in those scenarios - Scent stays with your for a while and the price for the quantity is amazing!</li>
            <li> Its a great cologne for a man. It is similar to hana e mori however it has a little character and strong element in it. If i would get a choice i would get this over Hana e mori BUT; the longevity on this thing is not as impressive as hana e mori.</li>
            <li> Bought this cologne for my husband and he wears it everyday! Loves this cologne because it lasts without spraying a lot...a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Transaction went smoothly. Item was just as described. Great Christmas gift. Grand son loved it and was very happy with it</li>
            <li> well, so far so good, i liked it so much, a good different scent and long lasting, keep it up ck...</li>
            <li> Love the scent, but the sprayer clogged after the first time it was used.</li>
            <li> The scent is like a torqued up CK, and it does last longer than the regular.  I would deinitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Not quite what I expected.  The scent does smell good- very similar to polo double black in my opinion.  My suggestion would be to purchase this if you like polo double black as this is a much better value.</li>
