    <ol>
            <li>The best!</li>
            <li>Even tho it is not 100% organic, it&#x27;s still the best of the purer products on the market - and believe me</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful.</li>
            <li>this is the best my lips  have ever felt.   </li>
            <li>the color is perfect</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s what happens when you find something that&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>It is my favorite!</li>
            <li>It stays on nicely if you don&#x27;t eat or drink.</li>
            <li>Also, the seller is great with very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I am very fair Irish and could look kind of washed out   </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>It is tinted and I get so many compliments on the color.  </li>
            <li>This  lip balm is better than ever  </li>
            <li>My favorite of all lip gloss</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t love it like I did the original.</li>
            <li>Yummy, smells and tastes great, lovely sheer color.  </li>
            <li>It is moisturizing, has SPF, and is the perfect color for me (dark hair, eyes, skin).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;the product is not as good as it used to be (I agree with another reviewer as to the consistency of the \\&quot;new\\&quot; product).&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping to receive the product that is pictured in Amazon not the new one.</li>
            <li>good product especially for really hot weather  good price and quality</li>
            <li>I love this product because the tint of red is perfect for a natural look that I like.</li>
            <li>This has the right texture, it&#x27;s not overly greasy like most and it has some staying power --</li>
            <li>(The ones that have those cherry lips) very soothing love</li>
            <li>Lost the 5th star only because it&#x27;s goes on so light - a deep terra cotta that is just a perfect shade.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more!</li>
            <li>Gives your lips a soft pink, has a pleasant subdued scent and I feel good that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Blaze\\&quot; shade gives my lips a great enhanced color similar to what a lipstain would give - noticeable but somewhat natural.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper, looks more natural</li>
            <li>Item is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>The Terratints formula is really moisturizing with a fresh minty flavor.  </li>
            <li>This item keeps my lips soft and smooth with just a hint of color.</li>
            <li>Terratints is a good compromise between lipcolor and plain lip balm.  </li>
            <li>Evidently Alba changed the original case and color although the name is the same.</li>
            <li>I look natural, fresh and</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a nice sheer red, something like Lip Smackers Dr. Pepper but a little more color.</li>
            <li>The red looks good on my pale skin</li>
            <li>I think the color looks pretty much the same as the container looks on my computer screen.  </li>
            <li>I love wearing lipstick, but I go through long periods where my lips are too rough for it.  </li>
            <li>My lips feel like baby lips and have that natural color that very young children  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a natural shade, doesn&#x27;t make lips look painted plastic.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>They were always chapped and feeling terrible and this gives you just that perfect color without looking like old lady lips.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Now it smells unpleasant to me.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.  </li>

            <li> Very disappointed in this product.  The photograph shows the lip balm as it was.  The package has been redone and&lt;br /&gt;the product is not as good as it used to be (I agree with another reviewer as to the consistency of the \\&quot;new\\&quot; product).&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping to receive the product that is pictured in Amazon not the new one.</li>
            <li> I love this product because the tint of red is perfect for a natural look that I like. This is my 4th year using this product.</li>
            <li> I was tired of my lipstick! I mean, at any time during the day I would have to use them even to go to they gym because my lips would get so dry! After this product I don&#x27;t have to look so fake during the day. I look natural, fresh and my lips are less dry even when I don&#x27;t wear it. The best!</li>
            <li> Even tho it is not 100% organic, it&#x27;s still the best of the purer products on the market - and believe me I&#x27;ve tried them all.   This has the right texture, it&#x27;s not overly greasy like most and it has some staying power -- try it, you&#x27;ll like it!! Also, the seller is great with very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a nice sheer red, something like Lip Smackers Dr. Pepper but a little more color. This is dark burgundy lipstick. I look like an evil clown. It&#x27;s in the trash now.</li>
            <li> Item is exactly as described.  Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is a deep color, not just a tint.  I think the color looks pretty much the same as the container looks on my computer screen.  It is moisturizing, has SPF, and is the perfect color for me (dark hair, eyes, skin).  It stays on nicely if you don&#x27;t eat or drink.</li>
            <li> I am plagued with perpetually dry, chapped lips.  I love wearing lipstick, but I go through long periods where my lips are too rough for it.  Terratints is a good compromise between lipcolor and plain lip balm.  The \\&quot;Blaze\\&quot; shade gives my lips a great enhanced color similar to what a lipstain would give - noticeable but somewhat natural.  The Terratints formula is really moisturizing with a fresh minty flavor.  I will definitely buy more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years now, but this batch seems to have changed.  It used to smell like peppermint.  Now it smells unpleasant to me.  I&#x27;m not sure exactly what type of smell it is....&amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34;?  I&#x27;m just not satisfied with whatever Alba has done with its tinted lip balms.  This is the third color that I&#x27;ve tried and they all smell the same.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. Gives your lips a soft pink, has a pleasant subdued scent and I feel good that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> Evidently Alba changed the original case and color although the name is the same. The tint is a little less colorful. I still like it okay but I don&#x27;t love it like I did the original. The picture does not match what I received.</li>
            <li> This item keeps my lips soft and smooth with just a hint of color. I no longer need lipstick. It is my favorite!</li>
            <li> I prefer wearing Terratints to wearing lipstick.  It&#x27;s cheaper, looks more natural and I don&#x27;t have to worry about chemicals getting into my system.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!  Why?  It&#x27;s a natural shade, doesn&#x27;t make lips look painted plastic. Bonus: it doesn&#x27;t contain lead.</li>
            <li> good product especially for really hot weather  good price and quality my gf loves it. definitely worth a try at least once</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years.  I buy a few different colors.  The red looks good on my pale skin it is a bit sparkly</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried this stuff...YOU SHOULD.  It is tinted and I get so many compliments on the color.  I have really sensitive skin so I can&#x27;t put just anything on my lips.  This product has been my staple lip balm for years.</li>
            <li> This  lip balm is better than ever  I have been using this for I think almost 10 years tried every other product  Berts bees etc.  this is the best my lips  have ever felt.   They were always chapped and feeling terrible and this gives you just that perfect color without looking like old lady lips.  My lips feel like baby lips and have that natural color that very young children  (The ones that have those cherry lips) very soothing love the feel  and the color is perfect I am very fair Irish and could look kind of washed out   Without a little color on my lips    I hope they don&#x27;t stop making this that&#x27;s what happens when you find something that&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> My favorite of all lip gloss</li>
            <li> Yummy, smells and tastes great, lovely sheer color.  Lost the 5th star only because it&#x27;s goes on so light - a deep terra cotta that is just a perfect shade.</li>
