            <li>, my honest opinion is that this is a very good product for those of you like me who want to have whiter, brighter teeth without the damaging effects of peroxide.</li>
            <li>It took about 2 to see results and they were amazing!</li>
            <li>It was amazing!</li>
            <li>Thank you for an amazing product!</li>
            <li>My teeth have looked better than ever, probably the best they ever have.</li>
            <li>But most of all, it&#x27;s awesome because of how well it works!  </li>
            <li>They worked marvelous, I couldnt ask for anything that could of worked better.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s some kind of coincidence!  </li>
            <li>its really remarkable product...</li>
            <li>But most of all, it&#x27;s awesome because of how well it works!</li>
            <li>It is easily the best in this product class.</li>
            <li>Best and most effective way to whiten teeth.</li>
            <li>Until I welcome this amazing product into my life.</li>
            <li>They are so bright it’s noticeable to everyone.  </li>
            <li>Another wonderful feature of this product is whitening LED light which carries the process of whitening the teeth rapidly.</li>
            <li>My good friend recommended Shine Whitening because they knew of my sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li>It works just as good as the $100+</li>
            <li>The trays are also fairly flexible.</li>
            <li>This whitener is a good deal and it worked well on his teeth.</li>
            <li>The tray system is good and might take some work</li>
            <li>but it is good for you in the end.</li>
            <li>Need to whiten teeth, looked on amazon for a good product.</li>
            <li>and so I came on here to look for good reviews since I can&#x27;t break the bank on this one.</li>
            <li>and I am here to add to the good ones.</li>
            <li>My daughter had good results with this, she had no complaints and no sensitivity.</li>
            <li>Completely loved this.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>They can&#x27;t be good for your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I went home and took it out of the box, then read the instructions and stuck the mouth tray into my mouth, forming a fit that fits perfectly.</li>
            <li>This is part of looking good every day.</li>
            <li>The price is good too.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good system to help whiten my teeth after I got braces removed.</li>
            <li>I’ve had good experiences with this product.</li>
            <li>and I get good results.</li>
            <li>This is a good deal for you.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>But Shine zero does a good job of not hurting me.</li>
            <li>that I know that it looks so good.</li>
            <li>but this product is doing a good job reversing the damage.</li>
            <li>and I think the tray stuff is a good look for this product.</li>
            <li>People at work are commenting about my teeth in a good way.</li>
            <li>It is fascinating to see how whoever is selling this product broke through Amazon&#x27;s review filters and is infiltrating the site with spiked review columns.  </li>
            <li>It was a good purchase.</li>
            <li>I then went to amazon to see if there were any helpful Q&amp;A and realized that all the good reviews are faked...</li>
            <li>I used it for about a week beforehand and it looked good in the mirror</li>
            <li>Good deal for the price.  </li>
            <li>and they told me how good it made me look.</li>
            <li>Good system here.</li>
            <li>My teeth are looking really good.</li>
            <li>This is a good product for those who do not want to use peroxide.</li>
            <li>best part, to me, is the fact that it is peroxide free.</li>
            <li>The best feature about this product is the inclusion of the LED light.</li>
            <li>But atlast i find a good way that is Shine-Whitening zero peroxide teeth.  </li>
            <li>So take it from me if you want to see a remarkable improvement that will illuminate you smile and attitude, try Shine Whitening, you will surely be as impressed with the product as I have been.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with what I got done, so that’s cool.</li>
            <li>The instructions are great and this is so easy to use!  </li>

            <li>All in all, I am very pleased with Shine Whitening and will use it again.</li>
            <li>The great thing about this product is it has zero peroxide, so I can use it safely.  </li>

            <li>I am very pleased with how it all turned out</li>
            <li>I was real easy to use and had everything you need to whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li>and I was very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Very glad to have tried it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased and will continue to use this.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, and most importantly, my gums were not irritated!!!  </li>

            <li>A friend of mine recommended this product to me and boy am I glad she did!  </li>
            <li>Love this though and will order again!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>As a front desk associate at work, I always have to wear a wonderful smile to keep clients comfortable and happy.</li>
            <li>After using Shine Whitening for about a week, I started to notice that my teeth were looking so much better!</li>
            <li>I dont think a whitening method can get any better than this!</li>
            <li>This has been the most effective whitening product I have encountered!</li>
            <li>Love this item!</li>
            <li>Which led me onto Amazon to see where I could get him more, and here I am !</li>
            <li>So Ive tried so many products for teeth whitening !</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>so I am wondering if they are even touching my teeth!</li>
            <li>My teeth are progressively getting whiter and whiter every day, and my confidence is getting better as well!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s really easy to use and apply, effect is great, I do drink a lot of coffee</li>
            <li>Found the system easy to use and everything is great.</li>
            <li>And this one is certainly one of the best products out there.  </li>
            <li>I brought this product a week ago and ever since I tried it, it&#x27;s  been amazing.</li>
            <li>but this works amazing.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel fantastic and look great.</li>
            <li>It has amazing reviews, but I am a skeptic at heart.</li>
            <li>It’s amazing this kind of technology exists.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t prepared to spend the kind of money it takes to get whitening done at a dentist&#x27;s office and my dental insurance doesn&#x27;t cover whitening.</li>
            <li>Their website also gives a tutorial, which is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>After a couple weeks I began to notice a nice difference.</li>
            <li>This is just as good and arguably better than a dentist cleaning.</li>
            <li>It is really effective.</li>
            <li>They look kind of yellow-y</li>
            <li>Loving it.</li>
            <li>It conforms to your own mouth</li>
            <li>I am astounded by how effective it has been.</li>
            <li>but that was my own fault.</li>
            <li>I received this product for testing purposes with a commitment to post an honest product review.  </li>
            <li>I received this product in return for an honest review.</li>
            <li>Affordable and effective.</li>
            <li>I ended up going on YouTube searching on my own.  </li>
            <li>I got a pack for my wife too, and she is loving the results as well.  </li>
            <li>received this product in exchange for my honest review-</li>
            <li>Recommended for if you need to whiten your teeth up a bit, and who of us doesn&#x27;t need that, to be honest?</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can kind of tell I smoke</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for this wonderful product!</li>
            <li>Nice Shine Without the Sensitivity!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The gel has a nice pleasant flavor that I do not hate.</li>
            <li>The trays are molded to fit my mouth and the results have been dazzling.</li>
            <li>I do have a beautiful smile using this shine whitening kit.</li>
            <li>But more importantly my teeth look great.</li>
            <li>I was super happy with how well it works.</li>
            <li>It contains no Peroxide and is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The instructions  comes with it and is very easy to follow.</li>
            <li>The instructions that it comes with are very easy to understand and give information on product safety as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth are 10× whiter and this product is very easy to use believe me when I say you can&#x27;t stop me from smiling.</li>
            <li>The instructions that it comes with are very easy to understand-</li>
            <li>My teeth are looking pretty good!</li>
            <li>This is PERFECT for sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also conscious about losing fluoride, so Shine Whitening was the perfect product for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked using trays better those pesky strips.</li>
            <li>So far I am really impressed with this whitening kit.</li>
            <li>This is a great value if you like having a shining smile.</li>
            <li>I’m happy with having a brighter smile around the office and at the club.</li>
            <li>and I found that a whiter smile was where my face just looked great.</li>
            <li>My smile is shining and I am feeling great.</li>
            <li>This by far is the best teeth whitening agent I have tried.</li>
            <li>I decided after reading some reviews to try a kit, because it&#x27;s more cost effective than paying someone.</li>
            <li>Excellent for sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>Nothing welcomes another person&#x27;s eyes more than a beautiful smile.</li>
            <li>Ive noticed this product to be the most effective and</li>
            <li>This Shine whitener is the best I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>The ones that seemed the most effective caused some sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>The Shine Whitening System has been the most effective teeth whitener I&#x27;ve ever had the pleasure of experiencing.</li>

            <li>but it worked fine without any issues.</li>
            <li>I use the tray and it works fine with me, but at one point I thought I lost it and used the q tip</li>
            <li>and it was fine.</li>
            <li>The kit comes with a set of easily formable mouth guards and case, instructions on the package, 2 tubes of whitening gel, an applicator head for the gel, a teeth color paper (to compre the color of your teeth before and after) and an LED light.</li>
            <li>But we’re doing fine.</li>
            <li>If you are having problems with the mouth tray, you can just apply the solution and it works fine.</li>

            <li>and I noticed a tremendous difference after about a week!</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s QUICK!</li>
            <li>This product worked wonderfully for me, and I would right away say that I will buy it subsequently in order to brighten my smile!</li>
            <li>The tray system is easy and the fluid is great</li>
            <li>I feel more confident and I am more willing to smile now.</li>
            <li>I am a great candidate for the use of whitening strips since my teeth are naturally less than a perfect white.</li>
            <li>, i ordered it, it arrived in just 3 days, and i started using it and noticed a huge difference,</li>
            <li>It does such a great job and is comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>I know, I should quit) and this had really taken a toll on my once bright smile.</li>
            <li>I also can&#x27;t get the infra light device to fit in my mouth with the trays as they have a flip which prevents the light device from staying in your month.</li>
            <li>I am a huge coffee drinker and then I started noticing that yellowish stain teeth; I knew I had to do something.</li>
            <li>I also like how this product as a LED light</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I did not experience any sensitivity.</li>
            <li>I like the LED light that comes with too because they do that at the dental office.</li>
            <li>The tray fit my mouth well</li>
            <li>Great product, and must for those that want truly white teeth.</li>
            <li>just at the direction explained 2x a day for 15 minutes with the light.  </li>
            <li>The trays are also extremely comfortable; its as if they were molded for my teeth</li>
            <li>Put they trays in and use the light to help accelerate the process.  </li>
            <li>It consists of trays that conform to your mouth to form a custom and snug fit.</li>
            <li>I tried this product because it claimed to be the same/similar process to the light trays used at the facility in the mall, and it claimed to not irritate gums like Crest.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My life is filled with all kinds of things that stain teeth.</li>
            <li>I’m  confident now to smile every time.</li>
            <li>With this product you will mold trays for your teeth, put whitening gel inside the tray, insert the trays in the mouth, and then put the LED light in the mouth.</li>
            <li>so it makes it comfortable to use</li>
            <li>Enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I can somewhat control salivation.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even know how to operate the light, it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Place them in your mouth and insert the light resting them against your trays for 15 minutes twice a day.  </li>
            <li>You stick the trays in your mouth to make them fit, then you continue to use them maybe two times a week</li>
            <li>and I’m really happy it has a second gel</li>
            <li>The tray system is made to fit in your mouth, so you should use it, because it was made for everyone’s mouth.</li>
            <li>My light did not even work.</li>
            <li>so I still had her light.</li>
            <li>but none as cheap.</li>
            <li>Seriously, don&#x27;t cheap out and buy the whitening strips instead.</li>
            <li>They are white and my lipstick looks great against my teeth.</li>
            <li>It is a great product and a solid, inexpensive alternative to the dentist&#x27;s chair.  </li>
            <li>I followed the detailed instructions on Shine Whitening</li>
            <li>The package includes a ultraviolet light, which you are instructed to use with the product.</li>
            <li>Enjoying my whiter smile.</li>
            <li>I want those I meet and greet to feel comfortable talking to me.</li>
            <li>It’s comfortable and my teeth are whiter.</li>
            <li>as doing the trays for the teeth and trying to get the light to stay in your mouth, as well as all the saliva build up for 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy that result and this product is to thank.</li>
            <li>In any case, teeth whitening has primarily been my husband&#x27;s thing ..</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s fun to watch him do the gel and light and stuff !</li>
            <li>Bizarre.</li>
            <li>in all, the gel with a light did whiten my teeth .  </li>
            <li>I used the product for 30 minutes each session as I saw on YouTube for another product with light.  </li>
            <li>My teeth look great after ten applications.</li>
            <li>Crest White Strips are great, but I didn&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;shooting pain&amp;#34; feeling I would get with using them.</li>
            <li>The trays formed to my mouth comfortably.  </li>
            <li>the results were amazing and my teeth stains went off that fast.</li>
            <li>and I do enjoy using this product always.</li>
            <li>I ran across this product and what stood out was the retina case and led light .</li>
            <li>light never worked from day one.</li>
            <li>LED light does not work.</li>
            <li>It works great on teeth, especially for people who drink a lot of tea or coffee and have stains from that!</li>
            <li>, I always make sure that my smile is the brightest.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been a huge coffee or wine drinker so for me, the change in my teeth color was really noticeable and did I mention, the TOTAL LACK OF teeth sensitivity was absolutely great!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable and insures even whitening.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was great to see how white my teeth could be.</li>
            <li>I have always taken pride in my white and perfect teeth (thanks to braces)</li>
            <li>These are my own personal honest and unbiased opinions*</li>
            <li>and I think the results I got were good enough that I didn’t want to risk doing it more.</li>
            <li>product is the perfect combination of being gentle enough to not cause sensitivity, but also to work efficiently.  </li>
            <li>I have used many other products to whiten my teeth, but this certain product is the that worked the best.</li>
            <li>I would be very conscious of my teeth, feelings as if I&#x27;ve ruined them with coffee and cigarettes and thats the first thing people see, you want to leave a great impression.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of products (many found right here on Amazon).  </li>
            <li>But hey, I am not complaining I am just excited about such great</li>
            <li>I could see a difference in the color of my teeth in the first application!!  </li>
            <li>While my teeth have been noticeably whiter to me, I think it’s the fact that I have a brighter smile and I am more willing to show them off that makes them better.</li>
            <li>I immediately saw results after the first use and after a couple more, my teeth are now whiter than they&#x27;re ever been...definitely recommend it if you struggle with the burden of having a stained smile :)</li>
            <li>It really works good very gentle on out teeth</li>
            <li>but I am pretty happy about the teeth thing, it doesn’t hurt or hurt my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>It is quick and easy to use, but without the peroxide.</li>
            <li>A beautiful smile requires a set of beatiful, white teeth, and this product gives just that.</li>
            <li>This is by far the most economical, comfortable, and effective teeth whitening product I have ever, ever found.</li>
            <li>The whitening system is good for those of us who have crooked teeth, the trays fit perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>It’s overall really good and an easy experience.</li>
            <li>This same light is even used at some professional whitening centers and that is why I am so impressed by this product.</li>
            <li>This product has helped me regain my confidence and my smile is here to stay!</li>
            <li>Shine Whitening can restore your beautiful white smile and gently with no sensitivity and pain which is important for healthy teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t notice a significant change</li>
            <li>It is worth the effort but stay committed to it once you start to see results!</li>
            <li>I have used this kit twice a day for the last 4 days, and there is a remarkable difference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li>I think that you&#x27;ll be pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li>A difference I can smile about!</li>
            <li>(it was a gift and if I could post from whoever brought it to the white elephant gift exchange I would), but I&#x27;m not a troll ! :p</li>
            <li>I wasn’t sure at first but, decided that I had nothing to lose.&lt;br</li>
            <li>unique experience with the professionalism of an orthodontist.</li>
            <li>Decide to give this product a try and am very pleased with the results so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for brighten my smile!</li>
            <li>and he said my enamel was thicker and stronger and guess what.......he complemented me on how BRIGHTER MY SMILE WAS!</li>
            <li>The tray included in the kit forms right to your teeth making the cleaning and brightening process more effective in whitening everything -not missing a spot.  </li>
            <li>I now have beautiful, white teeth and since I love to smile it really</li>
            <li>and it isn&#x27;t super comfortable.  </li>
            <li>That made me give up all my hope of having a natural bright smile again.</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t have that squeaky clean feeling either.  </li>
            <li>I got my package in the mail, it kind of looked like a science project, but using the mouth trays with the LED lights really felt fun.</li>
            <li>and now I have a bright smile which I&#x27;ve always wanted without having to spend a bunch of money on getting it professionally done.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve stopped smoking for years now and drink significantly less coffee, yet still have not been able to find a successful, cost-effective way to whiten my teeth.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty easy to use, the trays are comfortable also.</li>
            <li>Like some of the other reviewers have said, this is a great deal if you are looking to get whitening done on the cheap.</li>
            <li>Shine Whitening was comfortable, easy to use, and definitely more affordable than the professional whitening my dentist</li>
            <li>The price is right and the product does the trick!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shine whitening is a real life saver for me and being able to get it shipped right to my mail box, right from Amazon, well, what&#x27;s not to love about that.</li>
            <li>Lots of people compliment on how bright and white my teeth are!</li>
            <li>Full steam ahead, order me another latte because Shine Zero is the wings beneath my bright, white teeth.</li>
            <li>I noticed my teeth were on there watt to being bright white</li>
            <li>I am also happy that this system has caused absolutely no discomfort or tooth</li>
            <li>The results were amazing, it&#x27;s totally changed my smile and has given me so much more confidence in myself.</li>
            <li>My smile is brighter and I am more willing to flash it to people now</li>
            <li>In about two weeks my teeth have passed from a yellowish color to a really bright white color.</li>
            <li>Amazon was good enough to send me another package.  </li>
            <li>I doubt any of these reviews are true.</li>
            <li>so I love how gentle</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own and potential customers can&#x27;t come to Amazon and expect HONEST reviews by REAL customers:</li>
            <li>The gel is cool and minty.</li>
            <li>There is an optional UV light for a brighter smile.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the tray system and my mouth and smile have been attracting onlookers</li>
            <li>Anyway, thanks to this product I feel better about myself a bit.</li>
            <li>and so far the results have been spectacular.</li>
            <li>Got this one after trying cheaper to mid price items thinking maybe if I invest in a good product that my results will change a bit.</li>
            <li>My breath even smells better, which I didn&#x27;t really expect.</li>
            <li>I recommend Shine whitening to anyone who wants more bang for their buck.</li>
            <li>and it’s about good enough to do one TM period.</li>
            <li>I love the LED light, totally speeds up the process and removed more stains and yellowing</li>
            <li>This product has accomplished that and more.</li>
            <li>I started using Brilliant a few weeks ago</li>
            <li>otherwise they become too droopy and this is certainly true.  </li>
            <li>and it’s not bad for the price either.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with easy to use trays and an LED light that, in my opinion, really speeds up the process.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I placed the order in Amazon and got the product delivered on right time and delivery was free.</li>
            <li>The instructions might scare you at first because it seems like a lot of steps, but this kit is beyond easy.</li>
            <li>You do not have to worry about boiling water, burning your hand off or placing hot trays in your mouth to form a mold, It is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>instructions were easy to follow and after the first try I saw results.</li>
            <li>Getting the right tray consistency is super important because that&#x27;s going to affect how the trays mold to your teeth.  </li>
            <li>Thank you to the maker of this product, you have given me a smile worth showing off!</li>
            <li>This works great and is even effective against long term, deep stains.</li>
            <li>A week later I bought a second package for my best friend.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work well &amp; falls apart quickly.</li>
            <li>This is definitely the best whitening product I have personally used.</li>
            <li>Luckily I have a tray from another product I tried and used that.</li>
            <li>It noticeable whitens your teeth with quick results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to get white teeth, no matter how many times I brush my teeth with those whitening tooth pastes.</li>
            <li>A great product for those looking for something natural and helps out with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I feel so much more confident about myself now that I have my pearly whites back.  </li>
            <li>Noticed this online here by accident, lucky.</li>
            <li>lucky</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re whitening your teeth, you want something that works quickly, but that doesn&#x27;t damage your teeth or make them sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference in how bright my smile is and how white my teeth</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and</li>
            <li>I am very happy with Shine, as it is able to provide whitening treatment that works without using irritating ingredients, all for a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s important to consistently  whiten our teeth.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions exactly and applied the tray with the light for 15 minutes on just my bottom teeth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable, and doesn&#x27;t take much time out of your day at all!  </li>
            <li>It’s only 15 minutes a day and real easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable, and doesn&#x27;t take much time out of your day at all!</li>
            <li>First of all, it is very economical as it saves you a lot of money and a trip to the dentist.</li>
            <li>Anyways, he was very excited when I brought home this from work (only he would get excited by this!)</li>
            <li>I think I will like the new product better.  </li>
            <li>The toothpaste also actually tastes pretty good</li>
            <li>I find the product very well priced and easy to use as well.</li>
            <li>It’s very efficient and when you use the tray system it makes it easy for you to apply the gel to your teeth.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty good but the trays are WAY too big for my mouth.</li>
            <li>I found this product easy to use and really made my teeth whiter.</li>
            <li>This whitener was easy to use and didn&#x27;t irritate my teeth too much.</li>
            <li>I loved Crest White strips when they first came out, but the pain and sensitivity</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for a teeth whitening product that really works and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>The product nevertheless was ready to use with easy to follow instructions.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth with many issues.</li>
            <li>then it originally was when I first started to use the product.</li>
            <li>We’re getting married in two weeks!</li>
            <li>The LED light is something that I have never actually tried before on my own, but it really helps!</li>
            <li>Save your money and try this whitening product first and learn from my trials and errors!</li>
            <li>As an avid smoker and coffee drinker, I must say this is a necessity!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is actually a better product that comes with the better proportion of providing gentle enough treatment on to the tooth that will not cause sensitivity, but then it work tremendously.</li>
            <li>and I definitely recommend this product to everyone who wants some really cheap and works phenomenally!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing- easy on teeth and works extremely well.</li>
            <li>I can say that this is an awesome product for teeth whitening, previously i have so many other products</li>
            <li>/&gt;What&#x27;s great about this product is that it is easy to use, doesn&#x27;t take much time out of your day, it doesn&#x27;t make your teeth too sensitive like other products do, and it&#x27;s comfortable.</li>
            <li>The LED light makes the process so much easier and provides visibility while whitening.  </li>
            <li>Aside from it being reasonably priced, it is also peroxide free.</li>
            <li>I used the cheap teeth strips, but they didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always prided myself on my smile.  </li>
            <li>I also enjoyed the natural botanical ingredients.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste works great because it not only whitens my teeth but also protects it against being sensitive.  </li>
            <li>shine whitening has saved my smile.</li>
            <li>Now, i smile without thinking twice.</li>
            <li>Removing the coffee stains and improving my smile.</li>
            <li>I keep getting compliments on my smile.</li>
            <li>and I am veru upset and feel embarassed to smile or show my teeth.</li>
            <li>and I just happened to notice her transforming smile.</li>
            <li>No sensitivity felt, just a gleaning smile.</li>
            <li>No information on website worth any value</li>
            <li>I have a sparkling smile.</li>
            <li>I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and all opinions are based on my personal experience with the Shine Whitening-Zero Peroxide Teeth Whitening System.  </li>
            <li>I have been getting comments at work regarding my smile.</li>
            <li>and I can see a difference on my teeth and in my smile.</li>
            <li>That’s pretty cool.</li>
            <li>So I guess what I’m saying is that a whiter smile by maybe three or four degrees is the equivalent of losing 20 pounds.</li>
            <li>But my nervousness was unnecessary, because this kit is awesome!  </li>
            <li>Sometimes cheaper products aren’t as good as regular priced ones, but from what I can tell, this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Pretty cool if you ask me.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying I have the most sensitive teeth -</li>
            <li>Nobody has ever commented on my smile or my teeth</li>
            <li>I feel fresh</li>
            <li>It wasn’t worth it after a while.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price</li>
            <li>and I kind of forgot about it until last night when he mentioned that he hadn&#x27;t had teeth sensitivity, plus he thought his teeth did look whiter.</li>
            <li>This teeth whitener is worth the cost.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not abrasive at all, which is great for my sensitive teeth, and it works like an actual whitening treatment that you&#x27;d get at the dentist&#x27;s office!  </li>
            <li>It is worth every dime.</li>
            <li>Worth the effort for a youthful smile.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple to use, and effective.  </li>
            <li>The yellowish stain is gone and my mouth feels fresh.</li>
            <li>My smile had transformed into a MEGA WATT SMILE.  </li>
            <li>I used this for the first time for the full 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>It was worth the money for me.</li>
            <li>with weeks I noticed the difference in my smile.</li>
            <li>course, none of those things would matter if the results weren&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But my nervousness was unnecessary, because this kit is awesome!</li>
            <li>I had Complexion to laugh</li>
            <li>I had been using peroxide as a teeth whitening solution for quite some time, as a friend of mine mentioned that this approach was the cheapest route to brighten a smile.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now, and my teeth are whiter than ever - even more so than right after a professional whitening.  </li>
            <li>I am beyond excited that it actually works and apart from making my teeth beautifully white, it gives great breath as well.</li>
            <li>I also tried other similar products, but Shine Whitening is the best on the market.</li>
            <li>Other whitening products won&#x27;t do a good job as this one.</li>
            <li>The bottom tray never formed right either.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The day I got it, I had to try it right away.</li>
            <li>it made a difference on my pearly whites right away.</li>
            <li>A friend recommended this brand to me and I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month with nothing but positive whitening results!</li>
            <li>The LED light is cool and it&#x27;s a legitimate professional tool.  </li>
            <li>What makes it even more amazing it that although it is reasonably priced, it still does a terrific job as if you sought out a professional.</li>
            <li>I tried using this many times and it didn&#x27;t improve the shade of my teeth even after I used up more than half of the delivered amount.</li>
            <li>I am so happy to have my white smile back again!</li>
            <li>And at this price I really feel that I found a true winner</li>
            <li>I wish I noticed that first because it definitely isn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li>I liked that I was able to notice a visible difference after a couple days and that even weeks later my teeth are still white.</li>
            <li>My dentist gave me some long term treatment which was not that effective.</li>
            <li>It works quickly and I love that it has the same professional LED light that they use at the dentist.</li>
            <li>I prioritize keeping myself professional looking and healthy at all times, and this product has really helped me to eliminate my stain issue.</li>
            <li>This stuff helps rebuild a bit of enamel which is great because my teeth are yellowing at a crazy rate but this has really kind of reversed time for me.</li>
            <li>So the process is not horrible, and after a few treatments I have been gifted with whiter teeth.</li>
            <li>and I’m glad to say that after a few sessions my teeth are a lot better looking than before.</li>
            <li>I have even sent this product back home in India and they are happy with it too as they could not find a similar product that was even close to it over there.</li>
            <li>Well this stuff is easy to use even if you were 100 years old</li>
            <li>Product came with clear instructions and was easy to use.</li>
            <li>I found a video on how to mold the trays to fit, but nothing on how to use the gel or the blue light.  </li>
            <li>It comes with two injections filled with the white liquid gel, a syringe nozzle, the led light and two mouth trays.</li>
            <li>I really like how the product was able to whiten my teeth without making them feel sensitive after.</li>
            <li>and I’m glad to say that after a few sessions my teeth are a lot better looking than before.</li>
            <li>The gel you apply into your mouth is very cool and refreshing, a slight minty taste that is welcoming.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything that&#x27;s out there when it comes to whitening products from toothpastes and strips to paying upwards of $100 for a 15 minuted professional whitening session.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply with no mess.</li>
            <li>Works very fast and ask anyone</li>
            <li>My friends and family have very much noticed my teeth.</li>
            <li>Whitening solution works very fast.</li>
            <li>Since using this product, it is clear the the LED light has whitened my teeth far more and much faster.</li>
            <li>My pearly-whites haven&#x27;t gleamed so bright since I was a little one.</li>
            <li>This particular teeth whitening system is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I have earlier used many teeth whitening systems</li>
            <li>They did improve somewhat but not nearly as much as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>After about a week of use, i was so ready to step in front of that camera at the DMV and not feel embarrassed by my smile.</li>
            <li>Plus no expensive dental bills or taking off work for an appointment.</li>
            <li>I got fast whiter teeth, and no discomfort!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this 5 now &amp; it has done absolutely NOTHING!</li>
            <li>I struggled with the mouth guards at first.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love white teeth.</li>
            <li>I also love coffee, tea, red wine and berries.</li>
            <li>The rubber trays look like mouth guards for playing sports, but you dip them into hot water and mold them to your teeth.  </li>
            <li>so I’m sure it can be used daily until desired results are achieved.  </li>
            <li>First, I may have messed up, but I followed the instructions exactly.</li>
            <li>I heated up a mug of water and put the first tray in and it worked.</li>
            <li>This was my first time to use this kit.</li>
            <li>Now I have much brighter and whiter smile without any coffee or blueberry stains.</li>
            <li>Much better and simple to use as well.</li>
            <li>This is quite a process, but if you do it exactly as directed, you will see results.</li>
            <li>You dip in hot water to mold to your teeth.</li>
            <li>and my teeth have become a bit more white than before.</li>
            <li>but it saves time because it fits in your mouth exactly.</li>
            <li>I used it about twice a week for a couple months and my results have been stellar.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the type of person that can get results the first application with peroxide kits (Rembrandt).  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t eat ice cream or drink hot chocolate with out my teeth bothering me.</li>
            <li>So many different teeth whiteners</li>
            <li>and they couldn’t pinpoint what I improved, just that overall my look is “better.”</li>
            <li>I will keep using it and let you guys know how it looks in a month or more, but for now a big thumbs up for this product.</li>
            <li>Got the product on time, package exactly as described A+ seller.</li>
            <li>Love the product but they should have a variety of different sized trays for smaller mouths for sure.</li>
            <li>My smile is so much whiter than before.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any improvement in whiteness with my first application of this product.</li>
            <li>After the first use I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shine Whitening works just as well as professional whitening at a dentist&#x27;s office, costs a tiny fraction of the price, and is infinitely more comfortable to implement.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this to anyone that is looking for a safe way to whiten their teeth without going to the dentist.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find a teeth whitening system that is specifically designed for sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li>Saw improvement after the first application.</li>
            <li>Crest whitestrips work better for the same price.</li>
            <li>so I think this product might be exactly what I need to whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make your teeth and gums sensitive because the tray protects them, and the light that is used for the whitening process is trusted by dentist professionals.   </li>
            <li>I tried this for the first time and didn&#x27;t expect it to work so well.</li>
            <li>My teeth are whiter than they have ever been and my confidence is higher as well.</li>
            <li>But it really works!</li>
            <li>Whoever it is is sophisticated enough to be able to manhandle Amazon&#x27;s internal vetting process.</li>
            <li>Definitely one of the best trays I&#x27;ve used (I have a pretty small mouth</li>
            <li>Many of us have teeth with a bit of yellow tint, but Shine Whitening is fixing that!</li>
            <li>Now I am a coffee drinker, so I was plagued with brown stains that I was sure I would only my dentist could remove!</li>
            <li>I use at my dentist, but sooo much cheaper!</li>
            <li>I really recommend it!</li>
            <li>It brightened my teeth so much that people even noticed and complimented me on it!</li>
            <li>Shine Whitening really helped change that and gave me a smile that I can give without being embarrassed.  </li>
            <li>Higher quality than I</li>
            <li>Another one of my products I will be using on a consistent basis.</li>
            <li>Within the first couple of applications I was smiling from ear to ear.  </li>
            <li>I will keep using it and let you guys know how it looks in a month or more, but for now a big thumbs up for this product.</li>
            <li>I am a wine drinker(I love red wine!)</li>
            <li>I have tried many whitening products like Crest white strips, Colgate whitening toothpaste, and even a Groupon for a whitening agent that you have to paint on to your teeth.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried the trays, I wasn&#x27;t paying attention</li>
            <li>I am a regular user of at home teeth whitening systems and have tried out many of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Basically, soak the trays in hot water and then mold them to your teeth.</li>
            <li>“You have a nice smile” and “Wow, white teeth.”</li>
            <li>I tried a few over the counter ones from Walmart but found my teeth tingled and not in a good way.</li>
            <li>I found the tray system extremely easy to use and there is a little work up top to mold it to your mouth</li>
            <li>The easy to use trays are a major selling point for me.</li>
            <li>So pretty much all that would need is right here.</li>
            <li>What I like most about Shine Whitening is that is uses less chemicals and the LED light</li>
            <li>It whitened my teeth at least 3 shades; it was fast, easy, and non-messy; and it left me feeling more confident about my smile!</li>
            <li>Your smile is such a huge factor in confidence and every day life.</li>
            <li>I brush my teeth, put on the gel and trays, sometimes I use the light for s few minutes and then sit and write or watch a show while the magic gel does it&#x27;s thing.</li>
            <li>I wish I had a before picture, but I really think it does work, but I&#x27;m sure it will take longer to get my teeth as white as I want.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a brighter smile without the pain.</li>
            <li>Amazon, could you please look into the positive &#x27;reviews&#x27; that prompted me to purchase this?</li>
            <li>Becareful of all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>After smoking for many years, my teeth were stained grey.  </li>
            <li>but it pretty much maintained the color.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t know what to think about this, when my girlfriend first picked it up for me</li>
            <li>so it barely even fit in there.</li>
            <li>, then when they have cooled you simply put a bead of the teeth whitening gel into the trays (be sure to cut off the tab at the front of each tray) insert into your mouth and use the LED blue light device that comes with the set.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love the product, but did have one minor issue.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t know what to think about this, when my boyfriend first picked it up for me</li>
            <li>Also is not painful if you have sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>This was a gift to myself because I am a busy mom, in show business and giving myself a full body makeover and want to improve my image for 2015.</li>
            <li>It is amazing how much sparkling white teeth not only enhance your smile, but also make your skin tone look richer by its offset quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finally I have found an easy to use teeth whitening system.</li>
            <li>it claims no sensitivity and it seemed easy enough to use at home.</li>
            <li>This is a simple and easy way to whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive teeth and haven&#x27;t felt any noticeable discomfort.</li>
            <li>This product is simple to use and fits easily in my mouth now.</li>
            <li>I didn’t have any sensitivity issues but if you do I would suggest using it less, own to once a week.</li>
            <li>The tray system was easy to use and very simple.</li>
            <li>The LED light requires that you remove the batteries first as the batteries have a plastic piece in between them that needs to be removed prior to use.</li>
            <li>So I was very cautious when it came to my teeth becoming yellow.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive teeth, this did not bother my teeth at all.</li>
            <li>It is really easy to use and makes for lasting results.</li>
            <li>My teeth aren&#x27;t super sensitive</li>
            <li>love this product, because it gives you fast results, lasts for months and months, and doesn&#x27;t take a long time to use every day.</li>
            <li>For so long I have wanted to try a product that works well and effectively and does not make my teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li>really thought I was doomed because I don&#x27;t have the money or time to go get my teeth professionally whitened, but this product really does the job right at home!</li>
            <li>The kit is very easy to use and the price is very affordable, compared to other products.</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited to finally rid myself of my stained smile, but sadly the reviews were too good to be true.</li>
            <li>I mean really, a nice smile is one of the first things you notice on a person and living in an image-based society</li>
            <li>This whitening kit is simple to use and the instructions are pretty straightforward.</li>
            <li>Decided to try it because of the good reviews and it really made my teeth less sensitive and so much whiter that</li>
            <li>While many of these products and services have worked pretty well at whitening my teeth they have either been too abrasive for my gums and teeth leaving them super sensitive to cold and/or warm foods and drinks and have been pretty pricey.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It only takes up a few minutes of my day which is great</li>
            <li>The results were much better than I expected and much quicker than I anticipated.  </li>
            <li>Its really an amazing result i found by using it few days.  </li>
            <li>The reviews looked promising for the Shine Whitening - Zero Peroxide product, so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it helps to speed up the whole whitening process.</li>
            <li>However, with Shine Whitening I did not have much of an issue with that as well as my teeth are whiter than before.</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t like the after effect of tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li>Thanks xoxo</li>
            <li>An absolute life saver.</li>
            <li>It is the easiest to use and I feel so much safer &amp;#34;not&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Thanks to Shine Whitening</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not bothered with brushing my teeth each time after I had my coffee, can simply relax and enjoy the life.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very troublesome and they should fix it.</li>
            <li>For my teeth I have been trying a lot of product calling themselves \\&quot; fast results and safe\\</li>
            <li>It was much cheaper than going to the dentist to get them whitened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>teeth whiteners really work?  </li>
            <li>Eevery whitening treatment I had tried before this one caused so much sensitivity that I could use it without immediately feeling some sort of pain.</li>
            <li>I got all kinds of compliments about how much whiter my teeth were.</li>
            <li>You really get results with this one.</li>
            <li>I was a hesistant to laugh out loud.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>My teeth are much whiter than before.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend Shine Whitening!</li>
            <li>and it really has boosted my confidence.</li>
            <li>so I really couldn&#x27;t see if it worked</li>
            <li>I controlled the amount of substance so it was gentle on my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I put a bead of the solution in the trays, put them in my mouth with the included light, and left it all in my mouth for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>then I used this product must say it worked really well</li>
            <li>Thanks Shine Whitening.</li>
            <li>I really wish I didn&#x27;t buy this product now.</li>
            <li>Thanks for saving my photo day.</li>
            <li>my teeth are so much whiter than before</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if people are getting paid to post all these 5 stars but this stuff absolutely does not work.</li>
            <li>Aside from not working it is very time consuming.</li>
            <li>So I did not feel much difference and it could be done conveniently from home.</li>
            <li>And what do you know you really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Stop buying the cheap whiteners that you see at the grocery store and actually invest in a quality product.</li>
            <li>Smiling made me self-conscious and I wanted to get something that really worked without costing an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li>This product really works.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Shine Whitening.</li>
            <li>and I’m ready to eat all the chocolate cake at the bakery I work at.</li>
            <li>I question the quality of the product when the user information has so many inconsistencies.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t taste like sunshine and rainbows, but even this is much preferable to some of the gag-inducing tastes of others I have tried.</li>
            <li>This whole product is fishy.</li>
            <li>my teeth really began to spring out and catch people’s eyes.</li>
            <li>The LED light stopped working only after using it 4 times, I have asked for replacement.</li>
            <li>Thanks Shine zero.</li>
            <li>I started my research on teeth whitening products and stumbled upon this after amazon recommended it with its high rating I took a chance and behold Im here to say that it worked no pain and all of the gain!</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t have much plaque in them</li>
            <li>and I have always been so self conscious of my smile.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for a week and already my teeth are much brighter.</li>
            <li>Can not beat the cost either, very affordable.</li>
            <li>I did the whole process while watching a show and folding laundry</li>
            <li>There is also a UV light that comes with it- for extra whitening.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really enjoy having white teeth.</li>
            <li>It really boost my confidence.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy using it--very simple.</li>
            <li>but really it seems like they did a miracle,&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am one of those people and this product worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>one of the mouth guards formed to fit the upper teeth.</li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t really tell any difference.</li>
            <li>And wow, not only was there no chemical taste, but it did not hurt for me to remove it like most.</li>
            <li>When I found this product, I liked that it was made of botanical ingredients as opposed to really harsh chemicals that could be harmful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d say the results from this kit are more similar to professional whitening than crest strips.</li>
            <li>With this product I can smile everyday:-)</li>
            <li>I was able to obtain results similar to professional</li>
            <li>Definitely suitable for people with sensitive teeth and gums, and of course your teeth can finally return to their natural pearly state!</li>
            <li>My teeth isn’t so sensitive, but it has some discolorations, so what do I have to lose, right?  </li>
            <li>I used to have a bunch of coffee stains and other light stains on the surface of my teeth which caused me never to smile showing my teeth.</li>
            <li>I tried Shine Whitening three months ago and having bought many other brands will be sticking with this one.</li>
            <li>Tray system works so well, they should implement it in many other whitening solutions.</li>
            <li>Only making my smile nicer!</li>
            <li>I was really satisfied with this product and before this i have used some other products</li>
            <li>Tray system is better than other systems out there.</li>
            <li>I think it works better than other systems</li>
            <li>It works and it’s a better system than some other products I’ve seen on the market.</li>
            <li>so glad I did, based on the other amazon reviews here.</li>
            <li>Guys I have verified these reviews are from the same time period, posted by many accounts with no other reviews.</li>
            <li>There have been so many problems that I&#x27;ve had with other toothpastes.  </li>
            <li>but they were a reddish color and with this treatment they changed to a healthy pink!</li>
            <li>The LED light component was honestly super cool - and on par with professional whitening centers I&#x27;ve visited in the past.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Suggestion: make sure to be VERY careful when forming the trays.  </li>
            <li>My teeth have never looked so clean and white.</li>
            <li>The water was too hot apparently (I&#x27;ve been using sports guards for years and always used hot microwave water) and I ended up melting them.  </li>
            <li>After about 10 days my smile was resilient and a strong brilliance of only white.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this and the price is very affordable.</li>
            <li>I use it a couple times a week and the results so far have been very promising.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a ton of different companies and a bunch of home remedies for my old stained teeth, who would have thought it would have just been as easy as this.</li>
            <li>My teeth are pretty sensitive from eating lots of lemonade and lime from drinking tequila.</li>
            <li>So I made a mess of the trays, but they were still good enough to be used.</li>
            <li>I slowed it down to once a week because I feel like I didn’t need so many sessions</li>
            <li>You will most likely see your results in just a few days and smile with confidence again!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different teeth white one products.</li>
            <li>In addition,  most of the products I have used were more expensive than this one.</li>
            <li>but I love to whiten to remove the surface stains from my daily coffee, occasional Diet Coke and wine.  </li>
            <li>My smile has really improved since starting to use Shine Whitening.</li>
            <li>We’ve gone back many years and so for him to notice such a thing it must be working out on me.</li>
            <li>so I got braces as I got older.</li>
            <li>This has been such a boost to me personally as someone who has struggled with the way that my teeth look for most of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am on my second order and I have received so many complements on how white my teeth are.</li>
            <li>No one wants a yellow smile.</li>
            <li>I noticed decent results in 2.5 weeks and no teeth tingling.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the strips from the top name brand toothpastes, and those always worked for a very short time, but this one seems to last a lot longer.  </li>
            <li>It works really quickly, and my teeth are definitely several shades whiter than before.</li>
            <li>at least now I know what to use to keep my smile healthy.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth, so I really looked forward to this product.</li>
            <li>As someone who had braces for years, my teeth are very sensitive!</li>
            <li>One thing that bothers me most when I think about whitening my teeth is the fact that I would have to go to the dentist and go through all that discomfort apart from paying so much for a whitening that often does not last as long</li>
            <li>The little blue &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; device is comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>highly recommend Shine Whitening.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it to anybody looking to whiten their teeth.</li>
            <li>(I did 5 min on high power in an 1100w microwave).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I will highly reccomend these</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li>And I highly recommend you try this product for teeth whitening.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Between groups of them being done on the exact same date with either a very short one sentence comment or weak attempt at being more elaborate (while still writing similar salesmen like narratives)and not ONE person has an issue with this product - but they ALL sound like infomercial testimonials or are auditioning to be a QVC host.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a handful of other ones and this one has been by far the most convenient.</li>
            <li>and I guess in addition to becoming a little older, my enamel is burning off my teeth thanks to all the coffee.</li>
            <li>My teeth are always sensitive!!</li>
            <li>This was easy to use, extremely helpful</li>
            <li>At first I was a little overwhelmed when I saw it came with an LED light and all.</li>
            <li>The trays are easy to use, and the whitening gel stays put and does not leak into the rest of your mouth, which other products tend to do.</li>
            <li>My teeth are super white, with all the residue from coffee and cigarettes completely gone!  </li>
            <li>My teeth are super white, with all the residue from coffee and cigarettes completely gone!</li>
            <li>In a few days my teeth were great, back to normal, actually whiter than before.</li>
            <li>And really, you can&#x27;t beat the price when you think about how much professional teeth whitening services cost.</li>
            <li>I feel frustrated to smile on people because of my yellow teeth, Now I am very happy with Shine Whitening.</li>
            <li>Ever since I was a teenager I have always been obsessed with having a great white smile.</li>
            <li>As a college student who drinks lots of coffee, which causes stains, as well as a former smoker, I can&#x27;t tell you what a relief it is to have the smile I&#x27;ve wanted for the longest.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t messy at all, and I never worry that I&#x27;m putting harmful toxins in my body; I know this product is safe and high-quality, made with my health in mind.</li>
            <li>I no longer feel self conscious about smiling or guilty for having my favorite iced coffee :)</li>
            <li>Because after a few days of using this product my teeth look better than they have in years.</li>
            <li>Got the product last weekend and was pretty surprised by how fast it worked!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update after a few more.</li>
            <li>Or maybe I just have more confidence now that my teeth are a few shades whiter.</li>
            <li>I started to use Shine Whitening and after just a few treatments I was smiling a lot more.</li>
            <li>I need my breath to be fresh and my teeth to be white.</li>
            <li>I recently quit smoking and like most long time smokers my teeth were not the brightest.</li>
            <li>So, for anyone looking to whiten up their smile, I would definitely recommend this</li>
            <li>sensitive gums after, saw results after a few application, and easy to use!</li>
            <li>For some reason this solution in this mouth tray system (which is fine, in my opinion), does not affect my teeth the way other brands do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the best part about the Shine Whitening-Zero Peroxide Teeth Whitening System is that my teeth don&#x27;t get that dreadful tingly feeling that is often associated with so many other teeth whitening products, which is extremely important because my teeth are really sensitive.</li>
            <li>Always looking for new products in this category because I really cannot afford professional whitening at the dentist.</li>
            <li>I found this product easy to use and really made my teeth whiter in just few days of using it.</li>
            <li>I starter using it right from the next day and</li>
            <li>kit comes with everything you need, and instructions are provided that explain how to use the LED light and other materials.</li>
            <li>Could just be my new toothpaste too.</li>
            <li>This whitener really helped for me, as after using a different whitener for about 10 days, my teeth started to be really irritated by this.</li>
            <li>It took a few times to get to the desired whiteness I wanted, but overall effective product.</li>
            <li>It does not spread the light evenly across your teeth and has left me with a streak on my front upper 2 teeth that is whiter than the rest of those teeth.</li>
            <li>I am glad because I now enjoy seeing myself in the mirror or casually on video.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a major difference after one day of use, my teeth are much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all the major toothpastes promising to whiten my teeth to no effect.</li>
            <li>Considering I have very sensitive gums and teeth, I loathed whitening my teeth.</li>
            <li>and then I was also worried about how it would affect me since I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>The whitening solution works very fast actually.</li>
            <li>But my teeth were very sensitive to this</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth and thankfully Shine</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve realized when I had braces that my teeth are very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I am mainly writing this as I have failed using several products and finally reached a good genuine product.</li>
            <li>I knew they could be whiter, giving me a brighter smile, but its hard to keep them at a healthy white.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a long time since my smile started to fade, and I&#x27;ve been looking for something I can use at home to make them shine again.</li>
            <li>I did it for about a month, consistently, and my teeth are white and people have noticed.</li>
            <li>But, as an avid coffee drinker and years of smoking (I have since quit), my teeth are not as white as they used to be.&lt;br</li>
            <li>speeds up the whitening process and makes me feel like a professional at home!</li>
            <li>I drink a lot of coffee and red wine and my teeth are usually pretty stained.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Others close to me have even commented on my smile, and for the first time in a long time I&#x27;m not embarrassed to open my mouth.</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>I looked at &amp;#34;other reviews&amp;#34; of about 20 reviewers and EVERY ONE of them also gave 5 starts to something called &#x27;Omegaboost&#x27; and many other of the same products.  </li>
            <li>You have to use it consistently for a week or two, but you will definitely notice results.</li>
            <li>They are all posted in the same time frame, which is pretty sketchy....</li>
            <li>This teeth whitening made my teeth look so pretty and white after a couple of weeks of using it.</li>
            <li>I love this kit because it quite different from any other whitening kit .</li>
            <li>I basically had zero dental care as a child and the results are pretty obvious.</li>
            <li>The mouth tray system is easy to use and I like to taste a little bit of mint from the gel in my mouth.</li>
            <li>These social media sites really know how to make someone feel self conscious!</li>
            <li>I feel like some sort of bizarre electronic detective with these things, looking at review dates and saying odd things to myself like &amp;</li>
            <li>It’s easy and not a lot of trouble for a boatload of benefits.</li>
            <li>It surprises me that this product that doesn&#x27;t use anything harsh and is extremely easy to work with.</li>
            <li>I seriously love these, I had some dark teeth as I used to be a smoker so my teeth weren&#x27;t all that white.</li>
            <li>This method is not only fast, but it&#x27;s pretty simple and clean as opposed to other methods.</li>
            <li>kit also includes a LED whitening light, which cuts down considerably on the time the process takes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Way better then spending hundreds on zoom white or other things from the dentist!</li>
            <li>My teeth shade isn&#x27;t super different after several attempts with this product.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no more yellow spotting on my teeth, people compliment on how white they are, and I even smile more</li>
            <li>It really was, after the first use I could see a difference that I hadn&#x27;t seen with the other products I used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little cumbersome to stuff so much in your mouth at once, but it&#x27;s worth it, if it works.</li>
            <li>Also doesn&#x27;t make my teeth super sensitive like some other brands.</li>
            <li>Especially compared to these other super expensive brands out there that do not work as great as this one.</li>
            <li>Most of the gel is wasted falling out of your mouth if you try to balance the light on the trays -- and you truly better just stand over the sink for 15 minutes because the amount of drool escaping your mouth is truly that bad.  </li>
            <li>Looks like I don&#x27;t have to be embarrassed of my old yellow teeth anymore thanks to Shine Whitening.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and trying to find a whitening product that doesn&#x27;t cause me pain and actually works has been a real challenge.</li>
            <li>I do use mine with clear trays I got years ago from my orthodontist.</li>
            <li>I have used a professional teeth whitening system from the dentist before and that was when I was 20</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>Lastly I like how its uses trays and that helps to get your whole mouth whiten.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with the results.</li>
            <li>and i told him my teeth were getting sensitive</li>
            <li>My teeth have never been whiter and I am so pleasantly surprised that they arent sensitive one bit.  </li>
            <li>So far, my gums and teeth have had no irritation at all.</li>
            <li>I am a professional networker and attend a lot of business mixers.</li>
            <li>As a busy executive I can take my Shine Whitening kit on business trips and use conveniently when at home.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural style tooth whitener and looked on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Assume they either sent me a defective light, or one with dead batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The packaging makes me giggle because it&#x27;s so old school and 80&#x27;s looking.</li>
            <li>I have always wanted to get my teeth whitened professionally</li>
            <li>My husband has a sensitive mouth.</li>
            <li>I had a professional whitening kit from my dentist</li>
            <li>Far cheaper than Crest Whitestrips 3D or the Zoom whitening.</li>
            <li>There is a second gel for gentle teeth.</li>
            <li>I still went ahead with the whitening process, but when I got to the LED light it was dead.</li>
            <li>but my teeth are too sensitive.  </li>
            <li>My teeth and gums are a bit sensitive</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not only gentle</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Studies have shown that natural aging can also discolor teeth.  </li>
            <li>has all natural ingrediants.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>After testing this product EXACTLY as instructed on the package, my teeth were whiter and not sensitive AT ALL.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t see results until my second time using the kit.  </li>
            <li>I use a tooth whitening product along with this one because I have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>The real color of our enamel is actually yellowish.</li>
            <li>My confidence is up and people have noticed that my teeth are whiter, or at least that I’m smiling a lot more often.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using the product a few times a week</li>
            <li>I even use toothpaste for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Considering my age and my smoking and coffee habits, I don&#x27;t think I can achieve the pearly whites of a movie star, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results I have had so far.</li>
            <li>With a baby on the way I couldn&#x27;t afford to pay the price of professional teeth whitening.  </li>
            <li>I can’t really say anything else except that the product definitely worked for me</li>
            <li>It brightens your teeth after just one use, but mine are still mildly sensitive afterwards.</li>
            <li>I have some sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>The gel did not make my teeth sensitive by any means.</li>
            <li>I tried an at-home tooth whitening system before, but it left me in absolute agony from the peroxide.</li>
            <li>I tried some of the big brand name whitening systems, but they hurt my teeth too much to continue using them.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>It is made of botanical products which means it&#x27;s completely natural.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are sensitive and this takes care of them without pain.</li>
            <li>I drink so much coffee daily that I started seeing my teeth loosing the brightness</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve bought the crest whitening strips but the fall off and tried the old school Rembrandt trays</li>
            <li>I could not afford a professional cleaning, so I gave this a try instead.</li>
            <li>This product is very helpful to give you the white teeth you always wanted.</li>
            <li>My teeth were always straight, but they were just yellow.  </li>
            <li>The cost of the dentist constantly whitening my teeth started to become a real burden.</li>
            <li>I can truly say Shine Whitening works just as well as professional whitening.</li>
            <li>Its up to and how sensitive your teeth are.</li>
            <li>and I am amazed that I am seeing results so early in the process.</li>
            <li>Shine Whitening works just as well as professional</li>
            <li>Maybe I lost too much enamel by drinking sodas when I was a teen.</li>
            <li>So far I have used it twice</li>
            <li>My teeth are usually sensitive when I use whitener, but because it doesn&#x27;t have peroxide I have not had issues.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t brush my teeth very often as a kid &amp; started regularly smoking cigarettes &amp; drinking coffee at the age of 16.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>By the end of my tenure at school my teeth looked like an old man’s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is a gel for people with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I had no issues with the sensitivity and my teeth are considerably whiter than when I started.</li>
            <li>I have always been self conscious about my teeth.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a professional-grade whitening gel without peroxide, that after ten uses, really DOES whiten.  </li>
            <li>Looking for white teeth fast?</li>
            <li>My teeth can be sensitive and I felt no discomfort while using it.</li>
            <li>and i was completely fed up.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully I found this product, it doesn&#x27;t have peroxide which I believe was the reasoning of making my teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li>I love drinking a couple of cups of coffee in the morning, but even worse for my teeth is my love of green tea.</li>
            <li>I have a not-so-perfect smile, and the tray didn&#x27;t fit well, so that is my only complaint.</li>
            <li>I’ve done a few off-Broadway plays as an actress, and the last thing I need is to have my teeth stand out more than my performance.  </li>
            <li>Accurately followed the directions, even tried applying the gel with a Q-tip as some other reviewer had suggested(!), but this product gave no visible results.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and my teeth look so much whiter than they had with other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>The only thing I was really worried about was my teeth becoming overly sensitive for the next few weeks.</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical at first, but I see great improvement, so I recommend it.</li>
            <li>You know that when other people start complimenting you on your smile that something has changed.</li>
            <li>Since using Shine Whitening  about a month ago, I’ve caught so many ridiculous compliments</li>
            <li>Now with that being said, this is more work compared to the crest white strips I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>What I love the most is that it&#x27;s quick and  the zero-peroxide formula guarantees no sensitivity on your gums or teeth and that is contains ingredients made in the USA it doesn&#x27;t have any foreign crap</li>
            <li>However, being a high school teacher has led me to an increased coffee habit and the occasional relaxation cigarette....and this led to yellowing teeth.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this whitening system to anyone dealing with yellow or discolored teeth.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product as the price and the quality is well above my standards!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product - especially if you suffer from teeth sensitivity like I do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for a new product to try and this one caught my eye due to all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I am so grateful for Shine Whitening because it costs much less than comparable brands, but the difference is very real!</li>
            <li>after just one week my teeth were already showing major improvement!</li>
            <li>This one is a keeper - the kit is easy to use and definitely whitens the teeth without harsh, nasty-tasting peroxide.</li>
            <li>, I work hard to reduce the discoloration, and I&#x27;ve spent my fair share on products that simply do not make a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>Light was defective, opened the packaging and the small directions that came with</li>
            <li>I am really regretting I went so long without keeping up the color of my teeth</li>
            <li>(seeing as how I tend to get into long winded stories in real life ..</li>
            <li>and it was not easy to complete the process adequately.</li>
            <li>You get 2 syringes of tooth whitener, a little blue LED light, and a tooth shade chart.</li>
            <li>Only a handful of treatments before my teeth looked like new.</li>
            <li>The day was approaching fast and my teeth were as yellow as the freshest lemon at market.</li>
            <li>Simply take a few moments and follow the directions to mold the teeth trays to your teeth for a custom fit that will ensure the whitening gel stays where it is supposed to</li>
            <li>I would smile a lot less because I never wanted to show off my teeth.</li>
            <li>Yellow teeth used to really hold back my self esteem.</li>
            <li>I tried tooth strips as well, and those seemed to work a shade or two, but this is about the same price as a package of those strips and at least for me, works a lot better.</li>
            <li>and I left them in the hot water too long and the trays became unmanageable</li>
            <li>When I went for the second one, the reheated water in the mug completely deformed the tray!</li>
            <li>I noticed a major difference</li>
            <li>But it works, and no other store-bought product could substitute.  </li>
            <li>Preparing for a job interview I put on my white shirt and to my dismay my teeth looked so yellow and as the first impression is key</li>
            <li>But it works, and no other store-bought product could substitute.</li>
            <li>Using this product was painless, and I would definitely recommend it to anybody with sensitive teeth who can&#x27;t afford a trip to the dentist!</li>
            <li>The whitening is not very aggressive so it takes longer than some of the other products available.</li>
            <li>considering that I lead a pretty hectic and active</li>
            <li>The system was easy to use and gentle on my poor teeth, and three weeks later my teeth are noticeably whiter and brighter.</li>
            <li>You do have to do a little work up top but other than that, you do need to run it under some hot water and then bite down to make a mark.</li>
            <li>There was just a little work up top to chomp down on the piece of plastic to mold into your teeth.</li>
            <li>I have always brushed my teeth with a whitening tooth paste at least twice a day, but noticed that my teeth were becoming a shade of gray.</li>
            <li>As someone who drinks an excessive amount of coffee and smokes a lot of cigarettes, this whitening system cleared up the yellow in my teeth pretty fast.</li>
            <li>(I alternate it with natural toothpaste)</li>
            <li>I tried over the counter products such as various mouth washes and toothpastes and they helped to an extent but didn&#x27;t really get them as white as I wanted them to be.</li>
            <li>As an extra added plus it was also cheaper then going to get them done professionally.</li>
            <li>But after extended use this product barely whitened my teeth.</li>
            <li>Without spending hundreds of dollars, my teeth were visibly whitened similar to the professional job I had done years ago.  </li>
            <li>But with the tray system here, Shine Whitening has me as a customer for the near future.</li>
            <li>so I definitely needed a product for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I started an early job last year</li>
            <li>so be careful not to put too much of the solution in the trays.</li>
            <li>After that time the tray feels soft enough to place on your teeth to mold to your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for something to whiten my teeth with but with a low peroxide dosage as my teeth and gums are quite sensitive.</li>
            <li>It completely removes all stains from my teeth, and makes them so white I can almost not believe it!</li>
            <li>Especially if you have sensitive teeth, because that’s what it’s for, lots of products don’t include this sort of thing.</li>
            <li>I often feel self conscious in public because of my stained teeth, so after searching online I decided to try this affordable product.</li>
            <li>and wow, I didn&#x27;t realize how yellow they were.  </li>
            <li>As stated, it won&#x27;t make your gums red and teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li>I used it once so far and the product is definitely as described.</li>
            <li>I just couldn&#x27;t take the taste and still left my teeth sensitive.  </li>
            <li>All kind a silly.</li>
            <li>But most of the products out there contain peroxide or other chemicals that make them more painful than they are worth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Since I have very sensitive teeth, I usually would go to the dentist, but I figured I would try this whitening system out first.</li>
            <li>Super shady.</li>
            <li>Other than that I really like it</li>
            <li>It also works much faster than some of the other ones I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>My teeth are sparkling and my smile is contagious so it is a little bit of a public service for everyone in my area.</li>
            <li>Not a single one shows &amp;#34;Verified Purchase&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to open your eyes to what is going on here and how this company is trying to fool you with 40 fake reviews about how amazing this is.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical in the beginning after looking at the website and noticing that most of the website is not functioning properly, and the only thing that really works is a YouTube video that demonstrates a generic teeth molding tray.</li>
            <li>and one of his biggest complaints (especially the one from the dentist&#x27;s office) was that it made his teeth extremely sensitive (and he swears it doesn&#x27;t actually whiten but just strips his teeth enamel).</li>
            <li>The instructions tell you to be careful and not leave the trays in hot water for too long</li>
            <li>I started using Shine Whitening a few months ago, and have finally seen success at work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started using this product a few weeks ago and after only a handful of treatments I am sporting a whiter smile and a friendlier face.</li>
            <li>My teeth have gotten yellow from drinking a lot of coffee as I am a major addict</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend these trays over all other ones I have tried!</li>
            <li>I monitored my teeth daily and there was an initial gradual whitening of my teeth that turned to a marked improvement in my teeth color in a very short time.  </li>
            <li>After using this product for a few weeks I saw a very noticeable improvement!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an avid caffeine drinker  and the yellowing of our teeth accumulates everyday.</li>
            <li>You place a small amount of the whitening gel from the syringe in the trays on the side of your teeth that show when you smile.  </li>
            <li>No problem, it’s a small price to pay for a shining smile.</li>
            <li>When I first start using it a few times I saw a difference in my teeth .</li>
            <li>My dentist told me my teeth were getting a little yellow because of age, but this product has brought the white back into my smile.  </li>
            <li>My friends were able to notice the dramatic difference in how my teeth were before (yellow) and now!</li>
            <li>and I was never able to get it to work right after that.</li>
            <li>Ive bee through the trays , the gels, the paste, some are messier than others, some can create a huge sensitivity to cold and/or hot things that you consume.</li>
            <li>Also I&#x27;ve had lots of stains on my teeth from drinking way too much wine and smoking cigarettes for half my life.</li>
            <li>With Shine Whitening it is a much easier process with much less time and no time captivated in a dental chair.</li>
            <li>Its definitely awkward to have the UV light hanging out of your mouth for 15 minutes, but my teeth like shades whiter even after one use!!</li>
            <li>The crest white strips are easier, but they left my teeth feeling so thin and super sensitive!</li>
            <li>This is super important for me as every other teeth whitening product or mouthwash that I&#x27;ve used has caused slight to mildly irritating sensations.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never before had a product work with this much ease and efficiency, and I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has tried every alternative out there with little results or a crippled wallet.</li>
            <li>so I always had a hard time keeping my smile very white.  </li>
            <li>I use the mouth trays and some of my friends have also complained about having problems with other systems that don’t have such an easy to use protocol.</li>
            <li>The added fact that it is zero-peroxide provides much relief that it doesn&#x27;t hurt my teeth or affect them in a negative way and make them too sensitive.</li>

            <li> As always, my words and my opinions are 100% my very own.</li>
            <li> Very good product... 5 stars for sure!</li>
            <li> , my honest opinion is that this is a very good product for those of you like me who want to have whiter, brighter teeth without the damaging effects of peroxide.</li>
            <li> It took about 2 to see results and they were amazing!</li>
            <li> It was amazing!</li>
            <li> Thank you for an amazing product!</li>
            <li> My teeth have looked better than ever, probably the best they ever have.</li>
            <li> But most of all, it&#x27;s awesome because of how well it works!  </li>
            <li> They worked marvelous, I couldnt ask for anything that could of worked better.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s some kind of coincidence!  </li>
            <li> its really remarkable product...</li>
            <li> But most of all, it&#x27;s awesome because of how well it works!</li>
            <li> It is easily the best in this product class.</li>
            <li> Best and most effective way to whiten teeth.</li>
            <li> Until I welcome this amazing product into my life.</li>
            <li> They are so bright it’s noticeable to everyone.  </li>
            <li> Another wonderful feature of this product is whitening LED light which carries the process of whitening the teeth rapidly.</li>
            <li> My good friend recommended Shine Whitening because they knew of my sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li> It works just as good as the $100+</li>
            <li> The trays are also fairly flexible.</li>
            <li> This whitener is a good deal and it worked well on his teeth.</li>
            <li> The tray system is good and might take some work</li>
            <li> but it is good for you in the end.</li>
            <li> Need to whiten teeth, looked on amazon for a good product.</li>
            <li> and so I came on here to look for good reviews since I can&#x27;t break the bank on this one.</li>
            <li> and I am here to add to the good ones.</li>
            <li> My daughter had good results with this, she had no complaints and no sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Completely loved this.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> They can&#x27;t be good for your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I went home and took it out of the box, then read the instructions and stuck the mouth tray into my mouth, forming a fit that fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is part of looking good every day.</li>
            <li> The price is good too.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good system to help whiten my teeth after I got braces removed.</li>
            <li> I’ve had good experiences with this product.</li>
            <li> and I get good results.</li>
            <li> This is a good deal for you.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> But Shine zero does a good job of not hurting me.</li>
            <li> that I know that it looks so good.</li>
            <li> but this product is doing a good job reversing the damage.</li>
            <li> and I think the tray stuff is a good look for this product.</li>
            <li> People at work are commenting about my teeth in a good way.</li>
            <li> It is fascinating to see how whoever is selling this product broke through Amazon&#x27;s review filters and is infiltrating the site with spiked review columns.  </li>
            <li> It was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I then went to amazon to see if there were any helpful Q&amp;A and realized that all the good reviews are faked...</li>
            <li> I used it for about a week beforehand and it looked good in the mirror</li>
            <li> Good deal for the price.  </li>
            <li> and they told me how good it made me look.</li>
            <li> Good system here.</li>
            <li> My teeth are looking really good.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for those who do not want to use peroxide.</li>
            <li> best part, to me, is the fact that it is peroxide free.</li>
            <li> The best feature about this product is the inclusion of the LED light.</li>
            <li> But atlast i find a good way that is Shine-Whitening zero peroxide teeth.  </li>
            <li> So take it from me if you want to see a remarkable improvement that will illuminate you smile and attitude, try Shine Whitening, you will surely be as impressed with the product as I have been.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with what I got done, so that’s cool.</li>
            <li> The instructions are great and this is so easy to use!  </li>
            <li> I never tried teeth whitening cream before, but I&#x27;m very glad that I have.</li>
            <li> I am very on top of my oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> All in all, I am very pleased with Shine Whitening and will use it again.</li>
            <li> The great thing about this product is it has zero peroxide, so I can use it safely.  </li>

            <li> and I was very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Very glad to have tried it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased and will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, and most importantly, my gums were not irritated!!!  </li>

            <li> A friend of mine recommended this product to me and boy am I glad she did!  </li>
            <li> Love this though and will order again!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> As a front desk associate at work, I always have to wear a wonderful smile to keep clients comfortable and happy.</li>
            <li> After using Shine Whitening for about a week, I started to notice that my teeth were looking so much better!</li>
            <li> I dont think a whitening method can get any better than this!</li>
            <li> This has been the most effective whitening product I have encountered!</li>
            <li> Love this item!</li>
            <li> Which led me onto Amazon to see where I could get him more, and here I am !</li>
            <li> So Ive tried so many products for teeth whitening !</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> so I am wondering if they are even touching my teeth!</li>
            <li> My teeth are progressively getting whiter and whiter every day, and my confidence is getting better as well!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s really easy to use and apply, effect is great, I do drink a lot of coffee</li>
            <li> Found the system easy to use and everything is great.</li>
            <li> And this one is certainly one of the best products out there.  </li>
            <li> I brought this product a week ago and ever since I tried it, it&#x27;s  been amazing.</li>
            <li> but this works amazing.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel fantastic and look great.</li>
            <li> It has amazing reviews, but I am a skeptic at heart.</li>
            <li> It’s amazing this kind of technology exists.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t prepared to spend the kind of money it takes to get whitening done at a dentist&#x27;s office and my dental insurance doesn&#x27;t cover whitening.</li>
            <li> Their website also gives a tutorial, which is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> After a couple weeks I began to notice a nice difference.</li>
            <li> This is just as good and arguably better than a dentist cleaning.</li>
            <li> It is really effective.</li>
            <li> They look kind of yellow-y</li>
            <li> Loving it.</li>
            <li> It conforms to your own mouth</li>
            <li> I am astounded by how effective it has been.</li>
            <li> but that was my own fault.</li>
            <li> I received this product for testing purposes with a commitment to post an honest product review.  </li>
            <li> I received this product in return for an honest review.</li>

            <li> I also can&#x27;t get the infra light device to fit in my mouth with the trays as they have a flip which prevents the light device from staying in your month.</li>
            <li> I am a huge coffee drinker and then I started noticing that yellowish stain teeth; I knew I had to do something.</li>
            <li> I also like how this product as a LED light</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I did not experience any sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I like the LED light that comes with too because they do that at the dental office.</li>
            <li> The tray fit my mouth well</li>
            <li> Great product, and must for those that want truly white teeth.</li>
            <li> just at the direction explained 2x a day for 15 minutes with the light.  </li>
            <li> The trays are also extremely comfortable; its as if they were molded for my teeth</li>
            <li> Put they trays in and use the light to help accelerate the process.  </li>
            <li> It consists of trays that conform to your mouth to form a custom and snug fit.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because it claimed to be the same/similar process to the light trays used at the facility in the mall, and it claimed to not irritate gums like Crest.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My life is filled with all kinds of things that stain teeth.</li>
            <li> I’m  confident now to smile every time.</li>
            <li> With this product you will mold trays for your teeth, put whitening gel inside the tray, insert the trays in the mouth, and then put the LED light in the mouth.</li>
            <li> so it makes it comfortable to use</li>
            <li> Enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I can somewhat control salivation.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know how to operate the light, it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Place them in your mouth and insert the light resting them against your trays for 15 minutes twice a day.  </li>
            <li> You stick the trays in your mouth to make them fit, then you continue to use them maybe two times a week</li>
            <li> and I’m really happy it has a second gel</li>
            <li> The tray system is made to fit in your mouth, so you should use it, because it was made for everyone’s mouth.</li>
            <li> My light did not even work.</li>
            <li> so I still had her light.</li>
            <li> but none as cheap.</li>
            <li> Seriously, don&#x27;t cheap out and buy the whitening strips instead.</li>
            <li> They are white and my lipstick looks great against my teeth.</li>
            <li> It is a great product and a solid, inexpensive alternative to the dentist&#x27;s chair.  </li>
            <li> I followed the detailed instructions on Shine Whitening</li>
            <li> The package includes a ultraviolet light, which you are instructed to use with the product.</li>
            <li> Enjoying my whiter smile.</li>
            <li> I want those I meet and greet to feel comfortable talking to me.</li>
            <li> It’s comfortable and my teeth are whiter.</li>
            <li> as doing the trays for the teeth and trying to get the light to stay in your mouth, as well as all the saliva build up for 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy that result and this product is to thank.</li>
            <li> In any case, teeth whitening has primarily been my husband&#x27;s thing ..</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s fun to watch him do the gel and light and stuff !</li>
            <li> Bizarre.</li>
            <li> in all, the gel with a light did whiten my teeth .  </li>
            <li> I used the product for 30 minutes each session as I saw on YouTube for another product with light.  </li>
            <li> My teeth look great after ten applications.</li>
            <li> Crest White Strips are great, but I didn&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;shooting pain&amp;#34; feeling I would get with using them.</li>
            <li> The trays formed to my mouth comfortably.  </li>
            <li> the results were amazing and my teeth stains went off that fast.</li>
            <li> and I do enjoy using this product always.</li>
            <li> I ran across this product and what stood out was the retina case and led light .</li>
            <li> light never worked from day one.</li>
            <li> LED light does not work.</li>
            <li> It works great on teeth, especially for people who drink a lot of tea or coffee and have stains from that!</li>
            <li> , I always make sure that my smile is the brightest.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a huge coffee or wine drinker so for me, the change in my teeth color was really noticeable and did I mention, the TOTAL LACK OF teeth sensitivity was absolutely great!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable and insures even whitening.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was great to see how white my teeth could be.</li>
            <li> I have always taken pride in my white and perfect teeth (thanks to braces)</li>
            <li> These are my own personal honest and unbiased opinions*</li>
            <li> and I think the results I got were good enough that I didn’t want to risk doing it more.</li>
            <li> product is the perfect combination of being gentle enough to not cause sensitivity, but also to work efficiently.  </li>
            <li> I have used many other products to whiten my teeth, but this certain product is the that worked the best.</li>
            <li> I would be very conscious of my teeth, feelings as if I&#x27;ve ruined them with coffee and cigarettes and thats the first thing people see, you want to leave a great impression.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of products (many found right here on Amazon).  </li>
            <li> But hey, I am not complaining I am just excited about such great</li>
            <li> I could see a difference in the color of my teeth in the first application!!  </li>
            <li> While my teeth have been noticeably whiter to me, I think it’s the fact that I have a brighter smile and I am more willing to show them off that makes them better.</li>
            <li> I immediately saw results after the first use and after a couple more, my teeth are now whiter than they&#x27;re ever been...definitely recommend it if you struggle with the burden of having a stained smile :)</li>
            <li> It really works good very gentle on out teeth</li>
            <li> but I am pretty happy about the teeth thing, it doesn’t hurt or hurt my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> It is quick and easy to use, but without the peroxide.</li>
            <li> A beautiful smile requires a set of beatiful, white teeth, and this product gives just that.</li>
            <li> This is by far the most economical, comfortable, and effective teeth whitening product I have ever, ever found.</li>
            <li> The whitening system is good for those of us who have crooked teeth, the trays fit perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> It’s overall really good and an easy experience.</li>
            <li> This same light is even used at some professional whitening centers and that is why I am so impressed by this product.</li>
            <li> This product has helped me regain my confidence and my smile is here to stay!</li>
            <li> Shine Whitening can restore your beautiful white smile and gently with no sensitivity and pain which is important for healthy teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t notice a significant change</li>
            <li> It is worth the effort but stay committed to it once you start to see results!</li>
            <li> I have used this kit twice a day for the last 4 days, and there is a remarkable difference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I think that you&#x27;ll be pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li> A difference I can smile about!</li>
            <li> (it was a gift and if I could post from whoever brought it to the white elephant gift exchange I would), but I&#x27;m not a troll ! :p</li>
            <li> I wasn’t sure at first but, decided that I had nothing to lose.&lt;br</li>
            <li> unique experience with the professionalism of an orthodontist.</li>
            <li> Decide to give this product a try and am very pleased with the results so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for brighten my smile!</li>
            <li> and he said my enamel was thicker and stronger and guess what.......he complemented me on how BRIGHTER MY SMILE WAS!</li>
            <li> The tray included in the kit forms right to your teeth making the cleaning and brightening process more effective in whitening everything -not missing a spot.  </li>
            <li> I now have beautiful, white teeth and since I love to smile it really</li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t super comfortable.  </li>
            <li> That made me give up all my hope of having a natural bright smile again.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t have that squeaky clean feeling either.  </li>
            <li> I got my package in the mail, it kind of looked like a science project, but using the mouth trays with the LED lights really felt fun.</li>
            <li> and now I have a bright smile which I&#x27;ve always wanted without having to spend a bunch of money on getting it professionally done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stopped smoking for years now and drink significantly less coffee, yet still have not been able to find a successful, cost-effective way to whiten my teeth.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty easy to use, the trays are comfortable also.</li>
            <li> Like some of the other reviewers have said, this is a great deal if you are looking to get whitening done on the cheap.</li>
            <li> Shine Whitening was comfortable, easy to use, and definitely more affordable than the professional whitening my dentist</li>
            <li> The price is right and the product does the trick!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shine whitening is a real life saver for me and being able to get it shipped right to my mail box, right from Amazon, well, what&#x27;s not to love about that.</li>
            <li> Lots of people compliment on how bright and white my teeth are!</li>
            <li> Full steam ahead, order me another latte because Shine Zero is the wings beneath my bright, white teeth.</li>
            <li> I noticed my teeth were on there watt to being bright white</li>
            <li> I am also happy that this system has caused absolutely no discomfort or tooth</li>
            <li> The results were amazing, it&#x27;s totally changed my smile and has given me so much more confidence in myself.</li>
            <li> My smile is brighter and I am more willing to flash it to people now</li>
            <li> In about two weeks my teeth have passed from a yellowish color to a really bright white color.</li>
            <li> Amazon was good enough to send me another package.  </li>
            <li> I doubt any of these reviews are true.</li>
            <li> so I love how gentle</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own and potential customers can&#x27;t come to Amazon and expect HONEST reviews by REAL customers:</li>
            <li> The gel is cool and minty.</li>
            <li> There is an optional UV light for a brighter smile.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the tray system and my mouth and smile have been attracting onlookers</li>
            <li> Anyway, thanks to this product I feel better about myself a bit.</li>
            <li> and so far the results have been spectacular.</li>
            <li> Got this one after trying cheaper to mid price items thinking maybe if I invest in a good product that my results will change a bit.</li>
            <li> My breath even smells better, which I didn&#x27;t really expect.</li>
            <li> I recommend Shine whitening to anyone who wants more bang for their buck.</li>
            <li> and it’s about good enough to do one TM period.</li>
            <li> I love the LED light, totally speeds up the process and removed more stains and yellowing</li>
            <li> This product has accomplished that and more.</li>
            <li> I started using Brilliant a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> otherwise they become too droopy and this is certainly true.  </li>
            <li> and it’s not bad for the price either.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with easy to use trays and an LED light that, in my opinion, really speeds up the process.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I placed the order in Amazon and got the product delivered on right time and delivery was free.</li>
            <li> The instructions might scare you at first because it seems like a lot of steps, but this kit is beyond easy.</li>
            <li> You do not have to worry about boiling water, burning your hand off or placing hot trays in your mouth to form a mold, It is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> instructions were easy to follow and after the first try I saw results.</li>
            <li> Getting the right tray consistency is super important because that&#x27;s going to affect how the trays mold to your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Thank you to the maker of this product, you have given me a smile worth showing off!</li>
            <li> This works great and is even effective against long term, deep stains.</li>
            <li> A week later I bought a second package for my best friend.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well &amp; falls apart quickly.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best whitening product I have personally used.</li>
            <li> Luckily I have a tray from another product I tried and used that.</li>
            <li> It noticeable whitens your teeth with quick results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to get white teeth, no matter how many times I brush my teeth with those whitening tooth pastes.</li>
            <li> A great product for those looking for something natural and helps out with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I feel so much more confident about myself now that I have my pearly whites back.  </li>
            <li> Noticed this online here by accident, lucky.</li>
            <li> lucky</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re whitening your teeth, you want something that works quickly, but that doesn&#x27;t damage your teeth or make them sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference in how bright my smile is and how white my teeth</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and</li>
            <li> I am very happy with Shine, as it is able to provide whitening treatment that works without using irritating ingredients, all for a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s important to consistently  whiten our teeth.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions exactly and applied the tray with the light for 15 minutes on just my bottom teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable, and doesn&#x27;t take much time out of your day at all!  </li>
            <li> It’s only 15 minutes a day and real easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable, and doesn&#x27;t take much time out of your day at all!</li>
            <li> First of all, it is very economical as it saves you a lot of money and a trip to the dentist.</li>
            <li> Anyways, he was very excited when I brought home this from work (only he would get excited by this!)</li>
            <li> I think I will like the new product better.  </li>
            <li> The toothpaste also actually tastes pretty good</li>
            <li> I find the product very well priced and easy to use as well.</li>
            <li> It’s very efficient and when you use the tray system it makes it easy for you to apply the gel to your teeth.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty good but the trays are WAY too big for my mouth.</li>
            <li> I found this product easy to use and really made my teeth whiter.</li>
            <li> This whitener was easy to use and didn&#x27;t irritate my teeth too much.</li>
            <li> I loved Crest White strips when they first came out, but the pain and sensitivity</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a teeth whitening product that really works and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> The product nevertheless was ready to use with easy to follow instructions.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth with many issues.</li>
            <li> then it originally was when I first started to use the product.</li>
            <li> We’re getting married in two weeks!</li>
            <li> The LED light is something that I have never actually tried before on my own, but it really helps!</li>
            <li> Save your money and try this whitening product first and learn from my trials and errors!</li>
            <li> As an avid smoker and coffee drinker, I must say this is a necessity!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is actually a better product that comes with the better proportion of providing gentle enough treatment on to the tooth that will not cause sensitivity, but then it work tremendously.</li>
            <li> and I definitely recommend this product to everyone who wants some really cheap and works phenomenally!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing- easy on teeth and works extremely well.</li>
            <li> I can say that this is an awesome product for teeth whitening, previously i have so many other products</li>
            <li> /&gt;What&#x27;s great about this product is that it is easy to use, doesn&#x27;t take much time out of your day, it doesn&#x27;t make your teeth too sensitive like other products do, and it&#x27;s comfortable.</li>
            <li> The LED light makes the process so much easier and provides visibility while whitening.  </li>
            <li> Aside from it being reasonably priced, it is also peroxide free.</li>
            <li> I used the cheap teeth strips, but they didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always prided myself on my smile.  </li>
            <li> I also enjoyed the natural botanical ingredients.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste works great because it not only whitens my teeth but also protects it against being sensitive.  </li>
            <li> shine whitening has saved my smile.</li>
            <li> Now, i smile without thinking twice.</li>
            <li> Removing the coffee stains and improving my smile.</li>
            <li> I keep getting compliments on my smile.</li>
            <li> and I am veru upset and feel embarassed to smile or show my teeth.</li>
            <li> and I just happened to notice her transforming smile.</li>
            <li> No sensitivity felt, just a gleaning smile.</li>
            <li> No information on website worth any value</li>
            <li> I have a sparkling smile.</li>
            <li> I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and all opinions are based on my personal experience with the Shine Whitening-Zero Peroxide Teeth Whitening System.  </li>
            <li> I have been getting comments at work regarding my smile.</li>
            <li> and I can see a difference on my teeth and in my smile.</li>
            <li> That’s pretty cool.</li>
            <li> So I guess what I’m saying is that a whiter smile by maybe three or four degrees is the equivalent of losing 20 pounds.</li>
            <li> But my nervousness was unnecessary, because this kit is awesome!  </li>
            <li> Sometimes cheaper products aren’t as good as regular priced ones, but from what I can tell, this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Pretty cool if you ask me.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I have the most sensitive teeth -</li>
            <li> Nobody has ever commented on my smile or my teeth</li>
            <li> I feel fresh</li>
            <li> It wasn’t worth it after a while.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price</li>
            <li> and I kind of forgot about it until last night when he mentioned that he hadn&#x27;t had teeth sensitivity, plus he thought his teeth did look whiter.</li>
            <li> This teeth whitener is worth the cost.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not abrasive at all, which is great for my sensitive teeth, and it works like an actual whitening treatment that you&#x27;d get at the dentist&#x27;s office!  </li>
            <li> It is worth every dime.</li>
            <li> Worth the effort for a youthful smile.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple to use, and effective.  </li>
            <li> The yellowish stain is gone and my mouth feels fresh.</li>
            <li> My smile had transformed into a MEGA WATT SMILE.  </li>
            <li> I used this for the first time for the full 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> It was worth the money for me.</li>
            <li> with weeks I noticed the difference in my smile.</li>
            <li> course, none of those things would matter if the results weren&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But my nervousness was unnecessary, because this kit is awesome!</li>
            <li> I had Complexion to laugh</li>
            <li> I had been using peroxide as a teeth whitening solution for quite some time, as a friend of mine mentioned that this approach was the cheapest route to brighten a smile.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now, and my teeth are whiter than ever - even more so than right after a professional whitening.  </li>
            <li> I am beyond excited that it actually works and apart from making my teeth beautifully white, it gives great breath as well.</li>
            <li> I also tried other similar products, but Shine Whitening is the best on the market.</li>
            <li> Other whitening products won&#x27;t do a good job as this one.</li>
            <li> The bottom tray never formed right either.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The day I got it, I had to try it right away.</li>
            <li> it made a difference on my pearly whites right away.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this brand to me and I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month with nothing but positive whitening results!</li>
            <li> The LED light is cool and it&#x27;s a legitimate professional tool.  </li>
            <li> What makes it even more amazing it that although it is reasonably priced, it still does a terrific job as if you sought out a professional.</li>
            <li> I tried using this many times and it didn&#x27;t improve the shade of my teeth even after I used up more than half of the delivered amount.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have my white smile back again!</li>
            <li> And at this price I really feel that I found a true winner</li>
            <li> I wish I noticed that first because it definitely isn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li> I liked that I was able to notice a visible difference after a couple days and that even weeks later my teeth are still white.</li>
            <li> My dentist gave me some long term treatment which was not that effective.</li>
            <li> It works quickly and I love that it has the same professional LED light that they use at the dentist.</li>
            <li> I prioritize keeping myself professional looking and healthy at all times, and this product has really helped me to eliminate my stain issue.</li>
            <li> This stuff helps rebuild a bit of enamel which is great because my teeth are yellowing at a crazy rate but this has really kind of reversed time for me.</li>
            <li> So the process is not horrible, and after a few treatments I have been gifted with whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> and I’m glad to say that after a few sessions my teeth are a lot better looking than before.</li>
            <li> I have even sent this product back home in India and they are happy with it too as they could not find a similar product that was even close to it over there.</li>
            <li> Well this stuff is easy to use even if you were 100 years old</li>
            <li> Product came with clear instructions and was easy to use.</li>
            <li> I found a video on how to mold the trays to fit, but nothing on how to use the gel or the blue light.  </li>
            <li> It comes with two injections filled with the white liquid gel, a syringe nozzle, the led light and two mouth trays.</li>
            <li> I really like how the product was able to whiten my teeth without making them feel sensitive after.</li>
            <li> and I’m glad to say that after a few sessions my teeth are a lot better looking than before.</li>
            <li> The gel you apply into your mouth is very cool and refreshing, a slight minty taste that is welcoming.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything that&#x27;s out there when it comes to whitening products from toothpastes and strips to paying upwards of $100 for a 15 minuted professional whitening session.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply with no mess.</li>
            <li> Works very fast and ask anyone</li>
            <li> My friends and family have very much noticed my teeth.</li>
            <li> Whitening solution works very fast.</li>
            <li> Since using this product, it is clear the the LED light has whitened my teeth far more and much faster.</li>
            <li> My pearly-whites haven&#x27;t gleamed so bright since I was a little one.</li>
            <li> This particular teeth whitening system is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> I have earlier used many teeth whitening systems</li>
            <li> They did improve somewhat but not nearly as much as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> After about a week of use, i was so ready to step in front of that camera at the DMV and not feel embarrassed by my smile.</li>
            <li> Plus no expensive dental bills or taking off work for an appointment.</li>
            <li> I got fast whiter teeth, and no discomfort!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this 5 now &amp; it has done absolutely NOTHING!</li>
            <li> I struggled with the mouth guards at first.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love white teeth.</li>
            <li> I also love coffee, tea, red wine and berries.</li>
            <li> The rubber trays look like mouth guards for playing sports, but you dip them into hot water and mold them to your teeth.  </li>
            <li> so I’m sure it can be used daily until desired results are achieved.  </li>
            <li> First, I may have messed up, but I followed the instructions exactly.</li>
            <li> I heated up a mug of water and put the first tray in and it worked.</li>
            <li> This was my first time to use this kit.</li>
            <li> Now I have much brighter and whiter smile without any coffee or blueberry stains.</li>
            <li> Much better and simple to use as well.</li>
            <li> This is quite a process, but if you do it exactly as directed, you will see results.</li>
            <li> You dip in hot water to mold to your teeth.</li>
            <li> and my teeth have become a bit more white than before.</li>
            <li> but it saves time because it fits in your mouth exactly.</li>
            <li> I used it about twice a week for a couple months and my results have been stellar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type of person that can get results the first application with peroxide kits (Rembrandt).  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t eat ice cream or drink hot chocolate with out my teeth bothering me.</li>
            <li> So many different teeth whiteners</li>
            <li> and they couldn’t pinpoint what I improved, just that overall my look is “better.”</li>
            <li> I will keep using it and let you guys know how it looks in a month or more, but for now a big thumbs up for this product.</li>
            <li> Got the product on time, package exactly as described A+ seller.</li>
            <li> Love the product but they should have a variety of different sized trays for smaller mouths for sure.</li>
            <li> My smile is so much whiter than before.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any improvement in whiteness with my first application of this product.</li>
            <li> After the first use I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shine Whitening works just as well as professional whitening at a dentist&#x27;s office, costs a tiny fraction of the price, and is infinitely more comfortable to implement.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this to anyone that is looking for a safe way to whiten their teeth without going to the dentist.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find a teeth whitening system that is specifically designed for sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li> Saw improvement after the first application.</li>
            <li> Crest whitestrips work better for the same price.</li>
            <li> so I think this product might be exactly what I need to whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your teeth and gums sensitive because the tray protects them, and the light that is used for the whitening process is trusted by dentist professionals.   </li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time and didn&#x27;t expect it to work so well.</li>
            <li> My teeth are whiter than they have ever been and my confidence is higher as well.</li>
            <li> But it really works!</li>
            <li> Whoever it is is sophisticated enough to be able to manhandle Amazon&#x27;s internal vetting process.</li>
            <li> Definitely one of the best trays I&#x27;ve used (I have a pretty small mouth</li>
            <li> Many of us have teeth with a bit of yellow tint, but Shine Whitening is fixing that!</li>
            <li> Now I am a coffee drinker, so I was plagued with brown stains that I was sure I would only my dentist could remove!</li>
            <li> I use at my dentist, but sooo much cheaper!</li>
            <li> I really recommend it!</li>
            <li> It brightened my teeth so much that people even noticed and complimented me on it!</li>
            <li> Shine Whitening really helped change that and gave me a smile that I can give without being embarrassed.  </li>
            <li> Higher quality than I</li>
            <li> Another one of my products I will be using on a consistent basis.</li>
            <li> Within the first couple of applications I was smiling from ear to ear.  </li>
            <li> I will keep using it and let you guys know how it looks in a month or more, but for now a big thumbs up for this product.</li>
            <li> I am a wine drinker(I love red wine!)</li>
            <li> I have tried many whitening products like Crest white strips, Colgate whitening toothpaste, and even a Groupon for a whitening agent that you have to paint on to your teeth.  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried the trays, I wasn&#x27;t paying attention</li>
            <li> I am a regular user of at home teeth whitening systems and have tried out many of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Basically, soak the trays in hot water and then mold them to your teeth.</li>
            <li> “You have a nice smile” and “Wow, white teeth.”</li>
            <li> I tried a few over the counter ones from Walmart but found my teeth tingled and not in a good way.</li>
            <li> I found the tray system extremely easy to use and there is a little work up top to mold it to your mouth</li>
            <li> The easy to use trays are a major selling point for me.</li>
            <li> So pretty much all that would need is right here.</li>
            <li> What I like most about Shine Whitening is that is uses less chemicals and the LED light</li>
            <li> It whitened my teeth at least 3 shades; it was fast, easy, and non-messy; and it left me feeling more confident about my smile!</li>
            <li> Your smile is such a huge factor in confidence and every day life.</li>
            <li> I brush my teeth, put on the gel and trays, sometimes I use the light for s few minutes and then sit and write or watch a show while the magic gel does it&#x27;s thing.</li>
            <li> I wish I had a before picture, but I really think it does work, but I&#x27;m sure it will take longer to get my teeth as white as I want.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a brighter smile without the pain.</li>
            <li> Amazon, could you please look into the positive &#x27;reviews&#x27; that prompted me to purchase this?</li>
            <li> Becareful of all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> After smoking for many years, my teeth were stained grey.  </li>
            <li> but it pretty much maintained the color.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t know what to think about this, when my girlfriend first picked it up for me</li>
            <li> so it barely even fit in there.</li>
            <li> , then when they have cooled you simply put a bead of the teeth whitening gel into the trays (be sure to cut off the tab at the front of each tray) insert into your mouth and use the LED blue light device that comes with the set.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love the product, but did have one minor issue.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t know what to think about this, when my boyfriend first picked it up for me</li>
            <li> Also is not painful if you have sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> This was a gift to myself because I am a busy mom, in show business and giving myself a full body makeover and want to improve my image for 2015.</li>
            <li> It is amazing how much sparkling white teeth not only enhance your smile, but also make your skin tone look richer by its offset quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally I have found an easy to use teeth whitening system.</li>
            <li> it claims no sensitivity and it seemed easy enough to use at home.</li>
            <li> This is a simple and easy way to whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive teeth and haven&#x27;t felt any noticeable discomfort.</li>
            <li> This product is simple to use and fits easily in my mouth now.</li>
            <li> I didn’t have any sensitivity issues but if you do I would suggest using it less, own to once a week.</li>
            <li> The tray system was easy to use and very simple.</li>
            <li> The LED light requires that you remove the batteries first as the batteries have a plastic piece in between them that needs to be removed prior to use.</li>
            <li> So I was very cautious when it came to my teeth becoming yellow.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive teeth, this did not bother my teeth at all.</li>
            <li> It is really easy to use and makes for lasting results.</li>
            <li> My teeth aren&#x27;t super sensitive</li>
            <li> love this product, because it gives you fast results, lasts for months and months, and doesn&#x27;t take a long time to use every day.</li>
            <li> For so long I have wanted to try a product that works well and effectively and does not make my teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li> really thought I was doomed because I don&#x27;t have the money or time to go get my teeth professionally whitened, but this product really does the job right at home!</li>
            <li> The kit is very easy to use and the price is very affordable, compared to other products.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to finally rid myself of my stained smile, but sadly the reviews were too good to be true.</li>
            <li> I mean really, a nice smile is one of the first things you notice on a person and living in an image-based society</li>
            <li> This whitening kit is simple to use and the instructions are pretty straightforward.</li>
            <li> Decided to try it because of the good reviews and it really made my teeth less sensitive and so much whiter that</li>
            <li> While many of these products and services have worked pretty well at whitening my teeth they have either been too abrasive for my gums and teeth leaving them super sensitive to cold and/or warm foods and drinks and have been pretty pricey.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It only takes up a few minutes of my day which is great</li>
            <li> The results were much better than I expected and much quicker than I anticipated.  </li>
            <li> Its really an amazing result i found by using it few days.  </li>
            <li> The reviews looked promising for the Shine Whitening - Zero Peroxide product, so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it helps to speed up the whole whitening process.</li>
            <li> However, with Shine Whitening I did not have much of an issue with that as well as my teeth are whiter than before.</li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t like the after effect of tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Thanks xoxo</li>
            <li> An absolute life saver.</li>
            <li> It is the easiest to use and I feel so much safer &amp;#34;not&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Thanks to Shine Whitening</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not bothered with brushing my teeth each time after I had my coffee, can simply relax and enjoy the life.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very troublesome and they should fix it.</li>
            <li> For my teeth I have been trying a lot of product calling themselves \\&quot; fast results and safe\\</li>
            <li> It was much cheaper than going to the dentist to get them whitened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> teeth whiteners really work?  </li>
            <li> Eevery whitening treatment I had tried before this one caused so much sensitivity that I could use it without immediately feeling some sort of pain.</li>
            <li> I got all kinds of compliments about how much whiter my teeth were.</li>
            <li> You really get results with this one.</li>
            <li> I was a hesistant to laugh out loud.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My teeth are much whiter than before.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend Shine Whitening!</li>
            <li> and it really has boosted my confidence.</li>
            <li> so I really couldn&#x27;t see if it worked</li>
            <li> I controlled the amount of substance so it was gentle on my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> I put a bead of the solution in the trays, put them in my mouth with the included light, and left it all in my mouth for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> then I used this product must say it worked really well</li>
            <li> Thanks Shine Whitening.</li>
            <li> I really wish I didn&#x27;t buy this product now.</li>
            <li> Thanks for saving my photo day.</li>
            <li> my teeth are so much whiter than before</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if people are getting paid to post all these 5 stars but this stuff absolutely does not work.</li>
            <li> Aside from not working it is very time consuming.</li>
            <li> So I did not feel much difference and it could be done conveniently from home.</li>
            <li> And what do you know you really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Stop buying the cheap whiteners that you see at the grocery store and actually invest in a quality product.</li>
            <li> Smiling made me self-conscious and I wanted to get something that really worked without costing an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> This product really works.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Shine Whitening.</li>
            <li> and I’m ready to eat all the chocolate cake at the bakery I work at.</li>
            <li> I question the quality of the product when the user information has so many inconsistencies.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t taste like sunshine and rainbows, but even this is much preferable to some of the gag-inducing tastes of others I have tried.</li>
            <li> This whole product is fishy.</li>
            <li> my teeth really began to spring out and catch people’s eyes.</li>
            <li> The LED light stopped working only after using it 4 times, I have asked for replacement.</li>
            <li> Thanks Shine zero.</li>
            <li> I started my research on teeth whitening products and stumbled upon this after amazon recommended it with its high rating I took a chance and behold Im here to say that it worked no pain and all of the gain!</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t have much plaque in them</li>
            <li> and I have always been so self conscious of my smile.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for a week and already my teeth are much brighter.</li>
            <li> Can not beat the cost either, very affordable.</li>
            <li> I did the whole process while watching a show and folding laundry</li>
            <li> There is also a UV light that comes with it- for extra whitening.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really enjoy having white teeth.</li>
            <li> It really boost my confidence.</li>
            <li> and I enjoy using it--very simple.</li>
            <li> but really it seems like they did a miracle,&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am one of those people and this product worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> one of the mouth guards formed to fit the upper teeth.</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t really tell any difference.</li>
            <li> And wow, not only was there no chemical taste, but it did not hurt for me to remove it like most.</li>
            <li> When I found this product, I liked that it was made of botanical ingredients as opposed to really harsh chemicals that could be harmful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d say the results from this kit are more similar to professional whitening than crest strips.</li>
            <li> With this product I can smile everyday:-)</li>
            <li> I was able to obtain results similar to professional</li>
            <li> Definitely suitable for people with sensitive teeth and gums, and of course your teeth can finally return to their natural pearly state!</li>
            <li> My teeth isn’t so sensitive, but it has some discolorations, so what do I have to lose, right?  </li>
            <li> I used to have a bunch of coffee stains and other light stains on the surface of my teeth which caused me never to smile showing my teeth.</li>
            <li> I tried Shine Whitening three months ago and having bought many other brands will be sticking with this one.</li>
            <li> Tray system works so well, they should implement it in many other whitening solutions.</li>
            <li> Only making my smile nicer!</li>
            <li> I was really satisfied with this product and before this i have used some other products</li>
            <li> Tray system is better than other systems out there.</li>
            <li> I think it works better than other systems</li>
            <li> It works and it’s a better system than some other products I’ve seen on the market.</li>
            <li> so glad I did, based on the other amazon reviews here.</li>
            <li> Guys I have verified these reviews are from the same time period, posted by many accounts with no other reviews.</li>
            <li> There have been so many problems that I&#x27;ve had with other toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> but they were a reddish color and with this treatment they changed to a healthy pink!</li>
            <li> The LED light component was honestly super cool - and on par with professional whitening centers I&#x27;ve visited in the past.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Suggestion: make sure to be VERY careful when forming the trays.  </li>
            <li> My teeth have never looked so clean and white.</li>
            <li> The water was too hot apparently (I&#x27;ve been using sports guards for years and always used hot microwave water) and I ended up melting them.  </li>
            <li> After about 10 days my smile was resilient and a strong brilliance of only white.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this and the price is very affordable.</li>
            <li> I use it a couple times a week and the results so far have been very promising.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a ton of different companies and a bunch of home remedies for my old stained teeth, who would have thought it would have just been as easy as this.</li>
            <li> My teeth are pretty sensitive from eating lots of lemonade and lime from drinking tequila.</li>
            <li> So I made a mess of the trays, but they were still good enough to be used.</li>
            <li> I slowed it down to once a week because I feel like I didn’t need so many sessions</li>
            <li> You will most likely see your results in just a few days and smile with confidence again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different teeth white one products.</li>
            <li> In addition,  most of the products I have used were more expensive than this one.</li>
            <li> but I love to whiten to remove the surface stains from my daily coffee, occasional Diet Coke and wine.  </li>
            <li> My smile has really improved since starting to use Shine Whitening.</li>
            <li> We’ve gone back many years and so for him to notice such a thing it must be working out on me.</li>
            <li> so I got braces as I got older.</li>
            <li> This has been such a boost to me personally as someone who has struggled with the way that my teeth look for most of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am on my second order and I have received so many complements on how white my teeth are.</li>
            <li> No one wants a yellow smile.</li>
            <li> I noticed decent results in 2.5 weeks and no teeth tingling.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the strips from the top name brand toothpastes, and those always worked for a very short time, but this one seems to last a lot longer.  </li>
            <li> It works really quickly, and my teeth are definitely several shades whiter than before.</li>
            <li> at least now I know what to use to keep my smile healthy.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth, so I really looked forward to this product.</li>
            <li> As someone who had braces for years, my teeth are very sensitive!</li>
            <li> One thing that bothers me most when I think about whitening my teeth is the fact that I would have to go to the dentist and go through all that discomfort apart from paying so much for a whitening that often does not last as long</li>
            <li> The little blue &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; device is comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> highly recommend Shine Whitening.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend it to anybody looking to whiten their teeth.</li>
            <li> (I did 5 min on high power in an 1100w microwave).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I will highly reccomend these</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li> And I highly recommend you try this product for teeth whitening.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Between groups of them being done on the exact same date with either a very short one sentence comment or weak attempt at being more elaborate (while still writing similar salesmen like narratives)and not ONE person has an issue with this product - but they ALL sound like infomercial testimonials or are auditioning to be a QVC host.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a handful of other ones and this one has been by far the most convenient.</li>
            <li> and I guess in addition to becoming a little older, my enamel is burning off my teeth thanks to all the coffee.</li>
            <li> My teeth are always sensitive!!</li>
            <li> This was easy to use, extremely helpful</li>
            <li> At first I was a little overwhelmed when I saw it came with an LED light and all.</li>
            <li> The trays are easy to use, and the whitening gel stays put and does not leak into the rest of your mouth, which other products tend to do.</li>
            <li> My teeth are super white, with all the residue from coffee and cigarettes completely gone!  </li>
            <li> My teeth are super white, with all the residue from coffee and cigarettes completely gone!</li>
            <li> In a few days my teeth were great, back to normal, actually whiter than before.</li>
            <li> And really, you can&#x27;t beat the price when you think about how much professional teeth whitening services cost.</li>
            <li> I feel frustrated to smile on people because of my yellow teeth, Now I am very happy with Shine Whitening.</li>
            <li> Ever since I was a teenager I have always been obsessed with having a great white smile.</li>
            <li> As a college student who drinks lots of coffee, which causes stains, as well as a former smoker, I can&#x27;t tell you what a relief it is to have the smile I&#x27;ve wanted for the longest.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t messy at all, and I never worry that I&#x27;m putting harmful toxins in my body; I know this product is safe and high-quality, made with my health in mind.</li>
            <li> I no longer feel self conscious about smiling or guilty for having my favorite iced coffee :)</li>
            <li> Because after a few days of using this product my teeth look better than they have in years.</li>
            <li> Got the product last weekend and was pretty surprised by how fast it worked!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update after a few more.</li>
            <li> Or maybe I just have more confidence now that my teeth are a few shades whiter.</li>
            <li> I started to use Shine Whitening and after just a few treatments I was smiling a lot more.</li>
            <li> I need my breath to be fresh and my teeth to be white.</li>
            <li> I recently quit smoking and like most long time smokers my teeth were not the brightest.</li>
            <li> So, for anyone looking to whiten up their smile, I would definitely recommend this</li>
            <li> sensitive gums after, saw results after a few application, and easy to use!</li>
            <li> For some reason this solution in this mouth tray system (which is fine, in my opinion), does not affect my teeth the way other brands do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the best part about the Shine Whitening-Zero Peroxide Teeth Whitening System is that my teeth don&#x27;t get that dreadful tingly feeling that is often associated with so many other teeth whitening products, which is extremely important because my teeth are really sensitive.</li>
            <li> Always looking for new products in this category because I really cannot afford professional whitening at the dentist.</li>
            <li> I found this product easy to use and really made my teeth whiter in just few days of using it.</li>
            <li> I starter using it right from the next day and</li>
            <li> kit comes with everything you need, and instructions are provided that explain how to use the LED light and other materials.</li>
            <li> Could just be my new toothpaste too.</li>
            <li> This whitener really helped for me, as after using a different whitener for about 10 days, my teeth started to be really irritated by this.</li>
            <li> It took a few times to get to the desired whiteness I wanted, but overall effective product.</li>
            <li> It does not spread the light evenly across your teeth and has left me with a streak on my front upper 2 teeth that is whiter than the rest of those teeth.</li>
            <li> I am glad because I now enjoy seeing myself in the mirror or casually on video.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a major difference after one day of use, my teeth are much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all the major toothpastes promising to whiten my teeth to no effect.</li>
            <li> Considering I have very sensitive gums and teeth, I loathed whitening my teeth.</li>
            <li> and then I was also worried about how it would affect me since I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> The whitening solution works very fast actually.</li>
            <li> But my teeth were very sensitive to this</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth and thankfully Shine</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve realized when I had braces that my teeth are very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I am mainly writing this as I have failed using several products and finally reached a good genuine product.</li>
            <li> I knew they could be whiter, giving me a brighter smile, but its hard to keep them at a healthy white.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a long time since my smile started to fade, and I&#x27;ve been looking for something I can use at home to make them shine again.</li>
            <li> I did it for about a month, consistently, and my teeth are white and people have noticed.</li>
            <li> But, as an avid coffee drinker and years of smoking (I have since quit), my teeth are not as white as they used to be.&lt;br</li>
            <li> speeds up the whitening process and makes me feel like a professional at home!</li>
            <li> I drink a lot of coffee and red wine and my teeth are usually pretty stained.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Others close to me have even commented on my smile, and for the first time in a long time I&#x27;m not embarrassed to open my mouth.</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> I looked at &amp;#34;other reviews&amp;#34; of about 20 reviewers and EVERY ONE of them also gave 5 starts to something called &#x27;Omegaboost&#x27; and many other of the same products.  </li>
            <li> You have to use it consistently for a week or two, but you will definitely notice results.</li>
            <li> They are all posted in the same time frame, which is pretty sketchy....</li>
            <li> This teeth whitening made my teeth look so pretty and white after a couple of weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> I love this kit because it quite different from any other whitening kit .</li>
            <li> I basically had zero dental care as a child and the results are pretty obvious.</li>
            <li> The mouth tray system is easy to use and I like to taste a little bit of mint from the gel in my mouth.</li>
            <li> These social media sites really know how to make someone feel self conscious!</li>
            <li> I feel like some sort of bizarre electronic detective with these things, looking at review dates and saying odd things to myself like &amp;</li>
            <li> It’s easy and not a lot of trouble for a boatload of benefits.</li>
            <li> It surprises me that this product that doesn&#x27;t use anything harsh and is extremely easy to work with.</li>
            <li> I seriously love these, I had some dark teeth as I used to be a smoker so my teeth weren&#x27;t all that white.</li>
            <li> This method is not only fast, but it&#x27;s pretty simple and clean as opposed to other methods.</li>
            <li> kit also includes a LED whitening light, which cuts down considerably on the time the process takes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Way better then spending hundreds on zoom white or other things from the dentist!</li>
            <li> My teeth shade isn&#x27;t super different after several attempts with this product.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no more yellow spotting on my teeth, people compliment on how white they are, and I even smile more</li>
            <li> It really was, after the first use I could see a difference that I hadn&#x27;t seen with the other products I used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little cumbersome to stuff so much in your mouth at once, but it&#x27;s worth it, if it works.</li>
            <li> Also doesn&#x27;t make my teeth super sensitive like some other brands.</li>
            <li> Especially compared to these other super expensive brands out there that do not work as great as this one.</li>
            <li> Most of the gel is wasted falling out of your mouth if you try to balance the light on the trays -- and you truly better just stand over the sink for 15 minutes because the amount of drool escaping your mouth is truly that bad.  </li>
            <li> Looks like I don&#x27;t have to be embarrassed of my old yellow teeth anymore thanks to Shine Whitening.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and trying to find a whitening product that doesn&#x27;t cause me pain and actually works has been a real challenge.</li>
            <li> I do use mine with clear trays I got years ago from my orthodontist.</li>
            <li> I have used a professional teeth whitening system from the dentist before and that was when I was 20</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> Lastly I like how its uses trays and that helps to get your whole mouth whiten.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the results.</li>
            <li> and i told him my teeth were getting sensitive</li>
            <li> My teeth have never been whiter and I am so pleasantly surprised that they arent sensitive one bit.  </li>
            <li> So far, my gums and teeth have had no irritation at all.</li>
            <li> I am a professional networker and attend a lot of business mixers.</li>
            <li> As a busy executive I can take my Shine Whitening kit on business trips and use conveniently when at home.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural style tooth whitener and looked on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Assume they either sent me a defective light, or one with dead batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The packaging makes me giggle because it&#x27;s so old school and 80&#x27;s looking.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to get my teeth whitened professionally</li>
            <li> My husband has a sensitive mouth.</li>
            <li> I had a professional whitening kit from my dentist</li>
            <li> Far cheaper than Crest Whitestrips 3D or the Zoom whitening.</li>
            <li> There is a second gel for gentle teeth.</li>
            <li> I still went ahead with the whitening process, but when I got to the LED light it was dead.</li>
            <li> but my teeth are too sensitive.  </li>
            <li> My teeth and gums are a bit sensitive</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not only gentle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Studies have shown that natural aging can also discolor teeth.  </li>
            <li> has all natural ingrediants.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> After testing this product EXACTLY as instructed on the package, my teeth were whiter and not sensitive AT ALL.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t see results until my second time using the kit.  </li>
            <li> I use a tooth whitening product along with this one because I have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> The real color of our enamel is actually yellowish.</li>
            <li> My confidence is up and people have noticed that my teeth are whiter, or at least that I’m smiling a lot more often.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using the product a few times a week</li>
            <li> I even use toothpaste for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Considering my age and my smoking and coffee habits, I don&#x27;t think I can achieve the pearly whites of a movie star, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results I have had so far.</li>
            <li> With a baby on the way I couldn&#x27;t afford to pay the price of professional teeth whitening.  </li>
            <li> I can’t really say anything else except that the product definitely worked for me</li>
            <li> It brightens your teeth after just one use, but mine are still mildly sensitive afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have some sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> The gel did not make my teeth sensitive by any means.</li>
            <li> I tried an at-home tooth whitening system before, but it left me in absolute agony from the peroxide.</li>
            <li> I tried some of the big brand name whitening systems, but they hurt my teeth too much to continue using them.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> It is made of botanical products which means it&#x27;s completely natural.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are sensitive and this takes care of them without pain.</li>
            <li> I drink so much coffee daily that I started seeing my teeth loosing the brightness</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought the crest whitening strips but the fall off and tried the old school Rembrandt trays</li>
            <li> I could not afford a professional cleaning, so I gave this a try instead.</li>
            <li> This product is very helpful to give you the white teeth you always wanted.</li>
            <li> My teeth were always straight, but they were just yellow.  </li>
            <li> The cost of the dentist constantly whitening my teeth started to become a real burden.</li>
            <li> I can truly say Shine Whitening works just as well as professional whitening.</li>
            <li> Its up to and how sensitive your teeth are.</li>
            <li> and I am amazed that I am seeing results so early in the process.</li>
            <li> Shine Whitening works just as well as professional</li>
            <li> Maybe I lost too much enamel by drinking sodas when I was a teen.</li>
            <li> So far I have used it twice</li>
            <li> My teeth are usually sensitive when I use whitener, but because it doesn&#x27;t have peroxide I have not had issues.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t brush my teeth very often as a kid &amp; started regularly smoking cigarettes &amp; drinking coffee at the age of 16.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> By the end of my tenure at school my teeth looked like an old man’s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is a gel for people with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I had no issues with the sensitivity and my teeth are considerably whiter than when I started.</li>
            <li> I have always been self conscious about my teeth.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a professional-grade whitening gel without peroxide, that after ten uses, really DOES whiten.  </li>
            <li> Looking for white teeth fast?</li>
            <li> My teeth can be sensitive and I felt no discomfort while using it.</li>
            <li> and i was completely fed up.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully I found this product, it doesn&#x27;t have peroxide which I believe was the reasoning of making my teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li> I love drinking a couple of cups of coffee in the morning, but even worse for my teeth is my love of green tea.</li>
            <li> I have a not-so-perfect smile, and the tray didn&#x27;t fit well, so that is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> I’ve done a few off-Broadway plays as an actress, and the last thing I need is to have my teeth stand out more than my performance.  </li>
            <li> Accurately followed the directions, even tried applying the gel with a Q-tip as some other reviewer had suggested(!), but this product gave no visible results.</li>
            <li> It is gentle and my teeth look so much whiter than they had with other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> The only thing I was really worried about was my teeth becoming overly sensitive for the next few weeks.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first, but I see great improvement, so I recommend it.</li>
            <li> You know that when other people start complimenting you on your smile that something has changed.</li>
            <li> Since using Shine Whitening  about a month ago, I’ve caught so many ridiculous compliments</li>
            <li> Now with that being said, this is more work compared to the crest white strips I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> What I love the most is that it&#x27;s quick and  the zero-peroxide formula guarantees no sensitivity on your gums or teeth and that is contains ingredients made in the USA it doesn&#x27;t have any foreign crap</li>
            <li> However, being a high school teacher has led me to an increased coffee habit and the occasional relaxation cigarette....and this led to yellowing teeth.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this whitening system to anyone dealing with yellow or discolored teeth.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product as the price and the quality is well above my standards!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product - especially if you suffer from teeth sensitivity like I do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a new product to try and this one caught my eye due to all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I am so grateful for Shine Whitening because it costs much less than comparable brands, but the difference is very real!</li>
            <li> after just one week my teeth were already showing major improvement!</li>
            <li> This one is a keeper - the kit is easy to use and definitely whitens the teeth without harsh, nasty-tasting peroxide.</li>
            <li> , I work hard to reduce the discoloration, and I&#x27;ve spent my fair share on products that simply do not make a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> Light was defective, opened the packaging and the small directions that came with</li>
            <li> I am really regretting I went so long without keeping up the color of my teeth</li>
            <li> (seeing as how I tend to get into long winded stories in real life ..</li>
            <li> and it was not easy to complete the process adequately.</li>
            <li> You get 2 syringes of tooth whitener, a little blue LED light, and a tooth shade chart.</li>
            <li> Only a handful of treatments before my teeth looked like new.</li>
            <li> The day was approaching fast and my teeth were as yellow as the freshest lemon at market.</li>
            <li> Simply take a few moments and follow the directions to mold the teeth trays to your teeth for a custom fit that will ensure the whitening gel stays where it is supposed to</li>
            <li> I would smile a lot less because I never wanted to show off my teeth.</li>
            <li> Yellow teeth used to really hold back my self esteem.</li>
            <li> I tried tooth strips as well, and those seemed to work a shade or two, but this is about the same price as a package of those strips and at least for me, works a lot better.</li>
            <li> and I left them in the hot water too long and the trays became unmanageable</li>
            <li> When I went for the second one, the reheated water in the mug completely deformed the tray!</li>
            <li> I noticed a major difference</li>
            <li> But it works, and no other store-bought product could substitute.  </li>
            <li> Preparing for a job interview I put on my white shirt and to my dismay my teeth looked so yellow and as the first impression is key</li>
            <li> But it works, and no other store-bought product could substitute.</li>
            <li> Using this product was painless, and I would definitely recommend it to anybody with sensitive teeth who can&#x27;t afford a trip to the dentist!</li>
            <li> The whitening is not very aggressive so it takes longer than some of the other products available.</li>
            <li> considering that I lead a pretty hectic and active</li>
            <li> The system was easy to use and gentle on my poor teeth, and three weeks later my teeth are noticeably whiter and brighter.</li>
            <li> You do have to do a little work up top but other than that, you do need to run it under some hot water and then bite down to make a mark.</li>
            <li> There was just a little work up top to chomp down on the piece of plastic to mold into your teeth.</li>
            <li> I have always brushed my teeth with a whitening tooth paste at least twice a day, but noticed that my teeth were becoming a shade of gray.</li>
            <li> As someone who drinks an excessive amount of coffee and smokes a lot of cigarettes, this whitening system cleared up the yellow in my teeth pretty fast.</li>
            <li> (I alternate it with natural toothpaste)</li>
            <li> I tried over the counter products such as various mouth washes and toothpastes and they helped to an extent but didn&#x27;t really get them as white as I wanted them to be.</li>
            <li> As an extra added plus it was also cheaper then going to get them done professionally.</li>
            <li> But after extended use this product barely whitened my teeth.</li>
            <li> Without spending hundreds of dollars, my teeth were visibly whitened similar to the professional job I had done years ago.  </li>
            <li> But with the tray system here, Shine Whitening has me as a customer for the near future.</li>
            <li> so I definitely needed a product for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I started an early job last year</li>
            <li> so be careful not to put too much of the solution in the trays.</li>
            <li> After that time the tray feels soft enough to place on your teeth to mold to your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for something to whiten my teeth with but with a low peroxide dosage as my teeth and gums are quite sensitive.</li>
            <li> It completely removes all stains from my teeth, and makes them so white I can almost not believe it!</li>
            <li> Especially if you have sensitive teeth, because that’s what it’s for, lots of products don’t include this sort of thing.</li>
            <li> I often feel self conscious in public because of my stained teeth, so after searching online I decided to try this affordable product.</li>
            <li> and wow, I didn&#x27;t realize how yellow they were.  </li>
            <li> As stated, it won&#x27;t make your gums red and teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li> I used it once so far and the product is definitely as described.</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t take the taste and still left my teeth sensitive.  </li>
            <li> All kind a silly.</li>
            <li> But most of the products out there contain peroxide or other chemicals that make them more painful than they are worth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Since I have very sensitive teeth, I usually would go to the dentist, but I figured I would try this whitening system out first.</li>
            <li> Super shady.</li>
            <li> Other than that I really like it</li>
            <li> It also works much faster than some of the other ones I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> My teeth are sparkling and my smile is contagious so it is a little bit of a public service for everyone in my area.</li>
            <li> Not a single one shows &amp;#34;Verified Purchase&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to open your eyes to what is going on here and how this company is trying to fool you with 40 fake reviews about how amazing this is.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical in the beginning after looking at the website and noticing that most of the website is not functioning properly, and the only thing that really works is a YouTube video that demonstrates a generic teeth molding tray.</li>
            <li> and one of his biggest complaints (especially the one from the dentist&#x27;s office) was that it made his teeth extremely sensitive (and he swears it doesn&#x27;t actually whiten but just strips his teeth enamel).</li>
            <li> The instructions tell you to be careful and not leave the trays in hot water for too long</li>
            <li> I started using Shine Whitening a few months ago, and have finally seen success at work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started using this product a few weeks ago and after only a handful of treatments I am sporting a whiter smile and a friendlier face.</li>
            <li> My teeth have gotten yellow from drinking a lot of coffee as I am a major addict</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend these trays over all other ones I have tried!</li>
            <li> I monitored my teeth daily and there was an initial gradual whitening of my teeth that turned to a marked improvement in my teeth color in a very short time.  </li>
            <li> After using this product for a few weeks I saw a very noticeable improvement!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid caffeine drinker  and the yellowing of our teeth accumulates everyday.</li>
            <li> You place a small amount of the whitening gel from the syringe in the trays on the side of your teeth that show when you smile.  </li>
            <li> No problem, it’s a small price to pay for a shining smile.</li>
            <li> When I first start using it a few times I saw a difference in my teeth .</li>
            <li> My dentist told me my teeth were getting a little yellow because of age, but this product has brought the white back into my smile.  </li>
            <li> My friends were able to notice the dramatic difference in how my teeth were before (yellow) and now!</li>
            <li> and I was never able to get it to work right after that.</li>
            <li> Ive bee through the trays , the gels, the paste, some are messier than others, some can create a huge sensitivity to cold and/or hot things that you consume.</li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;ve had lots of stains on my teeth from drinking way too much wine and smoking cigarettes for half my life.</li>
            <li> With Shine Whitening it is a much easier process with much less time and no time captivated in a dental chair.</li>
            <li> Its definitely awkward to have the UV light hanging out of your mouth for 15 minutes, but my teeth like shades whiter even after one use!!</li>
            <li> The crest white strips are easier, but they left my teeth feeling so thin and super sensitive!</li>
            <li> This is super important for me as every other teeth whitening product or mouthwash that I&#x27;ve used has caused slight to mildly irritating sensations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never before had a product work with this much ease and efficiency, and I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has tried every alternative out there with little results or a crippled wallet.</li>
            <li> so I always had a hard time keeping my smile very white.  </li>
            <li> I use the mouth trays and some of my friends have also complained about having problems with other systems that don’t have such an easy to use protocol.</li>
            <li> The added fact that it is zero-peroxide provides much relief that it doesn&#x27;t hurt my teeth or affect them in a negative way and make them too sensitive.</li>
            <li> Shine Whitening leaves my teeth looking just as good as they do when I get them professionally cleaned at the dentist, which I hate.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive like other similar products.</li>
            <li> However, the peroxide left my teeth extremely sensitive, causing me to seek other options.</li>
            <li> Having the LED light in your mouth for the 15 minutes was a little weird at first, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> Then you fill the tray with a little bit of gel, which does a decent job of whitening your teeth.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive teeth, and have tried other products out there-</li>
            <li> but during the process, my teeth did not get sensitive like other whitening</li>
            <li> all products little high price than this and no results with that products</li>
            <li> The included light is pretty bad.</li>
            <li> The results definitely superseded the average results from professional whitening that I&#x27;ve received.</li>
            <li> At least I&#x27;ve learned now to read the low ratings first, ha.</li>
            <li> The dentist was far to expensive for my budget and those whitening toothpastes just didn&#x27;t seem to be working or just taking their sweet time.</li>
            <li> recommend this Shine Whitening especially those people like me who are afraid to visit a dentist or doesn&#x27;t have dental insurance but want their teeth to look more white.</li>
            <li> I had a problem with tooth sensitivity in the past, and I really didn&#x27;t want that again.</li>
            <li> We often write reviews when we have had a negative experience, and we neglect to give credit when a product does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> In the past, I have tried some drug store whitening products but it didnt really work that well on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I will keep using this as long as I need to, and I will definitely recommend this to anyone who asks!</li>
            <li> Whitening toothpastes are helpful, but are not very comfortable to use  if you have sensitive gums dont feel like whitening all of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They are whiter and I only apply a little bit at a time, but so far I have zero issues with it.</li>
            <li> Products that I have used in the past that did not include the LED light did very little to whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> but I misplaced one of my trays and they want to charge me $150 to have new molds</li>
            <li> I went for a cleaning at the dentist, bought a new toothbrush, whitening toothpaste, floss, mouthwash, and some whitening pen (which was a waste of money)&lt;br</li>
            <li> My review had been marked as helpful by 21/21, then suddenly within a few days was flooded with 50-60 &#x27;not helpful&#x27; ratings.</li>
            <li> There were no clear instructions for the product and the website has no information and is full of broken links.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this product at first, but after using it for three weeks, I saw a difference in my smile.  </li>
            <li> Check all the March 11th reviewers - look at the other reviews they&#x27;ve written from their profiles on the same day and you&#x27;ll notice they have all reviewed the same products, which means they&#x27;re hired spammers.</li>
            <li> I needed something effective and did not taste bad.</li>
            <li> The trays are huge which make it difficult to place in my mouth-</li>
            <li> I went through so much pain and expense only to have sad, sensitive, not-so-white teeth.</li>
            <li> and it didnt take long to see the effect.</li>
            <li> I put a tiny drop of the whitening gel on each tooth in the mold, keeping it in the center because you want to avoid contact with your gums.  </li>
            <li> I am 69 years old, a smoker and a heavy coffee drinker.</li>
            <li> how long I used them.</li>
            <li> Either they take too long to work</li>
            <li> is an inexpensive and healthier choice that will not damage the teeth in long</li>
            <li> The kit came with everything it said it did, but no clear way to use it.  </li>
            <li> I read the instructions and they are not clear on how to work around these issues.</li>
            <li> I was a little shocked at first how white my teeth actually got so quickly</li>
            <li> Works fine - very thin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also American made, so I&#x27;m not worried about odd chemicals coming from different countries, and there&#x27;s no peroxide, which I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I barely felt any uneasiness on my gums or my teeth and within less than a week, my teeth were whiter than they had been in years.</li>
            <li> I work as a receptionist and my appearance is very important to me, but, I also drink coffee, red wine, and smoke cigarettes which all leave really bad staining on your teeth.</li>
            <li> Very poor design on the light.</li>
            <li> That is why this product is different from other teeth whitening products and thus this feature makes this product stand out from them.</li>
            <li> of the other whitening products I have used either didn&#x27;t work well enough, caused me tooth and/or gum pain, or both.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be cheaper than other ones that are similar</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t leave a gross film on your teeth like other products.</li>
            <li> Priced at $30, it&#x27;s definitely a bargain price, compared to other whitening formulas.  </li>
            <li> After years of trying other kits and products, I am finally seeing a difference!</li>
            <li> I had similar results with other gels, but this does not leave any sensitivity to my teeth or gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth are not sensitive and there is no pain!</li>
            <li> The other products these &amp;#34;users&amp;#34; reviewed are all the same and are all 5 stars (supplements, omega 3 oil, cell phone cases, etc).</li>
            <li> These simple pleasures have a drawback of course, which is that my teeth have become stained and in some parts are very dark yellow.  </li>
            <li> Once I take the trays out, I rinse them out, brush them with a toothbrush and once their dry, store them in the pouch they came</li>
            <li> I did two back to back sessions and plan to repeat in a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I tried tooth bleaching but after few months the color will be back to yellow stains.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used products in the past that have worked, but the results were far less apparent than the results achieved with this product.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I now do not hide my smile and actually take pictures.</li>
            <li> Also due to those braces my teeth were stained a little, and it had made me self conscious.</li>
            <li> Not even that much, but a little yellow sucks.</li>
            <li> In the past, I had used Crest whitening strips, and I had my teeth professionally whitened at a health/beauty place in the mall.</li>
            <li> As a matter of habit, I usually get my teeth professionally whitened once every couple of years or so.  </li>
            <li> I usually get my teeth professionally whitened once every couple of years or so.</li>
            <li> you soak the trays in hot water, mold to your teeth, then apply a thin line of whitening serum to the tray..</li>
            <li> I was renewing my driver&#x27;s license and knew my teeth were less than sparkly white</li>
            <li> I like this product because it seems complicated at first but is actually simpler than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, I am one of those people whose teeth are sensitive to hot and cold temperatures, etc.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products - some totally useless and others mediocre to decent.</li>
            <li> I do wish the trays weren&#x27;t as thick because I feel like I really have to bite down while wearing them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s absolutely no pain; I have very sensitive gums and have had a hard time finding a product or procedure that doesn&#x27;t cut my gums up or make me want to scream in agony.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s something wrong about all these positive reviews all posted around the same time..</li>
            <li> Being a little vain, I knew that I needed a product to get this yellow teeth situation under wraps.  </li>
            <li> My teeth were a little yellow</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a little bit and already notice a difference in my teeth.</li>
            <li> Only a little difference.</li>
            <li> is to thanks at least a little bit.</li>
            <li> In some cases, &amp;#34;sensitivity&amp;#34; is far too neutral a word since it feels like your teeth are plagued by a dull ache that doesn&#x27;t want to seem to go away.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product for anyone trying to get rid of dull, yellow teeth.  </li>
            <li> Seemed to work well and did not make my teeth ache like every single other teeth whitener I have used.</li>
            <li> Yes all bad things for my teeth, but who doesn&#x27;t love to have sweets?</li>
            <li> Great product but the website they recommend is just awful.</li>
            <li> At least it&#x27;s not making my teeth feel sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Closed the casing and pressed the on button, nothing happened.</li>
            <li> but I could never really afford it</li>
            <li> But it does work well after only a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Faster than I would have expected.</li>
            <li> Only a few times of maybe 30 minutes each can improve my teeth so drastically.  </li>
            <li> I only used it a few times before Shine zero</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not really what I wanted to hear.</li>
            <li> teeth whitening set came with an upper and lower tray that you drop in a cup of water that has been brought to a boil, after leaving the trays in the water for just a few seconds</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s definitely worth a shot for anyone that&#x27;s skeptical.</li>
            <li> As someone with hyper-sensitive teeth, I have to be really careful about which dental hygiene products I use.</li>
            <li> Only a few treatments</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are two big problems, one is that there are no detailed written instructions.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a regular teeth whitener for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Rough to the touch of my finger as well as when I ran my tongue along my teeth.  </li>
            <li> As a smoker and coffee drinker, I seem to have trouble with keeping my teeth white even after use of whitening kits.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the peroxide based teeth whitening systems over the years and while they do whiten the teeth my gums were so sensitive and my dentist told me it actually made my receding gums worse.</li>
            <li> I have used it a few times thus far and already my teeth are a few shades brighter than what they were.</li>
            <li> I kind of feel like an idiot for buying into this.</li>
            <li> My pale yellow teeth were not like the pearly whites I&#x27;ve witnessed everywhere</li>
            <li> I left two messages a few days in between each other and still have yet to get a response.</li>
            <li> Unlike whitening strips from colgate or crest these are less sensitive, making it less harsh on your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not positive it&#x27;s working, but I think it is.  </li>
            <li> I have previously used dental grade whitening kits and could never complete my treatment due to sensitivity.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I’m surprised Crest or someone else hasn’t made something like this for people who can’t keep the ridiculous strips in their teeth to stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also has no peroxide unlike a lot of other whitening products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product delivered just as I had expected and hoped!</li>
            <li> Mostly I have been disappointed until this one.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day so that my teeth doesn&#x27;t get used to it.</li>
            <li> and I had heard horror stories from other people.</li>
            <li> I looked at a few of these reviews and noticed they almost all of them start with a story, which is strange.</li>
            <li> The pain was extremely sharp.</li>
            <li> and i will recommend to other people ....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s become apart of my ritual to do it every other day.</li>
            <li> I do use other whitening products but there was still room for improvement</li>
            <li> so I decided to give Shine Whitening a try and in conjunction with other products that I use.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, my teeth get pretty stained.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when looking at the 5 Star reviews, see what other products</li>
            <li> So using Crest White strips has been a pain in the past.</li>
            <li> The other reviews are bought or faked.</li>
            <li> Never had whitening results with other products.</li>
            <li> The instructions were extremely way to follow.</li>
            <li> One says to use the product twice a day; the other says once.</li>
            <li> Shine Whitening stood out extra ordinarily giving response</li>
            <li> Other people seemed to notice too.</li>
            <li> I found Shine Whitening  on Amazon and based on the other reviews decided to pick it up and try it out.</li>
            <li> You don’t know what it’s like on the other side with whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> My teeth are so white, it&#x27;s unbelievable.</li>
            <li> My husband is an extremely picky person who has tried a lot of teeth whitening products</li>
            <li> other problem is that the material for the trays are supposed to be dipped in boiling water for 4 seconds than placed against the teeth to form a mold.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried other whitening products--no luck.</li>
            <li> I have tried several whitening brands and techniques in the past.</li>
            <li> and I had to stop whitening my teeth with the other stuff because it was astringent.</li>
            <li> I usually use the crest white strips but a friend told me I needed to try this product</li>
            <li> I started looking for other ways to whiten my teeth and not have sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> The other thing that sets Shine Whitening apart is the design of the tray.</li>
            <li> As mentioned, the peroxide I was using caused extreme sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> The taste is also tolerable, making me feel extremely safe/comfortable using this product.</li>
            <li> Wow, definitely would NEVER consider purchasing after filtering through this boatload of FAKE reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was crazy how much a difference white teeth makes.</li>
            <li> I have seen some other ones for less money but the quality was not there.</li>
            <li> I used to be a smoker and drink lots of coffee and have had a hard time gaining back the pearly whites I had in my youth.  </li>
            <li> I would 100% recommend this to  anybody who is in search of get rid of the dull and yellow coloured tooth.</li>
            <li> And while I&#x27;m wary of companies claiming that there products are &amp;#34;no sensitivity&amp;#34;, I really had no sensitivity issues.  </li>
            <li> What use is the product now that the trays are not useful to anyone else in the family?</li>
            <li> Since coffee ruins teeth too I kept up the teeth whitening.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s time intensive (twice a day for 15 minutes), uncomfortable and I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference after a week.</li>
            <li> my teeth have gotten really really yellow tinted lately, I looked to this product for help and in a manner of a week</li>
            <li> I THINK I notice that my teeth are whiter, but it&#x27;s not worth the distress caused by my &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; teeth after using the product.  </li>
            <li> My guess is that if I do not keep up with the whitening treatments then my teeth will again slowly start to turn yellow like they were before, after my enamel had worn away.</li>
            <li> I love keeping my teeth white but hate the fact that peroxide is a common ingredient in these types of products.</li>
            <li> You have to put it in your mouth and bite down to form it around your teeth but after that it’s a personalized indentation.</li>
            <li> I have used other whitening products and toothpastes, but this system tops them all!</li>
            <li> I have started actually opening my mouth when I smile, and I had spent years avoiding open mouth smiles because I feel like it gives away this awful truth about my teeth!</li>
            <li> Other items do not fit as well and often strips slip off my teeth.</li>
            <li> And almost all of these were posted within a few days of each other.  </li>
            <li> Just over a week&#x27;s time of using the whitening system my teeth started to look slightly whiter</li>
            <li> and I still drink up to two cups of black coffee per day without the worry.</li>
            <li> I had to cut the bottom one almost in half.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference about a week and a half into using it.</li>
            <li> After using the Shine Whitening-Zero Peroxide Teeth Whitening System for 4 days my teeth have become slightly brighter.  </li>
            <li> and it’s a lot less hassle just putting this in your mouth that is made to fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I smoked maybe half a pack a day for a handful of years.</li>
            <li> I stuck on the mouth guard and used it for fifteen minutes per use and after a month or a month and a half</li>
            <li> The results were visible in less than a month.</li>
            <li> plan to continue using this at least once a day for as long as I continue to see results.</li>
            <li> It also did not feel the weird feeling normally from the tempature of the item.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful what I use on my teeth since I have had gum problems in the past</li>
            <li> but that’s not true.</li>
            <li> Inject the trays with the gel and bite down for a few minutes for whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> With this new job Im starting coffee has been my new friend and worst enemy because it stains your teeth</li>
            <li> And it works without any of the negative side effects that have caused me problems with similar products in the past.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Luckily I picked up Shine Zero, which probably cut my stains in half in about a few months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried other products in the past</li>
            <li> I started using these whitening trays and as little as a week</li>
            <li> The truth is we’re going to need a little bit of help.</li>
            <li> and my teeth could use a little whitening.</li>
            <li> There is a little bit of mint taste in the gel, which makes it easier to use this product.</li>
            <li> When I got this product in the mail I was a little apprehensive.</li>
            <li> I saw little to no improvement no matter</li>
            <li> There is a little bit of mint taste in the gel, which makes it easier to use this product.</li>
            <li> Something is a little &amp;#34;off-white&amp;#34; about this product.  </li>
            <li> (You know you&#x27;re swallowing a little bit of it</li>
            <li> I just wanted something that would make my teeth a little whiter.</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because my teeth look a little whiter after 1 day.</li>
            <li> and I wish it was a little whiter</li>
            <li> I’ve had problems with other products in the past but not this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little anal when it comes to my teeth whitening procedures.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants to naturally whiten their teeth without having that hated sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I stopped using Crest brand white strips because it was making my teeth sensitive and painful.</li>
            <li> Just after a few uses I could see the change in my teeth.</li>
            <li> and I must say, my poor teeth have never been the same.  </li>
            <li> It took a few weeks before we saw a difference.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> Found this and used it for a few days.</li>
            <li> these phonies behind a keyboard have reviewed and it&#x27;s either the ONE product or the same products all across the board.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Been using this twice a day for two weeks and taking a few weeks off.  </li>
            <li> Then for a few weeks I did the procedure for a few minutes every week.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to use it, and even waited a few weeks to start...    </li>
            <li> I also am a heavy coffee drinker.</li>
            <li> Waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> They where whiter after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> I bought some and after a few treatments my teeth are whiter than ever.</li>
            <li> Wanted to round out the look</li>
            <li> so I got this and stuck the tray in my mouth everyday for a few days</li>
            <li> I use this product about three times a week for a few weeks and my teeth have almost never been brighter.</li>
            <li> My teeth always had a brownish tint on them because I&#x27;m a heavy coffee drinker</li>
            <li> I thought it would take maybe a few months to see results but in a matter of days I noticed that my teeth were whiter than before.</li>
            <li> Use this product a few times a week</li>
            <li> Ive used the expensive trays from the dentist before and they worked but would leave my teeth so sensitive.  </li>
            <li> and you waste the gel</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen my teeth quite a few shades whiter</li>
            <li> My parents were poor when I was growing up, so I didn&#x27;t make it to the dentist regularly.</li>
            <li> I have narrow teeth...</li>
            <li> I had whitening done at the dentist a few years ago and swore never to put up with that agony again.</li>
            <li> What a waste of 2 weeks and $30.</li>
            <li> After just a few uses</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to use it, and even waited a few weeks to start...</li>
            <li> No side effects and cost is also not that much heavy in front of our shining whitened teeth.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked to see results right away after using it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever used other teeth whitening products, you know how hard it is to find a product that works at an inexpensive price.</li>
            <li> ;  I have to endorse the other negative reviews.</li>
            <li> The trays were not easy to mold at all.</li>
            <li> i mean, i&#x27;ve tried other teeth whitening products, but non</li>
            <li> Very little time of my day is wasted, which I appreciate with my schedule.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that has left my teeth in less than pristine condition.</li>
            <li> It was yellowing pretty bad</li>
            <li> In the past, I used a few techniques to whiten my teeth (baking soda, bleach).</li>
            <li> &quot; but  after using them I got some serious consequences affecting my gum by those extreme chemical products.</li>
            <li> Tried it once and the light was really awkward, no way to use it without holding it for 15 minutes - very poorly fitted.</li>
            <li> Saw that this is a common complaint from some of the other Amazon reviewers.</li>
            <li> This led to me not caring for them as much as I should have, but even brushing and flossing can sometimes be painful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of teeth whitening products in the past...</li>
            <li> I have never been one to drink coffee until the past year</li>
            <li> Usually 3-4 cups a day.</li>
            <li> Not sure how Shine  zero works</li>
            <li> /&gt;All 5 stars reviews are fake, I clicked on several....</li>
            <li> and we’ve all had those problems in the past but kiss those goodbye.</li>
            <li> I have and always have had a small mouth</li>
            <li> I usually do my whitening in the evening.</li>
            <li> I did have a problem with one of the syringes blowing out, not sure how that happened</li>
            <li> It came in on time as promised though I was a bit hesitant because of my past experience.</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY teeth whitening products that always gives me sensitivity in my gums, and a horrible aftertaste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I smoke cigarettes and drink colas daily, needless to say my teeth are stained.</li>
            <li> I have been using Shine Whitening for the past two weeks, and have noticed my teeth are visibly whiter.</li>
            <li> and I usually get this every month to keep my smiles on point.</li>
            <li> but I usually experience some discomfort while using at home whiteners.</li>
            <li> An individual with poorly cared for teeth just says the person cares poorly about themselves.</li>
            <li> I only expected some sensitivity or pain to be the worst case scenario for trying this once, not instant receded gumline.</li>
            <li> they cause after using them for awhile is really difficult to stand--especially over a long period of time.</li>
            <li> so why on earth would I start drinking coffee to wreck all of my hard work?&lt;br</li>
            <li> So the stain on my teeth was hard to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Luckily  or not so lucky for me this ended up being the same crap my sister purchased a few years ago and gave to me</li>
            <li> I recommend this to any dull, stained teeth challenged person.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when ordering this because how could a teeth whitening kit without those harsh ingredients whiten your teeth?</li>
            <li> at least whenever I see my teeth getting yellower).</li>
            <li> There is increased saliva production while using...for me at least.</li>
            <li> With the strips I can at least put them on and be on my way if I&#x27;m in a rush.</li>
            <li> so I was looking for a product that would whiten (I&#x27;m a regular coffee drinker) but not cause me pain every time I would eat something cold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 20s and want to keep them for awhile, so I try to invest in whitening programs.</li>
            <li> the least amount of side effects.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and would say my tooth enamel went up at least four to six shades, and it doesn&#x27;t burn like the dickens.</li>
            <li> Sucks.</li>
            <li> I hate going to the dentist and won&#x27;t unless I absolutely have to.</li>
            <li> I have a very small mouth</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I have the bad habit of smoking cigarettes and drinking too much coffee.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this is a revolution in teeth whitening...</li>
            <li> This one seriously brightened and whitened overnight.</li>
            <li> They were very unappealing and unattractive  which made me not smile often.</li>
            <li> I have never tried a whitening system before since I am have always been skeptical and a little paranoid with some of the ingredients do to teeth.</li>
            <li> I feel bad for people 100 years ago when white teeth were prized as well but did not have whitening services.</li>
            <li> I smoke, drink coffee and red wine, so I do all the bad things for tooth enamel that&#x27;s out there.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;m also a heavy smoker (I know,</li>
            <li> I read the reviews again and noticed quite a few people saying they are fake reviews.</li>
            <li> However years of drinking tea have taken a toll on my teeth and they are not a bright as they used to be.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and hate the taste of chemicals in mouth.</li>
            <li> My problem with other products is that they hurt my teeth, and were dangerous because of the peroxide which eats away teeth enamel.  </li>
            <li> She is addicted to white teeth and started nagging when my coffee stained teeth got too bad.  </li>
            <li> No more wasting my money on expensive teeth cleaning.</li>
            <li> No more though!!</li>
            <li> My teeth weren&#x27;t all that bad according to the chart that was enclosed but still I expected some change.</li>
            <li> I was tired of looking at the Colgate brand whitener and using the Crest system.</li>
            <li> So we looked for something to whiten his teeth without irritating his mouth.</li>
            <li> The gel was worse than anything I have ever tried before.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how my experience with this gel could be so much worse than all of the others who reviewed this product.</li>
            <li> And then by the time they were straight they had been stained by a horrible smoking habit I picked up as a teenager.</li>
            <li> Alas, my teeth have taken on a yellowish cast over the years - some from age and the rest from coffee and tea.</li>
            <li> The link was broken.</li>
            <li> Now I am almost as addicted as she is.  </li>
            <li> I never experienced any gum irritation.</li>
            <li> I hate having yellow teeth</li>
            <li> product has no customer support and the company does not stand behind the product.</li>
            <li> I have tried some other products before like strips and bleaching but it&#x27;s just too painful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to coffee, but unfortunately that comes with its health detriments, one of those being the coffee stains on my teeth.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re all fake.</li>
            <li> The nasty yellow stains are almost gone</li>
            <li> /&gt;Either way, because of all the fake reviews I discovered on here between when I purchased the product and now receiving it, I&#x27;m not going to bother to purchase again.</li>
            <li> Sorry Dr. McCrory.</li>
            <li> I was so angry</li>
            <li> I was recommend this by a friend and though I was hesitant, I was proven wrong.</li>
            <li> WAS NOT IMPRESSED WITH THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> So when I had the opportunity to review this product I figured I might as well try it since I have tried everything else and failed.</li>
            <li> Website they stated on the box has no link - Lame.</li>
            <li> this product is that expensive.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about the trays conforming to my mouth, but they did.</li>
            <li> I would recommend buying this product to anyone that is trying to rid their teeth of Nasty yellow stains; that&#x27;s why I bought one for my wife and my mother, who both smoke cigarettes and drink wine as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s uncomfortable, invasive, expensive, and often leaves my gums stinging for days afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Ha, sorry, couldn&#x27;t help it.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel uncomfortable and self-conscious about myself and thus forbids me from smiling.</li>
            <li> All of these reviews are FAKE.</li>
            <li> All fake reviews, trying something else.</li>
            <li> before I posted and sorry, mine is probably going to involve a story at some point</li>
            <li> Scary, how well it was done.</li>
            <li> I found that this was uncomfortable on my teeth because of the heat.  </li>
            <li> Some of them don&#x27;t even work, so I was skeptical when a friend gave me this kit as a gift for my birthday.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, these two tend to wreak havoc on my teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s uncomfortable, invasive, expensive, and often leaves my gums stinging for days afterwards.</li>
            <li> Tried it for two weeks and was not impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> Battery died in one day and bet uncomfortable</li>
            <li> Having yellow teeth is horrible for your confidence..</li>
            <li> I have always felt insecure about my teeth.</li>
            <li> These reviews appear to be fake.</li>
            <li> Only problem is the paste taste HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> Too bad, because my teeth have taken a turn for the worse.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t dare eat a popsicle and really cold drinks</li>
            <li> It seemed that the spaces looked &#x27;dirty&#x27; compared to the teeth.  </li>
            <li> but I was desperate after taking off my braces</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I was wrong!</li>
            <li> Who would have thought I could reverse my nasty coffee habit in just a few weeks?!  </li>
            <li> so I looked around for something not too expensive and found this!</li>
            <li> I received the SHINE WHITENING ZERO PEROXIDE TEETH WHITENING SYSTEM and I will admit to being very skeptical.</li>
            <li> I needed this whitening system badly.</li>
            <li> hurt my teeth so bad after using them.</li>
            <li> I used to feel bad about my teeth, they were yellowish.</li>
            <li> Nothing bad.</li>
            <li> It works, and it doesn&#x27;t taste bad at all, I can deal with it.</li>
            <li> had also noticed fewer incidence of bad breath.</li>
            <li> and I got a bad case of sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> but i did not find any result but after started using this product myself shocked because its showing the result</li>
            <li> After years of smoking and drinking my teeth are embarrassingly ugly in terms of color.</li>
            <li> So of course my teeth&#x27;s were stain in ugly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I had been frustrated with Crest and Walgreens brands whitening strips, as they irritated my gums after leaving them on for 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Did I mention I hate going to the dentist?</li>
            <li> Peroxide can be horrible for your moth, and if it accidently gets into your body it could get you terribly sick.</li>
            <li> Well, I have tried a variety of products on the market and am usually very disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t produce the results in which are advertised.</li>
            <li> I started to noticed that nasty stains were all over my teeth.</li>
            <li> My schedule is horrible and I have been ingesting coffee like a madman.</li>
            <li> I can continue with my horrible coffee habit and pass my teeth off as non-coffee drinkers.</li>
            <li> It’s insane</li>
            <li> Strips keep falling out of my mouth when I put them in, it’s insane.</li>
            <li> The worst case scenario would be that I flushed $30.</li>
            <li> and I have been miserable.</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t a nasty taste like the crest products too!</li>
            <li> Their teeth must have been horrible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a terrible feeling but one that I didn&#x27;t get after using Shine Whitening.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Please notice that most of the 5 star ratings (90% or more) do not show a verified purchase. They&#x27;re all fake. And don&#x27;t bother commenting about mine not showing a verified purchase - I&#x27;m just one person. I&#x27;m trying to open your eyes to what is going on here and how this company is trying to fool you with 40 fake reviews about how amazing this is. 40 people who can&#x27;t prove that they actually bought the product.Do yourself a favor and pass on this and get something that actually works. This is such a gimmick. If there&#x27;s no peroxide, your teeth won&#x27;t get whiter. What a joke!</li>
            <li> After the reviews I was actually hesitant.  It seemed like they were too good to be true.  I have used a professional teeth whitening system from the dentist before and that was when I was 20 so I have a lot more stains now.  I didn&#x27;t think this would compare but it actually did.&lt;br /&gt;Suggestion: make sure to be VERY careful when forming the trays.  I accidentally let the back end flap over on one and it stuck to itself and I had to cut it off.  Not that I wanted to whiten my molars, but I can feel where it is cut and it isn&#x27;t super comfortable.  I do wish the trays weren&#x27;t as thick because I feel like I really have to bite down while wearing them.&lt;br /&gt;As for the actually whitening process, I used it for 3 days and two of my coworkers asked if I had been whitening my teeth.  3 days.  Wow.  I used it about a week and now I use it just once a week for upkeep.</li>
            <li> I never tried teeth whitening cream before, but I&#x27;m very glad that I have. I brought this product a week ago and ever since I tried it, it&#x27;s  been amazing. My teeth really became whiten gradually within a few weeks. I&#x27;ve received compliments from my family and friends. I&#x27;ve very happy that I chose this brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always prided myself on my smile.  However, being a high school teacher has led me to an increased coffee habit and the occasional relaxation cigarette....and this led to yellowing teeth.  Being a little vain, I knew that I needed a product to get this yellow teeth situation under wraps.  The reviews looked promising for the Shine Whitening - Zero Peroxide product, so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product&#x27;s really simple to use.  The trays form to your mouth and fit perfectly into my rather large one.  Very little time of my day is wasted, which I appreciate with my schedule.  And while I&#x27;m wary of companies claiming that there products are &amp;#34;no sensitivity&amp;#34;, I really had no sensitivity issues.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product like this for years! Finally I have found an easy to use teeth whitening system. I like also how the formula it has, has no sensitivity on the gums or even on your teeth. Just over a week&#x27;s time of using the whitening system my teeth started to look slightly whiter then it originally was when I first started to use the product.I also like how this product as a LED light and it helps to speed up the whole whitening process. This same light is even used at some professional whitening centers and that is why I am so impressed by this product. Lastly I like how its uses trays and that helps to get your whole mouth whiten. I would buy this product again and recommend to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> As someone who drinks an excessive amount of coffee and smokes a lot of cigarettes, this whitening system cleared up the yellow in my teeth pretty fast. I started using the system about a month ago and in a couple of days I was already seeing a big improvement. In the past, I used a few techniques to whiten my teeth (baking soda, bleach). This method is not only fast, but it&#x27;s pretty simple and clean as opposed to other methods. I would highly recommend this whitening system to anyone dealing with yellow or discolored teeth.</li>
            <li> Considering I have very sensitive gums and teeth, I loathed whitening my teeth. However, with Shine Whitening I did not have much of an issue with that as well as my teeth are whiter than before. As a college student who drinks lots of coffee, which causes stains, as well as a former smoker, I can&#x27;t tell you what a relief it is to have the smile I&#x27;ve wanted for the longest. I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a brighter smile without the pain.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product guys. I have earlier used many teeth whitening systems but this works amazing. The best part of this product is that it guarantees no sensitivity or on teeth due to its zero peroxide formula. Another wonderful feature of this product is whitening LED light which carries the process of whitening the teeth rapidly. That is why this product is different from other teeth whitening products and thus this feature makes this product stand out from them.</li>
            <li> I am a great candidate for the use of whitening strips since my teeth are naturally less than a perfect white. I gave up coffee for health reasons but also hoped it would improve the color of my teeth. They did improve somewhat but not nearly as much as I would have liked. I&#x27;ve tried the whitening toothpastes and rinses out there with negligible to average results at best.    Which brings us to this product. When I finally bit the bullet and decided to go this route I was pleasantly surprised with the results. I wasn&#x27;t prepared to spend the kind of money it takes to get whitening done at a dentist&#x27;s office and my dental insurance doesn&#x27;t cover whitening. So this turned out to be a great do-it-yourself alternative. Without a doubt a great product!</li>
            <li> After smoking for many years, my teeth were stained grey.  But Shine Whitening helped improve the color of my teeth.  It is easy to apply.  I used it daily.  I also enjoyed the natural botanical ingredients.  Plus this product is made in the USA.  My teeth and I would recommend this awesome product.</li>
            <li> My dad is a dentist and i told him my teeth were getting sensitive and he recommended this shine whitening toothpaste.  This toothpaste works great because it not only whitens my teeth but also protects it against being sensitive.  My teeth have never been whiter and I am so pleasantly surprised that they arent sensitive one bit.  The toothpaste also actually tastes pretty good and I have noticed that my breath is fresher than ever too.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to naturally whiten their teeth without having that hated sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I am very on top of my oral hygiene. What I am always concerned about now is whitening my teeth. I have tried other products in the past but I really don&#x27;t like the after effect of tooth sensitivity. Fortunately, I did not experience any sensitivity. I like the LED light that comes with too because they do that at the dental office. The tray fit my mouth well and I was glad to know they we can order more syringes. I recommend this teeth whitening product.</li>
            <li> shine whitening has saved my smile. after years of coffee stained my teeth i thought it was hopeless. i took  the chance now im glad i did</li>
            <li> I have to say i absolutley loved this product! after just one week my teeth were already showing major improvement! I would gladly recomend this product, I love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kimberly</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s something wrong about all these positive reviews all posted around the same time..</li>
            <li> Best and most effective way to whiten teeth. This product is amazing- easy on teeth and works extremely well. The price is great and you get lots of product. The easy to use trays are a major selling point for me. 100% satisfied. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> The day was approaching fast and my teeth were as yellow as the freshest lemon at market. My good friend recommended Shine Whitening because they knew of my sensitivity issues. Just after a few uses I could see the change in my teeth. To my relief I had no problems and my teeth were the brightest thing at the party.  Thanks xoxo</li>
            <li> I love this whitening system! It works quickly and I love that it has the same professional LED light that they use at the dentist. It also has no peroxide unlike a lot of other whitening products. It&#x27;s so convenient and easy to use. I recommend it to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a week and already I can see a huge difference! I love this product! Easy to apply with no mess.</li>
            <li> This whitener really helped for me, as after using a different whitener for about 10 days, my teeth started to be really irritated by this. My gums basically caught on fire each time I used that one, so I had to stop it. However, this whitener contained 0 peroxide and is made from all-natural ingredients, so I figured to give it a try. So far, my gums and teeth have had no irritation at all. Even better, it works just as well as my peroxide one did! I am very happy with Shine, as it is able to provide whitening treatment that works without using irritating ingredients, all for a reasonable cost. I will definately be buying this again once my syringes run out!</li>
            <li> I was renewing my driver&#x27;s license and knew my teeth were less than sparkly white...(years of coffee and fruit juice) So i was looking on Amazon and stumbled across Shine Whitening - Zero Peroxide Teeth Whitening System - No Sensitivity, and I am truly glad i did, i ordered it, it arrived in just 3 days, and i started using it and noticed a huge difference, i mean, i&#x27;ve tried other teeth whitening products, but non that did my teeth justice like Shine Whitening does. After about a week of use, i was so ready to step in front of that camera at the DMV and not feel embarrassed by my smile. Now, i smile without thinking twice. Great product, and must for those that want truly white teeth.</li>
            <li> BOGUS product! The instructions are non existent (even if you go to the &#x27;website&#x27;).  Most of the gel is wasted falling out of your mouth if you try to balance the light on the trays -- and you truly better just stand over the sink for 15 minutes because the amount of drool escaping your mouth is truly that bad.  I have been scammed!! Amazon, could you please look into the positive &#x27;reviews&#x27; that prompted me to purchase this?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to coffee, but unfortunately that comes with its health detriments, one of those being the coffee stains on my teeth. I prioritize keeping myself professional looking and healthy at all times, and this product has really helped me to eliminate my stain issue. It isn&#x27;t messy at all, and I never worry that I&#x27;m putting harmful toxins in my body; I know this product is safe and high-quality, made with my health in mind.</li>
            <li> I seriously love these, I had some dark teeth as I used to be a smoker so my teeth weren&#x27;t all that white. I was tired of looking at the Colgate brand whitener and using the Crest system. These are just perfect for getting my teeth shiny and white, and just in time for the holidays too. Looks like I don&#x27;t have to be embarrassed of my old yellow teeth anymore thanks to Shine Whitening.</li>
            <li> I am a professional networker and attend a lot of business mixers. It&#x27;s imperative that I have a bright, white, happy smile. But years of red wine and coffee at all those mixers and business dinners took their toll on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I found Shine Whitening! An absolute life saver. I love that it is peroxide free -- no burning gums. Plus no expensive dental bills or taking off work for an appointment. As a busy executive I can take my Shine Whitening kit on business trips and use conveniently when at home. I am so happy to have my white smile back again!</li>
            <li> I started to noticed that nasty stains were all over my teeth. They were very unappealing and unattractive  which made me not smile often. My co worker had recommended me this product and at first I was skeptical but after consistent use I have seen results. The nasty yellow stains are almost gone and my teeth are stronger! This product has helped me regain my confidence and my smile is here to stay!</li>
            <li> I tried Shine Whitening three months ago and having bought many other brands will be sticking with this one. It is the easiest to use and I feel so much safer &amp;#34;not&amp;#34; putting peroxide in my mouth. I work as a receptionist and my appearance is very important to me, but, I also drink coffee, red wine, and smoke cigarettes which all leave really bad staining on your teeth. And I simply cannot afford to go to the dentist as often as I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shine whitening is a real life saver for me and being able to get it shipped right to my mail box, right from Amazon, well, what&#x27;s not to love about that. I have already recommended this product to friends and family and am delighted to be able to leave a kind word for such a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this. I&#x27;ve tried so many different teeth white one products. Have been going back and forth between the brands but then accidentally found this one. What makes me like it, is the price and quality.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really easy to use and apply, effect is great, I do drink a lot of coffee so teeth whitening is a must for me. Thanks to Shine Whitening I&#x27;m not bothered with brushing my teeth each time after I had my coffee, can simply relax and enjoy the life.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Shine Whitening is a lifesaver!! My teeth have never looked so clean and white. For years, I have been struggling with yellow teeth, trying different products like teeth whitening toothpaste to whitening strops to bleaching products and nothing has ever seemed to work. So I decided to try out the shine whitening system, after hearing and reading GREAT reviews about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product delivered just as I had expected and hoped! I barely felt any uneasiness on my gums or my teeth and within less than a week, my teeth were whiter than they had been in years. This was easy to use, extremely helpful and I love the product! I would definitely buy this product again in the future and I recommend it to everyone struggling with yellow teeth.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural style tooth whitener and looked on Amazon. I found Shine Whitening and it is fabulous!!! It is made in the US using botanical ingredients and is a great price. Lots of people compliment on how bright and white my teeth are! I will be telling all my friends to get this.</li>
            <li> Tray system works so well, they should implement it in many other whitening solutions. I know this one works well and fits into my teeth like a glove. Other items do not fit as well and often strips slip off my teeth. It&#x27;s very troublesome and they should fix it. This is the only product that i&#x27;ve seen with this sort of system in place. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Wow. Seeing results in such a short period of time. I am amazed at how white my teeth look today when only about a week ago my teeth looked like two bricks of butter. Anyway, I recommend this.</li>
            <li> I have been smoker for a while and gave up recently, but my lower teeth have been affected and have some darker, yellow tone. Whitening toothpastes are helpful, but are not very comfortable to use  if you have sensitive gums dont feel like whitening all of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using Shine Whitening and it didnt take long to see the effect. The kit is very easy to use and the price is very affordable, compared to other products. Also is not painful if you have sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything that&#x27;s out there when it comes to whitening products from toothpastes and strips to paying upwards of $100 for a 15 minuted professional whitening session. While many of these products and services have worked pretty well at whitening my teeth they have either been too abrasive for my gums and teeth leaving them super sensitive to cold and/or warm foods and drinks and have been pretty pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the review on Shine Whitening I thought, &amp;#34;What the hey, let me try this&amp;#34; and I have to say, I am very happy with it. It works just as good as the $100+ teeth whitening but, doesn&#x27;t make my teeth and gums hurt. The best part? The price! It&#x27;s easy to use form the comfort and privacy of my own home and it&#x27;s affordable. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> when I read the instructions and found out that this one is made of botanical ingredients it arose my curiosity.   For my teeth I have been trying a lot of product calling themselves \\&quot; fast results and safe\\&quot; but  after using them I got some serious consequences affecting my gum by those extreme chemical products. That made me give up all my hope of having a natural bright smile again. But when I found this gel and its components I could not resist to give it a try.  I am very satisfied and the results are real. I felt no pain at all and my assurance of knowing that I am using a botanical product motivates me to proceed the treatment.</li>
            <li> I have tried countless products over the years to try to get my teeth whiter. Mostly I have been disappointed until this one. I have sensitive teeth and trying to find a whitening product that doesn&#x27;t cause me pain and actually works has been a real challenge. When I used Shine Whitening I got fast whiter teeth, and no discomfort! It was much cheaper than going to the dentist to get them whitened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the other whitening products I have used either didn&#x27;t work well enough, caused me tooth and/or gum pain, or both. In addition,  most of the products I have used were more expensive than this one. All in all, I am very pleased with Shine Whitening and will use it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this 5 now &amp; it has done absolutely NOTHING! My teeth are not even the slightest bit whiter. I can&#x27;t see how this has worked for anyone at all!</li>
            <li> Light was defective, opened the packaging and the small directions that came with it mentioned protective battery liner to remove, but there was none. Which tells me that this was an already opened and used product. Opened the battery casing just to make sure and there was no protective film to remove to make the batteries work, just the batteries were in there. Closed the casing and pressed the on button, nothing happened. Saw that this is a common complaint from some of the other Amazon reviewers. Assume they either sent me a defective light, or one with dead batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, because of all the fake reviews I discovered on here between when I purchased the product and now receiving it, I&#x27;m not going to bother to purchase again. I&#x27;m just returning and going to try something else. Check all the March 11th reviewers - look at the other reviews they&#x27;ve written from their profiles on the same day and you&#x27;ll notice they have all reviewed the same products, which means they&#x27;re hired spammers. Which also explains why they&#x27;re not verified purchasers. Super shady. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed with this product.  I struggled with the mouth guards at first. The water was too hot apparently (I&#x27;ve been using sports guards for years and always used hot microwave water) and I ended up melting them.  Amazon was good enough to send me another package.  I used is just at the direction explained 2x a day for 15 minutes with the light.  My teeth weren&#x27;t all that bad according to the chart that was enclosed but still I expected some change. After 6 weeks. Still nothing.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love white teeth. I also love coffee, tea, red wine and berries. I&#x27;m also conscious about losing fluoride, so Shine Whitening was the perfect product for me. It is quick and easy to use, but without the peroxide. My teeth are whiter than ever and I still drink up to two cups of black coffee per day without the worry. The trays are also extremely comfortable; its as if they were molded for my teeth lol.</li>
            <li> The packaging makes me giggle because it&#x27;s so old school and 80&#x27;s looking. Did anyone else notice that? I still like this product though. I use it every other day so that my teeth doesn&#x27;t get used to it. (I alternate it with natural toothpaste) I&#x27;ve always liked using trays better those pesky strips. They fit better and doesn&#x27;t get all slimy and all in your mouth. The trays are also fairly flexible. Their website also gives a tutorial, which is a nice bonus. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of whitening products and like many of them except for the toothpastes...they don&#x27;t do much. But I digress.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of teeth whitening products in the past... none have worked this well. And here&#x27;s the thing: I hate going to the dentist and won&#x27;t unless I absolutely have to. But my teeth get stained from the pots of coffee I drink every day. Shine Whitening leaves my teeth looking just as good as they do when I get them professionally cleaned at the dentist, which I hate. Did I mention I hate going to the dentist? Ha. Sorry Dr. McCrory. You may not see me for a while.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to get my teeth whitened professionally but I could never really afford it and then I was also worried about how it would affect me since I have very sensitive teeth and I had heard horror stories from other people. Still I wanted to find a way to get the stains removed from my teeth. I tried over the counter products such as various mouth washes and toothpastes and they helped to an extent but didn&#x27;t really get them as white as I wanted them to be. Then I read about this product and decided to give it a try. it claims no sensitivity and it seemed easy enough to use at home. It really was, after the first use I could see a difference that I hadn&#x27;t seen with the other products I used. As an extra added plus it was also cheaper then going to get them done professionally.</li>
            <li> I am a coffee drinker and occasional smoker of cigars.  These simple pleasures have a drawback of course, which is that my teeth have become stained and in some parts are very dark yellow.  I bought Shine Whitening hoping to improve my teeth and make them the correct white color they should be again.  My problem with other products is that they hurt my teeth, and were dangerous because of the peroxide which eats away teeth enamel.  The great thing about this product is it has zero peroxide, so I can use it safely.  I have been using it for 4 weeks now and already see my teeth several shades whiter with the deep yellow stains reduced.  I will keep using Shine Whitening and see just how white my teeth can get.  Best of all,  I know I am doing no damage to my teeth.  Only making my smile nicer!</li>
            <li> I have always heard and have seen evidence of what coffee can do to teeth.  It is so unsightly.  I have never been one to drink coffee until the past year and I must say, my poor teeth have never been the same.  I have always taken pride in my white and perfect teeth (thanks to braces) so why on earth would I start drinking coffee to wreck all of my hard work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s simple, stress!  Do teeth whiteners really work?  Yes! They do! And only if you use it according to instructions.  Shine Whitening can restore your beautiful white smile and gently with no sensitivity and pain which is important for healthy teeth and gums.  It contains no Peroxide and is very easy to use.  You will most likely see your results in just a few days and smile with confidence again!</li>
            <li> For years I had tried to whiten my teeth with peroxide based products. I went through so much pain and expense only to have sad, sensitive, not-so-white teeth. Finally! Am affordable, safe, peroxide free whitening system that truly works. My pearly-whites haven&#x27;t gleamed so bright since I was a little one. The LED light component was honestly super cool - and on par with professional whitening centers I&#x27;ve visited in the past. Seriously, this is a revolution in teeth whitening...and I feel like a million dollars. A week later I bought a second package for my best friend.</li>
            <li> I actually love this product. A friend of mines won it on a web site called surveyswagger.com and she didn&#x27;t use it. I took it off her hands and it actually does work. I was a little shocked at first how white my teeth actually got so quickly but it does work. I haven&#x27;t had a chance yet to go to the store and purchase some more for myself but i definitely plan on getting some more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this Shine Whitening especially those people like me who are afraid to visit a dentist or doesn&#x27;t have dental insurance but want their teeth to look more white.</li>
            <li> My husband has a sensitive mouth. He likes how white my teeth look. So we looked for something to whiten his teeth without irritating his mouth. This whitener is a good deal and it worked well on his teeth. My husband told me that it is easy to use as well. It took a few weeks before we saw a difference. But it does work well after only a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I am a verified purchaser and bought this item despite the claims that this product is a scam. I&#x27;ve noticed a major difference after one day of use, my teeth are much whiter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using a qtip to apply it to your teeth and use the trays as a seal.</li>
            <li> Becareful of all the positive reviews. Most of then are not verified.... possible scam</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth. Eevery whitening treatment I had tried before this one caused so much sensitivity that I could use it without immediately feeling some sort of pain. This product does a great job of whitening my teeth. Removing the coffee stains and improving my smile. It does such a great job and is comfortable to use. No pain, no sensitivity. It works! This product gives me the results I have been looking for. It gives me the most dazzling smile. I keep getting compliments on my smile. I can stop looking in the mirror!</li>
            <li> After using this product for a few weeks I saw a very noticeable improvement! I got all kinds of compliments about how much whiter my teeth were. Buy buy buy! you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I have white teeth to begin with but I love to whiten to remove the surface stains from my daily coffee, occasional Diet Coke and wine.  I had a professional whitening kit from my dentist but I misplaced one of my trays and they want to charge me $150 to have new molds made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit is great.  It comes with everything you need.  The rubber trays look like mouth guards for playing sports, but you dip them into hot water and mold them to your teeth.  Be sure to push the rubber against your teeth with a little bit of pressure to make sure you get the perfect fit.  I put a tiny drop of the whitening gel on each tooth in the mold, keeping it in the center because you want to avoid contact with your gums.  Put they trays in and use the light to help accelerate the process.  I wear mine overnight since I grind my teeth anyway.  I only need to whiten about once a month, but this product doesn’t leave with me with any sensitivity so I’m sure it can be used daily until desired results are achieved.  Once I take the trays out, I rinse them out, brush them with a toothbrush and once their dry, store them in the pouch they came in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Shine Whitening.  Far cheaper than Crest Whitestrips 3D or the Zoom whitening.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not positive it&#x27;s working, but I think it is.  Could just be my new toothpaste too.</li>
            <li> I love this product! After a couple weeks I began to notice a nice difference. I also have a sensitivity issue and this is so great with that. I don&#x27;t feel any discomfort whatsoever. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Pay attention to the writing style in these reviews. Seem similar?  Probably from the same person. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> I used to be a smoker and drink lots of coffee and have had a hard time gaining back the pearly whites I had in my youth.  I&#x27;ve stopped smoking for years now and drink significantly less coffee, yet still have not been able to find a successful, cost-effective way to whiten my teeth.  I started using Shine Whitening a few months ago, and have finally seen success at work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Shine Whitening is super easy to use, basically fitting as a denture into the gums and provides a nice even whitening for teeth.  There&#x27;s absolutely no pain; I have very sensitive gums and have had a hard time finding a product or procedure that doesn&#x27;t cut my gums up or make me want to scream in agony.  The LED light makes the process so much easier and provides visibility while whitening.  I&#x27;ve never before had a product work with this much ease and efficiency, and I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has tried every alternative out there with little results or a crippled wallet.</li>
            <li> As someone who had braces for years, my teeth are very sensitive! This product was the only one which did not hurt or cause damage. It is gentle and my teeth look so much whiter than they had with other products I have tried. You really get results with this one. Definitely suitable for people with sensitive teeth and gums, and of course your teeth can finally return to their natural pearly state!</li>
            <li> There is a second gel for gentle teeth. That’s enough for five stars. It works and my teeth feel great.</li>
            <li> This works great. The little blue &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; device is comfortable and easy to use. Watch some of those commercials about teeth whitening products and you&#x27;ll notice a similar or identical blue &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; device.</li>
            <li> The best part, absolutely no sensitivity. But after extended use this product barely whitened my teeth.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend this product. Doesn&#x27;t work well &amp; falls apart quickly.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product as an incentive to continue with quitting smoking. When I finally went a week without one, I opened my Shine Whitening kit. I was pretty excited to finally rid myself of my stained smile, but sadly the reviews were too good to be true. First, I may have messed up, but I followed the instructions exactly. I heated up a mug of water and put the first tray in and it worked. When I went for the second one, the reheated water in the mug completely deformed the tray! I still went ahead with the whitening process, but when I got to the LED light it was dead. I was so angry and I immediately tried to call shine whitening. Of course, a machine answered. I left two messages a few days in between each other and still have yet to get a response.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. Aside from it being reasonably priced, it is also peroxide free. This is super important for me as every other teeth whitening product or mouthwash that I&#x27;ve used has caused slight to mildly irritating sensations. With this product, I feel no discomfort whatsoever. It has truly been a blessing, and I thank the heavens every time I see my pearly whites in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The system itself is fairly easy to use. It consists of trays that conform to your mouth to form a custom and snug fit. After using it once, I felt like a pro. It only takes up a few minutes of my day which is great considering that I lead a pretty hectic and active lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to recap - this product is affordable, easy to use, and peroxide free. I&#x27;d highly recommend it to anybody looking to whiten their teeth.</li>
            <li> I looked at a few of these reviews and noticed they almost all of them start with a story, which is strange. Seems like a promo you&#x27;d see on TV. Then I saw the lack of verified purchases. It just doesn&#x27;t add up. I doubt any of these reviews are true. I suggest you find a different product</li>
            <li> This stuff helps rebuild a bit of enamel which is great because my teeth are yellowing at a crazy rate but this has really kind of reversed time for me.</li>
            <li> This is a simple and easy way to whiten your teeth. The tray system is good and might take some work but it is good for you in the end. Molds to your teeth.</li>
            <li> I have Yellow Teeth and I am veru upset and feel embarassed to smile or show my teeth. I was a hesistant to laugh out loud.And with the help of a friend I came to know about this Shine Whitening.It really works good very gentle on out teeth .There will be no question of yellow teeth after using this .I would definitely recommend this Product.</li>
            <li> Drinking tea and coffee have taken my teeth from white to tan.  I tried whitening them before but my teeth are too sensitive.  When I found Shine Whitening with no sensitivity, I decided to give it a try.  Not only did I love the results, but people started commenting on how great my teeth looked asking who my dentist was.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth, so I really looked forward to this product. The trays were not easy to mold at all. The top one collapsed as I put it in my mouth and I was never able to get it to work right after that. So before I was able to use the whitener at all, the tray was ruined. I had to cut the bottom one almost in half. I have a very small mouth and it was way too big for me. The bottom tray never formed right either. Then I tried to put the gel on them and give it a try just to see if the trays would work at all, and I had to spit and rinse immediately! The pain was extremely sharp. The gel was worse than anything I have ever tried before. I don&#x27;t know how my experience with this gel could be so much worse than all of the others who reviewed this product. What use is the product now that the trays are not useful to anyone else in the family? What a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I was really satisfied with this product and before this i have used some other products but i did not find any result but after started using this product myself shocked because its showing the result and I have been using it for about 3 weeks and have noticed a huge improvement!.It was very easy to use and didn&#x27;t take a lot of time and i will recommend to other people ....</li>
            <li> This was my first time to use this kit. In the past, I had used Crest whitening strips, and I had my teeth professionally whitened at a health/beauty place in the mall. The Crest whitening strips irritated my gums, and the place and the mall charged hundreds of dollars. I tried this product because it claimed to be the same/similar process to the light trays used at the facility in the mall, and it claimed to not irritate gums like Crest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleased with the results. Without spending hundreds of dollars, my teeth were visibly whitened similar to the professional job I had done years ago.  Furthermore, and most importantly, my gums were not irritated!!!  Will buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> I needed this whitening system badly. I&#x27;m an avid caffeine drinker  and the yellowing of our teeth accumulates everyday. So it&#x27;s important to consistently  whiten our teeth. I&#x27;ve tried whitening strips,pens and of course the toothpastes. But I didn&#x27;t notice a significant change so I asked  my cousin and she  recommended this to me. Why didn&#x27;t I ever ask her before,she has beautiful white teeth. My teeth and gums are a bit sensitive so I love how gentle this product is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not only gentle but it&#x27;s easy to do and the trays are sturdy and fit my mouth without any hassle. This is just as good and arguably better than a dentist cleaning. I noticed my teeth  shade lighten noticeably just after one use. I was impressed. It&#x27;s become apart of my ritual to do it every other day. I no longer feel self conscious about smiling or guilty for having my favorite iced coffee :)</li>
            <li> If you want to make your teeth shining and brighter again, this is the product. One of my friends was already using it and I just happened to notice her transforming smile. She recommended me to use this product and after the very first treatment, I saw it working amazingly on my teeth. Now I have much brighter and whiter smile without any coffee or blueberry stains. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My life is filled with all kinds of things that stain teeth. Caffeinated beverages galore. Need to whiten teeth, looked on amazon for a good product. Found this and used it for a few days. I can use my teeth to white balance a camera now. Full steam ahead, order me another latte because Shine Zero is the wings beneath my bright, white teeth.</li>
            <li> My teeth are a lot better looking than before. I will keep using it and let you guys know how it looks in a month or more. It is really effective.</li>
            <li> I do use other whitening products but there was still room for improvement so I decided to give Shine Whitening a try and in conjunction with other products that I use. It took a few times to get to the desired whiteness I wanted, but overall effective product. For the price I think its a great buy. I would repurchase. in the future.</li>
            <li> The results are very good for this product. The trays are molded to fit my mouth and the results have been dazzling. My teeth are noticeably whiter and I am happy with that. I found this product to be cheaper than other ones that are similar so I’m also happy about the price.</li>
            <li> My schedule is horrible and I have been ingesting coffee like a madman. Too bad, because my teeth have taken a turn for the worse. They look kind of yellow-y and so I came on here to look for good reviews since I can&#x27;t break the bank on this one. Saw the reviews here and I am here to add to the good ones. I used it for a handful of treatments and my teeth are two tones lighter. Loving it.</li>
            <li> My daughter had good results with this, she had no complaints and no sensitivity.</li>
            <li> The whitening solution works very fast actually. Faster than I would have expected. Much better and simple to use as well. Will be using this product in the future. People at work are asking me about it so I have been referring them here. Will leave a review to tell the internet as well.</li>
            <li> Tray system is better than other systems out there. It conforms to your own mouth so it&#x27;s like having a personalized system in it. You do have to do a little work up top but other than that, you do need to run it under some hot water and then bite down to make a mark. Then you fill the tray with a little bit of gel, which does a decent job of whitening your teeth. Works very fast and ask anyone and i would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product is okay. The whitening is not very aggressive so it takes longer than some of the other products available. The included light is pretty bad. It does not spread the light evenly across your teeth and has left me with a streak on my front upper 2 teeth that is whiter than the rest of those teeth. Very poor design on the light.</li>
            <li> Teeth are looking whiter as we speak. No sensitivity felt, just a gleaning smile.</li>
            <li> Strips fall out of my mouth a lot of the time. It’s a hassle. But with the tray system here, Shine Whitening has me as a customer for the near future. Enjoy using this system as it’s easy to use.</li>
            <li> Completely loved this. It didn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive like other similar products. It was easy to use. And i loved the fast results</li>
            <li> You know that when other people start complimenting you on your smile that something has changed. I used to have a bunch of coffee stains and other light stains on the surface of my teeth which caused me never to smile showing my teeth. It was embarrassing and no matter what I did the damage was already done. I started using these whitening trays and as little as a week I noticed the stains slowly starting to fade away. Let&#x27;s see what happens after a month!</li>
            <li> Oo la la, do my teeth glisten. I love this product, and that it doesn&#x27;t have peroxide. I take pride in having clean and nice teeth. I floss twice a day, but i also drink coffee and tea throughout the day and this can have an effect on the whiteness. I was recommend this by a friend and though I was hesitant, I was proven wrong. I will be using it more often (at least whenever I see my teeth getting yellower).</li>
            <li> I drink coffee from 8 am until I run out of coffee. Usually 3-4 cups a day. Needless to say, my teeth get pretty stained. I&#x27;ve used all the major toothpastes promising to whiten my teeth to no effect. After trying Shine Whitening I have noticed a visible difference in the color of my teeth. Great product.!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had sensitive teeth. This led to me not caring for them as much as I should have, but even brushing and flossing can sometimes be painful. It&#x27;s been a long time since my smile started to fade, and I&#x27;ve been looking for something I can use at home to make them shine again. But most of the products out there contain peroxide or other chemicals that make them more painful than they are worth.&lt;br /&gt;I was so relieved to find Shine Whitening. At first I was a little overwhelmed when I saw it came with an LED light and all. But it&#x27;s very simple to use and I began seeing results after about a week. I&#x27;m so grateful to find a way to painlessly whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> Teeth whitening is no longer only for smokers or people who drink lots of coffee and red wine.  Studies have shown that natural aging can also discolor teeth.  Thanks to Shine Whitening, I was able to whiten my teeth in the comfort of my own home.  I did not need to spend hundreds at the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results from Shine Whitening are great!  My teeth are much whiter than before.  I don&#x27;t have to hide my teeth from the camera anymore when I am having my photo taken.  I am very impressed with this teeth whitening product.  I have told all of my friends about it.  I highly recommend Shine Whitening!</li>
            <li> Wow, definitely would NEVER consider purchasing after filtering through this boatload of FAKE reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE: All products are sold by the same \\&quot;Verified American\\&quot; and therein lies the heart of the problem. I wouldn&#x27;t trust this seller for a second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between groups of them being done on the exact same date with either a very short one sentence comment or weak attempt at being more elaborate (while still writing similar salesmen like narratives)and not ONE person has an issue with this product - but they ALL sound like infomercial testimonials or are auditioning to be a QVC host.  Just perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when looking at the 5 Star reviews, see what other products these phonies behind a keyboard have reviewed and it&#x27;s either the ONE product or the same products all across the board.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a shame a product can&#x27;t stand on it&#x27;s own and potential customers can&#x27;t come to Amazon and expect HONEST reviews by REAL customers: Shine White, TruFormula, NuNutrients,OmegaBoost, InfiniteGrowth.</li>
            <li> Great product but the website they recommend is just awful. No information on website worth any value</li>
            <li> I have been looking for years for something to remove my tea and coffee stains.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of products (many found right here on Amazon).  And this one is certainly one of the best products out there.  My tea and coffee stains are gone and I&#x27;m smiling again.  Yea!  And it didn&#x27;t hurt my mouth or gums.  Very good product... 5 stars for sure!</li>
            <li> I drink tons of coffee for work. I have to get up at 6 each morning so that will not be changing anytime soon. Unfortunately, that has left my teeth in less than pristine condition. So I came online and looked for a solution. Found this and used it for a couple weeks. My teeth are looking pretty good! I can continue with my horrible coffee habit and pass my teeth off as non-coffee drinkers. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I think this is junk. I purchased this after seeing such wonderful reviews here on Amazon and elsewhere. I tried using this many times and it didn&#x27;t improve the shade of my teeth even after I used up more than half of the delivered amount. I was skeptical in the beginning after looking at the website and noticing that most of the website is not functioning properly, and the only thing that really works is a YouTube video that demonstrates a generic teeth molding tray.</li>
            <li> The gel you apply into your mouth is very cool and refreshing, a slight minty taste that is welcoming. So the process is not horrible, and after a few treatments I have been gifted with whiter teeth. My teeth are probably two shades lighter than before which is great for me. It was yellowing pretty bad and it really has boosted my confidence. Five out of five.</li>
            <li> I’m  confident now to smile every time. I found this product easy to use and really made my teeth whiter in just few days of using it.</li>
            <li> So far so good! Been using this twice a day for two weeks and taking a few weeks off.  I have super sensitive teeth and haven&#x27;t felt any noticeable discomfort. I love that this is product has all natural ingrediants.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel great after this treatment. I have sensitive teeth so I was worried but it worked fine without any issues. My teeth are sparkling and my smile is contagious so it is a little bit of a public service for everyone in my area. Enjoy this product and the way people will look at your nice teeth from now on.</li>
            <li> Coffee is acidic and eats away at the enamel in our teeth. Coffee is also a very popular drink. Why don’t they package Shine  zero at Starbucks? Because after a few days of using this product my teeth look better than they have in years. It’s insane how well it works. I am astounded by how effective it has been.</li>
            <li> I am glad I can continue with my coffee habit and looking like I have a sparkling smile.</li>
            <li> Hurt my teeth, messed up the mold but that was my own fault. But my teeth were very sensitive to this so I really couldn&#x27;t see if it worked</li>
            <li> I received this product for testing purposes with a commitment to post an honest product review.  After testing this product EXACTLY as instructed on the package, my teeth were whiter and not sensitive AT ALL. Now with that being said, this is more work compared to the crest white strips I have used in the past. With this product you will mold trays for your teeth, put whitening gel inside the tray, insert the trays in the mouth, and then put the LED light in the mouth. Then you have to go around like that for 15 minutes... and this is to be done twice a day. This is quite a process, but if you do it exactly as directed, you will see results. I did it for about a month, consistently, and my teeth are white and people have noticed. The crest white strips are easier, but they left my teeth feeling so thin and super sensitive! They can&#x27;t be good for your teeth.  I couldn&#x27;t dare eat a popsicle and really cold drinks hurt my teeth so bad after using them. I had no problems at all with sensitivity or my teeth having a brittle/thin feeling. That is probably what I like the best. I don&#x27;t have to spend a fortune getting my teeth whitened at the dentist and my teeth still feel great.  It is worth the effort but stay committed to it once you start to see results!</li>
            <li> I received the product for free or a discounted amount for an unbiased and honest opinion....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I was able to try Shine Whitening. I drink a lot of coffee. Everyone knows that coffee tend to stain your teeth. Brushing alone does not always get your teeth 100% white.  This whitening system is easy to use. The instructions  comes with it and is very easy to follow. In the kit you get 2 mouth guards. You dip in hot water to mold to your teeth. You get 2 syringes of tooth whitener, a little blue LED light, and a tooth shade chart. I really didn&#x27;t see results until my second time using the kit.  I noticed my teeth were on there watt to being bright white</li>
            <li> PACKAGE CAME OPENED AND GEL WAS LEAKING ALL OVER.  WAS NOT IMPRESSED WITH THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I use a tooth whitening product along with this one because I have sensitive teeth. The two products together do a bang up job and my teeth don&#x27;t hurt when applying. I have a receding gum line so I definitely needed a product for sensitive teeth. The price is right and the product does the trick!</li>
            <li> My teeth are always sensitive!! So using Crest White strips has been a pain in the past. No more though!! This whitening kit is great for sensitive teeth. Its definitely awkward to have the UV light hanging out of your mouth for 15 minutes, but my teeth like shades whiter even after one use!!</li>
            <li> I brush every day and floss just about every day. It’s inevitable that our teeth will discolor a bit. That is a shame. The real color of our enamel is actually yellowish. Despite this, I started using brilliant and it has done wonders for my teeth. The truth is we’re going to need a little bit of help. I use it about three times a week and my teeth have never looked better. I won’t be stopping anytime soon.</li>
            <li> My confidence is up and people have noticed that my teeth are whiter, or at least that I’m smiling a lot more often. This product is simple to use and fits easily in my mouth now. The gel is cool and minty. I enjoy using the product a few times a week and my teeth have become a bit more white than before.</li>
            <li> My friends and family have very much noticed my teeth. I just had a birthday party and everyone was talking about my teeth. Won’t say the age but let’s just say that my teeth looked about five to ten years younger than me! Great. I’m very happy with the results. Found the system easy to use and everything is great.</li>
            <li> I used to feel bad about my teeth, they were yellowish. Not even that much, but a little yellow sucks. I started to whiten my teeth with Shine Whitening  and I feel a lot better about myself, so the results are excellent. I find the product very well priced and easy to use as well.</li>
            <li> I found the tray system extremely easy to use and there is a little work up top to mold it to your mouth but it saves time because it fits in your mouth exactly.</li>
            <li> I kind of feel like an idiot for buying into this. You can&#x27;t whiten without peroxide. The other reviews are bought or faked. Please don&#x27;t buy this, I didn&#x27;t learn until after I did.</li>
            <li> I started an early job last year and I guess in addition to becoming a little older, my enamel is burning off my teeth thanks to all the coffee. Teeth are actually yellow in color but the enamel is white. Not sure how Shine  zero works but it does. My teeth look five, ten years younger and I’m happy with the results. Five out of five.</li>
            <li> **I received this product in return for an honest review. All thoughts and opinions are my own.**&lt;br /&gt;  I have never tried a whitening system before since I am have always been skeptical and a little paranoid with some of the ingredients do to teeth. However years of drinking tea have taken a toll on my teeth and they are not a bright as they used to be. I have tried everything toothpaste, mouth wash and nothing seemed to touch the stains. So when I had the opportunity to review this product I figured I might as well try it since I have tried everything else and failed. The instructions were easy to understand and I was really happy that they gave product information and safety  as well. The trays mold to your teeth so it makes it comfortable to use and I just leave it in for 15 minutes and I am done. There is an optional UV light for a brighter smile.I have noticed a difference about a week and a half into using it. I am REALLY impressed!</li>
            <li> The results are never like what is advertised.  Take a look at my before, during, and after pictures.  My teeth shade isn&#x27;t super different after several attempts with this product.  The teeth whitening trays did not even mold to my teeth properly.  The majority of the 5 star ratings for this product are unverified purchases.  I returned to Amazon for a refund.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth so I know what I’m talking about when I say most products hurt my teeth. I even use toothpaste for sensitive teeth. Well this product, if you want you can apply it with a cotton swab. I controlled the amount of substance so it was gentle on my teeth and gums. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Strips keep falling out of my mouth when I put them in, it’s insane. I started using this product and nothing has fallen out yet. It’s very efficient and when you use the tray system it makes it easy for you to apply the gel to your teeth. My results have been very good in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I am continuing to use this product. I bought it on a whim because I saw it was inexpensive and I read the reviews and my teeth could use a little whitening. I am very impressed with what happened next. I went home and took it out of the box, then read the instructions and stuck the mouth tray into my mouth, forming a fit that fits perfectly. Then for a few weeks I did the procedure for a few minutes every week. Now my teeth look world’s better. It’s not rocket science and I’m happy with the results.</li>
            <li> My smile has really improved since starting to use Shine Whitening. My teeth feel fantastic and look great. They are whiter than ever. I really enjoy the tray system and my mouth and smile have been attracting onlookers and I have been receiving comments from my coworkers. Enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> Only a few times of maybe 30 minutes each can improve my teeth so drastically.  I only used it a few times before Shine zero showed me that my teeth don’t have to look stained. I did it about 3x a week and after a month of used my teeth were maybe two shades lighter. It really works.</li>
            <li> Got the product last weekend and was pretty surprised by how fast it worked! It is really strong so be careful not to put too much of the solution in the trays. Other than that I really like it</li>
            <li> I used it about twice a week for a couple months and my results have been stellar. You can just brush the gel onto your teeth with a cotton swab and it works almost as well.</li>
            <li> So far I am really impressed with this whitening kit. I have never tried to whiten my teeth before. I am 69 years old, a smoker and a heavy coffee drinker. I have always brushed my teeth with a whitening tooth paste at least twice a day, but noticed that my teeth were becoming a shade of gray. Like some may, I attributed this to age and a gradual reduction of enamel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading numerous reviews on the various teeth whitening products, I decided that I didn&#x27;t want to use a product with peroxide. I had a problem with tooth sensitivity in the past, and I really didn&#x27;t want that again. So I decided to try this product. The worst case scenario would be that I flushed $30. I am so glad that I tried this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day I got it, I had to try it right away. The directions for molding the trays weren&#x27;t the best. So I made a mess of the trays, but they were still good enough to be used. I put a bead of the solution in the trays, put them in my mouth with the included light, and left it all in my mouth for 15 minutes. To tell you the truth, it really wasn&#x27;t my idea of a good time. Fortunately, I can somewhat control salivation. So I didn&#x27;t drool. The short 15 minutes seemed like forever, but my anticipation of whiter teeth helped me to stick it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I did!! I could see a difference in the color of my teeth in the first application!!  Since the first application, I have ordered a set of 10 trays and have made a set that fit perfectly. I have used this kit twice a day for the last 4 days, and there is a remarkable difference in the whiteness of my teeth. Considering my age and my smoking and coffee habits, I don&#x27;t think I can achieve the pearly whites of a movie star, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results I have had so far. I am also happy that this system has caused absolutely no discomfort or tooth sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to continue using this at least once a day for as long as I continue to see results. Each time I use it my teeth look better. Maybe I will eventually have the pearly whites!!t my teeth look better. Maybe I will eventually have the pearly whites!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know how to operate the light, it doesn&#x27;t work. Website they stated on the box has no link - Lame. And if you click on the review that shows pictures....woman in the pictures with whiter teeth isn&#x27;t the same woman who wrote the review....how did that happen ? After I read all reviews again I sent it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All 5 stars reviews are fake, I clicked on several....all reviews are written on the same day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go to your dentist pay 150 - to get started with the mold for your mouth and one Whitening Colgate kit then buy the whitening paste refill on Amazon for 35.- something (look on my review)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; No dentist pays me to say this, I don&#x27;t need money I have enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And people who don&#x27;t think my review is helpful are trolls from this company.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type of person that can get results the first application with peroxide kits (Rembrandt).  Somehow I didn&#x27;t notice instant results with this zero-peroxide product.  And it doesn&#x27;t have that squeaky clean feeling either.  At least it&#x27;s not making my teeth feel sensitive.  I&#x27;ve only tried one application.  I&#x27;ll update after a few more.</li>
            <li> With a baby on the way I couldn&#x27;t afford to pay the price of professional teeth whitening.  A friend of mine recommended this product to me and boy am I glad she did!  After just a couple of uses I noticed a major difference and so did everyone around me.  Nothing like an inexpensive product that actually works!</li>
            <li> This is part of looking good every day. Whiter teeth leads to a better look. I use this about three times a week and I feel great about my teeth</li>
            <li> I love that it works without peroxide. I have really sensitive teeth, and have tried other products out there- they hurt!!! This one seriously brightened and whitened overnight. It was crazy how much a difference white teeth makes. It is so easy to use!!! I just ordered another one-- I used to buy it from a local Wholesaler, but can&#x27;t seem to find it anymore. Such a relief to find it on here!</li>
            <li> After using the Shine Whitening-Zero Peroxide Teeth Whitening System for 4 days my teeth have become slightly brighter.  I didn&#x27;t have any sensitivity to the product.  As with teeth whitening systems that use peroxide this one is gentler on the gums and cheeks.  It did take a couple days for my teeth to start showing any difference but it does.  I drink a lot of Coke Zero with caffeine in it and I love fruit.  So the stain on my teeth was hard to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This product was easy to use.  You boil some water in the microwave and place the mouth piece in the cup about 10 seconds.  After that time the tray feels soft enough to place on your teeth to mold to your teeth.  You take them out of your mouth and trim off the tab and rinse.  You place a small amount of the whitening gel from the syringe in the trays on the side of your teeth that show when you smile.  Do this on both trays.  Place them in your mouth and insert the light resting them against your trays for 15 minutes twice a day.  Remove them and rinse them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  You will like this product.  It works well.  This product arrived quickly and was packaged safely.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and all opinions are based on my personal experience with the Shine Whitening-Zero Peroxide Teeth Whitening System.  As always, my words and my opinions are 100% my very own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve talked to my dentist about it but he just suggested using whitening product on regular basis. I choose this Shine  Zero and it makes my teeth become whiter. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it seems complicated at first but is actually simpler than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I use it multiple times a week and it’s a lot less hassle just putting this in your mouth that is made to fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m surprised Crest or someone else hasn’t made something like this for people who can’t keep the ridiculous strips in their teeth to stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth have become a lot whiter than before i used Shine Zero.</li>
            <li> I have been getting comments at work regarding my smile. While my teeth have been noticeably whiter to me, I think it’s the fact that I have a brighter smile and I am more willing to show them off that makes them better. Anyway, thanks to this product I feel better about myself a bit.</li>
            <li> I brush every day twice, sometimes three times if I can get the third one in. But even with the most stringent routine, my teeth have seen better days color-wise. I started using this product and immediately my teeth display a difference. My choppers are whiter and I think it’s a great thing.</li>
            <li> I use it maybe twice a week and my teeth have improved in whiteness. I slowed it down to once a week because I feel like I didn’t need so many sessions but it pretty much maintained the color.</li>
            <li> My teeth are whiter. That’s it. The price is good too. You stick the trays in your mouth to make them fit, then you continue to use them maybe two times a week an your teeth get whiter. That’s about it. I can’t really say anything else except that the product definitely worked for me and I can see a difference on my teeth and in my smile.</li>
            <li> It brightens your teeth after just one use, but mine are still mildly sensitive afterwards. Nothing bad. Not like regular peroxide whitening products I&#x27;ve used. Overall I&#x27;m impressed. I do use mine with clear trays I got years ago from my orthodontist. Maybe that makes a difference? I don&#x27;t know. Love this though and will order again!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and hate the taste of chemicals in mouth. I ran across this strip and had to put it to the test. I can&#x27;t eat ice cream or drink hot chocolate with out my teeth bothering me. My friend actually said here try this, so I did. And wow, not only was there no chemical taste, but it did not hurt for me to remove it like most. There was also no build up my teeth. It also did not feel the weird feeling normally from the tempature of the item. I say look no further!!!</li>
            <li> So many different teeth whiteners so I decided to put this one to the test I drank some coffee smoked a couple of cigarettes anything I could think of to stain my teeth then I used this product must say it worked really well</li>
            <li> After years of smoking and drinking my teeth are embarrassingly ugly in terms of color. I can&#x27;t afford to have a dentist whitening my teeth so I figured I&#x27;d do it myself. The results were amazing, it&#x27;s totally changed my smile and has given me so much more confidence in myself. The trays that come with it are so great to, it made the experience so much easier, and the light that goes on is a huge help too. I love shine whitening and what its done for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I was looking for a good system to help whiten my teeth after I got braces removed. It took about 2 to see results and they were amazing! Will purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> My friends and family have definitely noticed that my teeth are whiter. They couldn’t tell exactly what it was, which is great because then that means my smile is brighter and they couldn’t pinpoint what I improved, just that overall my look is “better.” I started using this product a few weeks ago and after only a handful of treatments I am sporting a whiter smile and a friendlier face.</li>
            <li> There is a little bit of mint taste in the gel, which makes it easier to use this product.</li>
            <li> This product whitens the enamel and I’m really happy it has a second gel—I think the second gel works. It is there to help with the remineralization of your teeth. It helps with sensitivity and also rebuilding enamel. My teeth surely are whiter so I know this product worked for me. Very happy.</li>
            <li> This is a great value if you like having a shining smile. Like some of the other reviewers have said, this is a great deal if you are looking to get whitening done on the cheap. It does a good job and the set up is very easy to use and I had no problems whatsoever. I think it works better than other systems and I think it’s a no brainer to get this product.</li>
            <li> Friends have been asking me what I use on my teeth and I tell them Shine Whitening. I have been using this for only a couple weeks and so far the results have been spectacular. I use the mouth trays and some of my friends have also complained about having problems with other systems that don’t have such an easy to use protocol. Strips and such slip off our teeth and we’ve all had those problems in the past but kiss those goodbye.</li>
            <li> I drink a lot of coffee and I’m glad to say that after a few sessions my teeth are a lot better looking than before. I will keep using it and let you guys know how it looks in a month or more, but for now a big thumbs up for this product.</li>
            <li> My dentist even knew that I was using teeth whitening. We’ve gone back many years and so for him to notice such a thing it must be working out on me. That’s pretty cool. The tray system works and I found if fairly easy to use. There was just a little work up top to chomp down on the piece of plastic to mold into your teeth. But after that everything was easy peasy.</li>
            <li> I have used many teeth whitening solutions before this one and this is cheap and easy. I have seen some other ones for less money but the quality was not there. Either they did not work or were so flimsy or garbage. But not this product. This one delivers the goods and my teeth are happier for it.</li>
            <li> The tray system is made to fit in your mouth, so you should use it, because it was made for everyone’s mouth. It works and it’s a better system than some other products I’ve seen on the market.</li>
            <li> I’ve always been self-conscious about my teeth. They were crooked as a child so I got braces as I got older. And then by the time they were straight they had been stained by a horrible smoking habit I picked up as a teenager. I was hesitant to try this product out just because I felt defeated by my teeth, but I’m so glad I did, based on the other amazon reviews here. My teeth have looked better than ever, probably the best they ever have. The tray system is easy and the fluid is great—I probably stick it in my mouth for 20 minutes per session and about four times a week. I feel more confident and I am more willing to smile now. Thanks Shine Whitening.</li>
            <li> I’ve had good experiences with this product. I’m happy with having a brighter smile around the office and at the club. I swear I see a difference in people’s reaction to me. Maybe I’m making it up psychologically. Or maybe I just have more confidence now that my teeth are a few shades whiter. I only use it twice a week and I get good results.</li>
            <li> My gums may be beyond repair after using this once. Beware of this product. I followed the instructions exactly and applied the tray with the light for 15 minutes on just my bottom teeth. To my horror, my gums had dramatically receded. It doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s going to bounce back either. I really wish I didn&#x27;t buy this product now. I only expected some sensitivity or pain to be the worst case scenario for trying this once, not instant receded gumline.</li>
            <li> I find that if my smile looks good I smile more often. I lost 20 pounds and my face was looking great and I was smiling more. I started to use Shine Whitening and after just a few treatments I was smiling a lot more. My teeth were a little yellow and I found that a whiter smile was where my face just looked great.So I guess what I’m saying is that a whiter smile by maybe three or four degrees is the equivalent of losing 20 pounds. It feels so great.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t know what to think about this, when my girlfriend first picked it up for me (I drink coffee daily, and was a smoker for years...while my teeth weren&#x27;t yellow, they weren&#x27;t exactly white either).  I was hesitant to use it, and even waited a few weeks to start...    But my nervousness was unnecessary, because this kit is awesome!  It&#x27;s comfortable, and doesn&#x27;t take much time out of your day at all!  But most of all, it&#x27;s awesome because of how well it works!  My teeth are super white, with all the residue from coffee and cigarettes completely gone!  If this is a problem for you, I would def recommend you try this.  It will help!    Of course, now my girlfriend won&#x27;t stop talking about how right she was lol...</li>
            <li> I work in the customer service industry and have to greet and speak with customers all the time. Depending on what I eat for lunch (anything with spinach, really), I&#x27;ll be sure to check my teeth in the mirror afterwards. But, as an avid coffee drinker and years of smoking (I have since quit), my teeth are not as white as they used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend of mine suggested this product to me and I noticed a tremendous difference after about a week! It is amazing how much sparkling white teeth not only enhance your smile, but also make your skin tone look richer by its offset quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s great about this product is that it is easy to use, doesn&#x27;t take much time out of your day, it doesn&#x27;t make your teeth too sensitive like other products do, and it&#x27;s comfortable. I still drink about two to three cups of coffee a day, but with regular brushing and occasional upkeep, my teeth are always sparkling white. I&#x27;ve never had a more confident smile.</li>
            <li> In just about a week I noticed the difference in the whiteness of my teeth. I am beyond happy I purchased Shine Whitening! I am beyond excited that it actually works and apart from making my teeth beautifully white, it gives great breath as well. Easy to use, and inexpensive if you ask me. It works wonders for that price. Especially compared to these other super expensive brands out there that do not work as great as this one. When I run out, I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> As a front desk associate at work, I always have to wear a wonderful smile to keep clients comfortable and happy. I also am a heavy coffee drinker. I was looking for a healthy alternative to whiten my teeth and minimize sensitivity. What I like most about Shine Whitening is that is uses less chemicals and the LED light speeds up the whitening process and makes me feel like a professional at home!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly good product!  Never had whitening results with other products.</li>
            <li> it made a difference on my pearly whites right away.</li>
            <li> It’s only 15 minutes a day and real easy to use. In a few days my teeth were great, back to normal, actually whiter than before. Thanks for saving my photo day.</li>
            <li> Got the product on time, package exactly as described A+ seller. The whitening system is good for those of us who have crooked teeth, the trays fit perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> Waste of money and time. The Crest Strips are better. My light did not even work. Luckily  or not so lucky for me this ended up being the same crap my sister purchased a few years ago and gave to me so I still had her light.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty good but the trays are WAY too big for my mouth. I have and always have had a small mouth so it barely even fit in there. I did however see a vast improvement in the way my teeth changed. They where whiter after just a few uses. Love the product but they should have a variety of different sized trays for smaller mouths for sure.</li>
            <li> my teeth are so much whiter than before</li>
            <li> When I got this product in the mail I was a little apprehensive. It has amazing reviews, but I am a skeptic at heart. I have used other whitening products and toothpastes, but this system tops them all! The instructions that it comes with are very easy to understand and give information on product safety as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the second use, I could notice a spot on one of my teeth that has been stained for years starting to fade! Since brightening my teeth and my smile, I have become more confident about smiling. This has been such a boost to me personally as someone who has struggled with the way that my teeth look for most of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely going to be recommending this product to any of my friends that are looking for a teeth whitening system. Thank you to the maker of this product, you have given me a smile worth showing off!</li>
            <li> I didn’t have any sensitivity issues but if you do I would suggest using it less, own to once a week. And if that persists you can apply the gel using a cotton swab instead of the mouth tray. I use the tray and it works fine with me, but at one point I thought I lost it and used the q tip and it was fine. It turned out it was in the downstairs bath and while that’s great, it’s not like this product is that expensive. I would have just bought another one, easy.</li>
            <li> The gel has a nice pleasant flavor that I do not hate. So when I do use this product I feel like I am freshening up my breath too. But more importantly my teeth look great.</li>
            <li> Yep, very happy. Used the product and my teeth are whiter. I have some sensitive teeth so I have to be careful but I did not have issues with this gel.</li>
            <li> I’m feeling more and more confident every time I look in the mirror. I found this product easy to use and really made my teeth whiter.</li>
            <li> This is a good deal for you. I have seen so many teeth products over the years that I can spot a deal when I see one. This is a great price for what it does. Sometimes cheaper products aren’t as good as regular priced ones, but from what I can tell, this is the real deal. I bought some and after a few treatments my teeth are whiter than ever.</li>
            <li> Considering that this is a bargain I would say buy it. There are comparable items that do similar things that Brilliant does but none as cheap. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Only a handful of treatments before my teeth looked like new. Pretty cool if you ask me. The tray system was easy to use and very simple.</li>
            <li> My teeth hurt during lots of things, eating sometimes even. But Shine zero does a good job of not hurting me. My teeth look great and are painless.</li>
            <li> Zero peroxide Teeth Whitening, I figured it wouldn&#x27;t work but thought I&#x27;d try this product. I&#x27;ve used the peroxide based teeth whitening systems over the years and while they do whiten the teeth my gums were so sensitive and my dentist told me it actually made my receding gums worse. That&#x27;s not really what I wanted to hear. So, when I had the chance to review this product and purchased it at a reduced price I figured what would I have to lose?&lt;br /&gt;This teeth whitening set came with an upper and lower tray that you drop in a cup of water that has been brought to a boil, after leaving the trays in the water for just a few seconds you then put them one at a time in your mouth to form around your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all there is to that part, then when they have cooled you simply put a bead of the teeth whitening gel into the trays (be sure to cut off the tab at the front of each tray) insert into your mouth and use the LED blue light device that comes with the set.&lt;br /&gt;I left mine in my mouth for about 10 minutes each time, that&#x27;s all I had time for, I noticed a difference after 3 times. I drink a lot of coffee and red wine and my teeth are usually pretty stained. I like the fact that it worked and I didn&#x27;t have the peroxide on my gums!&lt;br /&gt;So, my honest opinion is that this is a very good product for those of you like me who want to have whiter, brighter teeth without the damaging effects of peroxide.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when ordering this because how could a teeth whitening kit without those harsh ingredients whiten your teeth? I was wrong! The Shine whitening system made a difference with one application. The kit comes with a set of easily formable mouth guards and case, instructions on the package, 2 tubes of whitening gel, an applicator head for the gel, a teeth color paper (to compre the color of your teeth before and after) and an LED light. The instructions were extremely way to follow. The mouth guards molded perfectly to my teeth following the instructions. Heat water in the microwave to boiling temperature (I did 5 min on high power in an 1100w microwave). Dip the pieces one by one into the cup, shake off excess water, put in mouth and suck out any air or bubbles while pushing the molds on your teeth with your fingers. Easy Peary!! The gel did not make my teeth sensitive by any means. I have previously used dental grade whitening kits and could never complete my treatment due to sensitivity. I am happy that I had zero sensitivity with the shine whitening. The LED light requires that you remove the batteries first as the batteries have a plastic piece in between them that needs to be removed prior to use. Having the LED light in your mouth for the 15 minutes was a little weird at first, but you get used to it. There is increased saliva production while using...for me at least. After following removal instructions I immediately noticed a difference in the color of my teeth. It was amazing! I am going to continue using this product for 4 weeks and will update with before and after photos. PS..the gel isn&#x27;t bs tasting either!&lt;br /&gt;* I purchased this item to review during a promotional period. These are my own personal honest and unbiased opinions*</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if people are getting paid to post all these 5 stars but this stuff absolutely does not work. Seriously, don&#x27;t cheap out and buy the whitening strips instead. Aside from not working it is very time consuming. With the strips I can at least put them on and be on my way if I&#x27;m in a rush.</li>
            <li> I wanted to ask the cute guy who works the counter at the gym out and I knew I had to look great so I’ve been doing squats and stairmaster. Wanted to round out the look so I got this and stuck the tray in my mouth everyday for a few days and I could see it looked different in the mirror. Well he said yes and we went out for coffee. Since coffee ruins teeth too I kept up the teeth whitening. We’re getting married in two weeks! Just kidding. But we’re doing fine. I’m excited about my bae and brilliant is to thanks at least a little bit.</li>
            <li> My smile is so much whiter than before. I can see it in photos an in the mirror and it’s just so obvious. I use this product about three times a week for a few weeks and my teeth have almost never been brighter. I can’t remember seeing them like this. I am very pleased with how it all turned out and it’s not bad for the price either.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any improvement in whiteness with my first application of this product. It may take a while to work so I will continue to use it. The only thing I was really worried about was my teeth becoming overly sensitive for the next few weeks. This happens with almost every brand that I have used before. Not the case with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to use a teeth whitening system, but the make me nervous. When I found this product, I liked that it was made of botanical ingredients as opposed to really harsh chemicals that could be harmful. I was really skeptical about the trays conforming to my mouth, but they did. I was real easy to use and had everything you need to whiten your teeth. I was shocked to see results right away after using it. Now I can drink my tea and have white teeth! I will definitely use again.</li>
            <li> My teeth always had a brownish tint on them because I&#x27;m a heavy coffee drinker I figured that&#x27;s how they&#x27;d stay. A friend recommended this brand to me and I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month with nothing but positive whitening results! I will definitely be purchasing again</li>
            <li> I have tried various teeth whitening systems and trips to the dentist before but when I found Shine Whitening - Zero Peroxide Teeth Whitening System, I was amazed at the results. First of all, it is very economical as it saves you a lot of money and a trip to the dentist. What I like about this product is its features such as Zero-Peroxide formula and it uses botanical ingredients made in the USA. Also the experience is the same as visiting the dentist. So I did not feel much difference and it could be done conveniently from home. I have recommended it to all my family and friends and they are hooked on it too. I have even sent this product back home in India and they are happy with it too as they could not find a similar product that was even close to it over there. I just love Shine Whitening and you will love too when you try this product.</li>
            <li> Man every teeth whitener that I have ever used has been a dud. Got this one after trying cheaper to mid price items thinking maybe if I invest in a good product that my results will change a bit. And what do you know you really do get what you pay for. This whitener was easy to use and didn&#x27;t irritate my teeth too much. After the first use I noticed a difference. Stop buying the cheap whiteners that you see at the grocery store and actually invest in a quality product. I think that you&#x27;ll be pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li> After smoking for 12 years I finally quit. I needed something to get rid of my stained teeth. Smiling made me self-conscious and I wanted to get something that really worked without costing an arm and a leg. I tried the teeth whiting brands in walmart and they did not work out for me. I have very sensitive teeth and thankfully Shine Whitening doesn&#x27;t irritate my teeth at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got my package in the mail, it kind of looked like a science project, but using the mouth trays with the LED lights really felt fun. After using Shine Whitening for about a week, I started to notice that my teeth were looking so much better! I&#x27;m on week two now and my teeth look awesome. They are white and my lipstick looks great against my teeth. My breath even smells better, which I didn&#x27;t really expect. I recommend Shine whitening to anyone who wants more bang for their buck.</li>
            <li> Wow! This is definitely the best whitening product I have personally used. I&#x27;ve tried a ton of different companies and a bunch of home remedies for my old stained teeth, who would have thought it would have just been as easy as this. It&#x27;s also American made, so I&#x27;m not worried about odd chemicals coming from different countries, and there&#x27;s no peroxide, which I&#x27;ve tried. Also I&#x27;ve had lots of stains on my teeth from drinking way too much wine and smoking cigarettes for half my life. I thought I would never have my perfect white teeth back.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with easy to use trays and an LED light that, in my opinion, really speeds up the process. And it doesn&#x27;t leave a gross film on your teeth like other products. I would recommend buying this product to anyone that is trying to rid their teeth of Nasty yellow stains; that&#x27;s why I bought one for my wife and my mother, who both smoke cigarettes and drink wine as well. For the price it&#x27;s definitely worth a shot for anyone that&#x27;s skeptical. Also, just to add in here- FREE Shipping! And it&#x27;s QUICK! It got to my home in only 2 business days from the date of purchase.</li>
            <li> I began to see results almost immediately.  I monitored my teeth daily and there was an initial gradual whitening of my teeth that turned to a marked improvement in my teeth color in a very short time.  Must have been just been in just over a week.  The results were much better than I expected and much quicker than I anticipated.  But hey, I am not complaining I am just excited about such great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s more, is that Shine Whitening did not impact my teeth in any way I did not want.  I was concerned about my teeth&#x27;s sensitivity but there was no issue with that.  This product really works.  And it works without any of the negative side effects that have caused me problems with similar products in the past.  And at this price I really feel that I found a true winner</li>
            <li> As a matter of habit, I usually get my teeth professionally whitened once every couple of years or so.  It&#x27;s uncomfortable, invasive, expensive, and often leaves my gums stinging for days afterwards.  But it works, and no other store-bought product could substitute.  Until I started using Shine Whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shine Whitening works just as well as professional whitening at a dentist&#x27;s office, costs a tiny fraction of the price, and is infinitely more comfortable to implement.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now, and my teeth are whiter than ever - even more so than right after a professional whitening.  It is a great product and a solid, inexpensive alternative to the dentist&#x27;s chair.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> We often write reviews when we have had a negative experience, and we neglect to give credit when a product does exactly what it claims to do. I followed the detailed instructions on Shine Whitening and I noticed a vast improvement my teeth having a yellow veneer became whiter and whiter. After about 10 days my smile was resilient and a strong brilliance of only white.The yellow stains vanished!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my teeth brightened by my dentist and it cost me $100 and about an hour&#x27;s time. With Shine Whitening it is a much easier process with much less time and no time captivated in a dental chair. So take it from me if you want to see a remarkable improvement that will illuminate you smile and attitude, try Shine Whitening, you will surely be as impressed with the product as I have been.</li>
            <li> I have white teeth!!!! Ha, sorry, couldn&#x27;t help it. Affordable and effective. The best way to describe this product!! It was easy to use and I could see great results!! As much as I was happy to see results, I was even more excited that this is made in the US. Made in the US and NO PEROXIDE!! I definitely recommend this to anyone that is looking for a safe way to whiten their teeth without going to the dentist.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I have the most sensitive teeth - any liquid that is above or below room temperature makes me wince. Unfortunately I&#x27;m also a heavy smoker (I know, I know, I should quit) and this had really taken a toll on my once bright smile. I tried an at-home tooth whitening system before, but it left me in absolute agony from the peroxide. When I found Shine Whitening for sensitive teeth, I practically cried with joy. The system was easy to use and gentle on my poor teeth, and three weeks later my teeth are noticeably whiter and brighter. Others close to me have even commented on my smile, and for the first time in a long time I&#x27;m not embarrassed to open my mouth. I wish I had taken a before picture so you all could see the results for yourselves. I would buy this product again in a heartbeat and have already reccommended it to my friends and family. And really, you can&#x27;t beat the price when you think about how much professional teeth whitening services cost.</li>
            <li> As someone with hyper-sensitive teeth, I have to be really careful about which dental hygiene products I use. I tried some of the big brand name whitening systems, but they hurt my teeth too much to continue using them. I was so excited to find a teeth whitening system that is specifically designed for sensitive teeth! Shine Whitening&#x27;s zero peroxide system was a life saver! Now my teeth are sparkling white.</li>
            <li> Only a few treatments and I am about two shades lighter in the teeth. Whitening solution works very fast. Simple to use.</li>
            <li> Since using Shine Whitening  about a month ago, I’ve caught so many ridiculous compliments I thought I was being pranked. Nobody has ever commented on my smile or my teeth but now it’s all “You have a nice smile” and “Wow, white teeth.” Some are from cute girls. I am not complaining. Thanks Shine Whitening. I will keep using this product until my life is over.</li>
            <li> I love getting colonics because it makes me feel clean on the inside, and Shine zero makes my mouth feel like it’s gone through a teeth colonic. I feel fresh and I’m ready to eat all the chocolate cake at the bakery I work at. Shine zero is the reverse of a coffee enema, because coffee would stain teeth and this product does the opposite of that. It’s all part of my routine now. I brush, floss, use Shine zero. I meditate during the time we have to wait and it’s about good enough to do one TM period. It’s all about consolidating the time we have into efficient productivity.</li>
            <li> Before I started using the product, I went to the Shine Whitening website for more information. As a former editor, I was concerned about the inconsistency between the directions on the package and the directions on the website. One says to use the product twice a day; the other says once. The package includes a ultraviolet light, which you are instructed to use with the product. The website has no information about this step and feature. I question the quality of the product when the user information has so many inconsistencies.  I have used the product for 5 days (just once a day), however, and I am seeing results. It&#x27;s a little cumbersome to stuff so much in your mouth at once, but it&#x27;s worth it, if it works.</li>
            <li> Has not whitened at all.</li>
            <li> My smile is brighter and I am more willing to flash it to people now that I know that it looks so good. This Shine zero product will be getting more purchases from me. 5 out of 5. Easy to use and very comfortable. Inject the trays with the gel and bite down for a few minutes for whiter teeth. It’s easy and not a lot of trouble for a boatload of benefits.</li>
            <li> My smile is shining and I am feeling great. My teeth are whiter than since I was in my 20s before all the coffee and cigarettes. I have to keep it up though, and I am buying more here on this site. Enjoying my whiter smile. You should do it too.</li>
            <li> Now this was a rip off!</li>
            <li> I dont think a whitening method can get any better than this! I am so happy with the outcome from this product! They worked marvelous, I couldnt ask for anything that could of worked better. I will highly reccomend these</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive teeth so I was looking for a product that would whiten (I&#x27;m a regular coffee drinker) but not cause me pain every time I would eat something cold. Shine Whitening is the perfect product for someone like me. It whitened my teeth at least 3 shades; it was fast, easy, and non-messy; and it left me feeling more confident about my smile! I would recommend this product to anyone especially for how inexpensive it is! If you are looking for a great teeth whitening system, try Shine Whitening!</li>
            <li> As an avid coffee drinker on the go, I usually dont have time to brush my teeth after each drink. I have had some moderate coffee stains on my teeth from years of drinking coffee. It makes me feel uncomfortable and self-conscious about myself and thus forbids me from smiling. I was looking for something to whiten my teeth with but with a low peroxide dosage as my teeth and gums are quite sensitive. I&#x27;ve found this product and it works wonders. I can leave it on and not worry about any sensitivity or irritation because it doesn&#x27;t affect me like that. I have used it a few times thus far and already my teeth are a few shades brighter than what they were. I plan on continuing to use it until I achieve my desired level of brightness. Thank you for such a magnificent product.</li>
            <li> Shine Whitening is a teeth whitening formula that helps brighten teeth.  Priced at $30, it&#x27;s definitely a bargain price, compared to other whitening formulas.  It is made of botanical products which means it&#x27;s completely natural.  Furthermore, it does not contain peroxide.  Because there is not peroxide, there is no risk for teeth or gum sensitivity.</li>
            <li> FINALLY!! A Teeth whitening system that actually works! I received the SHINE WHITENING ZERO PEROXIDE TEETH WHITENING SYSTEM and I will admit to being very skeptical. VERY!&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several different kinds of &amp;#34;paint-on&amp;#34; whiteners, numerous brands of whitening toothpaste and strips that stick to teeth. I saw little to no improvement no matter how long I used them. SHINE WHITENING ZERO PEROXIDE kit is everything you want a whitening system to be! Well almost everything. It doesn&#x27;t taste like sunshine and rainbows, but even this is much preferable to some of the gag-inducing tastes of others I have tried.The instructions might scare you at first because it seems like a lot of steps, but this kit is beyond easy. Simply take a few moments and follow the directions to mold the teeth trays to your teeth for a custom fit that will ensure the whitening gel stays where it is supposed to and then every time you use it after that it is a breeze. I usually do my whitening in the evening. I brush my teeth, put on the gel and trays, sometimes I use the light for s few minutes and then sit and write or watch a show while the magic gel does it&#x27;s thing.I am very happy with the results I have seen with this kit. It has more than exceeded my expectations. After years of trying other kits and products, I am finally seeing a difference! A difference I can smile about!</li>
            <li> This by far is the best teeth whitening agent I have tried. I am on my second order and I have received so many complements on how white my teeth are. I have told so many members of my family about this product and they are all jumping on board to whiter teeth. I highly recommend this and the price is very affordable.</li>
            <li> No more wasting my money on expensive teeth cleaning. My teeth are sensitive and this takes care of them without pain. Within a month my teeth have changed shades for the better.</li>
            <li> This whole product is fishy. Save your hard-earned money and just go buy some whitestrips. All of these reviews are FAKE. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Saw improvement after the first application.</li>
            <li> I drink so much coffee daily that I started seeing my teeth loosing the brightness and I have been miserable. I went for a cleaning at the dentist, bought a new toothbrush, whitening toothpaste, floss, mouthwash, and some whitening pen (which was a waste of money)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought the crest whitening strips but the fall off and tried the old school Rembrandt trays but they whitened my teeth but faded quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I chose to try Shine Whitening because of the fact there is 0 peroxide and i know that is what causes sensitivity and it comes with the LED light!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;No sensitive gums after, saw results after a few application, and easy to use! There wasn&#x27;t a nasty taste like the crest products too! I love the LED light, totally speeds up the process and removed more stains and yellowing then I could have imagined! Way better then spending hundreds on zoom white or other things from the dentist!</li>
            <li> My teeth are not perfectly white, so I purchased this item. I have used many other products to whiten my teeth, but this certain product is the that worked the best. I now have beautiful, white teeth and since I love to smile it really helps.&lt;br /&gt;I volunteer and so I interact with lots of people. I need my breath to be fresh and my teeth to be white. Impressions are a big thing in business. I want those I meet and greet to feel comfortable talking to me. This product has accomplished that and more. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love drinking a couple of cups of coffee in the morning, but even worse for my teeth is my love of green tea. Alas, my teeth have taken on a yellowish cast over the years - some from age and the rest from coffee and tea. I have tried many products - some totally useless and others mediocre to decent. Always looking for new products in this category because I really cannot afford professional whitening at the dentist. This one is a keeper - the kit is easy to use and definitely whitens the teeth without harsh, nasty-tasting peroxide.</li>
            <li> After trying out several medicines and out of frustrations I gave up treating my teeth issue. I was recommended by one of my friend on this tooth whitening product. I am mainly writing this as I have failed using several products and finally reached a good genuine product. I have had a hands on to the products like like Crest white strips, herbal toothpaste, and of course a whitening agent which will basically paint the tooth. I actually realised after trying out all of these things, Shine Whitening stood out extra ordinarily giving response and I personally conisder it to be the best one to treat the tooth colour issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is actually a better product that comes with the better proportion of providing gentle enough treatment on to the tooth that will not cause sensitivity, but then it work tremendously. I would 100% recommend this to  anybody who is in search of get rid of the dull and yellow coloured tooth. This product worked wonderfully for me, and I would right away say that I will buy it subsequently in order to brighten my smile!</li>
            <li> I love the product, but did have one minor issue. I have a not-so-perfect smile, and the tray didn&#x27;t fit well, so that is my only complaint. Luckily I have a tray from another product I tried and used that. The whitening product itself works great and I was very satisfied with it. If you have perfect teeth, you will have no issues though!</li>
            <li> 15 minutes, twice a day, and I noticed no difference whatsoever...</li>
            <li> All fake reviews, trying something else.</li>
            <li> Enjoying the tray system a lot. It takes a tiny bit of work up front, since you have to heat up the mouth guard and mold it into your mouth, but after that it makes every subsequent step easier. It fits in my mouth like that because it’s made to do that, and my teeth thank you. It’s comfortable and my teeth are whiter.</li>
            <li> I thought it would take maybe a few months to see results but in a matter of days I noticed that my teeth were whiter than before. Other people seemed to notice too. It’s amazing this kind of technology exists. I feel bad for people 100 years ago when white teeth were prized as well but did not have whitening services. Their teeth must have been horrible. Well this stuff is easy to use even if you were 100 years old it’s easy. Inject the trays, stick it in, minutes later, bam. White teeth. Continue and repeat and I will be doing that as I’ve come on here to purchase more.</li>
            <li> I smoked maybe half a pack a day for a handful of years. My teeth were stained from decades of tar and gross stuff. After I quit I started to pick up the pieces. Enter Shine zero for the teeth. I stuck on the mouth guard and used it for fifteen minutes per use and after a month or a month and a half my teeth really began to spring out and catch people’s eyes. I am really regretting I went so long without keeping up the color of my teeth but this product is doing a good job reversing the damage.</li>
            <li> For some reason this solution in this mouth tray system (which is fine, in my opinion), does not affect my teeth the way other brands do. Sometimes my teeth would hurt to the point where I was at tears. It wasn’t worth it after a while. So I quit trying to whiten my teeth even though I really like having a great looking smile.I found Shine Whitening  on Amazon and based on the other reviews decided to pick it up and try it out. Thank you guys because whatever is happening is great, and my teeth look great and they don’t hurt anymore.</li>
            <li> The LED light stopped working only after using it 4 times, I have asked for replacement. I have noticed some change in my teeth just in those 4 times. Will update the review if I get the replacement in a timely manner and see further improvements.</li>
            <li> Find myself smiling a lot more around town. Use this product a few times a week and I am happy with what is happening.  Thanks Shine zero.</li>
            <li> I ordered this reading great reviews and after we had it for a week I read the reviews again and noticed quite a few people saying they are fake reviews. I wish I noticed that first because it definitely isn&#x27;t worth the money. Crest whitestrips work better for the same price.</li>
            <li> My teeth have gotten yellow from drinking a lot of coffee as I am a major addict so I think this product might be exactly what I need to whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> This has been the most effective whitening product I have encountered! It completely removes all stains from my teeth, and makes them so white I can almost not believe it! With only two uses of these trays, I have noticed an incredible change in my smile! The trays are easy to use, and the whitening gel stays put and does not leak into the rest of your mouth, which other products tend to do. The gel also tastes much better than others, fresh and minty! Best of all, my teeth do NOT hurt after I use these trays! I would certainly recommend these trays over all other ones I have tried!</li>
            <li> I’ve done a few off-Broadway plays as an actress, and the last thing I need is to have my teeth stand out more than my performance.  My teeth isn’t so sensitive, but it has some discolorations, so what do I have to lose, right?  I was a little skeptical about this product at first, but after using it for three weeks, I saw a difference in my smile.  I started receiving compliments from the cast and my boyfriend about how white my teeth were.  I immediately knew this product was the reason.  Now my boyfriend’s using it, lol.   Its a quick and easy do-it-yourself dentist appointment at home!  The tray included in the kit forms right to your teeth making the cleaning and brightening process more effective in whitening everything -not missing a spot.  It doesn&#x27;t make your teeth and gums sensitive because the tray protects them, and the light that is used for the whitening process is trusted by dentist professionals.   Your toothbrush can&#x27;t beat it!  Great product.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth with many issues. I cannot even drink cold water without having it kind of pang. So I was very cautious when it came to my teeth becoming yellow. I have tried some other products before like strips and bleaching but it&#x27;s just too painful. I used this item here sparingly and my teeth feel great. They are whiter and I only apply a little bit at a time, but so far I have zero issues with it. No problems. Godsend.</li>
            <li> Love this item! It noticeable whitens your teeth with quick results. I have recommended it to many of my family and friends and will continue using it myself. If you are considering buying this item, add it to your cart now, you won&#x27;t regret it one bit!</li>
            <li> Best whitening you can use even my dentist asked what i was doing that it looks good and lasts too.</li>
            <li> There is a little bit of mint taste in the gel, which makes it easier to use this product.</li>
            <li> Seemed to work well and did not make my teeth ache like every single other teeth whitener I have used. Product came with clear instructions and was easy to use. I have very sensitive teeth and I will continue using this product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, worked as expected. I tried this for the first time and didn&#x27;t expect it to work so well. Would repurchase in the future.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product.  Sure it did whiten my teeth some.  The bother factor got to me....as doing the trays for the teeth and trying to get the light to stay in your mouth, as well as all the saliva build up for 15 minutes.  After a while I realized it was somewhat cleaning the teeth, but doing nothing for the cracks between the teeth.  It seemed that the spaces looked &#x27;dirty&#x27; compared to the teeth.  Then I tried to find refills with zero peroxide.  I could not find refills for this product.  I finally bought the foam of another product where you brush with a tooth brush.  I think I will like the new product better.  Brush for one minute and you are done.</li>
            <li> I have whiter teeth in weeks because of this product and I am smiling a lot more. My confidence is up and my teeth are definitely part of the reason why.</li>
            <li> I use it a couple times a week and the results so far have been very promising. My teeth are whiter than before and I think the tray stuff is a good look for this product. You have to put it in your mouth and bite down to form it around your teeth but after that it’s a personalized indentation. Works well in my experience.</li>
            <li> You don’t know what it’s like on the other side with whiter teeth. Try Shine Whitening out and see. I am beaming.</li>
            <li> People at work are commenting about my teeth in a good way. I really enjoy that result and this product is to thank. I started using Brilliant a few weeks ago and I’m seeing great results. The mouth tray system is easy to use and I like to taste a little bit of mint from the gel in my mouth. It’s overall really good and an easy experience.</li>
            <li> There is a second gel, and you should use it. Especially if you have sensitive teeth, because that’s what it’s for, lots of products don’t include this sort of thing. But Shine Whitening does.</li>
            <li> I can say that this is an awesome product for teeth whitening, previously i have so many other products all products little high price than this and no results with that products but when i started using this product am really satisfying with this, surely i will recommend this products to people who are searching for teeth whitening product.</li>
            <li> I used this with a whitening kit treatment and wow! My teeth are so white, it&#x27;s unbelievable. Definitely recommended this!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever used other teeth whitening products, you know how hard it is to find a product that works at an inexpensive price. Other whitening products won&#x27;t do a good job as this one. The best part is that it&#x27;s easy to use and works in only 15 minutes! Unlike whitening strips from colgate or crest these are less sensitive, making it less harsh on your teeth and gums. The fact that Shine Whitening has zero peroxide is a big plus. Peroxide can be horrible for your moth, and if it accidently gets into your body it could get you terribly sick. It surprises me that this product that doesn&#x27;t use anything harsh and is extremely easy to work with. Easy instructions and a safe product I would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Will purchase again. I have super sensitive teeth, this did not bother my teeth at all. I did have a problem with one of the syringes blowing out, not sure how that happened but I could still get the product in the trays so it wasn&#x27;t that big of a deal. Great taste and a nice gentle whitening.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t want their teeth whiter? Well, I have tried a variety of products on the market and am usually very disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t produce the results in which are advertised. So, Shine Whitening was going to be my last hope but I am so thankful I decided to try it. My teeth are whiter than they have ever been and my confidence is higher as well. This will be the only teeth whitening product I ever use.</li>
            <li> I did not know beforehand but I&#x27;ve realized when I had braces that my teeth are very sensitive. Also due to those braces my teeth were stained a little, and it had made me self conscious. I decided after reading some reviews to try a kit, because it&#x27;s more cost effective than paying someone. I was a little skeptical at first, but I see great improvement, so I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Preparing for a job interview I put on my white shirt and to my dismay my teeth looked so yellow and as the first impression is key I started my research on teeth whitening products and stumbled upon this after amazon recommended it with its high rating I took a chance and behold Im here to say that it worked no pain and all of the gain!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s something fishy about these reviews.  Not a single one shows &amp;#34;Verified Purchase&amp;#34;.  I looked at &amp;#34;other reviews&amp;#34; of about 20 reviewers and EVERY ONE of them also gave 5 starts to something called &#x27;Omegaboost&#x27; and many other of the same products.  That&#x27;s some kind of coincidence!  And almost all of these were posted within a few days of each other.  I don&#x27;t like dissing a product I haven&#x27;t tried, but does anyone else think these reviews seem fishy?</li>
            <li> Excellent for sensitive teeth.  Ive used the expensive trays from the dentist before and they worked but would leave my teeth so sensitive.  Been using this for a week and already see a good improvement with zero pain! Definitely worth the price</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on here before I posted and sorry, mine is probably going to involve a story at some point (seeing as how I tend to get into long winded stories in real life .. why should it be different online !), and I don&#x27;t have a verified purchase yet (it was a gift and if I could post from whoever brought it to the white elephant gift exchange I would), but I&#x27;m not a troll ! :p In any case, teeth whitening has primarily been my husband&#x27;s thing .. he drinks a lot of coffee and he&#x27;s the one who has tried all sorts of whitening systems (ranging from ones he buys from local drugstores to one he purchased through the dentist&#x27;s office for like $200 .. I was like, what!) and one of his biggest complaints (especially the one from the dentist&#x27;s office) was that it made his teeth extremely sensitive (and he swears it doesn&#x27;t actually whiten but just strips his teeth enamel). Anyways, he was very excited when I brought home this from work (only he would get excited by this!) and tried it out starting maybe three weeks ago and I kind of forgot about it until last night when he mentioned that he hadn&#x27;t had teeth sensitivity, plus he thought his teeth did look whiter. Which led me onto Amazon to see where I could get him more, and here I am ! My husband is an extremely picky person who has tried a lot of teeth whitening products so I&#x27;m impressed he actually found one that he&#x27;d want to purchase again. Plus, it&#x27;s fun to watch him do the gel and light and stuff !</li>
            <li> This was a gift to myself because I am a busy mom, in show business and giving myself a full body makeover and want to improve my image for 2015. You can use your finger to spread the gel but I prefer to use a swab. I see a difference already and only had it since Christmas, started using it day after. One tip is not to use a lot of the gel...  This teeth whitener is worth the cost. I used a whitener years ago and saw no difference, though I only paid $20 for it. A trusted friend had one and suggested I try this one out. It came in on time as promised though I was a bit hesitant because of my past experience. But it really works!</li>
            <li> It is fascinating to see how whoever is selling this product broke through Amazon&#x27;s review filters and is infiltrating the site with spiked review columns.  I feel like some sort of bizarre electronic detective with these things, looking at review dates and saying odd things to myself like &amp;#34;How many people that need teeth whitener also love Garcinia Cambogia...&amp;#34;  I have to endorse the other negative reviews. Something is a little &amp;#34;off-white&amp;#34; about this product.  Update: Bizarre. My review had been marked as helpful by 21/21, then suddenly within a few days was flooded with 50-60 &#x27;not helpful&#x27; ratings. Whoever it is is sophisticated enough to be able to manhandle Amazon&#x27;s internal vetting process. Scary, how well it was done.</li>
            <li> Guys I have verified these reviews are from the same time period, posted by many accounts with no other reviews. Buyer beware, you have all been warned.</li>
            <li> I have used whitening strips and gels before, and these work as well as others.  After two consecutive treatments, I found my teeth between one and two shades whiter.  I had similar results with other gels, but this does not leave any sensitivity to my teeth or gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two big problems, one is that there are no detailed written instructions.  You are directed to a web site, which links to a YouTube video.  The link was broken. I ended up going on YouTube searching on my own.  I found a video on how to mold the trays to fit, but nothing on how to use the gel or the blue light.  This is terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other problem is that the material for the trays are supposed to be dipped in boiling water for 4 seconds than placed against the teeth to form a mold.  I found that this was uncomfortable on my teeth because of the heat.  If you do not do this, you can not get the impression of the teeth in the mold well and you waste the gel product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I found that in order to get the mold flexible enough to make an impression, it stretches and forms a blob and it was not easy to complete the process adequately. I am planning to write to Amazon customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the gel with a light did whiten my teeth .  I used the product for 30 minutes each session as I saw on YouTube for another product with light.  I did two back to back sessions and plan to repeat in a few weeks.  I have no idea if this is correct because there are no instructions.</li>
            <li> If you are having problems with the mouth tray, you can just apply the solution and it works fine. I lost the tray actually but I will be buying another here.</li>
            <li> This stuff is inexpensive. I was hesitant to buy it based on that but saw the reviews and I came running. This product works great and I would recommend it to anyone looking to whiten their teeth.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week and the results are pretty good. My teeth are white and I do not want that to change, so I keep this up.</li>
            <li> I have tried it all before with multiple brands of toothpaste.  This is definitely something different though! There have been so many problems that I&#x27;ve had with other toothpastes.  Either they take too long to work or they don&#x27;t work at all. I&#x27;ve even tried toothpastes that were way too abrasive and hurt my teeth completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a product that I definitely want to stick with.  It&#x27;s not abrasive at all, which is great for my sensitive teeth, and it works like an actual whitening treatment that you&#x27;d get at the dentist&#x27;s office!  The LED light is something that I have never actually tried before on my own, but it really helps! I tried one pack and I could definitely tell the difference! I will keep using this as long as I need to, and I will definitely recommend this to anyone who asks!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m the lady that like things that doesn&#x27;t likes my teeth&#x27;s such as coffee,red wine and so on. So of course my teeth&#x27;s were stain in ugly. Until I welcome this amazing product into my life. My teeth are 10× whiter and this product is very easy to use believe me when I say you can&#x27;t stop me from smiling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to get white teeth, no matter how many times I brush my teeth with those whitening tooth pastes. I&#x27;ve also tried other whitening products--no luck. Shine Whitening was comfortable, easy to use, and definitely more affordable than the professional whitening my dentist quoted me (yikes). Definitely one of the best trays I&#x27;ve used (I have a pretty small mouth but it still fit nicely). I&#x27;ve seen my teeth quite a few shades whiter and I plan on continuing to use this! You don&#x27;t have to go broke trying to get a nice smile. Save your money and try this whitening product first and learn from my trials and errors!</li>
            <li> Many of us have teeth with a bit of yellow tint, but Shine Whitening is fixing that! By buying this product, you avoid a costly doctor&#x27;s visit, and the best of all, you don&#x27;t spend hundred&#x27;s of dollars! I also tried other similar products, but Shine Whitening is the best on the market. It guarantees your shine and white teeth.</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY teeth whitening products that always gives me sensitivity in my gums, and a horrible aftertaste in my mouth. Some of them don&#x27;t even work, so I was skeptical when a friend gave me this kit as a gift for my birthday. So I loaded the syringe and distributed the solution in the trays and after I did the treatment I used a whitening chart to see the results. My teeth were 4 shades lighter according to the chart! The best part? No sensitivity, no pain, no yucky aftertaste! Now I am a coffee drinker, so I was plagued with brown stains that I was sure I would only my dentist could remove! Yet they were gone, and even my gums were brighter, I didn&#x27;t have much plaque in them but they were a reddish color and with this treatment they changed to a healthy pink! Bonus! I will definitely be using this again!</li>
            <li> Scam. Shine whitening you suck @$$.</li>
            <li> I have been smoking for 3 years and have seen my teeth start to yellow. Since I&#x27;m an actor, I just can&#x27;t have that! Since I have very sensitive teeth, I usually would go to the dentist, but I figured I would try this whitening system out first. This is PERFECT for sensitive teeth! It&#x27;s the same treatment (and result) I use at my dentist, but sooo much cheaper! I will definitely continue to use this!</li>
            <li> I love my espresso and cabernet but lo and behold I don&#x27;t like my stained teeth.  No one wants a yellow smile. Not me anyway. I tried a few over the counter ones from Walmart but found my teeth tingled and not in a good way. What sold me on this was No sensitivity and it lives up to the hype. I noticed decent results in 2.5 weeks and no teeth tingling.  Plus I can still indulge and not worry about it.</li>
            <li> Shine Whitening-Zero worked for me!! I smoke cigarettes and drink colas daily, needless to say my teeth are stained. I started using this 2 weeks ago and I see results. My teeth are brighter and I am more comfortable smiling.  I suggest that everyone order this product. It is worth every dime.</li>
            <li> It works! I recently stood up in a wedding and I wanted my teeth to look whiter for the pictures. I could not afford a professional cleaning, so I gave this a try instead. I have to be careful what I use on my teeth since I have had gum problems in the past and I experience sensitivity because of that. Well, this product is easy to use, affordable, and did not cause any discomfort. And best of all, the results were noticeably whiter teeth. You can definitely see the difference! I am a happy, happy customer and will use this product again.</li>
            <li> I have sensitivity but use a toothpaste to address that. I had no problems using this product. My teeth look great after ten applications. I have gum disease, drink coffee and wine. It works great for me! I protected my lips with Vaseline and had no issues with the brush dripping. I followed the advice of the reviewer who recommended rolling 2 inches of paper towel strips to place between the lips and gum area. Worth the effort for a youthful smile.</li>
            <li> I love my coffee and I love my wine. Unfortunately, these two tend to wreak havoc on my teeth. I&#x27;m in my late 20s and want to keep them for awhile, so I try to invest in whitening programs. I loved Crest White strips when they first came out, but the pain and sensitivity they cause after using them for awhile is really difficult to stand--especially over a long period of time. And, I worried about what the peroxide (i.e. Bleach!) was doing to my teeth and my digestive system. (You know you&#x27;re swallowing a little bit of it every day.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Shine Whitening. No bleach! My gums weren&#x27;t burning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product, because it gives you fast results, lasts for months and months, and doesn&#x27;t take a long time to use every day. They use an LED system just like in a dentist office...but way cheaper. It takes about 3 or 4 days to see results and by a week, my teeth are noticeably whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re going to spend $$ on self-improvement, I recommend this product. Take care of your face!</li>
            <li> A great product for those looking for something natural and helps out with sensitive teeth. Crest White Strips are great, but I didn&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;shooting pain&amp;#34; feeling I would get with using them. Plus, the gel always felt gross in my mouth and on my teeth. I have been using Shine Whitening for the past two weeks, and have noticed my teeth are visibly whiter. My teeth are not sensitive and there is no pain! I have even recommended it to family and friends alike!</li>
            <li> I often feel self conscious in public because of my stained teeth, so after searching online I decided to try this affordable product. I&#x27;m impressed that Shine Whitening whitens my teeth to my expectations, and best of all I didn&#x27;t have to spend hundreds of dollars. I usually get my teeth professionally whitened once every couple of years or so. It&#x27;s uncomfortable, invasive, expensive, and often leaves my gums stinging for days afterwards. But it works, and no other store-bought product could substitute.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend turned me onto this.  She is addicted to white teeth and started nagging when my coffee stained teeth got too bad.  So I tried it and wow, I didn&#x27;t realize how yellow they were.  Now I am almost as addicted as she is.  I tried other products but this seemed to be the best in terms of effectiveness/cost.  It lasts for quite a while too, even drinking coffee and the occasional cigar.  Very glad to have tried it.</li>
            <li> One of the most important things of our face that let&#x27;s us tell the world something about ourselves is our teeth. An individual with poorly cared for teeth just says the person cares poorly about themselves. Well if you do not want to be seen as one of these people then this product is for you. Nothing welcomes another person&#x27;s eyes more than a beautiful smile. A beautiful smile requires a set of beatiful, white teeth, and this product gives just that. This product is very helpful to give you the white teeth you always wanted.</li>
            <li> So Ive tried so many products for teeth whitening ! Ive bee through the trays , the gels, the paste, some are messier than others, some can create a huge sensitivity to cold and/or hot things that you consume. Ive noticed this product to be the most effective and the least amount of side effects. Your smile is such a huge factor in confidence and every day life. I would be very conscious of my teeth, feelings as if I&#x27;ve ruined them with coffee and cigarettes and thats the first thing people see, you want to leave a great impression. So this has super easy instructions and guidelines for you to easily make your way to having the most confident smile of your life !</li>
            <li> Who would have thought I could reverse my nasty coffee habit in just a few weeks?!  I&#x27;ve been a coffee drinker for decades now and I have always been so self conscious of my smile.  My teeth were always straight, but they were just yellow.  I know it&#x27;s all my fault, but I finally had enough.  These social media sites really know how to make someone feel self conscious! After countless hours of looking through reviews, I finally decided to take the plunge and buy the Shine Whitening system.  The instructions are great and this is so easy to use!  I feel so much more confident about myself now that I have my pearly whites back.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> This Shine whitener is the best I&#x27;ve used so far. It gets out all of my cigarette and coffee stains perfectly. I only use them once a week and I have perfectly white teeth all the time.  I never experienced any gum irritation.</li>
            <li> I would smile a lot less because I never wanted to show off my teeth. my teeth weren&#x27;t always the white pearls they should be on a regular basis. Especially those mornings when you just happen to run out of tooth paste and your tooth brush is no where to be found. I started using Shine Whitening after I soon received my product and I am very happy about the outcome. There&#x27;s no more yellow spotting on my teeth, people compliment on how white they are, and I even smile more (-: So I recommend this to all of my friends and all of my family along with people I don&#x27;t even know. But I know this, you will no regret it!</li>
            <li> I have tried several whitening brands and techniques in the past. The cost of the dentist constantly whitening my teeth started to become a real burden. Then I stumbled across this product and researched the product before deciding to purchase it. I can truly say Shine Whitening works just as well as professional whitening. What makes it even more amazing it that although it is reasonably priced, it still does a terrific job as if you sought out a professional. I have been using it for over a month now, and my teeth are whiter. It is a great product and a great whitening alternative. I really recommend it!</li>
            <li> Bottom line....this works.  I&#x27;ve used the strips from the top name brand toothpastes, and those always worked for a very short time, but this one seems to last a lot longer.  It&#x27;s simple to use, and effective.  My dentist told me my teeth were getting a little yellow because of age, but this product has brought the white back into my smile.  I love it.  I got a pack for my wife too, and she is loving the results as well.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I just wanted something that would make my teeth a little whiter. I know the dentist could probably do a better job, but for the cost this one worked well. Glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of these home-whitening kits, and this is one of the best ones. It works really quickly, and my teeth are definitely several shades whiter than before. Also doesn&#x27;t make my teeth super sensitive like some other brands. Good kit!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this kit came with a  light which is totally safe by the way, to help whiten my teeth very quickly. This is a really great home tooth whitening kit that provides an easy to use comfortable mouth tray. You do not have to worry about boiling water, burning your hand off or placing hot trays in your mouth to form a mold, It is so easy to use. Another thing you have is easy to use syringe included in the kit to use anytime, totally great for quick touch ups to help remove stains. I have been using this for a week and already my teeth are much brighter. Can not beat the cost either, very affordable. This is really a safe and easy product to help whiten your smile, I recommend anyone who wants fast whiter teeth to give this great product a try!!</li>
            <li> For so long I have wanted to try a product that works well and effectively and does not make my teeth sensitive. I have applied this twice before writing the review so that I know what I am talking about. It worked well, I could see a noticeable difference in the color of my teeth. It comes with two injections filled with the white liquid gel, a syringe nozzle, the led light and two mouth trays. So pretty much all that would need is right here. The instructions say apply twice a day for 15 days but I only do it once. Its up to and how sensitive your teeth are. It is imperative that you use the led light when you insert the trays in your mouth, it gives better results.&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided without any obligations.</li>
            <li> Loving using this product and feeling good about my smile.</li>
            <li> I hate having yellow teeth but unfortunately I have the bad habit of smoking cigarettes and drinking too much coffee. After trying this my teeth were whiter within two weeks and now I have a bright smile which I&#x27;ve always wanted without having to spend a bunch of money on getting it professionally done. It brightened my teeth so much that people even noticed and complimented me on it! The best part is as i keep using this product i can still drink coffee and have a bright smile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite satisfied with this product.  I love that it doesn&#x27;t have peroxide.  My gums and teeth had no sensitivity.  The LED light is cool and it&#x27;s a legitimate professional tool.  The trays formed to my mouth comfortably.  I like that it has botanical ingredients...And at the end of it all my teeth were noticeably whiter.  It was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Good product!  I used to smoke and drink a lot of coffee so I always had a hard time keeping my smile very white.  Shine Whitening really helped change that and gave me a smile that I can give without being embarrassed.  You have to use it according to directions for it to work correctly.  I will continue to use because I still drink coffee and wine, and eat things that can discolor my teeth but at least now I know what to use to keep my smile healthy.</li>
            <li> I was worried about my yellow stained teeth. I tried tooth bleaching but after few months the color will be back to yellow stains. Moreover the process was reducing the thickness of my teeth. My dentist gave me some long term treatment which was not that effective. I came to know about this shining whitening- zero peroxide teeth whitener through my colleague who had succeeded in using this. The results were visible in less than a month. I gave it a try and it worked like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I placed the order in Amazon and got the product delivered on right time and delivery was free. I starter using it right from the next day and the results were amazing and my teeth stains went off that fast. I am happy about this product and its results. I would recommend others too to use it if you have similar problems.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this worked</li>
            <li> There were no clear instructions for the product and the website has no information and is full of broken links.  The kit came with everything it said it did, but no clear way to use it.  Tried it once and the light was really awkward, no way to use it without holding it for 15 minutes - very poorly fitted. I then went to amazon to see if there were any helpful Q&amp;A and realized that all the good reviews are faked...</li>
            <li> I have yellowing teeth, who doesn’t. I started using this product and almost immediately I started to see results. I am glad because I now enjoy seeing myself in the mirror or casually on video. Very happy with the results and I recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Decided to try it because of the good reviews and it really made my teeth less sensitive and so much whiter that before. I have a nice smile now</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t work. Been using it for 1 month and see no difference in color.</li>
            <li> I use this product twice a week and I am amazed that I am seeing results so early in the process. My guess is that if I do not keep up with the whitening treatments then my teeth will again slowly start to turn yellow like they were before, after my enamel had worn away. No problem, it’s a small price to pay for a shining smile.</li>
            <li> I had to prepare for an audition and I had to stop whitening my teeth with the other stuff because it was astringent. My friend recommended this product so I used it and it worked! I used it for about a week beforehand and it looked good in the mirror and I got a comment about it in the audition process. Will see if I get the part and will update you guys but I am pretty happy about the teeth thing, it doesn’t hurt or hurt my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I do have a beautiful smile using this shine whitening kit. I love it and I usually get this every month to keep my smiles on point. I love this always and I do enjoy using this product always.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a regular teeth whitener for a few years now. I&#x27;m always looking for a new product to try and this one caught my eye due to all the positive reviews. This whitening kit is simple to use and the instructions are pretty straightforward. I did the whole process while watching a show and folding laundry (hurray for triple-tasking!).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say the results from this kit are more similar to professional whitening than crest strips. The results definitely superseded the average results from professional whitening that I&#x27;ve received. My teeth stains come from regular coffee and tea drinking, eating strong-staining spices, and occasionally smoking. After using this kit, my teeth looked white, not off white. I&#x27;m very pleased and will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> You have to use it consistently for a week or two, but you will definitely notice results. I am an occasional smoker and a daily soda drinker. My parents were poor when I was growing up, so I didn&#x27;t make it to the dentist regularly. My teeth have suffered as a result. They were discolored, which this product helped with. Also, I am one of those people whose teeth are sensitive to hot and cold temperatures, etc. Using this product was painless, and I would definitely recommend it to anybody with sensitive teeth who can&#x27;t afford a trip to the dentist!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a teeth whitening product that really works and is easy to use.In the past, I have tried some drug store whitening products but it didnt really work that well on my teeth. I saw this product online and it has great reviews so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Omg! I was so happy with the result of what it did to my teeth. With this product I can smile everyday:-)</li>
            <li> Glad I tried this whitening kit.  Good deal for the price.  Higher quality than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been frustrated with Crest and Walgreens brands whitening strips, as they irritated my gums after leaving them on for 10 minutes.  The Shine Whitening doesn&#x27;t have any peroxide in it, and it didn&#x27;t irritate my gums at all.  I got the same results with two syringes of Shine Whitening as using Crest strips twice a day for an entire week.  Saved time, saved money, very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Another one of my products I will be using on a consistent basis. It works, and it doesn&#x27;t taste bad at all, I can deal with it. Most importantly it whitens my teeth tremendously!!</li>
            <li> Shine Whitening works just as well as professional whitening- at a fraction of the cost! The trays mold to your teeth, which make them more comfortable while using. The instructions that it comes with are very easy to understand- you soak the trays in hot water, mold to your teeth, then apply a thin line of whitening serum to the tray.. leave on for 15 min and you&#x27;re done!  There is also a UV light that comes with it- for extra whitening.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review- I have been using it for about 3 weeks and have noticed a huge improvement!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy having white teeth. I usually use the crest white strips but a friend told me I needed to try this product and I absolutely love it! I really like how the product was able to whiten my teeth without making them feel sensitive after. I liked that I was able to notice a visible difference after a couple days and that even weeks later my teeth are still white. It is really easy to use and makes for lasting results.</li>
            <li> The trays are huge which make it difficult to place in my mouth- I have narrow teeth... so I am wondering if they are even touching my teeth! If I have known you had to use a tray I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this! Also you have to do it twice a day for 15 minutes... again, if known- wouldn&#x27;t have purchased!  I also can&#x27;t get the infra light device to fit in my mouth with the trays as they have a flip which prevents the light device from staying in your month. All kind a silly. I read the instructions and they are not clear on how to work around these issues. I gave it 3 stars because my teeth look a little whiter after 1 day.</li>
            <li> I bought this without even reading the reviews. They are all posted in the same time frame, which is pretty sketchy.... However I have used this whitening kit 3 times and do see a difference. As stated, it won&#x27;t make your gums red and teeth sensitive. I wish I had a before picture, but I really think it does work, but I&#x27;m sure it will take longer to get my teeth as white as I want.</li>
            <li> Tried it for two weeks and was not impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> I have been receiving all kinds of compliments about my pearly whites at work and at school. They are so bright it’s noticeable to everyone.  My teeth are really white and I’m happy. It really boost my confidence.</li>
            <li> Its OK, no miracles. I think all of my teeth may have just changed by a shade, maybe two, after using the kit. I&#x27;m going to have to find an alternative now. Maybe I lost too much enamel by drinking sodas when I was a teen. Maybe this is just me. Who knows.</li>
            <li> So far I have used it twice and I can see a difference.  My teeth are usually sensitive when I use whitener, but because it doesn&#x27;t have peroxide I have not had issues.</li>
            <li> I am a huge coffee drinker and then I started noticing that yellowish stain teeth; I knew I had to do something. My friend suggested I try the Shine Whitening - Zero Peroxide Teeth Whitening System. I wasn’t sure at first but, decided that I had nothing to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions were easy to follow and after the first try I saw results. It’s been three weeks and I am smiling a lot more. The yellowish stain is gone and my mouth feels fresh. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Yellow teeth used to really hold back my self esteem. I wouldn&#x27;t brush my teeth very often as a kid &amp; started regularly smoking cigarettes &amp; drinking coffee at the age of 16.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really thought I was doomed because I don&#x27;t have the money or time to go get my teeth professionally whitened, but this product really does the job right at home! I immediately saw results after the first use and after a couple more, my teeth are now whiter than they&#x27;re ever been...definitely recommend it if you struggle with the burden of having a stained smile :)</li>
            <li> Battery died in one day and bet uncomfortable</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and I was worried that my teeth would be affected by this product. But I didn&#x27;t have to because my teeth do not hurt. They do not hurt and they are whiter now. Very happy with results.</li>
            <li> Great price for this product. Noticed this online here by accident, lucky. I was just in the store and in the market for teeth whitening. Saw the prices and my jaw dropped, basically. This stuff is a bargain compared to in the store. And online too, I guess. That&#x27;s what it looks like from a cursory search. Will be buying this up.</li>
            <li> I feel frustrated to smile on people because of my yellow teeth, Now I am very happy with Shine Whitening. its really remarkable product...</li>
            <li> Since I started using this I&#x27;m noticing magnificent results! In about two weeks my teeth have passed from a yellowish color to a really bright white color. I just love how this is working for me and I definitely recommend this product to everyone who wants some really cheap and works phenomenally!</li>
            <li> Literally no effect after 1 week of religious adherence. Twice/day for 30-40 minutes. No change whatsoever.</li>
            <li> This product looked ghetto but I was desperate after taking off my braces so I looked around for something not too expensive and found this! My teeth are pretty sensitive from eating lots of lemonade and lime from drinking tequila. I have to say I haven&#x27;t been the best at brushing my teeth so this product was a perfect solution for me. It not only made my teeth white but during the process, my teeth did not get sensitive like other whitening products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A unique experience with the professionalism of an orthodontist. Will be recommending this for sure.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that would brighten my teeth without having to go to the Dentist and pay a fortune.  I found this product that seemed like the answer for me.  After ordering this product I soon received within a couple of days.  The instructions were simple, and I was soon applying the solution to the trays, and putting the product to test.  Within the first couple of applications I was smiling from ear to ear.  My smile had transformed into a MEGA WATT SMILE.  I am very happy that I ordered this product, and when my friends ask me how I did it, I happily tell them of your product &amp;#34;Shine Whitening&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This teeth whitening made my teeth look so pretty and white after a couple of weeks of using it. My friends had noticed how white my teeth was and they told me how good it made me look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s time intensive (twice a day for 15 minutes), uncomfortable and I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference after a week.</li>
            <li> I love this kit because it quite different from any other whitening kit . I love it comes with the case and syringe which makes it feel even more better for the price . Would continue to use this product !</li>
            <li> This was great! I used it once so far and the product is definitely as described. My friends were able to notice the dramatic difference in how my teeth were before (yellow) and now! Instant results and I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is trying to get pearly white teeth</li>
            <li> Having yellow teeth is horrible for your confidence.. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m so beyond lucky I found this product! My teeth are progressively getting whiter and whiter every day, and my confidence is getting better as well! I highly recommend this product as the price and the quality is well above my standards!</li>
            <li> As an avid smoker and coffee drinker, I must say this is a necessity! I have always felt insecure about my teeth. I knew they could be whiter, giving me a brighter smile, but its hard to keep them at a healthy white. But I have definitely found the way to do it! 5/5 would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I tend to over indulge in my caffeine. So it has some type of effect of my teeth . So when searching for a whitening kit . I ran across this product and what stood out was the retina case and led light . When I first start using it a few times I saw a difference in my teeth . Definitely would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> These work miracles! I always forget to brush and I drink alot of coffee my teeth have gotten really really yellow tinted lately, I looked to this product for help and in a manner of a week I saw a huge difference! ( Along with brushing my teeth as well! )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All you have to do is wear these strips during your daily life and when you take them off for the night you perfectly have lighter teeth! IN A MANNER OF HOURS!</li>
            <li> Good system here. I have tried a handful of other ones and this one has been by far the most convenient. The trays fit easily into my mouth and I enjoy using it--very simple. Recommended for if you need to whiten your teeth up a bit, and who of us doesn&#x27;t need that, to be honest?</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time for the full 15 minutes.  After I removed the trays and rinsed my mouth my teeth felt like sandpaper!  Rough to the touch of my finger as well as when I ran my tongue along my teeth.  Also made my gums bleed quite a bit (burned gums).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am returning this product TODAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I will say is I THINK I notice that my teeth are whiter, but it&#x27;s not worth the distress caused by my &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; teeth after using the product.  I hope the roughness goes away and it&#x27;s just de-mineralization of the enamel.  If it&#x27;s not gone by tomorrow morning I am calling my dentist for his opinion.</li>
            <li> I had whitening done at the dentist a few years ago and swore never to put up with that agony again. It hurts in your mouth and your pocketbook! I tried this product and would say my tooth enamel went up at least four to six shades, and it doesn&#x27;t burn like the dickens. I tried tooth strips as well, and those seemed to work a shade or two, but this is about the same price as a package of those strips and at least for me, works a lot better. I smoke, drink coffee and red wine, so I do all the bad things for tooth enamel that&#x27;s out there. Yes, I&#x27;d try it. It was worth the money for me.</li>
            <li> This is by far the most economical, comfortable, and effective teeth whitening product I have ever, ever found. I basically had zero dental care as a child and the results are pretty obvious. Self-esteem issues and all, I work hard to reduce the discoloration, and I&#x27;ve spent my fair share on products that simply do not make a noticeable difference. I am so grateful for Shine Whitening because it costs much less than comparable brands, but the difference is very real! I have started actually opening my mouth when I smile, and I had spent years avoiding open mouth smiles because I feel like it gives away this awful truth about my teeth! Thank you for an amazing product!</li>
            <li> Does not work. Accurately followed the directions, even tried applying the gel with a Q-tip as some other reviewer had suggested(!), but this product gave no visible results. What a waste of 2 weeks and $30. Also, I jumped back onto these reviews and it looks like this product is a downright scam. Sucks. At least I&#x27;ve learned now to read the low ratings first, ha.</li>
            <li> This product certainly is unbelievably awesome. You won&#x27;t even believe the results that you achieve after using this formula. I&#x27;ve used products in the past that have worked, but the results were far less apparent than the results achieved with this product. My teeth are whiter than ever before, and the results began to show up only a week after using it. If you&#x27;re going to invest in teeth-whitening products, invest in this one. I am more than satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> By the end of my tenure at school my teeth looked like an old man’s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily I picked up Shine Zero, which probably cut my stains in half in about a few months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Now my teeth look like the color they are supposed to be for my age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can kind of tell I smoke and I wish it was a little whiter but really it seems like they did a miracle,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you should have seen it before.</li>
            <li> There is a gel for people with sensitive teeth. Thank goodness. I am one of those people and this product worked very well for me. I had no issues with the sensitivity and my teeth are considerably whiter than when I started. I’ve had problems with other products in the past but not this one. I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> My teeth are looking really good. People at work are noticing and it only took a couple weeks for results to come in. I thought it would take longer but that’s not true. Tray system was easy to use and I recommend anyone give it a shot.</li>
            <li> Every week now, twice a week, I use Shine Whitening to brighten my teeth. It works out and is pretty good to my wallet too.</li>
            <li> one of the mouth guards formed to fit the upper teeth. the second guard will not form to the bottom teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I try to put them in the mouth at the same time as instructed. The shear mass made my jaw hurt and drooling occurs.&lt;br /&gt;The light never worked from day one. I emailed support@shinewhiteing.com and received no reply. Followed up with a second email and received no reply. Called the support number on the package and was referred back to the email address.&lt;br /&gt;This product has no customer support and the company does not stand behind the product. If it does not work for you, you are just out the money.</li>
            <li> I drink a lot of coffee and I’m glad to say that after a few sessions my teeth are a lot better looking than before. I will keep using it and let you guys know how it looks in a month or more, but for now a big thumbs up for this product.</li>
            <li> LED light does not work. I have not seen a difference in my teeth yet.</li>
            <li> I think to figure out if you can handle two, three, times a week you should star with once a week. I have stains on my teeth and I was eager for results but I decided that I didn’t want to go through any sort of teeth pain so I started off once a week and put those mouth trays into my jaw. I moved onto twice a week and I think the results I got were good enough that I didn’t want to risk doing it more. I am very happy with what I got done, so that’s cool.</li>
            <li> I have always been self conscious about my teeth. I have always drank coffee continously whether it was at work or in classes. My pale yellow teeth were not like the pearly whites I&#x27;ve witnessed everywhere I go. I heard about this product and decided to step up and make myself feel confident. I needed a product that would both whiten my teeth as well as not cause any discomfort. The product nevertheless was ready to use with easy to follow instructions.  After just a few uses I&#x27;ve noticed the coffee stains disappearing.  Needless to say I now do not hide my smile and actually take pictures. (I even drink coffee still)  :)</li>
            <li> Love the fact that this product is so easy to use! One thing that bothers me most when I think about whitening my teeth is the fact that I would have to go to the dentist and go through all that discomfort apart from paying so much for a whitening that often does not last as long as I would like.&lt;br /&gt;This kit definitely makes the process easier for me to do at the comfort of my home. The added fact that it is zero-peroxide provides much relief that it doesn&#x27;t hurt my teeth or affect them in a negative way and make them too sensitive. It works great on teeth, especially for people who drink a lot of tea or coffee and have stains from that!</li>
            <li> I recently quit smoking and like most long time smokers my teeth were not the brightest. The dentist was far to expensive for my budget and those whitening toothpastes just didn&#x27;t seem to be working or just taking their sweet time. Decide to give this product a try and am very pleased with the results so far. I have only been using it for a little bit and already notice a difference in my teeth. I will continue using it and will purchase more when I use this one up. Thank you so much for this wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Loving it !!&lt;br /&gt;I have tried so many whitening methods and gone to dentist as well and now i conclude i got what i was looking .This is an inexpensive and healthier choice that will not damage the teeth in long term.&lt;br /&gt;I had also noticed fewer incidence of bad breath.I feel more confident becoz of this.Lots of compliments from friends too!</li>
            <li> I love keeping my teeth white but hate the fact that peroxide is a common ingredient in these types of products. I tried this and it works wonders! My teeth have never looked better. I will keep purchasing this as much as possible!</li>
            <li> I am a wine drinker(I love red wine!), so I tried a different brand name and I got a bad case of sensitivity.  Then I tried baking soda and peroxide. I just couldn&#x27;t take the taste and still left my teeth sensitive.  After all this I paid $200 to have my dentist do it.  I was surprised to find out.  I still had sensitivity.  And my teeth are not as white as I thought it would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted to have my teeth whitened.  I started looking for other ways to whiten my teeth and not have sensitivity.  A friend recommended Shine Whitening.  I was amazed at how well it works and I can finally have white teeth without the pain. I will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> I have tried many whitening products like Crest white strips, Colgate whitening toothpaste, and even a Groupon for a whitening agent that you have to paint on to your teeth.  I would say out of all of those, Shine Whitening has been the best product all around.  When you&#x27;re whitening your teeth, you want something that works quickly, but that doesn&#x27;t damage your teeth or make them sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is the perfect combination of being gentle enough to not cause sensitivity, but also to work efficiently.  I would definitely recommend this product for anyone trying to get rid of dull, yellow teeth.  Shine Whitening worked well for me, and I would definitely buy it next time I&#x27;m looking for brighten my smile!</li>
            <li> These reviews appear to be fake. The other products these &amp;#34;users&amp;#34; reviewed are all the same and are all 5 stars (supplements, omega 3 oil, cell phone cases, etc). Check it out for yourself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little anal when it comes to my teeth whitening procedures. I mean really, a nice smile is one of the first things you notice on a person and living in an image-based society, I always make sure that my smile is the brightest. This particular teeth whitening system is by far my favorite. I started using it about 3 weeks ago and I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference in how bright my smile is and how white my teeth are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the best part about the Shine Whitening-Zero Peroxide Teeth Whitening System is that my teeth don&#x27;t get that dreadful tingly feeling that is often associated with so many other teeth whitening products, which is extremely important because my teeth are really sensitive. I can literally use it without feeling a thing. It also works much faster than some of the other ones I&#x27;ve used. So, for anyone looking to whiten up their smile, I would definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s to a brighter you!</li>
            <li> Nice Shine Without the Sensitivity!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve ever used teeth whitening products, you know that teeth sensitivity is one of the side effects of these products.  In some cases, &amp;#34;sensitivity&amp;#34; is far too neutral a word since it feels like your teeth are plagued by a dull ache that doesn&#x27;t want to seem to go away.  It&#x27;s a terrible feeling but one that I didn&#x27;t get after using Shine Whitening.  It&#x27;s a professional-grade whitening gel without peroxide, that after ten uses, really DOES whiten.  It comes with the mouth trays, syringes and gel.  The instructions tell you to be careful and not leave the trays in hot water for too long otherwise they become too droopy and this is certainly true.  The first time I tried the trays, I wasn&#x27;t paying attention and I left them in the hot water too long and the trays became unmanageable so I had to try again.  Getting the right tray consistency is super important because that&#x27;s going to affect how the trays mold to your teeth.  Aside from that, the rest of the process was simple enough.  I&#x27;ve never been a huge coffee or wine drinker so for me, the change in my teeth color was really noticeable and did I mention, the TOTAL LACK OF teeth sensitivity was absolutely great!  I highly recommend this product - especially if you suffer from teeth sensitivity like I do.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for those who do not want to use peroxide. It is an excellent whitener. It will remove stains and make your teeth pearly white. I recommend this to any dull, stained teeth challenged person.</li>
            <li> When it comes to my teeth, I want them to be white and shiny like Ben Vereen&#x27;s. Saw this kit and for the price I couldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy them. Arrived quickly and with weeks I noticed the difference in my smile. Definitely get these if you drink a lot of coffee.</li>
            <li> I am a regular user of at home teeth whitening systems and have tried out many of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my all time favorites is the Shine Whitening - Zero Peroxide Teeth Whitening System. I have found several advantages to this product over similar offerings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part, to me, is the fact that it is peroxide free. My teeth aren&#x27;t super sensitive but I usually experience some discomfort while using at home whiteners. No so with the Shine Whitening system. The other thing that sets Shine Whitening apart is the design of the tray. It is easily the best in this product class. It&#x27;s comfortable and insures even whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit also includes a LED whitening light, which cuts down considerably on the time the process takes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, none of those things would matter if the results weren&#x27;t worth it. There&#x27;s nothing to worry about in this department. I was able to obtain results similar to professional cleanings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this product again without hesitation.</li>
            <li> I drink coffee... I eat ice cream... I eat candy... Yes all bad things for my teeth, but who doesn&#x27;t love to have sweets? My teeth ended up getting stained a bit and the dentist prescribed some strong toothpaste to whiten them up. Only problem is the paste taste HORRIBLE. I needed something effective and did not taste bad. I looked at Crest and Colgate and just seems to not work as well as this product. I always like to give things a try and this works with results seen in a week.</li>
            <li> PERFECT! PERFECT! PERFECT! Finally a product that whitening&#x27;s my teeth without stripping the enamel. Ever since I was a teenager I have always been obsessed with having a great white smile. I began using peroxide at the age of 14 and I am 31 now. I haven&#x27;t had a problem keeping my teeth white over the years but my dentist recently told me that the years of peroxide use is thinning my enamel. I stopped and my white teeth started to go to BLAHHHH.I found this product by doing research and gave it a chance. I went back for a check up at my dentist and he said my enamel was thicker and stronger and guess what.......he complemented me on how BRIGHTER MY SMILE WAS!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  As a smoker and coffee drinker, I seem to have trouble with keeping my teeth white even after use of whitening kits.  I have tried many whitening products.  The ones that seemed the most effective caused some sensitivity.  This product made my teeth wonderfully white and without the sensitivity.  I received so many compliments on this product I have recommended it to all of my friends and family.  And I highly recommend you try this product for teeth whitening.</li>
            <li> I drink a lot of coffee and tea, so over the years my teeth had become quite yellowed. I tried the Crest Whitening toothpaste and others but I couldn&#x27;t really tell any difference. However, my wife bought this product for me to try and now I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve had whiter teeth in my life. This works great and is even effective against long term, deep stains.</li>
            <li> The Shine Whitening System has been the most effective teeth whitener I&#x27;ve ever had the pleasure of experiencing. Furthermore, it is so easy to use. The best feature about this product is the inclusion of the LED light. Products that I have used in the past that did not include the LED light did very little to whiten my teeth. Since using this product, it is clear the the LED light has whitened my teeth far more and much faster. This product is amazing. Looking for white teeth fast? This product is the answer.</li>
            <li> I love it! I was super happy with how well it works. It was great to see how white my teeth could be. It is pretty easy to use, the trays are comfortable also. My teeth can be sensitive and I felt no discomfort while using it. This is something I will use again in the future!</li>
            <li> Works fine - very thin</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t know what to think about this, when my boyfriend first picked it up for me (I drink coffee daily, and was a smoker for years...while my teeth weren&#x27;t yellow, they weren&#x27;t exactly white either). I was hesitant to use it, and even waited a few weeks to start...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my nervousness was unnecessary, because this kit is awesome! It&#x27;s comfortable, and doesn&#x27;t take much time out of your day at all! But most of all, it&#x27;s awesome because of how well it works! My teeth are super white, with all the residue from coffee and cigarettes completely gone! If this is a problem for you, I would def recommend you try this. It will help!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, now my boyfriend won&#x27;t stop talking about how right he was lol...</li>
            <li> I had Complexion to laugh and i was completely fed up.  But atlast i find a good way that is Shine-Whitening zero peroxide teeth.  Its really an amazing result i found by using it few days.  No side effects and cost is also not that much heavy in front of our shining whitened teeth.  Be ready to welcome all with your confident smile.</li>
            <li> Burned my mouth, didn&#x27;t whiten at all. Scam.</li>
            <li> With this new job Im starting coffee has been my new friend and worst enemy because it stains your teeth but this is like having your own person dentist for free! What I love the most is that it&#x27;s quick and  the zero-peroxide formula guarantees no sensitivity on your gums or teeth and that is contains ingredients made in the USA it doesn&#x27;t have any foreign crap</li>
            <li> I stopped using Crest brand white strips because it was making my teeth sensitive and painful. I wanted to find something that was cheaper and didn&#x27;t cause the pain. I used the cheap teeth strips, but they didn&#x27;t do much. Only a little difference. Thankfully I found this product, it doesn&#x27;t have peroxide which I believe was the reasoning of making my teeth sensitive. This works faster than Crest, and it&#x27;s also a bit cheaper! I&#x27;m so glad this is on prime as well. Now my teeth are white again, without all the pain and sensitivity!</li>
            <li> I had been using peroxide as a teeth whitening solution for quite some time, as a friend of mine mentioned that this approach was the cheapest route to brighten a smile.  However, the peroxide left my teeth extremely sensitive, causing me to seek other options. I have been using the Shine Whitening package for just two weeks now and already notice dental improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit comes with everything you need, and instructions are provided that explain how to use the LED light and other materials. Basically, soak the trays in hot water and then mold them to your teeth. As a coffee and soda consumer, I obviously have to pay extra attention to the finish on my teeth. These strips have restored the shine, and both friends have family have even noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At a relatively inexpensive price, I recommend the Shine Whitening package. As mentioned, the peroxide I was using caused extreme sensitivity.  With this kit, I have had no pain and better results.  The taste is also tolerable, making me feel extremely safe/comfortable using this product.</li>
