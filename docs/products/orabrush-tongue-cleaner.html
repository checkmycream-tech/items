    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Best of all I</li>
            <li>This product works great!</li>
            <li>When I got the product it was in excellent shape from shipping and when I tried it with the tongue gel that I bought</li>
            <li>For those prone to tongue \\&quot;gunk\\&quot;- this is the perfect product.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect size through my experience.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed.  </li>
            <li>I think the best way to use this product is after brushing your teeth and using this product before or after using mouthwash.     </li>
            <li>Best 5 dollars</li>
            <li>VERY effective!!</li>
            <li>the Orabrush is the greatest product for your mouth ever realesed sence the toothbursh..  </li>
            <li>I am really impressed though!</li>
            <li>AND I LOVE IT!!! :D</li>
            <li>Win win!</li>
            <li>1st time using it, my mouth felt great.  </li>
            <li>I have always been wanting to get this ever since I heard that it was great for eliminating morning breath.  </li>
            <li>The reason that I did not give it a five star rating was the fact that it does not cure morning breath and give you great smelling breath for the rest of the day (which in the official promo video it says it will do).  </li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>Now to start with, the shipping was great</li>
            <li>This is a great tool for your mouth.</li>
            <li>This thing works great.</li>
            <li>and it works great on her.</li>
            <li>It works great and helps remove plaque quicker than tooth brush.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li>I love that its free shipping!!!!  </li>
            <li>It was amazing, I tested my breath when I was done and it was great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>Bottom line, it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li>Life is good.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve used it 4 over a month and still works good.  </li>
            <li>its a good buy.</li>
            <li>The idea of this tongue brush/cleaner is a good one &amp; I do use it after I brush my teeth &amp; before I rinse.</li>
            <li>Me, I&#x27;ll just use my toothbrush and call it good.</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased.</li>
            <li>This tongue cleaning tool is outstanding!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone and everyone who loves to keep a clean fresh tongue!! :D</li>
            <li>The Orabrush Tongue Srubber is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting really amazing results because that is what they have been showing all over  </li>
            <li>/feeling/smelling/tasting amazing</li>
            <li>I tried brushing my tongue and it didn&#x27;t work as well as I liked.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the honest truth.  </li>
            <li>My dentist really liked it</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, when there is doubt there is always product reviews which is the absolute best feature</li>
            <li>and I was amazed by how effective it was.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not usually a person that gets duped by infomercials, but the way they explained its design and use made perfect sense.    </li>
            <li>All the people who are talking good about this product on internet are people who got this product for free.</li>
            <li>This tongue scraper is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Good thing this product is able to take everything off leaving you with a nice clean tongue.</li>
            <li>I had keep rinsing off the brush and adding water to scrape off more.  </li>
            <li>i do not know if it makes my breath any better, but it did get all the junk off my tounge</li>
            <li>like using tongue scrapers a LOT more...</li>
            <li>I find it more effective and comfortable to use the bristles to brush the tongue, then to rinse the gunk off than to use that scraper blade.</li>
            <li>Even after brushing and scraping your tongue with a toothbrush, the Orabrush somehow still manages to get more stuff off your tongue.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>After using this product before bed, I woke the next morning to a very happy husband.</li>
            <li>I received my Orabrush today and I love it already.</li>
            <li>think the world would be a better place if everyone had one of these.</li>
            <li>will love the DenTek tongue cleaner till I die</li>
            <li>After watching too many videos and hearing about it  </li>
            <li>and i don&#x27;t recommend it to anyone if you are looking for magical results as shown on internet infomercial.</li>
            <li>I switched to the Tung brush and love it.</li>
            <li>MAy have to order more.</li>
            <li>The brush is much better at getting into the tongue and cleaning it where as I think the scrapers missed a lot.</li>
            <li>I know I haven&#x27;t gone a day without using my orabrush, and I feel a lot more comfortable now that I do use one!  </li>
            <li>I make love to this thing every night.</li>
            <li>If the end were more tapered, I believe it would be easier to use.</li>
            <li>Hi, I am from Malaysia and in view of the exchange rate, I am more concerned than the rest about the validity of this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like it more if the head was rounded, but I still give it 5 stars at it</li>
            <li>However, Orabrush PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE add color selection on amazon, I don&#x27;t know why you are not already able to select the color you want.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many many tongue scrapers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Using the orabrush, I was able to get all the gunk off my tongue.     </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Imagine the smell of my breath in the morning :) That used to be a problem, I had to spend ages cleaning my tongue.</li>
            <li>Cheers :)</li>
            <li>People&#x27;s breath would be a lot better if they used these.</li>
            <li>It cleaned the tongue very well and leaves a very nice minty taste/breath afterwards.  </li>
            <li>However, a toothbrush with a bit of toothpaste can clean the tongue quicker and just as effectively as, and maybe even better than, this gadget.      </li>
            <li>and it helped keep my tongue nice and clean.</li>
            <li>I bought one about a year or so ago when they first came out, and LOVED it.</li>
            <li>I used it three to four times, and it doesnt clean the tongue at all!</li>
            <li>Awesome deep clean feel, oh yes.</li>
            <li>When all this is done my tongue is pink as can be and my breath is excellent.</li>
            <li>The brushing surface does a good job of removing gunk from the tongue, better than scraping or normal bristles.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen the videos about it, although I don&#x27;t fall easily for ads, but I bought this one to try it</li>
            <li>I got the Orabrush yesterday (very quick delivery).</li>
            <li>Now I can&#x27;t really smell my own breath, and so I don&#x27;t know for a fact that my breath is better, but</li>
            <li>I can fight around the reflex and still clean my tongue, it just takes more time.</li>
            <li>I do like it, but I wish I didn&#x27;t  gag so easily.</li>
            <li>He rolled over and said, \\&quot;We killed the dragon.\\&quot; :) A great product, it is amazing what could be on your tongue.</li>
            <li>My first time using it was amazing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great especially after having foods with strong odors (ie: seafood or garlic) or if you smoke.</li>
            <li>Honestly some mornings I have almost vomited in the sink, but you learn how to concentrate and relax and not gag so much.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product.   </li>
            <li>My regular teeth-cleaning and tongue-cleaning regimens continue to provide great results for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They had a trial they were running where you could get one for free, just pay s&amp;h so maybe check the official website before purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has worked great to clean off my tongue, and you can definitely tell that it is doing that job well.  </li>
            <li>B00005BAWO The Original TUNG Brush - Tongue Cleaner with Free TUNG Gel Sample]]</li>
            <li>The concept of this product makes sense: toothbrushes were made to clean smooth surfaces and tongue scrapers</li>
            <li>I was so excited to use this tongue cleaner brush thing that I used it as soon as I received it.  </li>
            <li>I would prefer looking around your area first before ordering it online since many places today carry them.</li>
            <li>The Orabrush is a lifesaver and worth every penny!</li>
            <li>By the time I reached that stage, I noticed my breath had improved significantly.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to get it in the mail to try it out, but once i did i was heartbroken</li>
            <li>For quite some time, I have used Dr. Wieder&#x27;s Original [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The hype makes you think this is new and amazing...</li>
            <li>on your tongue; however, I don&#x27;t think it is much more effective than a regular tongue scrapper from the drug store.</li>
            <li>Just a clean tongue.</li>
            <li>Overall great product, cant wait to try out their foam to assist in kepping your mouth fresh</li>
            <li>Anyone using a plastic spoon to clean their tongue should upgrade to an Orabrush.</li>
            <li>Clean your nasal area on days when none of your nasal passages is blocked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like I have a clean mouth till I have used the toung brush along with brushing and flossing.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>It is much better than using a toothbrush for cleaning your tongue, and it&#x27;s gentle too.</li>
            <li>But truthfully, they do absolutely nothing that my toothbrush doesn&#x27;t do.  </li>
            <li>Plus, a mouthful of sweet teeth.</li>
            <li>The Original TUNG Gel - Tongue Cleaner - Fresh Mint]]</li>
            <li>I think the company found the perfect size, if they made it any bigger the chances of gagging is much bigger!</li>
            <li>Thanks for making such a great product, it truly has changed my life.  </li>
            <li>The price is pretty cheap</li>
            <li>Still, I have tried two other tongue cleaners &amp; this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li>The strength of the bristles nicely matches with the nature of my tongue; at first I thought the bristles were too soft but they are not.</li>
            <li>This product has very soft bristles that scrub your tongue better and gentler than a toothbrush would</li>
            <li>This is a pretty neat product!</li>
            <li>when I scraped my tongue saw the evidence that the brush was worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to use it for almost a week, but I really couldn&#x27;t see it useful, nor comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The Orabrush does what it says it will do, and that is leave your tongue feeling fresh, and your breath likewise.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely worth buying</li>
            <li>I use these every night, but my mouth still smells in the morning, it is a useful product, but it doesn&#x27;t do what I have hoped it would do</li>
            <li>I questioned wether or not to get this, but it was worth it.</li>
            <li>After using it my mouth felt extremely fresh.</li>
            <li>I have spent in a good while.</li>
            <li>My breath stays fresh all day and when I wake up in the morning after having used it before bed I don&#x27;t have morning breath.</li>
            <li>Is the incremental \\&quot;benefit\\&quot; really worth it?</li>
            <li>In my opinion this item is well worth 5 bucks.</li>
            <li>It DOES bless you with overall better oral hygiene, but is not the magic trick to long lasting great breath.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to run this over my tongue SEVERAL times to get an OKAY clean.</li>
            <li>but after first few uses breath smelled fresh   and with a bit of mout wash smelled great</li>
            <li>I liked it a lot, and it feels a lot more thorough than the tongue scrapers that ive used in the past.</li>
            <li>and it barely works, my toothbrush does a better job, 2 stars is generous.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got an Orabrush after stumbling across-ed it on the internet recently and ordered one, honestly I thought it most likely another hyped product</li>
            <li>what good but still for $6.00 not worth it.</li>
            <li>This is good tongue scraper if you are looking for an average brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However out of the many scrapers/brushes I&#x27;ve tried the ora brush does a far better job by going above and beyond with first the brush portion to losen the plaque, and other cakey build up on your tongue, and then the scraper portion to kind of squeegee the goo</li>
            <li>The Ora-Brush Tongue cleaner definitely works better than trying to brush your tongue clean with a toothbrush-I use it after brushing and it removed white stuff easily.  </li>
            <li>but it certainly cleans the tongue and makes for a fresh breath.</li>
            <li>The product was in good condition but the brushels were a little bent probably from it coming through the mail and in a plastic seal instead of a box.</li>
            <li>Wash it off and it should look new and clean.</li>
            <li>though it really helped keep my breath fresh for A LOT longer then just my toothbrush</li>
            <li>and I did it exactly the way they said to.</li>
            <li>it did exactly what I was hoping it would do.  </li>
            <li>and we&#x27;ve given several to family and friends because we really do love it.</li>
            <li>This is way way better than the \\&quot;tongue cleaner\\&quot; on the back of some toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The first week or so of using the brush, you&#x27;ll be taking tons of gunk out each day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gross process seeing what comes off of your tongue, but it&#x27;s definitely better than having it still in your mouth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The toothbrush with the tongue cleaner back works better than this.</li>
            <li>but I am really OCD about oral hygiene!).</li>
            <li>Comparing this to three different scrapers I&#x27;d have to say this is much better.  </li>
            <li>Then I spray my tongue (making sure I reach the back) with BreathRx tongue spray, then scrape.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t think this was going to work at first   </li>
            <li>I, at first, gave this a somewhat negative review, but I have changed my mind, and now think it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m much more interested in what actually works, efficiently, for me.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased many similar products before, including (Ayurvedic) metal scraper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I ordered it online, and after much anticipation, I received my Orabrush!</li>
            <li>It seems like it would be abrasive, but it really isn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li>first tried Orabrush when they just started</li>
            <li>The soft bristles make this tongue cleaner unique.</li>
            <li>I combine this product with dr. wieder&#x27;s original tung-gel for a complete cleaning and breath freshening.</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews about this product before buying it, but I pretty much had my mind made up that I wanted to get it.  </li>
            <li>Not so much because it bothers other people, but even your own morning breath can be a pet peave.  </li>
            <li>I have tried various other tongue cleaners and they made me gag, didn&#x27;t clean well enough, or took too long to clean, this is perfect.</li>
            <li>Getting the results I wanted took many repetitions and a very, very long time.</li>
            <li>but I noticed no really dramatic effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The little teeth / prongs are supposed to be really effective at breaking up the stuff (bacteria maybe?)</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t use it all that much.</li>
            <li>I really like the brush.</li>
            <li>All I can say is, this brush cleaned of TONS of stuff even after I tested brushing my tongue with a toothbrush and rinsing really well.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product really works well.  </li>
            <li>so it would not have been much of a mistake if it didn&#x27;t do what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>This item works really well.  </li>
            <li>I ended up buying it because of too much hype about it on internet and everywhere.</li>
            <li>I never knew I had so much stuff on my tongue before I used this.</li>
            <li>This is such a cheaply made product.</li>
            <li>I think these guys should have spent more time designing the brush instead of hyping it with videos.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li>The product also came in a cheap plastic type thing not the one shown in the picture above.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m hoping my review will help someone as much as the Orabrush has helped me.  </li>
            <li>it was only 5 bucks and free shipping.</li>
            <li>The Orabrush was only $5 and Free Shipping</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t woried to much if it had not worked as well as I was hoping.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s what I found something that really work:</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li>After hearing about this in my marketing class, I really wanted to try out the product.</li>
            <li>Just buy a straight plastic tongue scraper, those work really well.</li>
            <li>I get better results when I use my Oral B cross action toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It can be really distracting to constantly be worrying about how much you might be breathing on your friends face, and takes away from many social interactions.  </li>
            <li>so it can&#x27;t possibly reach into the crevices of your tongue to clean it.</li>
            <li>then after about the third time it will b clean.  </li>
            <li>but I think we all want to have as clean of a mouth as we possibly can.  </li>
            <li>Use a Neti Pot or any similar device to clean your nasal area.</li>
            <li>The product might work better if the entire &#x27;brush&#x27; head and scraper was just half of its original size wider.</li>
            <li>I brush my teeth very well and have both a manual toothbrush (Oral B Cross Action with tongue cleaner) and a Sonicare toothbrush, yet I still clean my tongue with the Orabrush.</li>
            <li>It cleans your tongue better than a regular tongue scrapper in theory but in actuality it does about the same amount of work.</li>
            <li>What I mainly don&#x27;t like about this gadget is the scraper blade at the tip of the tool.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Cleans the tongue perfectly so you dont have a bad taste in your mouth after you eat &amp; makes breathe a lot fresher.</li>
            <li>When I tried it, I couldn&#x27;t tell if it was moving much matter off; my tongue looked almost as clear after as before.</li>
            <li>I continued to keep doing it as I now didn&#x27;t want that nastiness in my mouth, I kept doing it for a few minutes until nothing more came</li>
            <li>I used to just use a normal tongue scrubber.</li>
            <li>and I can easily say that this little guy gets the job done very well.</li>
            <li>it works pretty well, i am very surprised on how much gunk is actually on tongues!  </li>
            <li>Live and learn.</li>
            <li>If I forget to use it for a few days, it is amazing all of the gunk that will come off of my tongue, even after brushing (gross I know)!</li>
            <li>I used to use a plastic tongue scraper that was on the back of my tooth brush, and it really did not get much of the gunk off.</li>
            <li>Compare this to the funk that a scraper very clearly removes.</li>
            <li>Its easy to sue and its long lasting</li>
            <li>wow all I can say is get one of these!</li>
            <li>The bristles are short, so you are able to reach further back onto your tongue.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very simple product that really gets the job done!</li>
            <li>usually no.</li>
            <li>It only took about half the residue at the most off of my tongue.    </li>
            <li>I never had a huge trouble with my breath</li>
            <li>I guess this brush works well if you have a lot of stuff on your tongue, but typically I have a clean mouth</li>
            <li>like a dishwasher spot rinse, the Orabrush might provide a slightly shinier finish, after your tongue is clean already.</li>
            <li>Then I scrub my tongue with the soft bristles and then scrape the gunk off.</li>
            <li>The bristles are meant to be soft so that when you brush your tongue you get all the crevices of the tongue without scratching or making your tongue bleed.</li>
            <li>I brush my teeth well in the morning, use the Orabrush a couple times to get everything off of my tongue, and even gargle some Listerine, it definitely does not cure my breath for the whole day.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s really bound to happen when poking around back there.  </li>
            <li>am completely awed by this product.</li>
            <li>I would give it 3-4 star( as a regular tongue scraper) if it was not so much over hyped and mis advertised.</li>
            <li>The bristles are too soft to do anything.</li>
            <li>However, I was pleasantly surprised at how well it works.  </li>
            <li>What sold me about this was the idea that the soft bristles can reach into the grooves of your tongue</li>
            <li>I have read the Orabrush defense of their soft bristles, and I&#x27;ve watched their fake-blood-soaked tutorial video.</li>
            <li>Orabrush, if you are reading my comments, perhaps you should cater for \\&quot;soft, medium, hard\\&quot; bristles just like toothbrushes we find at the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Soft on tongue.</li>
            <li>The bristles on this are a little soft to really get your tongue clean, and the little ledge on the back used - according to the packaging - to scrape all the gunk off during a final sweep of the tongue, just seemed to get in the way most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Before using your tongue is covered in white stuff, after brushing your tongue is pink and clean.</li>
            <li>but I noticed that they have different models of these things I got the older model newer model</li>
            <li>, I brushed my teeth and tongue again with my normal toothbrush rinsed my mouth</li>
            <li>but I live in the same town as the company owners</li>
            <li>The thin soft bristles seemed to work off more yucky stuff than a toothbrush could.</li>
            <li>Although I am uncertain I am using it correctly, (scrape up and down right?)</li>
            <li>, in fact when i switched back to my DenTek, it took forever to clean off what the Orabrush had been missing every morning for a month!,&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>I also noticed I don&#x27;t need it as bad as others do, thank god lol.</li>
            <li>Not strong enough to get tongue clean</li>
            <li>I threw the thing in a drawer to possibly use for household cleaning, although I could have used an old toothbrush just as well.  </li>
            <li>After that it starts subsiding until there&#x27;s barely anything being scraped off each day.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve compared the results and a regular old tongue scraper picks up where this leaves off.  </li>
            <li>The brush is comfortable to use, except for the very back of the tongue, where the squared end of the head keeps you from getting those last few bits.  </li>
            <li>If the bristles were harder each individual bristle would put too much pressure on the tongue seperatley and scratch/ bleed the tongue.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are just right (not too soft or hard).  </li>
            <li>I stupidly fell for this product when I saw a video saying how great it was online.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say enough about how good it is..if you know someone who has bad breathe, get this to them asap</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Best of all I</li>
            <li> This product works great!</li>
            <li> When I got the product it was in excellent shape from shipping and when I tried it with the tongue gel that I bought</li>
            <li> For those prone to tongue \\&quot;gunk\\&quot;- this is the perfect product.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect size through my experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed.  </li>
            <li> I think the best way to use this product is after brushing your teeth and using this product before or after using mouthwash.     </li>
            <li> Best 5 dollars</li>
            <li> VERY effective!!</li>

            <li> Win win!</li>
            <li> 1st time using it, my mouth felt great.  </li>
            <li> I have always been wanting to get this ever since I heard that it was great for eliminating morning breath.  </li>
            <li> The reason that I did not give it a five star rating was the fact that it does not cure morning breath and give you great smelling breath for the rest of the day (which in the official promo video it says it will do).  </li>
            <li> It works great.</li>
            <li> Now to start with, the shipping was great</li>
            <li> This is a great tool for your mouth.</li>
            <li> This thing works great.</li>
            <li> and it works great on her.</li>
            <li> It works great and helps remove plaque quicker than tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I love that its free shipping!!!!  </li>
            <li> It was amazing, I tested my breath when I was done and it was great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Bottom line, it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li> Life is good.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used it 4 over a month and still works good.  </li>
            <li> its a good buy.</li>
            <li> The idea of this tongue brush/cleaner is a good one &amp; I do use it after I brush my teeth &amp; before I rinse.</li>
            <li> Me, I&#x27;ll just use my toothbrush and call it good.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased.</li>
            <li> This tongue cleaning tool is outstanding!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone and everyone who loves to keep a clean fresh tongue!! :D</li>
            <li> The Orabrush Tongue Srubber is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting really amazing results because that is what they have been showing all over  </li>
            <li> /feeling/smelling/tasting amazing</li>
            <li> I tried brushing my tongue and it didn&#x27;t work as well as I liked.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the honest truth.  </li>
            <li> My dentist really liked it</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, when there is doubt there is always product reviews which is the absolute best feature</li>
            <li> and I was amazed by how effective it was.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually a person that gets duped by infomercials, but the way they explained its design and use made perfect sense.    </li>
            <li> All the people who are talking good about this product on internet are people who got this product for free.</li>
            <li> This tongue scraper is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Good thing this product is able to take everything off leaving you with a nice clean tongue.</li>
            <li> I had keep rinsing off the brush and adding water to scrape off more.  </li>
            <li> i do not know if it makes my breath any better, but it did get all the junk off my tounge</li>
            <li> like using tongue scrapers a LOT more...</li>
            <li> I find it more effective and comfortable to use the bristles to brush the tongue, then to rinse the gunk off than to use that scraper blade.</li>
            <li> Even after brushing and scraping your tongue with a toothbrush, the Orabrush somehow still manages to get more stuff off your tongue.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> After using this product before bed, I woke the next morning to a very happy husband.</li>
            <li> I received my Orabrush today and I love it already.</li>
            <li> think the world would be a better place if everyone had one of these.</li>
            <li> will love the DenTek tongue cleaner till I die</li>
            <li> After watching too many videos and hearing about it  </li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t recommend it to anyone if you are looking for magical results as shown on internet infomercial.</li>
            <li> I switched to the Tung brush and love it.</li>
            <li> MAy have to order more.</li>
            <li> The brush is much better at getting into the tongue and cleaning it where as I think the scrapers missed a lot.</li>
            <li> I know I haven&#x27;t gone a day without using my orabrush, and I feel a lot more comfortable now that I do use one!  </li>
            <li> I make love to this thing every night.</li>
            <li> If the end were more tapered, I believe it would be easier to use.</li>
            <li> Hi, I am from Malaysia and in view of the exchange rate, I am more concerned than the rest about the validity of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like it more if the head was rounded, but I still give it 5 stars at it</li>
            <li> However, Orabrush PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE add color selection on amazon, I don&#x27;t know why you are not already able to select the color you want.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many many tongue scrapers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Using the orabrush, I was able to get all the gunk off my tongue.     </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Imagine the smell of my breath in the morning :) That used to be a problem, I had to spend ages cleaning my tongue.</li>
            <li> Cheers :)</li>
            <li> People&#x27;s breath would be a lot better if they used these.</li>
            <li> It cleaned the tongue very well and leaves a very nice minty taste/breath afterwards.  </li>
            <li> However, a toothbrush with a bit of toothpaste can clean the tongue quicker and just as effectively as, and maybe even better than, this gadget.      </li>
            <li> and it helped keep my tongue nice and clean.</li>
            <li> I bought one about a year or so ago when they first came out, and LOVED it.</li>
            <li> I used it three to four times, and it doesnt clean the tongue at all!</li>
            <li> Awesome deep clean feel, oh yes.</li>
            <li> When all this is done my tongue is pink as can be and my breath is excellent.</li>
            <li> The brushing surface does a good job of removing gunk from the tongue, better than scraping or normal bristles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen the videos about it, although I don&#x27;t fall easily for ads, but I bought this one to try it</li>
            <li> I got the Orabrush yesterday (very quick delivery).</li>
            <li> Now I can&#x27;t really smell my own breath, and so I don&#x27;t know for a fact that my breath is better, but</li>
            <li> I can fight around the reflex and still clean my tongue, it just takes more time.</li>
            <li> I do like it, but I wish I didn&#x27;t  gag so easily.</li>
            <li> He rolled over and said, \\&quot;We killed the dragon.\\&quot; :) A great product, it is amazing what could be on your tongue.</li>
            <li> My first time using it was amazing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great especially after having foods with strong odors (ie: seafood or garlic) or if you smoke.</li>
            <li> Honestly some mornings I have almost vomited in the sink, but you learn how to concentrate and relax and not gag so much.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product.   </li>
            <li> My regular teeth-cleaning and tongue-cleaning regimens continue to provide great results for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They had a trial they were running where you could get one for free, just pay s&amp;h so maybe check the official website before purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It has worked great to clean off my tongue, and you can definitely tell that it is doing that job well.  </li>
            <li> B00005BAWO The Original TUNG Brush - Tongue Cleaner with Free TUNG Gel Sample]]</li>
            <li> The concept of this product makes sense: toothbrushes were made to clean smooth surfaces and tongue scrapers</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use this tongue cleaner brush thing that I used it as soon as I received it.  </li>
            <li> I would prefer looking around your area first before ordering it online since many places today carry them.</li>
            <li> The Orabrush is a lifesaver and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> By the time I reached that stage, I noticed my breath had improved significantly.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to get it in the mail to try it out, but once i did i was heartbroken</li>
            <li> For quite some time, I have used Dr. Wieder&#x27;s Original [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The hype makes you think this is new and amazing...</li>
            <li> on your tongue; however, I don&#x27;t think it is much more effective than a regular tongue scrapper from the drug store.</li>
            <li> Just a clean tongue.</li>
            <li> Overall great product, cant wait to try out their foam to assist in kepping your mouth fresh</li>
            <li> Anyone using a plastic spoon to clean their tongue should upgrade to an Orabrush.</li>
            <li> Clean your nasal area on days when none of your nasal passages is blocked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I have a clean mouth till I have used the toung brush along with brushing and flossing.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> It is much better than using a toothbrush for cleaning your tongue, and it&#x27;s gentle too.</li>
            <li> But truthfully, they do absolutely nothing that my toothbrush doesn&#x27;t do.  </li>
            <li> Plus, a mouthful of sweet teeth.</li>
            <li> The Original TUNG Gel - Tongue Cleaner - Fresh Mint]]</li>
            <li> I think the company found the perfect size, if they made it any bigger the chances of gagging is much bigger!</li>
            <li> Thanks for making such a great product, it truly has changed my life.  </li>
            <li> The price is pretty cheap</li>
            <li> Still, I have tried two other tongue cleaners &amp; this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li> The strength of the bristles nicely matches with the nature of my tongue; at first I thought the bristles were too soft but they are not.</li>
            <li> This product has very soft bristles that scrub your tongue better and gentler than a toothbrush would</li>
            <li> This is a pretty neat product!</li>
            <li> when I scraped my tongue saw the evidence that the brush was worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to use it for almost a week, but I really couldn&#x27;t see it useful, nor comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The Orabrush does what it says it will do, and that is leave your tongue feeling fresh, and your breath likewise.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely worth buying</li>
            <li> I use these every night, but my mouth still smells in the morning, it is a useful product, but it doesn&#x27;t do what I have hoped it would do</li>
            <li> I questioned wether or not to get this, but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> After using it my mouth felt extremely fresh.</li>
            <li> I have spent in a good while.</li>
            <li> My breath stays fresh all day and when I wake up in the morning after having used it before bed I don&#x27;t have morning breath.</li>
            <li> Is the incremental \\&quot;benefit\\&quot; really worth it?</li>
            <li> In my opinion this item is well worth 5 bucks.</li>
            <li> It DOES bless you with overall better oral hygiene, but is not the magic trick to long lasting great breath.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to run this over my tongue SEVERAL times to get an OKAY clean.</li>
            <li> but after first few uses breath smelled fresh   and with a bit of mout wash smelled great</li>
            <li> I liked it a lot, and it feels a lot more thorough than the tongue scrapers that ive used in the past.</li>
            <li> and it barely works, my toothbrush does a better job, 2 stars is generous.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got an Orabrush after stumbling across-ed it on the internet recently and ordered one, honestly I thought it most likely another hyped product</li>
            <li> what good but still for $6.00 not worth it.</li>
            <li> This is good tongue scraper if you are looking for an average brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However out of the many scrapers/brushes I&#x27;ve tried the ora brush does a far better job by going above and beyond with first the brush portion to losen the plaque, and other cakey build up on your tongue, and then the scraper portion to kind of squeegee the goo</li>
            <li> The Ora-Brush Tongue cleaner definitely works better than trying to brush your tongue clean with a toothbrush-I use it after brushing and it removed white stuff easily.  </li>
            <li> but it certainly cleans the tongue and makes for a fresh breath.</li>
            <li> The product was in good condition but the brushels were a little bent probably from it coming through the mail and in a plastic seal instead of a box.</li>
            <li> Wash it off and it should look new and clean.</li>
            <li> though it really helped keep my breath fresh for A LOT longer then just my toothbrush</li>
            <li> and I did it exactly the way they said to.</li>
            <li> it did exactly what I was hoping it would do.  </li>
            <li> and we&#x27;ve given several to family and friends because we really do love it.</li>
            <li> This is way way better than the \\&quot;tongue cleaner\\&quot; on the back of some toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The first week or so of using the brush, you&#x27;ll be taking tons of gunk out each day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gross process seeing what comes off of your tongue, but it&#x27;s definitely better than having it still in your mouth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The toothbrush with the tongue cleaner back works better than this.</li>
            <li> but I am really OCD about oral hygiene!).</li>
            <li> Comparing this to three different scrapers I&#x27;d have to say this is much better.  </li>
            <li> Then I spray my tongue (making sure I reach the back) with BreathRx tongue spray, then scrape.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t think this was going to work at first   </li>
            <li> I, at first, gave this a somewhat negative review, but I have changed my mind, and now think it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m much more interested in what actually works, efficiently, for me.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased many similar products before, including (Ayurvedic) metal scraper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I ordered it online, and after much anticipation, I received my Orabrush!</li>
            <li> It seems like it would be abrasive, but it really isn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> first tried Orabrush when they just started</li>
            <li> The soft bristles make this tongue cleaner unique.</li>
            <li> I combine this product with dr. wieder&#x27;s original tung-gel for a complete cleaning and breath freshening.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews about this product before buying it, but I pretty much had my mind made up that I wanted to get it.  </li>
            <li> Not so much because it bothers other people, but even your own morning breath can be a pet peave.  </li>
            <li> I have tried various other tongue cleaners and they made me gag, didn&#x27;t clean well enough, or took too long to clean, this is perfect.</li>
            <li> Getting the results I wanted took many repetitions and a very, very long time.</li>
            <li> but I noticed no really dramatic effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The little teeth / prongs are supposed to be really effective at breaking up the stuff (bacteria maybe?)</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t use it all that much.</li>
            <li> I really like the brush.</li>
            <li> All I can say is, this brush cleaned of TONS of stuff even after I tested brushing my tongue with a toothbrush and rinsing really well.</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product really works well.  </li>
            <li> so it would not have been much of a mistake if it didn&#x27;t do what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> This item works really well.  </li>
            <li> I ended up buying it because of too much hype about it on internet and everywhere.</li>
            <li> I never knew I had so much stuff on my tongue before I used this.</li>
            <li> This is such a cheaply made product.</li>
            <li> I think these guys should have spent more time designing the brush instead of hyping it with videos.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li> The product also came in a cheap plastic type thing not the one shown in the picture above.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m hoping my review will help someone as much as the Orabrush has helped me.  </li>
            <li> it was only 5 bucks and free shipping.</li>
            <li> The Orabrush was only $5 and Free Shipping</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t woried to much if it had not worked as well as I was hoping.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s what I found something that really work:</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li> After hearing about this in my marketing class, I really wanted to try out the product.</li>
            <li> Just buy a straight plastic tongue scraper, those work really well.</li>
            <li> I get better results when I use my Oral B cross action toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It can be really distracting to constantly be worrying about how much you might be breathing on your friends face, and takes away from many social interactions.  </li>
            <li> so it can&#x27;t possibly reach into the crevices of your tongue to clean it.</li>
            <li> then after about the third time it will b clean.  </li>
            <li> but I think we all want to have as clean of a mouth as we possibly can.  </li>
            <li> Use a Neti Pot or any similar device to clean your nasal area.</li>
            <li> The product might work better if the entire &#x27;brush&#x27; head and scraper was just half of its original size wider.</li>
            <li> I brush my teeth very well and have both a manual toothbrush (Oral B Cross Action with tongue cleaner) and a Sonicare toothbrush, yet I still clean my tongue with the Orabrush.</li>
            <li> It cleans your tongue better than a regular tongue scrapper in theory but in actuality it does about the same amount of work.</li>
            <li> What I mainly don&#x27;t like about this gadget is the scraper blade at the tip of the tool.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Cleans the tongue perfectly so you dont have a bad taste in your mouth after you eat &amp; makes breathe a lot fresher.</li>
            <li> When I tried it, I couldn&#x27;t tell if it was moving much matter off; my tongue looked almost as clear after as before.</li>
            <li> I continued to keep doing it as I now didn&#x27;t want that nastiness in my mouth, I kept doing it for a few minutes until nothing more came</li>
            <li> I used to just use a normal tongue scrubber.</li>
            <li> and I can easily say that this little guy gets the job done very well.</li>
            <li> it works pretty well, i am very surprised on how much gunk is actually on tongues!  </li>
            <li> Live and learn.</li>
            <li> If I forget to use it for a few days, it is amazing all of the gunk that will come off of my tongue, even after brushing (gross I know)!</li>
            <li> I used to use a plastic tongue scraper that was on the back of my tooth brush, and it really did not get much of the gunk off.</li>
            <li> Compare this to the funk that a scraper very clearly removes.</li>
            <li> Its easy to sue and its long lasting</li>
            <li> wow all I can say is get one of these!</li>
            <li> The bristles are short, so you are able to reach further back onto your tongue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very simple product that really gets the job done!</li>
            <li> usually no.</li>
            <li> It only took about half the residue at the most off of my tongue.    </li>
            <li> I never had a huge trouble with my breath</li>
            <li> I guess this brush works well if you have a lot of stuff on your tongue, but typically I have a clean mouth</li>
            <li> like a dishwasher spot rinse, the Orabrush might provide a slightly shinier finish, after your tongue is clean already.</li>
            <li> Then I scrub my tongue with the soft bristles and then scrape the gunk off.</li>
            <li> The bristles are meant to be soft so that when you brush your tongue you get all the crevices of the tongue without scratching or making your tongue bleed.</li>
            <li> I brush my teeth well in the morning, use the Orabrush a couple times to get everything off of my tongue, and even gargle some Listerine, it definitely does not cure my breath for the whole day.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s really bound to happen when poking around back there.  </li>
            <li> am completely awed by this product.</li>
            <li> I would give it 3-4 star( as a regular tongue scraper) if it was not so much over hyped and mis advertised.</li>
            <li> The bristles are too soft to do anything.</li>
            <li> However, I was pleasantly surprised at how well it works.  </li>
            <li> What sold me about this was the idea that the soft bristles can reach into the grooves of your tongue</li>
            <li> I have read the Orabrush defense of their soft bristles, and I&#x27;ve watched their fake-blood-soaked tutorial video.</li>
            <li> Orabrush, if you are reading my comments, perhaps you should cater for \\&quot;soft, medium, hard\\&quot; bristles just like toothbrushes we find at the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Soft on tongue.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this are a little soft to really get your tongue clean, and the little ledge on the back used - according to the packaging - to scrape all the gunk off during a final sweep of the tongue, just seemed to get in the way most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before using your tongue is covered in white stuff, after brushing your tongue is pink and clean.</li>
            <li> but I noticed that they have different models of these things I got the older model newer model</li>
            <li> , I brushed my teeth and tongue again with my normal toothbrush rinsed my mouth</li>
            <li> but I live in the same town as the company owners</li>
            <li> The thin soft bristles seemed to work off more yucky stuff than a toothbrush could.</li>
            <li> Although I am uncertain I am using it correctly, (scrape up and down right?)</li>
            <li> , in fact when i switched back to my DenTek, it took forever to clean off what the Orabrush had been missing every morning for a month!,&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li> I also noticed I don&#x27;t need it as bad as others do, thank god lol.</li>
            <li> Not strong enough to get tongue clean</li>
            <li> I threw the thing in a drawer to possibly use for household cleaning, although I could have used an old toothbrush just as well.  </li>
            <li> After that it starts subsiding until there&#x27;s barely anything being scraped off each day.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve compared the results and a regular old tongue scraper picks up where this leaves off.  </li>
            <li> The brush is comfortable to use, except for the very back of the tongue, where the squared end of the head keeps you from getting those last few bits.  </li>
            <li> If the bristles were harder each individual bristle would put too much pressure on the tongue seperatley and scratch/ bleed the tongue.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are just right (not too soft or hard).  </li>
            <li> I stupidly fell for this product when I saw a video saying how great it was online.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say enough about how good it is..if you know someone who has bad breathe, get this to them asap</li>
            <li> I use this brush after brushing my teeth, and sometimes brush gums and other soft tissue with it.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely a product I will repurchase in the future, although the one I have has lasted a long time!</li>
            <li> thought for the price and hype, it would live up to the expectations, but it simply does no greater effect for me than regular products.</li>
            <li> Most bad breath causing bacterial plague resides in the deepest end of the tongue that is far out of the reach of a toothbrush or tongue cleaner.  </li>
            <li> Never let your tongue go dry i.e. drink a lot of fluid esp.</li>
            <li> The only criticism I have is that the end of the cleaner is so wide that I find myself gagging when I am trying to reach the very back of my tongue.</li>
            <li> and I dropped this item in the toilet.</li>
            <li> I wasted $10 being gullible, which usually I&#x27;m not.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve brushed my tongue every day for years, yet after 35 years the pinkness of my tongue was dull, I just assumed this was normal with age.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Orabrush for a long time now</li>
            <li> a long time, and get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also the long handle was easier to use.</li>
            <li> I like spicy food and strange cheeses.</li>
            <li> I have never used any other tongue cleaning products, but this definitely works for me!</li>
            <li> It was not any different from any other tongue scraper I have used before.</li>
            <li> breath is mostly due to the tongue but is not the only source.</li>
            <li> On daily basis take a few \\&quot;shots\\&quot; of undiluted organic apple cider vinegar mixed with honey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On daily basis take a few \\&quot;shots\\&quot; of undiluted organic apple cider vinegar mixed with honey.    </li>
            <li> tongue pale pink tongue is now as pink as a new born baby&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It gets a lot of crud off the back of your tongue that the little flat scrapers seem to miss.  </li>
            <li> Actually, after I used it for a couple months, I don&#x27;t even notice the white stuff on my tongue except in the very back, hard to reach place, but I still use it occasionaly.</li>
            <li> A lot of people are complaining that the brush head is too soft and the size of the head is too small.</li>
            <li> By the end of the morning-tongue-scraping ritual I was usually exhaused and with a sore tongue, while the latter only felt a bit clean-er but still somewhat &#x27;clogged&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Who would keep a broken product or send it back and pay the shipping just to get a new on?</li>
            <li> Usually my mouth starts to feel a little icky, especially after eating breakfast and lunch, but my tongue still feels like it did right after using the Orabrush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reviews talking about how it&#x27;s just little pieces of rubber that can&#x27;t possible</li>
            <li> p.s.-I found the angle between the scrubbing part and the handle to be a little to much, so I actually put mine in boiling water for a few seconds and bent the head back, towards being staight.  </li>
            <li> I had always had a problem with bad breath and this works much better than taking a tooth brush to your tongue.</li>
            <li> If it were at a better price I would have let it go without a bad review.</li>
            <li> It sure helps gets rid of bad breath</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a total con, don&#x27;t waste your time or money, there&#x27;s no deal here.</li>
            <li> Its not as rough on my tounge as I thought it would be either.</li>
            <li> width is not as wide as it seems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second Orabrush now after going for a few months without one.</li>
            <li> I never really questioned it, however I noticed it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was eager to try it, as it has been widely advertised on the internet.</li>
            <li> I had been wanting to buy an Orabrush for a short while after watching a few Youtube videos about this product.</li>
            <li> When I tried it out, it didn&#x27;t feel sharp or firm enough to get the gunk off my tongue.</li>
            <li> I was really bought over by their YouTube adds, in particular one in which the guy talked about halitophobia, the fear of bad breath.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure why this product only has 3 1/2 stars.</li>
            <li> I think the price of 1 was a little expensive, but if you buy a family pack it is worth it.</li>
            <li> carefully dilute home-grade H202 with DISTILLED water and use a nasal dispenser and squeeze it down the nasal passages until you feel it drain down the throat.</li>
            <li> Perhaps if you find the bristles too soft for you, you have a tough tongue.</li>
            <li> Sinusitis is an important source of bad breath.</li>
            <li> Sinusitis is an important source of bad breath.</li>
            <li> Plus the biggest disappointment was that the long fine bristles on it was just comprised of flimsy, weak rubber which had no effect whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Going without one for so long felt disgusting - this product has become as regular a part of my day as actually brushing, and I frequently will use my Orabrush a couple of extra times during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s also a little cheaper than the average scraper on the market considering</li>
            <li> this is supposed to scrape the white crap off my tounge, and it does exactly that   </li>
            <li> But yeah worth it for those who need a little assistance in the bad breath department.</li>
            <li> Usually i use a conventional plastic strip tongue scraper.</li>
            <li> Extend your tongue and the really bad plague buildup that is causing most of the bad breath will be near where the larynx or throat is.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t alleviate the bad breath completely, and you must continue with the regular mouth cleaning (with mouthwash and brushing)</li>
            <li> Give your tongue a few rubs, then tilt it up and scrape off the nastiness.</li>
            <li> waste of $6.00.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve use the Orabrush everyday sence i got it</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and night..</li>
            <li> I used this item everyday for months until tragedy struck</li>
            <li> took out the Orabrush took a few swipes and was literally appalled by the \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; coming off my tongue, I thought it was clean.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone who suffers from bad breath whether it&#x27;s a mild thing after eating or a serious problem.</li>
            <li> A few days later I got sick and my tongue turned Yellow from the bug I caught.  </li>
            <li> It really does help with bad breath.</li>
            <li> There is so much bacteria on your tongue that causes bad breath that your toothbrush and mouthwash just do not reach.  </li>
            <li> This brush is small but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money!</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not sure if there is a way to pick colors).  </li>
            <li> Well I might be wrong about what  I am saying but personally this product did not work for me</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s uncomfortable and can hurt the back of your tongue.</li>
            <li> I even tried doing my usual routine with a tongue brush and a scraper, and still Orabrush would pick something.</li>
            <li> it has a sharp plastic edge, which gathers a little bit of tongue gunk, but the brush itself is absolutely useless.</li>
            <li> I felt really dumb for falling for basically a little infomercial online.</li>
            <li> the shape of your tongue and allows you to reach much further to the back of the tongue than any other tool, (which is where the worst of the plack is)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also helps to clear up that toothpaste flavor that always lingers and makes food taste bad.</li>
            <li> I brush my teeth at least twice a day and floss after meals</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t quite get why the highly-skewed negative comments.</li>
            <li> This cleaner is a gadget that does work to remove the plague on the frontal part of the tongue, albeit somewhat slowly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So when i see those \\&quot;omg it didn&#x27;t work\\&quot; reviews, I get really confused, because Orabrush, plainly, makes the job done.</li>
            <li> When brushing this stuff off you can see the thick, nasty white stuff on the brush, it&#x27;s SO gross.</li>
            <li> Bad breath is not a very pleasant topic to talk about, so I&#x27;ll keep it brief.  </li>
            <li> but I would not recommend this product to anyone serious about the smell of their breath and cleanliness of their tongue.</li>
            <li> The reason I decided to try this product is because I occasionally had problems with bad breath, that&#x27;s no longer an issue.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a such a bad experience by any of the company&#x27;s at amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I had bad breath and a kinda white tongue before I started using the Orabrush.  </li>
            <li> From personal experience on fighting/maintaining bad breath below are my notes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was very disappointed with my first use.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product for myself however because it is a fairly gentle product (hence my disappointment with its ability to remove stuff from my tongue)</li>
            <li> but really no offense to the people with bad reviews even if it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I thought it was worthless but left it in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I am so confused at these people who say they dont get anything off their tongue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a poor Product.</li>
            <li> I now feel that this \\&quot;tongue scraping\\&quot; business is a farce after receiving this silly \\&quot;scraper\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> , I was very very disappointed, (so disappointed that i took the time to write this review), the Orabrush is a sad excuse for a tongue cleaner, the bristles do nothing and the only part that does anything</li>
            <li> Seriously, you need to buy this because your breath stinks.</li>
            <li> no more bad breath</li>
            <li> Along with drinking plenty of water, using the orabrush will solve bad breath due to a dirty tongue.</li>
            <li> I think some people are misled or have the wrong impression of this product.</li>
            <li> I followed all the videos and read instruction to see if I was doing wrong</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had thrown both of them away as they were absolutely useless.</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they did not have the product at the Target I visited.</li>
            <li> No more horrible morning breath, no more during the day bad taste in your mouth.</li>
            <li> if it looks to be dirty</li>
            <li> I am a bit obsessive about my oral hygiene, and the tongue cleaner I was using before wasn&#x27;t cutting it.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this product, but after trying it, I&#x27;m convinced.  </li>
            <li> yet I still have bad breath on occasion.  </li>
            <li> It took away bad breath after eating, it took away my morning breath.</li>
            <li> and it kills bad breath for hours.</li>
            <li> For the longest time I did not understand why I could brush my teeth, floss and use mouth wash before I went to bed AND wake up with bad breath.</li>
            <li> and I brush my teeth also, even so all of these combined don&#x27;t get rid of my bad breath.</li>
            <li> I dont suffer with bad breath</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but I&#x27;ve known the pain of having bad breath for years</li>
            <li> Everybody who says it is a bad product probably doesn&#x27;t know how to use it</li>
            <li> I have suffered for years from chronic bad breath.</li>
            <li> It is a must have for anyone who is worred about having bad breath.</li>
            <li> Reduced bad breath and kept my mouth looking</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing..clears up bad breathe on the tongue..</li>
            <li> I wish I had got to use one. :-(</li>
            <li> I Hate it.</li>
            <li> In exchange it cleans my mouth of unwanted bacteria and bad breath!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it unless I hated the person.</li>
            <li> Now let me just say, I used to have very bad breath.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nasty to see what can come off of your tongue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible.  </li>
            <li> Worst than my tongue scraper.</li>
            <li> I have halitosis (you can google it), and it gives me TERRIBLE breath.</li>
            <li> Nasty stuff on the brush,</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bad breath is not a very pleasant topic to talk about, so I&#x27;ll keep it brief.  If you want total freshness, start by cleaning your tongue. The soft bristles make this tongue cleaner unique. Try it and experience the freshness.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use this tongue cleaner brush thing that I used it as soon as I received it.  It didn&#x27;t bring anything up and I hadn&#x27;t brushed by tongue or anything.  I thought it was worthless but left it in my bathroom.  A few days later I got sick and my tongue turned Yellow from the bug I caught.  I tried brushing my tongue and it didn&#x27;t work as well as I liked.  I tried the tongue brush again and it worked so well!  I had keep rinsing off the brush and adding water to scrape off more.  I guess this brush works well if you have a lot of stuff on your tongue, but typically I have a clean mouth so I don&#x27;t use it all that much.</li>
            <li> I brush my teeth at least twice a day and floss after meals yet I still have bad breath on occasion.  I assumed the orabrush would fix this but it did not.  All the orabrush did was make me gag and irritate my tongue.</li>
            <li> this is supposed to scrape the white crap off my tounge, and it does exactly that   i do not know if it makes my breath any better, but it did get all the junk off my tounge</li>
            <li> I really like the brush. I am so confused at these people who say they dont get anything off their tongue. when I scraped my tongue saw the evidence that the brush was worth it. I think the price of 1 was a little expensive, but if you buy a family pack it is worth it. Best of all I though it really helped keep my breath fresh for A LOT longer then just my toothbrush</li>
            <li> This tongue cleaning tool is outstanding! Give your tongue a few rubs, then tilt it up and scrape off the nastiness. I have had it for a few months and still can&#x27;t get over how much cleaner my mouth is after every use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviews talking about how it&#x27;s just little pieces of rubber that can&#x27;t possible do anything must not have watched to video explaining how it works. All I can say is, this brush cleaned of TONS of stuff even after I tested brushing my tongue with a toothbrush and rinsing really well. Don&#x27;t be fooled by it&#x27;s looks, it does the job very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also helps to clear up that toothpaste flavor that always lingers and makes food taste bad. If you don&#x27;t have an Orabrush yet, what are you waiting for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product. It cleans your tongue better than a regular tongue scrapper in theory but in actuality it does about the same amount of work. The little teeth / prongs are supposed to be really effective at breaking up the stuff (bacteria maybe?) on your tongue; however, I don&#x27;t think it is much more effective than a regular tongue scrapper from the drug store. Bottom line, it&#x27;s a good product but it&#x27;s not life changing. Save yourself a couple of bucks and just pick up a tongue scrapper from your local CVS, Rite Aid, Duane Reade, or Walgreens.</li>
            <li> This product really works well.  I had always had a problem with bad breath and this works much better than taking a tooth brush to your tongue.</li>
            <li> wow all I can say is get one of these! no more bad breath but I noticed that they have different models of these things I got the older model newer model seems to have a wider head but hey it works the same. I would prefer looking around your area first before ordering it online since many places today carry them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen the videos about it, although I don&#x27;t fall easily for ads, but I bought this one to try it and I didn&#x27;t like it at all. I&#x27;ve been trying to use it for almost a week, but I really couldn&#x27;t see it useful, nor comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;I like using tongue scrapers a LOT more...</li>
            <li> Bought this and couldn&#x27;t wait to test this baby. 1st time using it, my mouth felt great.  It&#x27;s the same feeling after a dentist visit. I prefer this brush than the dentist of course. Combine this brush with the tongue gel, my mouth exploded with minty and freshness.</li>
            <li> I got the Orabrush yesterday (very quick delivery). I used it this morning after brushing my teeth, and it got rid of the yellow film that has always been on my tongue. Usually my mouth starts to feel a little icky, especially after eating breakfast and lunch, but my tongue still feels like it did right after using the Orabrush. I have never used any other tongue cleaning products, but this definitely works for me!</li>
            <li> Most bad breath causing bacterial plague resides in the deepest end of the tongue that is far out of the reach of a toothbrush or tongue cleaner.  Extend your tongue and the really bad plague buildup that is causing most of the bad breath will be near where the larynx or throat is.  This cleaner is a gadget that does work to remove the plague on the frontal part of the tongue, albeit somewhat slowly.  However, a toothbrush with a bit of toothpaste can clean the tongue quicker and just as effectively as, and maybe even better than, this gadget.      What I mainly don&#x27;t like about this gadget is the scraper blade at the tip of the tool.  The blade is angled like a garden hoe.  So when I&#x27;m using it to brush the tongue, the blade scrapes the tongue even when I don&#x27;t want it to scrape and it hurts when it does so.  I find it more effective and comfortable to use the bristles to brush the tongue, then to rinse the gunk off than to use that scraper blade.</li>
            <li> I stupidly fell for this product when I saw a video saying how great it was online. It was \\&quot;free\\&quot; when you paid four dollars for shipping and handling. This thing was a joke. Nothing \\&quot;gross\\&quot; came off of my tounge and I did it exactly the way they said to. It didn&#x27;t do anything. I get better results when I use my Oral B cross action toothbrush. I felt really dumb for falling for basically a little infomercial online. It&#x27;s a total con, don&#x27;t waste your time or money, there&#x27;s no deal here.</li>
            <li> This product works great! Its not as rough on my tounge as I thought it would be either. It has my breathe fresher and my confidene peaking. Life is good.</li>
            <li> it works pretty well, i am very surprised on how much gunk is actually on tongues!  i definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on a Sunday and it came on Wednesday! before the estimated delivery date. The product was in good condition but the brushels were a little bent probably from it coming through the mail and in a plastic seal instead of a box.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews about this product before buying it, but I pretty much had my mind made up that I wanted to get it.  The price is pretty cheap so it would not have been much of a mistake if it didn&#x27;t do what I wanted.  When I got the product it was in excellent shape from shipping and when I tried it with the tongue gel that I bought it did exactly what I was hoping it would do.  It cleaned the tongue very well and leaves a very nice minty taste/breath afterwards.  I recommend this product and will buy it again when it wears out.</li>
            <li> I brush my teeth very well and have both a manual toothbrush (Oral B Cross Action with tongue cleaner) and a Sonicare toothbrush, yet I still clean my tongue with the Orabrush. I think some people are misled or have the wrong impression of this product. I don&#x27;t know how they advertise but I always use this product AFTER brushing my teeth. Then I scrub my tongue with the soft bristles and then scrape the gunk off. It&#x27;s great especially after having foods with strong odors (ie: seafood or garlic) or if you smoke. Even after brushing and scraping your tongue with a toothbrush, the Orabrush somehow still manages to get more stuff off your tongue. I love this product. My partner introduced me to it and we&#x27;ve given several to family and friends because we really do love it.</li>
            <li> After using this product before bed, I woke the next morning to a very happy husband. He rolled over and said, \\&quot;We killed the dragon.\\&quot; :) A great product, it is amazing what could be on your tongue. For those prone to tongue \\&quot;gunk\\&quot;- this is the perfect product. It really does help with bad breath. No more horrible morning breath, no more during the day bad taste in your mouth. Just a clean tongue. Thanks.</li>
            <li> This brush is small but it gets the job done. It took away bad breath after eating, it took away my morning breath. Its easy to sue and its long lasting and it kills bad breath for hours. This is a must have product!</li>
            <li> The Orabrush does what it says it will do, and that is leave your tongue feeling fresh, and your breath likewise.  Would recommend to anyone with a tongue.</li>
            <li> I received my Orabrush today and I love it already. It works just like the video says. My mouth has never felt fresher. Buy one, use it, and kiss somebody.</li>
            <li> I Hate it. Don&#x27;t Buy it. It&#x27;s a poor Product. waste of $6.00.  some what good but still for $6.00 not worth it. width is not as wide as it seems.</li>
            <li> A lot of people are complaining that the brush head is too soft and the size of the head is too small. I think the company found the perfect size, if they made it any bigger the chances of gagging is much bigger! This is the perfect size through my experience. I have tried various other tongue cleaners and they made me gag, didn&#x27;t clean well enough, or took too long to clean, this is perfect. The bristles are meant to be soft so that when you brush your tongue you get all the crevices of the tongue without scratching or making your tongue bleed. If the bristles were harder each individual bristle would put too much pressure on the tongue seperatley and scratch/ bleed the tongue.  This is way way better than the \\&quot;tongue cleaner\\&quot; on the back of some toothbrush. I love that its free shipping!!!!  Overall great product, cant wait to try out their foam to assist in kepping your mouth fresh</li>
            <li> The Orabrush Tongue Srubber is AMAZING.  For the longest time I did not understand why I could brush my teeth, floss and use mouth wash before I went to bed AND wake up with bad breath. Introducting Orabrush! All of my problems were solved! There is so much bacteria on your tongue that causes bad breath that your toothbrush and mouthwash just do not reach.  The Orabrush is a lifesaver and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I now feel that this \\&quot;tongue scraping\\&quot; business is a farce after receiving this silly \\&quot;scraper\\&quot;.  It does nothing -- or maybe I just have the cleanest tongue on the planet??  I threw the thing in a drawer to possibly use for household cleaning, although I could have used an old toothbrush just as well.  I wasted $10 being gullible, which usually I&#x27;m not.  Live and learn.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this product, but after trying it, I&#x27;m convinced.  The first week or so of using the brush, you&#x27;ll be taking tons of gunk out each day.  After that it starts subsiding until there&#x27;s barely anything being scraped off each day.  By the time I reached that stage, I noticed my breath had improved significantly.  The reason I decided to try this product is because I occasionally had problems with bad breath, that&#x27;s no longer an issue.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Orabrush for a long time now and I can easily say that this little guy gets the job done very well. It doesn&#x27;t alleviate the bad breath completely, and you must continue with the regular mouth cleaning (with mouthwash and brushing) but it certainly cleans the tongue and makes for a fresh breath.</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money! It does not do the job! I used it three to four times, and it doesnt clean the tongue at all! it has a sharp plastic edge, which gathers a little bit of tongue gunk, but the brush itself is absolutely useless. It hurts a lot if I apply pressure. I would never recommend this to anybody and have already thrown out the one I got.</li>
            <li> This product does NOT work at all. Do not buy. I&#x27;ve had to run this over my tongue SEVERAL times to get an OKAY clean. If it were at a better price I would have let it go without a bad review. But $5? Oh, please.</li>
            <li> I have always been wanting to get this ever since I heard that it was great for eliminating morning breath.  Not so much because it bothers other people, but even your own morning breath can be a pet peave.  So I finally ordered this Orabrush Tongue Cleaner, which came in the color blue for me (I&#x27;m not sure if there is a way to pick colors).  It has worked great to clean off my tongue, and you can definitely tell that it is doing that job well.  The reason that I did not give it a five star rating was the fact that it does not cure morning breath and give you great smelling breath for the rest of the day (which in the official promo video it says it will do).  I brush my teeth well in the morning, use the Orabrush a couple times to get everything off of my tongue, and even gargle some Listerine, it definitely does not cure my breath for the whole day.  Not even all the way between meals.  It DOES bless you with overall better oral hygiene, but is not the magic trick to long lasting great breath.  It is definitely worth buying and I will definitely be getting a another when this one wears out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second Orabrush now after going for a few months without one. Going without one for so long felt disgusting - this product has become as regular a part of my day as actually brushing, and I frequently will use my Orabrush a couple of extra times during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reviewer said that the rubber bristles don&#x27;t do anything, but I find that they help to loosen things up without the sharpness of the scraper. I don&#x27;t know why there are some people who say the scraper doesn&#x27;t work,though, because it works just as dramatically as they show on the commercials, you just have to keep scraping until nothing comes off anymore. It&#x27;s a gross process seeing what comes off of your tongue, but it&#x27;s definitely better than having it still in your mouth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband noticed such a change that he started using one too, which is quite a testament to the product.</li>
            <li> No complaints about this product. Works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last a long time, and get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the world would be a better place if everyone had one of these.</li>
            <li> The Ora-Brush Tongue cleaner definitely works better than trying to brush your tongue clean with a toothbrush-I use it after brushing and it removed white stuff easily.  Actually, after I used it for a couple months, I don&#x27;t even notice the white stuff on my tongue except in the very back, hard to reach place, but I still use it occasionaly.</li>
            <li> This item works really well.  It gets a lot of crud off the back of your tongue that the little flat scrapers seem to miss.  Can make you gag, but that&#x27;s really bound to happen when poking around back there.  Recommended</li>
            <li> I started using a DenTek tongue cleaner and was amazed with the results, then i saw the Orabrush on the infomercial, and thought i&#x27;d try it out, I was very very disappointed, (so disappointed that i took the time to write this review), the Orabrush is a sad excuse for a tongue cleaner, the bristles do nothing and the only part that does anything is the built in tongue scraper and it barely works, my toothbrush does a better job, 2 stars is generous.&lt;br /&gt;I will love the DenTek tongue cleaner till I die, it&#x27;s a sleek simple design, that works well wihth the shape of your tongue and allows you to reach much further to the back of the tongue than any other tool, (which is where the worst of the plack is), in fact when i switched back to my DenTek, it took forever to clean off what the Orabrush had been missing every morning for a month!,&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0013NFZKI Dentek Tongue Cleaner]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve brushed my tongue every day for years, yet after 35 years the pinkness of my tongue was dull, I just assumed this was normal with age. I never really questioned it, however I noticed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got an Orabrush after stumbling across-ed it on the internet recently and ordered one, honestly I thought it most likely another hyped product that wouldn&#x27;t deliver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it in the mail today, I brushed my teeth and tongue again with my normal toothbrush rinsed my mouth well.&lt;br /&gt;Then took out the Orabrush took a few swipes and was literally appalled by the \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; coming off my tongue, I thought it was clean. I continued to keep doing it as I now didn&#x27;t want that nastiness in my mouth, I kept doing it for a few minutes until nothing more came off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My tongue pale pink tongue is now as pink as a new born baby&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;I am completely awed by this product.</li>
            <li> I use these every night, but my mouth still smells in the morning, it is a useful product, but it doesn&#x27;t do what I have hoped it would do so I give it 3 Stars. By the way, I do use mouth wash and I brush my teeth also, even so all of these combined don&#x27;t get rid of my bad breath.</li>
            <li> Yeah it works! So, does all the tongue scrapers I have used. I ended up buying it because of too much hype about it on internet and everywhere. I don&#x27;t know if it is over hyped everywhere but I live in the same town as the company owners so it is really big around here. After watching too many videos and hearing about it  I went to Walmart and bought 2 of these one for me and one for my girl friend. I used it as soon as I got home. I was expecting really amazing results because that is what they have been showing all over  the internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed with my first use.It was not any different from any other tongue scraper I have used before. It works but just like regular scraper. I followed all the videos and read instruction to see if I was doing wrong but I ended with gagging million times and hurting opening of my food pipe. I might have bruised it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any suggestion for this scraper but they are misleading people by over advertising this product. I would give it 3-4 star( as a regular tongue scraper) if it was not so much over hyped and mis advertised. All the people who are talking good about this product on internet are people who got this product for free. Well I might be wrong about what  I am saying but personally this product did not work for me and i don&#x27;t recommend it to anyone if you are looking for magical results as shown on internet infomercial. This is good tongue scraper if you are looking for an average brush.</li>
            <li> I also \\&quot;wanted\\&quot; to like this...but I&#x27;ve compared the results and a regular old tongue scraper picks up where this leaves off.  The hype makes you think this is new and amazing...but it&#x27;s not.  That&#x27;s the honest truth.  I have to wonder about the 5 star reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nasty to see what can come off of your tongue. Good thing this product is able to take everything off leaving you with a nice clean tongue. I combine this product with dr. wieder&#x27;s original tung-gel for a complete cleaning and breath freshening.</li>
            <li> I used to just use a normal tongue scrubber. However, I saw this on an add and asked my dentist about it. My dentist really liked it so I thought I would try it. YUCK... I never knew I had so much stuff on my tongue before I used this. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year now. It works great. But you must brush and scrape and then rinse.</li>
            <li> Although I am uncertain I am using it correctly, (scrape up and down right?) it doesn&#x27;t work for me. AT ALL.  The toothbrush with the tongue cleaner back works better than this.</li>
            <li> It is far too wide to reach the back of the tongue. I ordered 2 to amortize shipping costs but ended up chucking both and using instead a toothbrush with a scraper.</li>
            <li> This is such a cheaply made product. The bristles are too soft to do anything. In fact, they&#x27;re bent over at the ends so it can&#x27;t possibly reach into the crevices of your tongue to clean it. I think these guys should have spent more time designing the brush instead of hyping it with videos.  I switched to the Tung brush and love it. The key is to get the Tung gel too.[[ASIN:B00005BAWO The Original TUNG Brush - Tongue Cleaner with Free TUNG Gel Sample]] [[ASIN:B00005BJ92 The Original TUNG Gel - Tongue Cleaner - Fresh Mint]]</li>
            <li> after the 1st use u will notice a cleaner tongue.  then after about the third time it will b clean.  i&#x27;ve used it 4 over a month and still works good.  its a good buy.</li>
            <li> I questioned wether or not to get this, but it was worth it. I also noticed I don&#x27;t need it as bad as others do, thank god lol. But yeah worth it for those who need a little assistance in the bad breath department. I also got another one at wal-mart for a friend, also likes it. Give it a try, you might also like it XD.</li>
            <li> I got what I ordered abnd got it before Christmas.  The product is as it was described.  My daughter loves it...so do her sisters.  They each want one too.  So do I!!!  MAy have to order more.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this brush and the tongue cleaning foam as I thought my toothbrush did an ok job.  However, I was pleasantly surprised at how well it works.  The bristles are just right (not too soft or hard).  I dont suffer with bad breath but I think we all want to have as clean of a mouth as we possibly can.  I would recommend the brush and foam cleaner!!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product. I&#x27;m not usually a person that gets duped by infomercials, but the way they explained its design and use made perfect sense.    I was excited to get it in the mail to try it out, but once i did i was heartbroken (I know it sounds nerdy but I am really OCD about oral hygiene!). When I tried it out, it didn&#x27;t feel sharp or firm enough to get the gunk off my tongue. It only took about half the residue at the most off of my tongue.    The product might work better if the entire &#x27;brush&#x27; head and scraper was just half of its original size wider. Plus the biggest disappointment was that the long fine bristles on it was just comprised of flimsy, weak rubber which had no effect whatsoever. If the bristles were actually short, medium-strength toothbrush bristles only then might it work. I hope the company is reading this to rethink their quality and manufacturing methods    I know it&#x27;s inexpensive but I would not recommend this product to anyone serious about the smell of their breath and cleanliness of their tongue. My title speaks for itself.</li>
            <li> Comparing this to three different scrapers I&#x27;d have to say this is much better.  The brush is much better at getting into the tongue and cleaning it where as I think the scrapers missed a lot.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.The product came and it was damaged they told me they will send me another one without me returning my product. They sent me another one and that one was also damaged in shipping. They told me to take pictures of the both damaged brushes or send them back. Unfortunately I had thrown both of them away as they were absolutely useless. Who would keep a broken product or send it back and pay the shipping just to get a new on? They told me they wont send me another one. That time it cost about $5.98 and I just lost that amount of money that&#x27;s like trashing it. The product also came in a cheap plastic type thing not the one shown in the picture above. So obviously it got damaged in shipping. I&#x27;ve never had a such a bad experience by any of the company&#x27;s at amazon.com. I don&#x27;t know how it works as I never got to use one. I wish I had got to use one. :-(</li>
            <li> Maybe this product is not much different than brushing your tongue with your tooth brush and then scraping with a tongue scraper, however, this is two in one. The bristles are short, so you are able to reach further back onto your tongue. For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I had bad breath and a kinda white tongue before I started using the Orabrush.  I use it along with Tung tongue cleaner and BreathRx tongue spray.  My tongue routine is to brush my tongue with the Orabrush and Tung, then scrape;  after that rinse with water.  Then I spray my tongue (making sure I reach the back) with BreathRx tongue spray, then scrape.  Then I rinse with BreathRx mouthwash. When all this is done my tongue is pink as can be and my breath is excellent. I never write reviews, but I&#x27;ve known the pain of having bad breath for years and I&#x27;m hoping my review will help someone as much as the Orabrush has helped me.  Thanks for making such a great product, it truly has changed my life.  NO BS!</li>
            <li> I was really bought over by their YouTube adds, in particular one in which the guy talked about halitophobia, the fear of bad breath.  I was and still am (to a lesser degree) always worrying about my breath when I&#x27;m interacting with people.  It can be really distracting to constantly be worrying about how much you might be breathing on your friends face, and takes away from many social interactions.  If this sounds like you, I recommend this! Now I can&#x27;t really smell my own breath, and so I don&#x27;t know for a fact that my breath is better, but I know I haven&#x27;t gone a day without using my orabrush, and I feel a lot more comfortable now that I do use one!  p.s.-I found the angle between the scrubbing part and the handle to be a little to much, so I actually put mine in boiling water for a few seconds and bent the head back, towards being staight.  I find this makes it easier for me to get the back part of my tongue with the scrubbing part. Also this may help with gagging.  Honestly some mornings I have almost vomited in the sink, but you learn how to concentrate and relax and not gag so much.</li>
            <li> I make love to this thing every night. In exchange it cleans my mouth of unwanted bacteria and bad breath! Win win!</li>
            <li> Now to start with, the shipping was great it got here before the estimated date as soon as the arrival was possible about 4 days it got here I&#x27;m very happy with it. My first time using it was amazing, I couldn&#x27;t see a ton of stuff coming off my tongue but I definitely saw some stuff. After using it my mouth felt extremely fresh. It was amazing, I tested my breath when I was done and it was great. Everybody who says it is a bad product probably doesn&#x27;t know how to use it but really no offense to the people with bad reviews even if it didn&#x27;t work it was only 5 bucks and free shipping.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t think this was going to work at first   but after first few uses breath smelled fresh   and with a bit of mout wash smelled great</li>
            <li> The idea of this tongue brush/cleaner is a good one &amp; I do use it after I brush my teeth &amp; before I rinse. The only criticism I have is that the end of the cleaner is so wide that I find myself gagging when I am trying to reach the very back of my tongue. If the end were more tapered, I believe it would be easier to use. Still, I have tried two other tongue cleaners &amp; this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li> I, at first, gave this a somewhat negative review, but I have changed my mind, and now think it&#x27;s great. It is much better than using a toothbrush for cleaning your tongue, and it&#x27;s gentle too. I do recommend this.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty neat product! It&#x27;s a very simple product that really gets the job done!</li>
            <li> This is a great tool for your mouth. I have noticed my tongue getting cleaner.</li>
            <li> I tried this after seeing an online ad. I have suffered for years from chronic bad breath. Usually i use a conventional plastic strip tongue scraper. What sold me about this was the idea that the soft bristles can reach into the grooves of your tongue that a scraper ordinarilly can&#x27;t. When I tried it, I couldn&#x27;t tell if it was moving much matter off; my tongue looked almost as clear after as before. Compare this to the funk that a scraper very clearly removes. If you prefer a scraper, try Oolitt. But after using Orabrush, my mouth felt cooler and cleaner than it appears. Guess I have to keep using it.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product.   Wile I never had a huge trouble with my breath I was eager to try it, as it has been widely advertised on the internet. It has eliminated any trace of morning breath.   I am very impressed.  Five stars!</li>
            <li> The concept of this product makes sense: toothbrushes were made to clean smooth surfaces and tongue scrapers just scrape the surface of your tongue. This product has very soft bristles that scrub your tongue better and gentler than a toothbrush would and then there is a scraper to pull all that stuff you brushed out off your tongue.     I think the best way to use this product is after brushing your teeth and using this product before or after using mouthwash.     I liked it a lot, and it feels a lot more thorough than the tongue scrapers that ive used in the past.</li>
            <li> I have tried cleaning my tongue with a plastic spoon, with a Toothbrush (Both manual and electric) and the results were never pleasing. I had been wanting to buy an Orabrush for a short while after watching a few Youtube videos about this product. I decided to buy mine on Amazon. The Orabrush was only $5 and Free Shipping so I wasn&#x27;t woried to much if it had not worked as well as I was hoping. My order shipped on July 30th. It arrived 3 days later and I have been using it every day since. I simply gargle some water brush/scrape my tongue. I was amazed at how well this product actually worked. My tongue is cleaner than it has ever been and I can&#x27;t say that enough. NOTE: I have a gag reflex when brushing the back of my tongue. I still get the reaction when I use the Orabrush but that is just how well it works. I can fight around the reflex and still clean my tongue, it just takes more time. 5 dollars is 5 dollars. Anyone using a plastic spoon to clean their tongue should upgrade to an Orabrush. Best 5 dollars I have spent in a good while.</li>
            <li> This tongue scraper is by far the best I&#x27;ve used. My breath stays fresh all day and when I wake up in the morning after having used it before bed I don&#x27;t have morning breath. I don&#x27;t even need gum or mints throughout the day anymore. I highly recommend this product for anyone who suffers from bad breath whether it&#x27;s a mild thing after eating or a serious problem. This product delivers.</li>
            <li> Cleans the tongue perfectly so you dont have a bad taste in your mouth after you eat &amp; makes breathe a lot fresher.</li>
            <li> For quite some time, I have used Dr. Wieder&#x27;s Original [[ASIN:B00005BAWO Tung-Brush]] and [[ASIN:B00005BJ92 Tung-Gel]] for my tongue, and I have been very pleased. Using the Orabrush AFTER this regimen seems to provide a marginally pinker finish ... but I noticed no really dramatic effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to actually *replace* the Tung products with the Orabrush, but it was like trying to bathe with a Q-Tip. Getting the results I wanted took many repetitions and a very, very long time. So I finally went back to using the Tung Brush and Gel before the Orabrush.  I have read the Orabrush defense of their soft bristles, and I&#x27;ve watched their fake-blood-soaked tutorial video. But I&#x27;m much more interested in what actually works, efficiently, for me.  I also dislike the Orabrush built-in scraper -- it&#x27;s uncomfortable and can hurt the back of your tongue. So I finally went back to using my regular plastic scraper - the [[ASIN:B000WM1DZW Pureline Tongue Cleaner]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, to conclude ... like a dishwasher spot rinse, the Orabrush might provide a slightly shinier finish, after your tongue is clean already. Is the incremental \\&quot;benefit\\&quot; really worth it? For me ... usually no. My regular teeth-cleaning and tongue-cleaning regimens continue to provide great results for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible.  It doesn&#x27;t do anything.  It actually hurt my tongue.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it unless I hated the person.</li>
            <li> Hi, I am from Malaysia and in view of the exchange rate, I am more concerned than the rest about the validity of this product. I am a person who cares a lot about oral hygiene. I have purchased many similar products before, including (Ayurvedic) metal scraper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not speak for Orabrush but I don&#x27;t quite get why the highly-skewed negative comments. I tried Orabrush and it does what it is supposed to do. The strength of the bristles nicely matches with the nature of my tongue; at first I thought the bristles were too soft but they are not. Perhaps if you find the bristles too soft for you, you have a tough tongue. Orabrush, if you are reading my comments, perhaps you should cater for \\&quot;soft, medium, hard\\&quot; bristles just like toothbrushes we find at the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad breath is mostly due to the tongue but is not the only source. From personal experience on fighting/maintaining bad breath below are my notes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CAVITY AREA:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Go to the dentist often for dental checkup and services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. On alternate days, use diluted home-grade H202 (together with Baking Soda if you wish) to gargle and brush your teeth with. Learn how to dilute substances (from the internet) before you try this!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. After brushing your teeth, scrape your tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Never let your tongue go dry i.e. drink a lot of fluid esp. when you are on medication. Liquor can make the tongue dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NASAL AREA:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Use a Neti Pot or any similar device to clean your nasal area. Watch it at YouTube. I only use a plastic dispenser used for salad dressing. Use lukewarm water mixed with salt and baking soda. Clean your nasal area on days when none of your nasal passages is blocked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Here&#x27;s what I found something that really work: carefully dilute home-grade H202 with DISTILLED water and use a nasal dispenser and squeeze it down the nasal passages until you feel it drain down the throat. Learn how to dilute substances (from the internet) before you try this!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Understand your body tolerance towards allergy and mitigate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Sinusitis is an important source of bad breath. Understand and mitigate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INTESTINAL AREA:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. On daily basis take a few \\&quot;shots\\&quot; of undiluted organic apple cider vinegar mixed with honey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Take yogurt that has acidophilus in it; or you can purchase acidophilus capsules from the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading.owards allergy and mitigate it.    4.

            <li> I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT!! AND I LOVE IT!!! :D Soft on tongue. VERY effective!! I WILLL BUY AGAIN! I recommend this to anyone and everyone who loves to keep a clean fresh tongue!! :D</li>
            <li> After hearing about this in my marketing class, I really wanted to try out the product. I couldn&#x27;t find it in a Wal-Greens nor a Wal-Mart, so I did some research and learned that they have it at Target. Unfortunately, they did not have the product at the Target I visited. I ordered it online, and after much anticipation, I received my Orabrush! Sadly, there isn&#x27;t much notable difference with the Orabrush and a regular tongue cleaner. I used it for over two weeks and I see no improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought for the price and hype, it would live up to the expectations, but it simply does no greater effect for me than regular products. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> the Orabrush is the greatest product for your mouth ever realesed sence the toothbursh..  It is a must have for anyone who is worred about having bad breath. i&#x27;ve use the Orabrush everyday sence i got it and it has never once disapointed me.</li>
            <li> I use this brush after brushing my teeth, and sometimes brush gums and other soft tissue with it.  The brushing surface does a good job of removing gunk from the tongue, better than scraping or normal bristles.  The brush is comfortable to use, except for the very back of the tongue, where the squared end of the head keeps you from getting those last few bits.  I&#x27;d like it more if the head was rounded, but I still give it 5 stars at it is.</li>
            <li> Works like a Miracle. Before using your tongue is covered in white stuff, after brushing your tongue is pink and clean. When brushing this stuff off you can see the thick, nasty white stuff on the brush, it&#x27;s SO gross. However, Orabrush PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE add color selection on amazon, I don&#x27;t know why you are not already able to select the color you want.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised. I don&#x27;t feel like I have a clean mouth till I have used the toung brush along with brushing and flossing.&lt;br /&gt;Also if it looks to be dirty I recomend soaking it briefly in hydrogen peroxide. Wash it off and it should look new and clean.</li>
            <li> Not strong enough to get tongue clean</li>
            <li> Worst than my tongue scraper. Just buy a straight plastic tongue scraper, those work really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many many tongue scrapers.&lt;br /&gt;One of the simplest solutions is a spoon. (It&#x27;s also a little cheaper than the average scraper on the market considering you&#x27;ll probably have one lying around.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However out of the many scrapers/brushes I&#x27;ve tried the ora brush does a far better job by going above and beyond with first the brush portion to losen the plaque, and other cakey build up on your tongue, and then the scraper portion to kind of squeegee the goo away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to anyone out there looking to get rid of those white tongues.&lt;br /&gt;Especially smokers like myself.&lt;br /&gt;It works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They had a trial they were running where you could get one for free, just pay s&amp;h so maybe check the official website before purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if this is still a sales pitch or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when there is doubt there is always product reviews which is the absolute best feature amazon can offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the creators of this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bucky Wilson&lt;br /&gt;(...)</li>
            <li> This is bs. All it does is take of the sticky saliva at the back of the tongue, and yet my breath STILL smells like a gagged a donkey. I would not recommend this to anyone. The advertisement lies. They can go take this Product and stick it up their ASSets.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why this product only has 3 1/2 stars. This thing works great. Now let me just say, I used to have very bad breath. I wouldnt go to school without a pack of gum.    I used to ora brush once, and I could instantly tell the difference. My breath did not stink at all. (Tested this by licking my arm and with their spoon test)     I used to use a plastic tongue scraper that was on the back of my tooth brush, and it really did not get much of the gunk off. Using the orabrush, I was able to get all the gunk off my tongue.     That&#x27;s without even mentioning the price!! I bought it for around 5 bucks plus shipping.    Along with drinking plenty of water, using the orabrush will solve bad breath due to a dirty tongue.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item as well as a Tongue Sweeper. I was disappointed with this product for myself however because it is a fairly gentle product (hence my disappointment with its ability to remove stuff from my tongue) I let my daughter use it instead and it works great on her.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I bought one about a year or so ago when they first came out, and LOVED it. I have halitosis (you can google it), and it gives me TERRIBLE breath. Brushing my teeth and mouthwash alone don&#x27;t help. THIS DID. It seems like it would be abrasive, but it really isn&#x27;t! It feels like a massage on your tongue. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It definitely made my tongue feel cleaner. The thin soft bristles seemed to work off more yucky stuff than a toothbrush could. Also the long handle was easier to use.</li>
            <li> I do like it, but I wish I didn&#x27;t  gag so easily. It sure helps gets rid of bad breath</li>
            <li> It works great and helps remove plaque quicker than tooth brush.</li>
            <li> i do not like this brush I want to return it I bleed every time I brush with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evette&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> These guys are built well, they&#x27;re not pieces of junk.  But truthfully, they do absolutely nothing that my toothbrush doesn&#x27;t do.  The bristles on this are a little soft to really get your tongue clean, and the little ledge on the back used - according to the packaging - to scrape all the gunk off during a final sweep of the tongue, just seemed to get in the way most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take it or leave it.  Me, I&#x27;ll just use my toothbrush and call it good.</li>
            <li> I like spicy food and strange cheeses. I&#x27;m also a smoker and a coffee drinker. Plus, a mouthful of sweet teeth. Imagine the smell of my breath in the morning :) That used to be a problem, I had to spend ages cleaning my tongue. Tried everything: tongue brushes, scrapers, backs of toothbrushes, tablespoons and what-not. By the end of the morning-tongue-scraping ritual I was usually exhaused and with a sore tongue, while the latter only felt a bit clean-er but still somewhat &#x27;clogged&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first tried Orabrush when they just started and I was amazed by how effective it was. Whoosh-whoosh, done. Nasty stuff on the brush, oh my. Awesome deep clean feel, oh yes. I even tried doing my usual routine with a tongue brush and a scraper, and still Orabrush would pick something. It&#x27;s all about those hairs, I guess. And I know it lasts, because my breath used to bother me during the day, and now it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when i see those \\&quot;omg it didn&#x27;t work\\&quot; reviews, I get really confused, because Orabrush, plainly, makes the job done. Even after the \\&quot;expiry date\\&quot; suggested by the manufacturer. No, they didn&#x27;t pay me. Cheers :)</li>
            <li> I used this after I brushed my teeth and it helped keep my tongue nice and clean. Reduced bad breath and kept my mouth looking/feeling/smelling/tasting amazing</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing..clears up bad breathe on the tongue..I use it everyday and night..can&#x27;t say enough about how good it is..if you know someone who has bad breathe, get this to them asap</li>
            <li> I used this item everyday for months until tragedy struck and I dropped this item in the toilet. In my opinion this item is well worth 5 bucks.</li>
            <li> People&#x27;s breath would be a lot better if they used these. Seriously, you need to buy this because your breath stinks.</li>
            <li> I am a bit obsessive about my oral hygiene, and the tongue cleaner I was using before wasn&#x27;t cutting it. I bought this after I saw about a million youtube people rave about it (sponsored product.) I am really impressed though! If I forget to use it for a few days, it is amazing all of the gunk that will come off of my tongue, even after brushing (gross I know)! This is definitely a product I will repurchase in the future, although the one I have has lasted a long time!</li>
