            <li>and it works great!</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t very happy with the results at all .i</li>
            <li>This eye cream is awesome!  </li>
            <li>Great product and awesome company that cares about their customers!</li>
            <li>After two weeks of use, I can happily say that I am very pleased with the results!</li>
            <li>, this was a great purchase for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>Great product, hydrates and brightens skin overnight</li>
            <li>The under eye puffiness has also been greatly reduced since I have been using this product.</li>
            <li>This is a great discovery for me.</li>
            <li>Although I felt cheated after purchasing this product, Amazon did something amazing!</li>
            <li>Good product and great customer service.</li>
            <li>Well I loved the Retinol cream but the eye cream wasn&#x27;t as great for me.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product and it&#x27;s a nice routine I&#x27;ve gotten into!</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>Really good stuff.</li>
            <li>I have been very happy with the product Morning Light Beauty.</li>
            <li>This is a really good product.  </li>
            <li>but it seems to be doing a good job at reducing the appearance of under-eye puffiness.</li>
            <li>This product came in within good time.</li>
            <li>This gel is good.  </li>
            <li>If you want a good product working effectively on puffiness, try Elizabeth Arden eye treatment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s basically an aloe and Vitamin C gel, which is nice and probably good for your skin</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this eye cream!</li>
            <li>Eye cream has been the best I seen a difference in eyes in first week</li>
            <li>I was very impressed that it worked on the puffiness the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>It might work better for others!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>So, I love the Intensive Eye Gel!</li>
            <li>Love this eye gel!</li>
            <li>thing that I love the most is the great value that this is.</li>
            <li>I read so many good reviews about this product, but did not see results with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product from a very helpful company.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was impressed by the natural ingredients and the ease in applying it immediately.</li>
            <li>Then I found Morning Light at a good price and tried it.</li>
            <li>Most products take time to be effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you for a wonderful product!&lt;br /&gt;Kathy (62 years old)</li>
            <li>my make-up goes on very smoothly over it.</li>
            <li>a tightPeople are noticing and asking if I am getting more rest.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li>I received this Saturday and used it that night woke up Sunday looking more refreshed</li>
            <li>I feel so much better about myself.</li>
            <li>Most eye creams either too greasy or they just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I have used many eye gels, this is on par with the rest...</li>
            <li>I can confidently recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>The serum has a much more soothing affect than lotion type products that I have tried.</li>
            <li>should be a top buy.</li>
            <li>I am so glad</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t return the product, but I am confident that if I had decided to do so, it would not have been a problem.  </li>
            <li>but this eye gel has lifted them up :)  </li>
            <li>If I put it on a night, I wake up with my eyes more puffy than ever.</li>
            <li>but it is hands-down better then a lot of the products I&#x27;ve tried over the years.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that my skin looks more even and dewy (not oily).  </li>
            <li>and I did not apply any more than a pea sized amount in the areas that needed treatment.</li>
            <li>I love this eye cream, it makes my eyes feel awake and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Even so, I wanted something to better my skin or even for preventative care.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference at all, but I&#x27;m still going to use it in my nightly regime in case it&#x27;s doing something I&#x27;m just not seeing yet (until I find something I like more of course).</li>
            <li>Will buy more when my gift runs out.</li>
            <li>Even my friends have been commenting on how much better they look and wanting to try it themselves.  </li>
            <li>Makeup won&#x27;t smudge like when applied on top of creams.  </li>
            <li>buy again if the packaging was better; but not until then........</li>
            <li>Sure I will continue to keep using it.  </li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>I will continue using to see if there is more improvement over time.</li>
            <li>Need to give it some more time.</li>
            <li>Thank you Morning Light Beauty!</li>
            <li>Thank you, Morning Light!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s another great thing with this product, after using it for some time I don&#x27;t need to dispense as much.</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to continued use and even better results.</li>
            <li>I also liked the cool, refreshing feeling that it gave my eye</li>
            <li>I love to use it best after taking off my makeup after a long day at the office in front of a computer screen.</li>
            <li>I have pretty good skin already but was looking for something to lessen the look of aging.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Morning Light Beauty products!!!  </li>
            <li>I began using Morning Light eye cream a couple of months ago, after trying many, many products.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wake up with puffy eyes anymore, and I love that it goes on smoothly and absorbs well</li>
            <li>I love how light it goes</li>
            <li>I found this product to be effective right away, that is why I ordered it again and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I looked better and when you don&#x27;t feel good, at least you can look good or better than you feel.  </li>
            <li>The first bottle worked great although the dispenser emitted too much of the product.</li>
            <li>I also noticed some reduction in fine lines.</li>
            <li>But this one is definitely been the most effective!</li>
            <li>Just a dab of this cream is all that is needed to soothe and hydrate the area around my eyes, and even smooth some of the fine lines caused by dryness and makeup products.</li>
            <li>The gel is clean, fresh and goes on easily!</li>
            <li>and I have seen huge changes.  </li>
            <li>Brought it on a plane, and when I got to my destination, the pump bottle was sputtering rather than smoothly depositing.</li>
            <li>This one is a light gel with no oder.</li>
            <li>The product is light, non-oily, and non-irritating.  </li>
            <li>it feels fantastic.  </li>
            <li>and I also like its light texture that I can wear it under my make up.</li>
            <li>If you have puffy eyes, especially in the morning, this is great stuff to put on in the morning.</li>
            <li>Give Morning Light Cream</li>
            <li>I waited a while after I had gotten the cream so that I could really try it out and give them honest feedback.</li>
            <li>it must be the Morning Light eye gel and the Morning Light Retinol Cream.  </li>
            <li>Feel comfortable wearing on skin.  </li>
            <li>I have oily skin, so I tend to avoid eye creams and gels, but Morning Light is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>So far so good...</li>
            <li>Definitely didn&#x27;t work for me, but the company was very nice and emailed me to follow up on its progress.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get the results most others seem to get from the product, but the return was fast and easy.</li>
            <li>I am using my second bottle of this serum and it is by far the best I have found for puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li>great stuff, helps with puffiness and does not create dry skin!</li>
            <li>So far I have seen results with this product, however it doesn&#x27;t deliver amazing results like some have claimed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: I did receive a full refund.</li>
            <li>many promises, but not so much results.  </li>
            <li>Very cooling and my undereye never looked better.</li>
            <li>This product arrived very quickly and was exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>though - I am being affected by allergies and thyroid problems - so that is going to require adequate rest..</li>
            <li>It came quickly as I am a Prime member</li>
            <li>I am African American with brown skin and this product works perfectly on my skin complexion.</li>
            <li>I felt a tingling, warm sensation as I massaged it in, but I really didn&#x27;t see much of a difference on my face.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, it does absorb quickly.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>But even though the Intensive Eye Gel helps with the puffiness, and after more time I may be able to switch completely, not yet.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited to get this once ordered.  </li>
            <li>This is my first review ever!</li>
            <li>Conversely, this second bottle emits a better and more useful portion of the product, but I have not seen the results that I did during the first bottle.</li>
            <li>Great little product.</li>
            <li>I am a CPA and during tax season it really helped my eyes look alert and awake, which is a huge accomplishment.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the dispenser, I liked the results well enough to order a second bottle.</li>
            <li>item is worth it.</li>
            <li>Liked the feel of the cream and it seemed to help in a short period of time</li>
            <li>It may be worth trying this product, if they are still offering the guarantee.  </li>
            <li>and I started with it right away.  </li>
            <li>It worked right away</li>
            <li>I bought two bottles, I have eye bags under my right eye</li>
            <li>and I put it right on there</li>
            <li>received this product two days ago and started using it right away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it makes any noticable change in the long run, but each morning it feels very good and refreshing to dab on under the eyes.  </li>
            <li>The good news is that the Morning Light Beauty guarantees total customer satisfaction or your money back.</li>
            <li>This is a great, affordable product, and I highly recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s looking to reduce the dark circles under their eyes.</li>
            <li>When I first got this gel</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Morning light has been well tolerated by my overly sensitive eye area.</li>
            <li>Not expensive and definitely works better.</li>
            <li>gave it more than enough time for it to &amp;#34;work</li>
            <li>I like the product enough to continue using for sure.</li>
            <li>Does absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li>This is the first eye cream I have ever used</li>
            <li>and I really like it!</li>
            <li>It seems to be working pretty well.</li>
            <li>After writing a review I could not believe they actually contacted me to inform me that they would refund my money, as they wanted me to be completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I will remain a customer always, thanks again Amazon!</li>
            <li>I love it and especially like how it flattens and tones the skin under my eyes.</li>
            <li>More than enough for both eyes.</li>
            <li>I will probably reorder this one since the others did not help as much!</li>
            <li>It also helped with my ever present wrinkles, which I was ok with saying goodbye to.</li>
            <li>I think this eye gel works fairly well because it has vitamin C, cucumber extract, aloe and green tea extract in it.</li>
            <li>I have had only used this product for a few days - I gave it 5 stars because so far I am happy with it!!</li>
            <li>I will not buy it again, but did get my money back easily.</li>
            <li>But I have to say that although this is no &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; product, my skin has definitely improved, and I strongly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li>That is the one good thing I can mention about this product: the container does last quite a long time...</li>
            <li>and I was surprised to see it working after the first week!</li>
            <li>While I think it did moisturize, I don&#x27;t think it really did as much as I&#x27;d hoped or much with my fine lines and such around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I really like this.  </li>
            <li>In addition, it doesn&#x27;t travel very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 62 and have very puffy bags.</li>
            <li>Will not reorder as I expected to see  a lot more results.. Will try something else.</li>
            <li>Customer service has become a lost art in recent years, but at Morning Light Beauty</li>
            <li>My initial response is this product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>But this is really noticeable and I feel compelled to spread the word.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had some time using Morning Light (not religiously, I must add)</li>
            <li>Very</li>
            <li>Often when I wake in the morning, I notice that the skin is much smoother, almost flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She can&#x27;t use it because it really burns her skin.</li>
            <li>I really like these two products.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get much sleep as I am in nursing school</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>The owners are very helpful and even sent a follow up email to see how it was working.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have issues with my eyes really at all except from puffiness and dryness from tissues from when my dog died.</li>
            <li>This is just a gel that does nothing to really help with puffy eyes.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like this eye cream.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a difference when I use this product in the mornings.. its cooling and absorbs fast..</li>
            <li>But today, I can REALLY tell.</li>
            <li>Although, I did not receive the outcome I expected from my purchase, I was completely satisfied with the way Amazon handled the situation.</li>
            <li>It releases to much product.  </li>
            <li>Nothing OTC would do much of anything.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to you</li>
            <li>and I really like it...</li>
            <li>is the first eye product I have tried in many years (due to denial, I guess!)</li>
            <li>, I wanted to review it right away, I was so pleasantly surprised but</li>
            <li>I can say the first treatment help to reduce my puffiness about 25%, so i will continue the second order for some more weeks to see what is next.</li>
            <li>The product works better than any other one I’ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I had better results with other products, some of which were cheaper than this.    </li>
            <li>Great eye gel a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>I believe it may help more to reduce my puffiness and the dark area under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I do not have dark circles which is what many eye creams address.  </li>
            <li>I must admit I was not always consistent but not to far off.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was the pump action.  </li>
            <li>It seemed to help with the wrinkles more than dark circles</li>
            <li>My eye area actually looks more vibrant, firmer, and younger.  </li>
            <li>used this cream for 2 weeks, main issue for me is underye puffiness-</li>
            <li>My main issue is puffiness.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend trying the product as you&#x27;ve got nothing to lose.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes this might reduce puffiness</li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>I first used the gel the night before waking up at 5:30 AM to watch the USA v. Russia hockey game, and for the first time in my life my eyes looked more awake than my body felt.</li>
            <li>Not sure how to rate this but a month in I can say this: The pro&#x27;s- Very inexpensive versus most creams in this space.</li>
            <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: the manufacturer offered full refund for my purchase, so I was pleased to see that they stand behind their product to that extent.</li>
            <li>it is really good, i can notice a difference after two weeks, just a small dab on finger is just enough, not to oily.</li>
            <li>The gel is easy to apply, relatively odorless, and has become an essential part of my morning routine.</li>
            <li>I plan on trying other Morning Light products as well.</li>
            <li>Give it a couple of weeks if you are a new user.</li>
            <li>but whatever I find myself using the serum 2 - 3 times a day without any noticeable reduction in fine lines, wrinkles, or dark circles.</li>
            <li>In fairness to this product, I have been searching for a product to effectively improve my dark circles for a long time.</li>
            <li>It is very refreshing and only takes a small amount to do the job.</li>
            <li>My original expectations were not high, but I was surprised.  </li>
            <li>The crepiness was visibly reduced in the first eye area after only one application.  </li>
            <li>I suffer from allergies and this is the only product I have found that really works!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it religiously for the past month, day and night and it does make my eyes look more awake!</li>
            <li>like many other creams/gels I&#x27;ve used before the results don&#x27;t have a lasting result.</li>
            <li>I try new eye creams that promise depuffing miracles,  but this one so far is a dud.  </li>
            <li>Very rarely have I seen the slightest difference in the bags under my eyes, &amp; when I did see it, it didn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li>Both my puffiness and dark circles have diminished significantly.  </li>
            <li>gel is very easy to apply, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>After using Morning Light for a little over a week, however, I could not be happier with the results.</li>
            <li>So far I have found nothing that works for me.</li>
            <li>that works well on puffiness but the ingredients, though touted for sensitive eyes, is not.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s alive and well.</li>
            <li>and I really am seeing an improvement, especially on my eyelids.  </li>
            <li>, actually i don&#x27;t have much on today.&amp;#34;  She asked me again today,  Then it hit me...</li>
            <li>My eye area overall is much brighter as well.</li>
            <li>It leaves my eyes feeling alive and energized.</li>
            <li>So far it seems to do the job.  </li>
            <li>and I know the ingredients are natural and contain vitamins</li>
            <li>no heavy, oily feeling-</li>
            <li>This early in my usage, I can&#x27;t report any changes to my under eye wrinkles, and I don&#x27;t have a problem with darkness, but the puffiness relief is wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s working.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Morning Light Intensive Eye Gel for a few months now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost 65 years old and no money for plastic surgery or botox.  </li>
            <li>I had puffy eyes and dark circles under my eyes from the stress of house hunting and this product helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t had the product long enough to know if it really works as the advertisement suggests.  </li>
            <li>I had to take the opportunity to do so, after being disappointed so many times with most beauty purchases I&#x27;ve made throughout the years, from the highest rated to the priciest</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product because of the overall effect it has achieved.</li>
            <li>I am on my second bottle and i recommend it highly to everyone.</li>
            <li>Just because it didn&#x27;t work for me, does not mean that it will not work for others (we all are made differently) and</li>
            <li>people try to sell you on facebook for huge amounts of money and will do no better than this eye cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight feeling, no odor I can detect, and goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It takes so little and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Did little or nothing for laugh lines so far.</li>
            <li>I tested another system of products recently and loved the eye gel, but it was so expensive.</li>
            <li>so far though I will definitely be rebuying once it runs out!</li>
            <li>This is the first eye gel I&#x27;ve used that helps make the dark circles under my eyes appear lighter.</li>
            <li>It seems to help a little right away to relieve puffiness.  </li>
            <li>There is a real live person at the other end of the email, who will answer your questions and provide you with additional information about the product.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement in either my dark circles or bags under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I have very predominant dark circles</li>
            <li>And it feels cool on delicate tissue.</li>
            <li>When first applied I see no difference but a few hours after application, I do see a difference in the bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now, and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in puffiness, fine lines, and dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have used so many different kinds of eye creams, gels and even many high-end expensive brands with no great results.</li>
            <li>Overall, I noticed a difference in both fine line and wrinkles as well as dark circles underneath my eyes, which have always been a trouble spot for me.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this in hopes that it will slowly but surely continue to decrease the dark circles and puffiness.</li>
            <li>A little goes a LONG way and you can feel and see a difference right away.</li>
            <li>I have been using Morning Light everyday for almost three weeks and the dark circles around my eyes have almost faded entirely.</li>
            <li>I see a little progress in the bags, but not as much as I had hoped for.  </li>
            <li>I used the whole bottle and saw little difference in my eye bags or crows feet.  </li>
            <li>My friend asked me the other day if I was wearing new makeup.  </li>

            <li> I would have rated this a 1 or 2 for the product results, but the wonderful customer service brought it up another star.</li>

            <li> The customer service is excellent and I would recommend.  </li>

            <li> Thank you for a great product! ~Cathy~</li>
            <li> and it is great!</li>
            <li> and it works great!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t very happy with the results at all .i</li>
            <li> This eye cream is awesome!  </li>
            <li> Great product and awesome company that cares about their customers!</li>
            <li> After two weeks of use, I can happily say that I am very pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> , this was a great purchase for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> LOL</li>
            <li> Great product, hydrates and brightens skin overnight</li>
            <li> The under eye puffiness has also been greatly reduced since I have been using this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great discovery for me.</li>
            <li> Although I felt cheated after purchasing this product, Amazon did something amazing!</li>
            <li> Good product and great customer service.</li>
            <li> Well I loved the Retinol cream but the eye cream wasn&#x27;t as great for me.  </li>
            <li> This is a good product and it&#x27;s a nice routine I&#x27;ve gotten into!</li>
            <li> Good luck</li>
            <li> Really good stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with the product Morning Light Beauty.</li>
            <li> This is a really good product.  </li>
            <li> but it seems to be doing a good job at reducing the appearance of under-eye puffiness.</li>
            <li> This product came in within good time.</li>
            <li> This gel is good.  </li>
            <li> If you want a good product working effectively on puffiness, try Elizabeth Arden eye treatment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically an aloe and Vitamin C gel, which is nice and probably good for your skin</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this eye cream!</li>
            <li> Eye cream has been the best I seen a difference in eyes in first week</li>
            <li> I was very impressed that it worked on the puffiness the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> It might work better for others!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> So, I love the Intensive Eye Gel!</li>
            <li> Love this eye gel!</li>
            <li> thing that I love the most is the great value that this is.</li>
            <li> I read so many good reviews about this product, but did not see results with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product from a very helpful company.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was impressed by the natural ingredients and the ease in applying it immediately.</li>
            <li> Then I found Morning Light at a good price and tried it.</li>
            <li> Most products take time to be effective.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you for a wonderful product!&lt;br /&gt;Kathy (62 years old)</li>
            <li> my make-up goes on very smoothly over it.</li>
            <li> a tightPeople are noticing and asking if I am getting more rest.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> I received this Saturday and used it that night woke up Sunday looking more refreshed</li>
            <li> I feel so much better about myself.</li>
            <li> Most eye creams either too greasy or they just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have used many eye gels, this is on par with the rest...</li>
            <li> I can confidently recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love the product.</li>
            <li> The serum has a much more soothing affect than lotion type products that I have tried.</li>
            <li> should be a top buy.</li>
            <li> I am so glad</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t return the product, but I am confident that if I had decided to do so, it would not have been a problem.  </li>
            <li> but this eye gel has lifted them up :)  </li>
            <li> If I put it on a night, I wake up with my eyes more puffy than ever.</li>
            <li> but it is hands-down better then a lot of the products I&#x27;ve tried over the years.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that my skin looks more even and dewy (not oily).  </li>
            <li> and I did not apply any more than a pea sized amount in the areas that needed treatment.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream, it makes my eyes feel awake and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Even so, I wanted something to better my skin or even for preventative care.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference at all, but I&#x27;m still going to use it in my nightly regime in case it&#x27;s doing something I&#x27;m just not seeing yet (until I find something I like more of course).</li>
            <li> Will buy more when my gift runs out.</li>
            <li> Even my friends have been commenting on how much better they look and wanting to try it themselves.  </li>
            <li> Makeup won&#x27;t smudge like when applied on top of creams.  </li>
            <li> buy again if the packaging was better; but not until then........</li>
            <li> Sure I will continue to keep using it.  </li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> I will continue using to see if there is more improvement over time.</li>
            <li> Need to give it some more time.</li>
            <li> Thank you Morning Light Beauty!</li>
            <li> Thank you, Morning Light!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s another great thing with this product, after using it for some time I don&#x27;t need to dispense as much.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to continued use and even better results.</li>
            <li> I also liked the cool, refreshing feeling that it gave my eye</li>
            <li> I love to use it best after taking off my makeup after a long day at the office in front of a computer screen.</li>
            <li> I have pretty good skin already but was looking for something to lessen the look of aging.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Morning Light Beauty products!!!  </li>
            <li> I began using Morning Light eye cream a couple of months ago, after trying many, many products.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wake up with puffy eyes anymore, and I love that it goes on smoothly and absorbs well</li>
            <li> I love how light it goes</li>
            <li> I found this product to be effective right away, that is why I ordered it again and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I looked better and when you don&#x27;t feel good, at least you can look good or better than you feel.  </li>
            <li> The first bottle worked great although the dispenser emitted too much of the product.</li>
            <li> I also noticed some reduction in fine lines.</li>
            <li> But this one is definitely been the most effective!</li>
            <li> Just a dab of this cream is all that is needed to soothe and hydrate the area around my eyes, and even smooth some of the fine lines caused by dryness and makeup products.</li>
            <li> The gel is clean, fresh and goes on easily!</li>
            <li> and I have seen huge changes.  </li>
            <li> Brought it on a plane, and when I got to my destination, the pump bottle was sputtering rather than smoothly depositing.</li>
            <li> This one is a light gel with no oder.</li>
            <li> The product is light, non-oily, and non-irritating.  </li>
            <li> it feels fantastic.  </li>
            <li> and I also like its light texture that I can wear it under my make up.</li>
            <li> If you have puffy eyes, especially in the morning, this is great stuff to put on in the morning.</li>
            <li> Give Morning Light Cream</li>
            <li> I waited a while after I had gotten the cream so that I could really try it out and give them honest feedback.</li>
            <li> it must be the Morning Light eye gel and the Morning Light Retinol Cream.  </li>
            <li> Feel comfortable wearing on skin.  </li>
            <li> I have oily skin, so I tend to avoid eye creams and gels, but Morning Light is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> So far so good...</li>
            <li> Definitely didn&#x27;t work for me, but the company was very nice and emailed me to follow up on its progress.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the results most others seem to get from the product, but the return was fast and easy.</li>
            <li> I am using my second bottle of this serum and it is by far the best I have found for puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> great stuff, helps with puffiness and does not create dry skin!</li>
            <li> So far I have seen results with this product, however it doesn&#x27;t deliver amazing results like some have claimed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: I did receive a full refund.</li>
            <li> many promises, but not so much results.  </li>
            <li> Very cooling and my undereye never looked better.</li>
            <li> This product arrived very quickly and was exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> though - I am being affected by allergies and thyroid problems - so that is going to require adequate rest..</li>
            <li> It came quickly as I am a Prime member</li>
            <li> I am African American with brown skin and this product works perfectly on my skin complexion.</li>
            <li> I felt a tingling, warm sensation as I massaged it in, but I really didn&#x27;t see much of a difference on my face.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, it does absorb quickly.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> But even though the Intensive Eye Gel helps with the puffiness, and after more time I may be able to switch completely, not yet.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to get this once ordered.  </li>
            <li> This is my first review ever!</li>
            <li> Conversely, this second bottle emits a better and more useful portion of the product, but I have not seen the results that I did during the first bottle.</li>
            <li> Great little product.</li>
            <li> I am a CPA and during tax season it really helped my eyes look alert and awake, which is a huge accomplishment.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the dispenser, I liked the results well enough to order a second bottle.</li>
            <li> item is worth it.</li>
            <li> Liked the feel of the cream and it seemed to help in a short period of time</li>
            <li> It may be worth trying this product, if they are still offering the guarantee.  </li>
            <li> and I started with it right away.  </li>
            <li> It worked right away</li>
            <li> I bought two bottles, I have eye bags under my right eye</li>
            <li> and I put it right on there</li>
            <li> received this product two days ago and started using it right away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it makes any noticable change in the long run, but each morning it feels very good and refreshing to dab on under the eyes.  </li>
            <li> The good news is that the Morning Light Beauty guarantees total customer satisfaction or your money back.</li>
            <li> This is a great, affordable product, and I highly recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s looking to reduce the dark circles under their eyes.</li>
            <li> When I first got this gel</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Morning light has been well tolerated by my overly sensitive eye area.</li>
            <li> Not expensive and definitely works better.</li>
            <li> gave it more than enough time for it to &amp;#34;work</li>
            <li> I like the product enough to continue using for sure.</li>
            <li> Does absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li> This is the first eye cream I have ever used</li>
            <li> and I really like it!</li>
            <li> It seems to be working pretty well.</li>
            <li> After writing a review I could not believe they actually contacted me to inform me that they would refund my money, as they wanted me to be completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I will remain a customer always, thanks again Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love it and especially like how it flattens and tones the skin under my eyes.</li>
            <li> More than enough for both eyes.</li>
            <li> I will probably reorder this one since the others did not help as much!</li>
            <li> It also helped with my ever present wrinkles, which I was ok with saying goodbye to.</li>
            <li> I think this eye gel works fairly well because it has vitamin C, cucumber extract, aloe and green tea extract in it.</li>
            <li> I have had only used this product for a few days - I gave it 5 stars because so far I am happy with it!!</li>
            <li> I will not buy it again, but did get my money back easily.</li>
            <li> But I have to say that although this is no &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; product, my skin has definitely improved, and I strongly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> That is the one good thing I can mention about this product: the container does last quite a long time...</li>
            <li> and I was surprised to see it working after the first week!</li>
            <li> While I think it did moisturize, I don&#x27;t think it really did as much as I&#x27;d hoped or much with my fine lines and such around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I really like this.  </li>
            <li> In addition, it doesn&#x27;t travel very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 62 and have very puffy bags.</li>
            <li> Will not reorder as I expected to see  a lot more results.. Will try something else.</li>
            <li> Customer service has become a lost art in recent years, but at Morning Light Beauty</li>
            <li> My initial response is this product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> But this is really noticeable and I feel compelled to spread the word.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some time using Morning Light (not religiously, I must add)</li>
            <li> Very</li>
            <li> Often when I wake in the morning, I notice that the skin is much smoother, almost flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She can&#x27;t use it because it really burns her skin.</li>
            <li> I really like these two products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get much sleep as I am in nursing school</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> The owners are very helpful and even sent a follow up email to see how it was working.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have issues with my eyes really at all except from puffiness and dryness from tissues from when my dog died.</li>
            <li> This is just a gel that does nothing to really help with puffy eyes.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like this eye cream.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference when I use this product in the mornings.. its cooling and absorbs fast..</li>
            <li> But today, I can REALLY tell.</li>
            <li> Although, I did not receive the outcome I expected from my purchase, I was completely satisfied with the way Amazon handled the situation.</li>
            <li> It releases to much product.  </li>
            <li> Nothing OTC would do much of anything.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to you</li>
            <li> and I really like it...</li>
            <li> is the first eye product I have tried in many years (due to denial, I guess!)</li>
            <li> , I wanted to review it right away, I was so pleasantly surprised but</li>
            <li> I can say the first treatment help to reduce my puffiness about 25%, so i will continue the second order for some more weeks to see what is next.</li>
            <li> The product works better than any other one I’ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I had better results with other products, some of which were cheaper than this.    </li>
            <li> Great eye gel a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I believe it may help more to reduce my puffiness and the dark area under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I do not have dark circles which is what many eye creams address.  </li>
            <li> I must admit I was not always consistent but not to far off.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the pump action.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to help with the wrinkles more than dark circles</li>
            <li> My eye area actually looks more vibrant, firmer, and younger.  </li>
            <li> used this cream for 2 weeks, main issue for me is underye puffiness-</li>
            <li> My main issue is puffiness.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend trying the product as you&#x27;ve got nothing to lose.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes this might reduce puffiness</li>
            <li> I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I first used the gel the night before waking up at 5:30 AM to watch the USA v. Russia hockey game, and for the first time in my life my eyes looked more awake than my body felt.</li>
            <li> Not sure how to rate this but a month in I can say this: The pro&#x27;s- Very inexpensive versus most creams in this space.</li>
            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: the manufacturer offered full refund for my purchase, so I was pleased to see that they stand behind their product to that extent.</li>
            <li> it is really good, i can notice a difference after two weeks, just a small dab on finger is just enough, not to oily.</li>
            <li> The gel is easy to apply, relatively odorless, and has become an essential part of my morning routine.</li>
            <li> I plan on trying other Morning Light products as well.</li>
            <li> Give it a couple of weeks if you are a new user.</li>
            <li> but whatever I find myself using the serum 2 - 3 times a day without any noticeable reduction in fine lines, wrinkles, or dark circles.</li>
            <li> In fairness to this product, I have been searching for a product to effectively improve my dark circles for a long time.</li>
            <li> It is very refreshing and only takes a small amount to do the job.</li>
            <li> My original expectations were not high, but I was surprised.  </li>
            <li> The crepiness was visibly reduced in the first eye area after only one application.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from allergies and this is the only product I have found that really works!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it religiously for the past month, day and night and it does make my eyes look more awake!</li>
            <li> like many other creams/gels I&#x27;ve used before the results don&#x27;t have a lasting result.</li>
            <li> I try new eye creams that promise depuffing miracles,  but this one so far is a dud.  </li>
            <li> Very rarely have I seen the slightest difference in the bags under my eyes, &amp; when I did see it, it didn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> Both my puffiness and dark circles have diminished significantly.  </li>
            <li> gel is very easy to apply, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> After using Morning Light for a little over a week, however, I could not be happier with the results.</li>
            <li> So far I have found nothing that works for me.</li>
            <li> that works well on puffiness but the ingredients, though touted for sensitive eyes, is not.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s alive and well.</li>
            <li> and I really am seeing an improvement, especially on my eyelids.  </li>
            <li> , actually i don&#x27;t have much on today.&amp;#34;  She asked me again today,  Then it hit me...</li>
            <li> My eye area overall is much brighter as well.</li>
            <li> It leaves my eyes feeling alive and energized.</li>
            <li> So far it seems to do the job.  </li>
            <li> and I know the ingredients are natural and contain vitamins</li>
            <li> no heavy, oily feeling-</li>
            <li> This early in my usage, I can&#x27;t report any changes to my under eye wrinkles, and I don&#x27;t have a problem with darkness, but the puffiness relief is wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Morning Light Intensive Eye Gel for a few months now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 65 years old and no money for plastic surgery or botox.  </li>
            <li> I had puffy eyes and dark circles under my eyes from the stress of house hunting and this product helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t had the product long enough to know if it really works as the advertisement suggests.  </li>
            <li> I had to take the opportunity to do so, after being disappointed so many times with most beauty purchases I&#x27;ve made throughout the years, from the highest rated to the priciest</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product because of the overall effect it has achieved.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle and i recommend it highly to everyone.</li>
            <li> Just because it didn&#x27;t work for me, does not mean that it will not work for others (we all are made differently) and</li>
            <li> people try to sell you on facebook for huge amounts of money and will do no better than this eye cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very lightweight feeling, no odor I can detect, and goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It takes so little and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Did little or nothing for laugh lines so far.</li>
            <li> I tested another system of products recently and loved the eye gel, but it was so expensive.</li>
            <li> so far though I will definitely be rebuying once it runs out!</li>
            <li> This is the first eye gel I&#x27;ve used that helps make the dark circles under my eyes appear lighter.</li>
            <li> It seems to help a little right away to relieve puffiness.  </li>
            <li> There is a real live person at the other end of the email, who will answer your questions and provide you with additional information about the product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement in either my dark circles or bags under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have very predominant dark circles</li>
            <li> And it feels cool on delicate tissue.</li>
            <li> When first applied I see no difference but a few hours after application, I do see a difference in the bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now, and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in puffiness, fine lines, and dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have used so many different kinds of eye creams, gels and even many high-end expensive brands with no great results.</li>
            <li> Overall, I noticed a difference in both fine line and wrinkles as well as dark circles underneath my eyes, which have always been a trouble spot for me.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this in hopes that it will slowly but surely continue to decrease the dark circles and puffiness.</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way and you can feel and see a difference right away.</li>
            <li> I have been using Morning Light everyday for almost three weeks and the dark circles around my eyes have almost faded entirely.</li>
            <li> I see a little progress in the bags, but not as much as I had hoped for.  </li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle and saw little difference in my eye bags or crows feet.  </li>
            <li> My friend asked me the other day if I was wearing new makeup.  </li>
            <li> However, as a soothing eye gel I like this product; it absorbs immediately, has a cooling effect and is a very nice base for applying concealer.</li>
            <li> WOW, for the first time ever, I got an undereye cream/gel that does NOT send my eyes into a crying frenzy!!!  </li>
            <li> I bought this product mainly because I was tired of paying for high priced eye creams.  </li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m not sure any cream will do what we really want it to do so</li>
            <li> Just a tiny bit dabbed under each eye goes a long way and doesn&#x27;t burn or give my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 35 year old female who has been suffering the last few years with hyporthyroidism-hashimotos autoimmune disease.</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive as I have very sensitive skin around my eyes and often have an allergic reaction to gels/creams in that area.  </li>
            <li> It stings if it gets in your eye and the pump bottle is hard to gauge how much is going to come squirting out, but once you get used to it you compensate.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested it beneath one eye only for ten days and there was so difference in the dark circles.</li>
            <li> As long as they keep making this, I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it for too long</li>
            <li> Puffiness is unaffected in the slightest.</li>
            <li> My first thoughts were that maybe the manufacturer slightly altered the ingredients or changed the formula - not sure -</li>
            <li> impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an over-60 woman who purchased this product about three months ago due to dark circles under my eyes and I have been pleasantly surprised by the results.</li>
            <li> I purchased this eye cream after reading the reviews on this and several other products.  </li>
            <li> And as didn&#x27;t want to dry out my eyes and since all undereye stuff makes me cry</li>
            <li> The dark circles under my eyes have definitely lightened up -</li>
            <li> I have been teased about the dark circles around my eyes throughout my entire life.</li>
            <li> I still have the same dark circles, and puffiness under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> this product did nothing for me, Kind of disappointed no any change on any way or manner,</li>
            <li> I do not think there is a product that will totally take down my eye puffiness.  </li>
            <li> I ran out, bought a similar but other brand that dried the skin under my eyes out and look tiredness cane back.</li>
            <li> We all have different chemistries, and I do have a slight allergy to Vitamin C, but am not irritated by this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help reduce the puffiness and black and blue under my eyes.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Laugh lines&amp;#34; are less noticeable and the skin is actually tightening.  </li>
            <li> It has been only a little while, but I can tell that the puffiness and darkness is lessened.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a little over a week</li>
            <li> the bags were a little smaller.</li>
            <li> , it does&#x27;t dry out the skin around your eyes like some other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I recently traveled for a few days forgetting to pack the cream and could tell a difference without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few days.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product a few times</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell its effects as it&#x27;s only been a few days but</li>
            <li> I have had puffy eyes and dark circles for so long.</li>
            <li> probably because I have hundreds of dollars worth of useless ones languishing in my medicine cabinet...</li>
            <li> This product made absolutely no difference.  </li>
            <li> I received my Intensive Eye Gel this past Thursday (earlier than I had expected) and started using it before bed that evening and every night since.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty cynical but after a recent sinus infection that just increased the eye puffiness, I tried this.  </li>
            <li> The other day&lt;</li>
            <li> If it can work for me with puffiness due to an underlying condition,  it&#x27;s bound to work for you.</li>
            <li> I tried this one because of the part of the add that said try this even if you have tried a lot of other eye creams.  </li>
            <li> The other eye cream makes me cry.</li>
            <li> I gave it a try to resorb puffiness under my eyes (after trying so many other products), and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I do however have puffiness and eye bags, probably due to aging.</li>
            <li> I recommend this if you want to have that wide awake look and don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money doing it!</li>
            <li> Additionally, I found no extracurricular irritation around the corners of my eyes, which has occurred with some other eye care products in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has made a difference in my under eye bags but only a small difference, and it seems to take awhile before I see those results.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way on this product too!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me, but it may work for other skin types.</li>
            <li> I would have expected something more dramatic by now - unfortunately I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes to the darkness after a month of use.</li>
            <li> It helps a little, but not much.</li>
            <li> I have used all the super expensive products from Sephora and this one beats them all!</li>
            <li> have problems with puffiness, dark circles, and crepiness.  </li>
            <li> The puffiness and dark circles under my eyes have visibly reduced.  </li>
            <li> I had been using it only once a day and hadn&#x27;t noticed any improvement, but for the past few weeks have been using it twice a day.</li>
            <li> I saw no improvement in dark circles.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on its advertising claim that it works for dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have since used it morning and night beneath both eyes and the dark circles have not improved.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any change to the dark circles under the eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that the dark circles are not as dark - the puffiness</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of eye creams for bags, lines and dark circles.</li>
            <li> I like it because it seems to hydrate and reduce bags and dark</li>
            <li> I have always had dark purple circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It has shown no improvement to the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dark circles</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dark circles, so I can&#x27;t comment on that being a problem for me.</li>
            <li> It made no difference to the dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> The dark circles were almost gone.</li>
            <li> It did remove dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have had dark circles for a while now....</li>
            <li> Used this and saw improvement on puffiness and dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I used this product every morning for two weeks for my dark circles.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dark circles</li>
            <li> Seems to help with the dark circles also.  </li>
            <li> but it crtainly is lightweight and works well under the eys minimizing dark circles and puffiness.</li>
            <li> It seems to also brighten the area under the eyes making puffiness and dark circles go away.</li>
            <li> Based on that and the irritating pump action of the delivery system, I would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this eye cream because I had dark circles and in less than a week, I noticed the dark circles were disappearing.  </li>
            <li> you may as well keep the out of pocket down.</li>
            <li> noticed my dark circles are less severe</li>
            <li> I have been using it forvabout 2 and a half weeks.</li>
            <li> But being only a moisturizing gel it is seriously overpriced, and nothing in the ingredient list indicates it would ever improve the appearance of under-eye circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read all the previous reviews, so I&#x27;m hoping to see a change.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I will put it on at night and notice a less strain on the eyes.</li>
            <li> I noticed some lightening under the eyes in less than a week.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to only get a little bit - either nothing comes out or way too much, so a lot of it gets wasted.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this eye cream, but unfortunately I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference, even after using it for a few months.  </li>
            <li> I usually reserve such comments for at least a month&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> It may take a little longer to fully attack the bags (</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had little sleep.</li>
            <li> The biggest plus is the virtual nonexistence of dark, puffy circles under my eyes in the morning!  </li>
            <li> but I saw very little if almost no change with my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> Use this product nightly, takes a few weeks to see any effects,  Would have preferred faster results.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve been using it every night a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks now and have seen no benefit at all.</li>
            <li> have tried it for a few weeks I will  not buy it again .</li>
            <li> and I only used it for approximately a month or less.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> No more dark circles!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had dark eye circles (probably from working night shifts) and this cream is slowly erasing them from my face.</li>
            <li> As male in my mid-twenties, I was initially skeptical about this product.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I will purchase this again</li>
            <li> Im not sure if this is working.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s hard to control the amount dispensed.  </li>
            <li> Turning 50 has been hard.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend at least to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Disappointing result, but I am taking advantage of the money back guarantee and moving on.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very difficult to tell if you actually got all the product out of the container.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I felt like I wasted my money on this product.</li>
            <li> Not very impressed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money does not work!!!</li>
            <li> I would not hesitate to purchase any of their products because they stand behind them 100%.</li>
            <li> so this helps to hide my tired looking eyes.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t reduce the puffiness, i think it might have made it marginally worse.</li>
            <li> So, I respect them standing behind their guarantee.  </li>
            <li> I tried OTC brands (all of them), expensive store brands - nothing.</li>
            <li> I was wrong, the results were almost immediate.</li>
            <li> no clumping or weird interaction of products.  </li>
            <li> It was difficult to get it to pump and quite often it would squirt the product out so that it ended up all over rather than creaming it out.  </li>
            <li> expensive stuff</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> Cold spoons, tea bags.</li>
            <li> :(&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry to report.</li>
            <li> Lately, though, I&#x27;ve been afflicted with awful under eye puffiness and no amount of tea bags, cold spoons, or ice packs was doing the trick, so I gave this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have another eye cream that was very expensive</li>
            <li> Works well on my bad bags.</li>
            <li> It makes your eyes all puffy :(</li>
            <li> and my lids have started to hood a bit  :(</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good product and great customer service.</li>
            <li> I really like this.  I&#x27;m not sure if it makes any noticable change in the long run, but each morning it feels very good and refreshing to dab on under the eyes.  I just didn&#x27;t like the dispenser on it - it&#x27;s very difficult to tell if you actually got all the product out of the container.</li>
            <li> I began using Morning Light eye cream a couple of months ago, after trying many, many products.  I was impressed by the natural ingredients and the ease in applying it immediately. I also liked the cool, refreshing feeling that it gave my eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have problems with puffiness, dark circles, and crepiness.  The very first time I applied it, I applied it to one eye area and waited a few moments before applying it to the other.  I wanted to see if there was any immediate result.  There was. The crepiness was visibly reduced in the first eye area after only one application.  I was impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of months later, the crepiness is almost gone, and there is volume again in my eye area.  I see a little progress in the bags, but not as much as I had hoped for.  However, I&#x27;m giving this product five stars because it has totally brightened my eye area.  No more dark circles!  My eye area actually looks more vibrant, firmer, and younger.  It may take a little longer to fully attack the bags (as I said before, it has helped somewhat), but all in all, this was a great purchase for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product because of the overall effect it has achieved.</li>
            <li> I just reordered.....great stuff, helps with puffiness and does not create dry skin! Give it a couple of weeks if you are a new user.</li>
            <li> The puffiness and dark circles under my eyes have visibly reduced.  Just a tiny bit dabbed under each eye goes a long way and doesn&#x27;t burn or give my skin a tightPeople are noticing and asking if I am getting more rest. LOL</li>
            <li> When I first got this gel I was skeptical, as I am about most eye or skin products. I had been using it only once a day and hadn&#x27;t noticed any improvement, but for the past few weeks have been using it twice a day. Now I am noticing the difference! The dark circles under my eyes have definitely lightened up - I realize I just had to give it some time, and still do. I will continue to use this in hopes that it will slowly but surely continue to decrease the dark circles and puffiness. We all have different chemistries, and I do have a slight allergy to Vitamin C, but am not irritated by this product. I would recommend at least to give it a try.</li>
            <li> With this product I see no difference in my under eye area. I&#x27;ve only been using for 3 weeks, but still nothing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now, and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in puffiness, fine lines, and dark circles under my eyes. In addition, it doesn&#x27;t travel very well. Brought it on a plane, and when I got to my destination, the pump bottle was sputtering rather than smoothly depositing.</li>
            <li> Used the eye gel as soon as I received it and I did notice an improvement with the bags under my eyes. I&#x27;m still using it and my under eye bags are smaller. I am not expecting miracles because I will be 74 this year but I&#x27;m hoping the bags will disappear.</li>
            <li> I saw no improvement in dark circles. The lotion also made my eyes red. It did seem to improve under eye firmness to some degree. In fairness to this product, I have been searching for a product to effectively improve my dark circles for a long time. I haven&#x27;t yet found a product that works.</li>
            <li> This item didn&#x27;t make a difference for me. I have been using it forvabout 2 and a half weeks. I&#x27;m 62 and have very puffy bags. So far I have found nothing that works for me.</li>
            <li> I tried this as directed by the product instructions. While I think it did moisturize, I don&#x27;t think it really did as much as I&#x27;d hoped or much with my fine lines and such around my eyes. I have pretty good skin already but was looking for something to lessen the look of aging.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on its advertising claim that it works for dark circles. (The bottle itself makes no such claim anywhere, and only states it is an \\&quot;Intensive Eye Gel.\\&quot;) If this product had been advertised only as a soothing eye gel I would not have purchased it, as the price is way too high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested it beneath one eye only for ten days and there was so difference in the dark circles. I have since used it morning and night beneath both eyes and the dark circles have not improved. However, as a soothing eye gel I like this product; it absorbs immediately, has a cooling effect and is a very nice base for applying concealer. But being only a moisturizing gel it is seriously overpriced, and nothing in the ingredient list indicates it would ever improve the appearance of under-eye circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I did receive a full refund.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I tested another system of products recently and loved the eye gel, but it was so expensive. Then I found Morning Light at a good price and tried it. It was exactly what I was looking for! A little goes a LONG way and you can feel and see a difference right away.</li>
            <li> I received the eye gel and have been using it every day for about a&lt;br /&gt;week.  I like it a lot and think it is helping my under eye area.  The other day&lt;br /&gt;when lunching with my son, he said &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t know what it is, but you look&lt;br /&gt;younger today.&amp;#34;  So.....maybe it is working !!  I will continue to use it and&lt;br /&gt;see if others notice also.  Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 35 year old female who has been suffering the last few years with hyporthyroidism-hashimotos autoimmune disease. It makes your eyes all puffy :( I have been searching for years for a product to alleviate this. I tried OTC brands (all of them), expensive store brands - nothing. Cold spoons, tea bags. I was screwed then I found this and bought it based on the reviews. I was expecting it to do nothing...I was wrong, the results were almost immediate. I received this Saturday and used it that night woke up Sunday looking more refreshed then I had in years. I figured it was fluke; It&#x27;s been 4 nights and I&#x27;ve had little sleep. The puffiness has been dramatically reduced and my under eye area looks \\&quot;awake\\&quot; and completely different. This has restored my looks and my confidence. I feel so much better about myself. I&#x27;m hooked. As long as they keep making this, I will keep using it. I pray it&#x27;s never discontinued. Even if you&#x27;ve given up, try this. If it can work for me with puffiness due to an underlying condition,  it&#x27;s bound to work for you. Good luck ;)</li>
            <li> I got this for myself and my daughter neither of us have seen any results what so ever.</li>
            <li> Morning light has been well tolerated by my overly sensitive eye area. My final verdict is still out. I believe I see a difference in puffiness, but it seems to vary. I have noted my eye area is brighter, and it has made a difference in the below the eye area.</li>
            <li> I am a guy 50+ and have always had darkness under my eyes.  Now that I am getting a bit of puffiness I figured I would give this a go.  It has been only a little while, but I can tell that the puffiness and darkness is lessened.  I recently traveled for a few days forgetting to pack the cream and could tell a difference without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good job.</li>
            <li> Best eye cream I have ever tried! Works instantly to reduce puffiness. Most eye creams either too greasy or they just don&#x27;t work. Great product and awesome company that cares about their customers!</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help reduce the puffiness and black and blue under my eyes. I have used all the super expensive products from Sephora and this one beats them all!</li>
            <li> I try new eye creams that promise depuffing miracles,  but this one so far is a dud.  It pills my concealer so this will not be purchased again.  And no depuffing.</li>
            <li> I can say the first treatment help to reduce my puffiness about 25%, so i will continue the second order for some more weeks to see what is next. I believe it may help more to reduce my puffiness and the dark area under my eyes. Besides i always massage my puffiness area about 10 to 15 minutes everytimes before i apply the Gel so i don&#x27;t know that way also help or not. Thank you for your product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any change to the dark circles under the eyes.  I would have expected something more dramatic by now - unfortunately I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes to the darkness after a month of use.</li>
            <li> It helps a little, but not much. Will not reorder as I expected to see  a lot more results.. Will try something else.</li>
            <li> I am using my second bottle of this serum and it is by far the best I have found for puffiness under my eyes. It also works well with my concealer and foundation......no clumping or weird interaction of products.  I would recommend it for anyone with this problem.</li>
            <li> I have had only used this product for a few days - I gave it 5 stars because so far I am happy with it!! I have noticed that the dark circles are not as dark - the puffiness though - I am being affected by allergies and thyroid problems - so that is going to require adequate rest.. so far though I will definitely be rebuying once it runs out!</li>
            <li> As male in my mid-twenties, I was initially skeptical about this product. After using Morning Light for a little over a week, however, I could not be happier with the results. I first used the gel the night before waking up at 5:30 AM to watch the USA v. Russia hockey game, and for the first time in my life my eyes looked more awake than my body felt. The gel is easy to apply, relatively odorless, and has become an essential part of my morning routine. This is a great, affordable product, and I highly recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s looking to reduce the dark circles under their eyes.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of eye creams for bags, lines and dark circles. I tried this one because of the part of the add that said try this even if you have tried a lot of other eye creams.  I had and I did. I like it because it seems to hydrate and reduce bags and dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product for the same reason that I bought it.  I plan on trying other Morning Light products as well.</li>
            <li> This gel works wonders on puffiness, plus it does not irritate the eyes at all. I have another eye cream that was very expensive that works well on puffiness but the ingredients, though touted for sensitive eyes, is not. The other eye cream makes me cry. This one is a light gel with no oder. Works well on my bad bags. I do reapply it in the middle of the day. I will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> This product arrived very quickly and was exactly as advertised.  I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement in either my dark circles or bags under my eyes.  However, I have only used it for a couple of weeks.  The jury is still out on this one.  Would probably not buy it again.</li>
            <li> This rating is for the customer service and the product guarantee. Customer service has become a lost art in recent years, but at Morning Light Beauty it&#x27;s alive and well. I didn&#x27;t get the results most others seem to get from the product, but the return was fast and easy. I&#x27;d highly recommend trying the product as you&#x27;ve got nothing to lose.</li>
            <li> My initial response is this product is fantastic. I have always had dark purple circles under my eyes. After three days&#x27; use, the purple is gone. I usually reserve such comments for at least a month&#x27;s use. But this is really noticeable and I feel compelled to spread the word.</li>
            <li> I have used many eye gels, this is on par with the rest... many promises, but not so much results.  Used as directed for 2 months... didn&#x27;t notice a change.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this eye cream! Just a dab of this cream is all that is needed to soothe and hydrate the area around my eyes, and even smooth some of the fine lines caused by dryness and makeup products. The product is light, non-oily, and non-irritating.  I love to use it best after taking off my makeup after a long day at the office in front of a computer screen.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two months. It has shown no improvement to the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few days.....so I&#x27;m not sure.  I read all the previous reviews, so I&#x27;m hoping to see a change. I don&#x27;t have dark circles but I do have puffiness under my eyes.  My fingers are crossed...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product a few times and I can already see a difference.  I don&#x27;t wake up with puffy eyes anymore, and I love that it goes on smoothly and absorbs well, it does&#x27;t dry out the skin around your eyes like some other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Great product, hydrates and brightens skin overnight&lt;br /&gt;Have used this cream for 2 weeks, main issue for me is underye puffiness- which definitely has improved</li>
            <li> This product did not do anything for puffy eyes. :(&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry to report. Tried it a week and nothing.</li>
            <li> Eye cream has been the best I seen a difference in eyes in first week</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this eye cream, but unfortunately I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference, even after using it for a few months.  Also, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to only get a little bit - either nothing comes out or way too much, so a lot of it gets wasted.</li>
            <li> I purchased this eye cream after reading the reviews on this and several other products.  My main issue is puffiness.  I do not have dark circles which is what many eye creams address.  I was pretty excited to get this once ordered.  It came quickly as I am a Prime member and I started with it right away.  I used the gel twice a day.  I must admit I was not always consistent but not to far off.  The first thing I noticed was the pump action.  It was difficult to get it to pump and quite often it would squirt the product out so that it ended up all over rather than creaming it out.  This was a source of frustration throughout the time that I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product for several weeks and did not notice any difference in the puffiness around my eyes.  Based on that and the irritating pump action of the delivery system, I would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I think this product is great!  I suffer from allergies and this is the only product I have found that really works!  It is a noticeable difference and works well under makeup too.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of use, I can tell a difference in the skin around my eyes. &amp;#34;Laugh lines&amp;#34; are less noticeable and the skin is actually tightening.  The biggest plus is the virtual nonexistence of dark, puffy circles under my eyes in the morning!  I can confidently recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love the product. I definitely will order again. The discoloration under my eyes, and bags, have almost disappeared! Really good stuff.</li>
            <li> Use this product nightly, takes a few weeks to see any effects,  Would have preferred faster results.  Can&#x27;t recommend for purchase..</li>
            <li> This eye serum is wonderful.  It is very refreshing and only takes a small amount to do the job. Too soon to tell its effects as it&#x27;s only been a few days but it feels fantastic.  The serum has a much more soothing affect than lotion type products that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with the product Morning Light Beauty. I was very impressed that it worked on the puffiness the first time I used it. Most products take time to be effective. I found this product to be effective right away, that is why I ordered it again and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I had puffy eyes and dark circles under my eyes from the stress of house hunting and this product helped tremendously. It worked right away and I also like its light texture that I can wear it under my make up.</li>
            <li> If you have puffy eyes, especially in the morning, this is great stuff to put on in the morning. Sometimes I will put it on at night and notice a less strain on the eyes. I would recommend this for those who want to look their best as we age and not pay a lot for&lt;br /&gt;those expensive stuff people try to sell you on facebook for huge amounts of money and will do no better than this eye cream. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Not very impressed. I gave it a try to resorb puffiness under my eyes (after trying so many other products), and was disappointed. Plus, the pump releases a really big amount of product that you don&#x27;t need just to put around your eyes... If you want a good product working effectively on puffiness, try Elizabeth Arden eye treatment. Not expensive and definitely works better.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using the eye gel for several weeks now and both of us can tell differences in the area under our eyes.&lt;br /&gt;The thing that I love the most is the great value that this is. For the amount that is required to cover the under-eye area the selling price is exceedingly inexpensive for the results that are received.&lt;br /&gt;This should be a top buy.</li>
            <li> I have been teased about the dark circles around my eyes throughout my entire life. I am so glad my fiance&#x27; found this product before our wedding it is a God send. I have been using Morning Light everyday for almost three weeks and the dark circles around my eyes have almost faded entirely. The under eye puffiness has also been greatly reduced since I have been using this product. I am African American with brown skin and this product works perfectly on my skin complexion. Give Morning Light Cream a try I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like this product! The gel is clean, fresh and goes on easily! And it feels cool on delicate tissue. It does brighten the eyes, but doesn&#x27;t do as well for me with the puffiness. It might work better for others! I&#x27;ve been using it religiously for the past month, day and night and it does make my eyes look more awake! I don&#x27;t have dark circles, so I can&#x27;t comment on that being a problem for me. I do however have puffiness and eye bags, probably due to aging. This is a good product and it&#x27;s a nice routine I&#x27;ve gotten into! I recommend this if you want to have that wide awake look and don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money doing it!</li>
            <li> I am currently on my second bottle and it is going back. The first bottle worked great although the dispenser emitted too much of the product. Overall, I noticed a difference in both fine line and wrinkles as well as dark circles underneath my eyes, which have always been a trouble spot for me. Additionally, I found no extracurricular irritation around the corners of my eyes, which has occurred with some other eye care products in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the dispenser, I liked the results well enough to order a second bottle. Conversely, this second bottle emits a better and more useful portion of the product, but I have not seen the results that I did during the first bottle. My first thoughts were that maybe the manufacturer slightly altered the ingredients or changed the formula - not sure - but whatever I find myself using the serum 2 - 3 times a day without any noticeable reduction in fine lines, wrinkles, or dark circles. (I have never have any issues with puffiness so I can&#x27;t comment on that.) Disappointing result, but I am taking advantage of the money back guarantee and moving on.</li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle and saw little difference in my eye bags or crows feet.  I used it religiously, once in the morning and once at night.  I felt a tingling, warm sensation as I massaged it in, but I really didn&#x27;t see much of a difference on my face.  The customer service is wonderful, though!  I didn&#x27;t return the product, but I am confident that if I had decided to do so, it would not have been a problem.  There is a real live person at the other end of the email, who will answer your questions and provide you with additional information about the product. I would have rated this a 1 or 2 for the product results, but the wonderful customer service brought it up another star.</li>
            <li> I waited 5 weeks for write this review I bought two bottles, I have eye bags under my right eye this product did nothing for me, Kind of disappointed no any change on any way or manner,</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t re-order. Basically aloe in a bottle. If I would have seen the ingredients list before I ordered, I wouldn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> This is my first review ever! I had to take the opportunity to do so, after being disappointed so many times with most beauty purchases I&#x27;ve made throughout the years, from the highest rated to the priciest, I wanted to review it right away, I was so pleasantly surprised but like many other creams/gels I&#x27;ve used before the results don&#x27;t have a lasting result. I waited a bit.  I&#x27;ve had some time using Morning Light (not religiously, I must add) now and I have to say that even after the 1st use I saw a difference. Brightness &amp; firmness. I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and my lids have started to hood a bit  :( ... but this eye gel has lifted them up :)  Hope you guys have a great experience too!</li>
            <li> I received my Intensive Eye Gel this past Thursday (earlier than I had expected) and started using it before bed that evening and every night since.  I love it!  I was a little apprehensive as I have very sensitive skin around my eyes and often have an allergic reaction to gels/creams in that area.  I even had to get away from metal eyeglass frames and go back to plastic ones because of severe skin reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a difference by day two.  It is now Monday and I really am seeing an improvement, especially on my eyelids.  Their crepe-like appearance is DEFINITELY decreasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this rate of improvement, I am anticipating the possibility of wearing eye shadow again!  Yea!  I have not worn eye make-up for  years because of the way it accentuates my aging eyes.  I am even thinking of getting lighter colored eyeglass frames because I just may not want to hide my eyes any longer .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a wonderful product!&lt;br /&gt;Kathy (62 years old)</li>
            <li> Very impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an over-60 woman who purchased this product about three months ago due to dark circles under my eyes and I have been pleasantly surprised by the results. I noticed some lightening under the eyes in less than a week. With continued use, my eye area has become brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel is very easy to apply, and a little goes a long way. It is not greasy or oily. I apply it at night before I go to bed. Often when I wake in the morning, I notice that the skin is much smoother, almost flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside was the hard-to-open packaging. Otherwise, there were no side effects, such as irritation of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first eye product I have tried in many years (due to denial, I guess!) and I may experiment with some others. But I have to say that although this is no &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; product, my skin has definitely improved, and I strongly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I have used this product daily for a month or so.  Very rarely have I seen the slightest difference in the bags under my eyes, &amp; when I did see it, it didn&#x27;t last long.  It made no difference to the dark circles under my eyes.  It can be difficult to not pump out more product than you need.  Luckily, it does absorb quickly.  I will not buy it again, but did get my money back easily.</li>
            <li> I recommend this eye gel for bags under the eyes.  I can truly say it helped 100%.  I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> been using for a couple months , no difference at all</li>
            <li> I have had puffy eyes and dark circles for so long. I have tried everything for them , all the branded creams and gels and nothing have helped.  I bought this and believe it after three applications there was a difference . The dark circles were almost gone. people noticed the difference. I am on my second bottle and i recommend it highly to everyone.</li>
            <li> Not sure how to rate this but a month in I can say this: The pro&#x27;s- Very inexpensive versus most creams in this space. It did remove dark circles. It did reduce puffiness. Cons- Did little or nothing for laugh lines so far. I will continue to use and will update but overall, for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. Also, I&#x27;m not sure any cream will do what we really want it to do so you may as well keep the out of pocket down.</li>
            <li> So far I have seen results with this product, however it doesn&#x27;t deliver amazing results like some have claimed. It has made a difference in my under eye bags but only a small difference, and it seems to take awhile before I see those results. When first applied I see no difference but a few hours after application, I do see a difference in the bags under my eyes. I&#x27;m not sure if I will purchase this again I will continue to use it to see if there is any improvement with repeated use.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t.  I used it as directed on a daily basis until the cylinder had run its course and, frankly, I would have received the same results if I had been applying grape-flavored Kool Aid to my eyes for those months.  That is the one good thing I can mention about this product: the container does last quite a long time... hence the two-star review, rather than one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: the manufacturer offered full refund for my purchase, so I was pleased to see that they stand behind their product to that extent.</li>
            <li> If I put it on a night, I wake up with my eyes more puffy than ever. When I apply it in the mornings, it takes about an hour before the puffiness goes away. I got one for my daughter too. She can&#x27;t use it because it really burns her skin. I was so hoping this would work, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This product did nothing for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it more than enough time for it to &amp;#34;work it&#x27;s magic&amp;#34; but I actually did not see any chance in improvement for my under eyes.</li>
            <li> This is a really good product.  I haven&#x27;t used it for too long but it is hands-down better then a lot of the products I&#x27;ve tried over the years.  I will buy again.  The customer service is excellent and I would recommend.  A little goes a long way on this product too!</li>
            <li> This is the first eye gel I&#x27;ve used that helps make the dark circles under my eyes appear lighter.</li>
            <li> I bought this eye cream for the puffiness under my eyes. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work for me. The good news is that the Morning Light Beauty guarantees total customer satisfaction or your money back. I waited a while after I had gotten the cream so that I could really try it out and give them honest feedback. I sent them an email letting them know that it didn&#x27;t work for me and they refunded my money immediately! Just because it didn&#x27;t work for me, does not mean that it will not work for others (we all are made differently) and I would not hesitate to purchase any of their products because they stand behind them 100%.</li>
            <li> My friend asked me the other day if I was wearing new makeup.  My response, &amp;#34;no, actually i don&#x27;t have much on today.&amp;#34;  She asked me again today,  Then it hit me...it must be the Morning Light eye gel and the Morning Light Retinol Cream.  It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve added to my &amp;#34;beauty regimen&amp;#34;. I noticed that my skin looks more even and dewy (not oily).  So far so good...I really like these two products. :-D</li>
            <li> Using it daily for a month. I haven&#x27;t noticed a change in my under eye area.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t had the product long enough to know if it really works as the advertisement suggests.  My eye area appears to be lighter.</li>
            <li> After a week of use, I can say I like the product. I was hoping to replace the two products I was using with Intensive Eye Gel. I was using la therapie eye gel and sundari Chamomile Eye oil. I will definitely switch from la therapie eye cream, and even the la therapie eye gel. But even though the Intensive Eye Gel helps with the puffiness, and after more time I may be able to switch completely, not yet. I like the product enough to continue using for sure.</li>
            <li> So, I love the Intensive Eye Gel! I have used so many different kinds of eye creams, gels and even many high-end expensive brands with no great results. If I try a product and it only works &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;, I never buy it again. Well I&#x27;ve reordered your eye gel which means it&#x27;s working for me! Thank you for a great product! ~Cathy~</li>
            <li> Love this eye gel! I have had dark circles for a while now.... They are gone after using this gel. My eye area overall is much brighter as well.</li>
            <li> I have used it every night since I got it and can see some improvement in my eyes. I don&#x27;t get much sleep as I am in nursing school so this helps to hide my tired looking eyes.</li>
            <li> Definitely didn&#x27;t work for me, but the company was very nice and emailed me to follow up on its progress. I had just received it so I didn&#x27;t have an opinion yet, but months later still no change. Hopefully it will work for you, but it definitely didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> Used this and saw improvement on puffiness and dark circles.  I ran out, bought a similar but other brand that dried the skin under my eyes out and look tiredness cane back. So I just ordered my second bottle of this. I really like it.</li>
            <li> I used this product every morning for two weeks for my dark circles. I have very predominant dark circles and I was hoping this would help awaken my eyes and reduce puffiness ect. Unfortunately I felt like I wasted my money on this product. I would not recommend it. It also stung my eyes and I did not apply any more than a pea sized amount in the areas that needed treatment.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream, it makes my eyes feel awake and refreshed. It stings if it gets in your eye and the pump bottle is hard to gauge how much is going to come squirting out, but once you get used to it you compensate.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money does not work!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product mainly because I was tired of paying for high priced eye creams.  I&#x27;ve only used it for a little over a week but it seems to be doing a good job at reducing the appearance of under-eye puffiness. If you&#x27;re used to creams, it takes a few days to get used to not pumping out too much of the gel.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes this might reduce puffiness but it didn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s basically an aloe and Vitamin C gel, which is nice and probably good for your skin but it didn&#x27;t reduce the puffiness, i think it might have made it marginally worse.</li>
            <li> WOW, for the first time ever, I got an undereye cream/gel that does NOT send my eyes into a crying frenzy!!!  I bought this to use with my Timeless Hyaluronic Acid [bought amazon] that I am using with my moisturizer.  And as didn&#x27;t want to dry out my eyes and since all undereye stuff makes me cry figured I would try something that did not cost hundreds of $$$s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a heads up - have been using Timeless with my proactive+ and it is great!</li>
            <li> This product came in within good time. The owners are very helpful and even sent a follow up email to see how it was working. I didn&#x27;t want to give a review just 2 days in so I&#x27;ve been using it every night a few weeks now. I don&#x27;t have issues with my eyes really at all except from puffiness and dryness from tissues from when my dog died. Even so, I wanted something to better my skin or even for preventative care. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference at all, but I&#x27;m still going to use it in my nightly regime in case it&#x27;s doing something I&#x27;m just not seeing yet (until I find something I like more of course).</li>
            <li> Great little product. Got this from a friend as a gift and I was surprised to see it working after the first week! I&#x27;ve always had dark eye circles (probably from working night shifts) and this cream is slowly erasing them from my face. Will buy more when my gift runs out.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference at all after a month of use</li>
            <li> This is just a gel that does nothing to really help with puffy eyes.  I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks now and have seen no benefit at all.</li>
            <li> Feel comfortable wearing on skin.  But not working for eye bag.</li>
            <li> Does absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li> This is the first eye cream I have ever used and I really like it! I have oily skin, so I tend to avoid eye creams and gels, but Morning Light is not greasy at all. It takes so little and dries quickly. It leaves my eyes feeling alive and energized. I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of weeks, but can already see a difference. I use it in the morning before I put on my make-up and my make-up goes on very smoothly over it. It&#x27;s very lightweight feeling, no odor I can detect, and goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye cream for about 2 weeks now and I have seen huge changes.  Both my puffiness and dark circles have diminished significantly.  Even my friends have been commenting on how much better they look and wanting to try it themselves.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This gel is good.  Makeup won&#x27;t smudge like when applied on top of creams.  However, it&#x27;s hard to control the amount dispensed.  Often 2 times the amount wanted comes out; resulting in the cost is twice as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy again if the packaging was better; but not until then........</li>
            <li> So far it seems to do the job.  BUT………… the carrier they used (OnTrac)  was a disaster on a 2 day shipment and this happened 4 time with this carrier ….  Do not recommend this carrier nat all , so request  FED-X OR USPS OR UPS. BUT THE PRODUCT WAS A PLUS</li>
            <li> Have used daily as directed for almost 3 weeks with no noticeable difference. Puffiness is unaffected in the slightest. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Im not sure if this is working. I don&#x27;t see a difference, however, I do see redness at teh corners of my eyes!</li>
            <li> Great eye gel a little goes a long way! Very cooling and my undereye never looked better. I recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> I used this product continuously for 3 weeks, and did not see a difference.  I still have the same dark circles, and puffiness under my eyes.  I read so many good reviews about this product, but did not see results with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dark circles but I do have puffy eyes in the morning.  I keep mine in the refrigerator and when I use it in the morning I can feel it tightening and I know the ingredients are natural and contain vitamins and it seems to be working for me.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye cream. I&#x27;m.  Sure I will continue to keep using it.  It seems to be working pretty well. I have puffy eyes in the morning and I put it right on there and it works great! Love</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly.  It seems to help a little right away to relieve puffiness.  I will continue using to see if there is more improvement over time.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference when I use this product in the mornings.. its cooling and absorbs fast.. I highly recommend</li>
            <li> Still using it to see how well it will work for my bags under my eyes!  Seems to help with the dark circles also.  Need to give it some more time.</li>
            <li> What a difference!! I highly recommend Morning Light Beauty products!!!  I will continue to buy their products! Thank you Morning Light Beauty!</li>
            <li> I am a beauty product skeptic... probably because I have hundreds of dollars worth of useless ones languishing in my medicine cabinet... Lately, though, I&#x27;ve been afflicted with awful under eye puffiness and no amount of tea bags, cold spoons, or ice packs was doing the trick, so I gave this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product two days ago and started using it right away. I love how light it goes on- no heavy, oily feeling- so I can wear it under my makeup during the day. After one day of using it morning and night, I thought I saw some improvement under my eyes- the bags were a little smaller. But today, I can REALLY tell. My eyes haven&#x27;t looked this refreshed in months! This early in my usage, I can&#x27;t report any changes to my under eye wrinkles, and I don&#x27;t have a problem with darkness, but the puffiness relief is wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product, especially at the price. Thank you, Morning Light!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t very happy with the results at all .i have tried it for a few weeks I will  not buy it again .</li>
            <li> Like the review I gave their Retinol cream. Wonderful product from a very helpful company.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed my dark circles are less severe and I only used it for approximately a month or less.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it !</li>
            <li> Well I loved the Retinol cream but the eye cream wasn&#x27;t as great for me.  It did help with the puffiness but I saw very little if almost no change with my dark circles.  Sorry.</li>
            <li> Although I felt cheated after purchasing this product, Amazon did something amazing! After writing a review I could not believe they actually contacted me to inform me that they would refund my money, as they wanted me to be completely satisfied.  I was suprised as I did not expect to receive a refund, especially since I did not request one. Although, I did not receive the outcome I expected from my purchase, I was completely satisfied with the way Amazon handled the situation. I will remain a customer always, thanks again Amazon!</li>
            <li> I ordered this eye cream because I had dark circles and in less than a week, I noticed the dark circles were disappearing.  I would recommend this eye cream with five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item is worth it.</li>
            <li> it is really good, i can notice a difference after two weeks, just a small dab on finger is just enough, not to oily.</li>
            <li> advertised as &amp;#34;best eye cream&amp;#34; but it is not a cream, has no creamy qualities.  It is a gel that dries but I still felt that I needed a moisturizer after I put it around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I find that this product works - it is not a miracle product (what is?) but it crtainly is lightweight and works well under the eys minimizing dark circles and puffiness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been over a month and I&#x27;ve used the product once a day.  I have noticed how it keeps moisture around the eye and overall my eyes do look brighter.  I had used another product by Origins and will replace it with this.  Only thing I don&#x27;t like is the dispenser.  It releases to much product.  I&#x27;ve managed to control the amount I want to use.  That&#x27;s another great thing with this product, after using it for some time I don&#x27;t need to dispense as much.</li>
            <li> My original expectations were not high, but I was surprised.  Nothing OTC would do much of anything.  Thanks to you, I feel like I might be looking my age of 69.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working.  I&#x27;ve been using the eye cream for the last two weeks and feel that it&#x27;s making a difference with the puffiness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Morning Light Intensive Eye Gel for a few months now. I love it and especially like how it flattens and tones the skin under my eyes. It seems to also brighten the area under the eyes making puffiness and dark circles go away. I also noticed some reduction in fine lines. The pump on this container however does release quite a bit of gel. More than enough for both eyes. I used any excess on my neck. I think this eye gel works fairly well because it has vitamin C, cucumber extract, aloe and green tea extract in it. I did not experience any redness or irritation with this product as I did not put it that close to my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
            <li> The product works better than any other one I’ve tried.  I will probably reorder this one since the others did not help as much! Turning 50 has been hard.  I do not think there is a product that will totally take down my eye puffiness.  But this one is definitely been the most effective!</li>
            <li> Liked the feel of the cream and it seemed to help in a short period of time</li>
            <li> After two weeks of use, I can happily say that I am very pleased with the results! I&#x27;ve been trying a lot of different products for my under eye circles and this has been the only product that I&#x27;ve actually seen improvement. I am looking forward to continued use and even better results.</li>
            <li> I just stare to use this product and I really like it...</li>
            <li> I was pretty cynical but after a recent sinus infection that just increased the eye puffiness, I tried this.  In my case, the puffiness almost disappeared after four weeks.  I looked better and when you don&#x27;t feel good, at least you can look good or better than you feel.  I&#x27;m reordering this product.  I&#x27;m almost 65 years old and no money for plastic surgery or botox.  This is a great discovery for me.</li>
            <li> It seemed to help with the wrinkles more than dark circles</li>
            <li> after using this product for a while, i saw no visible difference</li>
            <li> This eye cream is awesome!  I am a CPA and during tax season it really helped my eyes look alert and awake, which is a huge accomplishment.  It also helped with my ever present wrinkles, which I was ok with saying goodbye to.</li>
            <li> This product made absolutely no difference.  I had better results with other products, some of which were cheaper than this.    (Reviewed by \\&quot;The Wife\\&quot;)    UPDATE:  I was contacted by the company and they refunded every penny.  So, I respect them standing behind their guarantee.  It may be worth trying this product, if they are still offering the guarantee.  It didn&#x27;t work for me, but it may work for other skin types.</li>
