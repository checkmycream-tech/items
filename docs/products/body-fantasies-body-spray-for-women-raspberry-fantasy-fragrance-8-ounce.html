            <li>and I love this one better because it smells more rich and does not have the alcohol smell</li>
            <li>This was a good price, but just too much for my nose.</li>
            <li>I had to throw it away as it smelled so strong and like a dollar store perfume knock off.</li>
            <li>I have used this fragrance for years, since it first came on the market, and it is my most favorite fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Raspberry Fantasy Spray is great, I actually use it to spray around my apartment to help with cooking odors from my neighbors apartment!</li>
            <li>The product is excellent as usual.</li>
            <li>smell very rich, fruity aroma that is incredible last long in the body, it is refreshing after a shower, I recomend</li>

            <li>My friend loves Raspberry scent and I looked in many stores to find Raspberry scent with no success.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This body spray has a rich and soft scent, but not really smell like raspberry.</li>
            <li>could only ever rarely find the super tiny bottles in the stores, decided I like it enough to get the big bottle!</li>
            <li>, it is at times hard to find in stores, so I was glad it was here on amazon.</li>
            <li>Only when I had this perfume as a 10 year old it was called &amp;#34;Sun-Kissed Raspberry&amp;#34;</li>

    <ol>
            <li> very happy with purchase</li>
            <li> I love this scent I have some really expensive perfume and this is the Raspberry Body is the one I get the most compliments on :) I couldn&#x27;t find it in store any more so I special ordered it on the internet</li>
            <li> This is a nice body spray. It arrived in 2 days. The scent of Raspberry is not what I was expecting because I had bought this product before at a local store. The scent does not last long but I still LIKE it.</li>
            <li> in no way does this smell like rasberries. I had to throw it away as it smelled so strong and like a dollar store perfume knock off. Not fruity at all! So disappointed :(</li>
            <li> I like the smell of cotton candy and there is a lot of spray in there. you do get your moneys worth. i like most of all the body fantasies but this one lasted me a couple months.</li>
            <li> very nice!!!! received in time</li>
            <li> The product is excellent as usual. I have been ordering it for many years.</li>
            <li> Raspberry Fantasy Spray is great, I actually use it to spray around my apartment to help with cooking odors from my neighbors apartment!</li>
            <li> I developed a skin rash :-((( Not recommended</li>
            <li> I am very pleased!! My friend loves Raspberry scent and I looked in many stores to find Raspberry scent with no success. I bought this for her at amazon.com for her birthday and she just loves it!! The scent is just like Raspberries as she wanted.</li>
            <li> Definitely one of my favorite scents from Body Fantasies, mmmmmmmmm.&lt;br /&gt;I could only ever rarely find the super tiny bottles in the stores, decided I like it enough to get the big bottle!</li>
            <li> I have always s loved this fragrance, it is at times hard to find in stores, so I was glad it was here on amazon. I tried the same scent from bath and body works and I love this one better because it smells more rich and does not have the alcohol smell, you really smell the raspberry&#x27;s. The price is great I think I may even order another one. The smell lasts a long time and remains in your clothing as well.</li>
            <li> my favorite body spray i love the way it smell so fresh great body spray fragrance for the summer nice</li>
            <li> I have used this fragrance for years, since it first came on the market, and it is my most favorite fragrance.  Sometimes you can&#x27;t find it in the stores, it&#x27;s either the most popular, or stores want to carry the newest scents in the Body Fantasy brand.  I hope that this seller will continue to carry Raspberry Fantasy.  I know where I can find it now, and do not have to drive all over town looking for it.  Please keep it in your stock for Amazon.</li>
            <li> This smells delicious, just like raspberries as I had hoped it would. I would highly recommend this product. I will be ordering more of this body spray. The price is right also.</li>
            <li> I thought i ordered cotton candy,not raspberry.I know i ordered cotton candy because it was what i ordered before.So i guess i&#x27;ll have to keep it.</li>
            <li> Just as I remember from my childhood! Only when I had this perfume as a 10 year old it was called &amp;#34;Sun-Kissed Raspberry&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this body splash. It is just extremely hard to find.</li>
            <li> love this spray - smells so good!</li>
            <li> The Raspberry was aweful!  It smelled like perfume my grandmother may have used - a nasty mix of dead flowers and alcohol.  I threw it away.  :(  I do really like the Cotton Candy one by the same company so I hope it was just a bad batch!</li>
            <li> This body spray has a rich and soft scent, but not really smell like raspberry. I recommend the cotton candy scent.</li>
            <li> smell very rich, fruity aroma that is incredible last long in the body, it is refreshing after a shower, I recomend</li>
            <li> Vendedor responsable, ademas de que el producto llego a la fecha indicada era lo que buscaba, buena fragancia, buen atomizador facil de aplicar. gracias</li>
            <li> I give it 3 stars as it did smell almost like raspberry, but it was too overwhelmimg. The pump started to wear out before the product was gone. I&#x27;ve used other Body Fantasies Body Sprays before and enjoyed them. This was a good price, but just too much for my nose.</li>
            <li> Great gift! Love that i can find it here when nowhere else sells it. (:</li>
            <li> Product was not the same as previously purchased at CVS.  Fragrance is completely different.  Not your fault but will not purchase again.</li>
