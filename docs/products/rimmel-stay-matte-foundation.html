            <li>One of the best drugstore beauty products.</li>
            <li>Awesome stuff</li>
            <li>I covers any imperfections just beautifully!</li>
            <li>That being said, I was initially very impressed with this foundation!  </li>
            <li>it makes your face look great! ...</li>
            <li>I am so impressed with this foundation</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the color selection.</li>
            <li>I have begun to stockpile it, it is that good!</li>
            <li>I was very pleased!</li>
            <li>The coverage is great..</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t believe how great it is.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li>I love this foundation!</li>
            <li>First , the color was perfect for my skin,, it was so matching,</li>
            <li>I apply it with my fingers, don&#x27;t use a primer at all, and it holds up through my morning workout amazingly well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of mousse-y or like cake icing.</li>
            <li>And, I don&#x27;t have to use a lot of product to make my skin look nice.  </li>
            <li>Recommendations are welcome ;)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so light on my face and the coverage is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t look orange! :)</li>
            <li>and I think that my skin looks more oily as the day goes on than when I wear a thinner foundation</li>
            <li>LOVE this foundation.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a love it or hat</li>
            <li>within a minute it turns to a powdery texture that feels so light!</li>
            <li>thats ok..</li>
            <li>So I decided to forgo primer altogether and was even more dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite foundation for my oily, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>Bought again and im in love with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You see, I normally wear airbrush foundation that goes on quickly, even, and perfectly matches my skin.  </li>
            <li>it applies very easily and smoothly...</li>
            <li>Both times that I wore it, I was impressed at how matte the foundation actually was, how weightless it felt (and remember, I&#x27;m used to super lightweight airbrush foundation!), and how well it stuck to my skin all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>True to color and blends very easily.</li>
            <li>but, really, I think that is a good problem to have.  </li>
            <li>But it rubs off WAY too easily.  </li>
            <li>I love the full coverage I get also.</li>
            <li>It creates a smooth, matte finish and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Rimmel Stay Matte liquid Mousse Foundation from influenster for sampling and testing purposes all for free.</li>
            <li>My most recent favorite was by Boots but either through my own ineptitude in application or a change in formula every time I applied it before foundation</li>
            <li>Ivory was too light for me</li>
            <li>when i opened the tube , it has a nice light scent , it is non greasy , very soft, I applied a little to my face , and it was awesome,,,</li>
            <li>The next week I decided to give this another try using my beauty blender sponge and amazing results!</li>
            <li>It covered two small pimples that I had perfectly.</li>
            <li>Stay Matte Foundation is simply amazing because I don&#x27;t have to do that second step any more.  </li>
            <li>I ve received full sized tube</li>
            <li>I have naturally tan skin and was sure that the color provided would be too light.  </li>
            <li>It offered great coverage,, although it faded after few hours</li>
            <li>It has great coverage, doesn&#x27;t look or feel heavy, and stays matte.</li>
            <li>and when I come home at 6:30 that night, it still looks just as fresh as it did when I applied it that morning.</li>
            <li>No oil or shine comes thru, just a fresh matte look.</li>
            <li>Although I loved the ease of applying the makeup (it spreads on so smoothly), it looked thick and cakey.</li>
            <li>Anyway, When I first tried this product, I put the primer on first</li>
            <li>I did this for maybe the first week.</li>
            <li>, I guess it is really unbeatable,, and I recommend using it for ladies who got oily skin !</li>
            <li>I have slightly oily skin, nothing over the top, but I live in Texas and the heat and humidity always gives me that lovely &amp;#34;shine</li>
            <li>The first day I put WAY too much on, less is more with this!</li>
            <li>I love the way my face looks when I wear this foundation because it looks natural, not heavy, and it stays in place.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised other reviewers said this foundation is good for oily skin.</li>
            <li>It can be a little flaky if you don&#x27;t exfoliate and moisturizer well before wearing, but otherwise I love it!</li>
            <li>As nice as the coverage is at first, unfortunately I&#x27;m going to have to switch to something else that stays on a bit better.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a problem applying with my fingers, but you should definitely pay attention to fine lines or creases and your jawbone/neckline area.</li>
            <li>and I had to train myself to not use so much as I&#x27;m so used to others that I have to layer on to cover up my rosacea cheeks.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and prone to break outs.</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin which is why I was looking forward to the &amp;#</li>
            <li>I also felt that it emphasized my pores and took a while to really blend in without looking streaky.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I felt like the coverage was even, it was not as streaky, and my pores did not stand out as much.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not the best foundation I&#x27;ve used but not the worse.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Mary Kay for 7 years and have really high expectations...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice enough foundation, but the magical part is that it sops up the oil on your T-zone like mad, leaving you looking quite fresh throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Normally I have to use a lot of foundation to cover my skin discolorations, then I have to put powder over that</li>
            <li>Since tis is used to be matte, you have to watch out for it being caked on, really spread it out and thin for a nice coverage.</li>
            <li>While my current tube was free for review, I would definitely buy this foundation for myself...</li>
            <li>Later in the day, the makeup looked very greasy and shiny.</li>
            <li>I used this with a non-oily primer underneath, and it really did give me a \\&quot;flawless\\&quot; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice product at a budget -- definitely shop around.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, prone to some acne because I have oily skin.</li>
            <li>Blending is also vital.</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t love how thick this feels on</li>
            <li>This makeup is very light, not cakey or thick, covers blemishes VERY well and a tiny dab goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li>When wearing this foundation, I&#x27;ve had several people tell me my skin looks clear and natural.</li>
            <li>I have extremely oily skin and have been using primers since they first came on the scene.</li>
            <li>This foundation definitely covers ALL flaws and gives skin a natural looking and luxurious finish.</li>
            <li>but this stuff seems to be barely sitting on my face waiting to fall off at any given opportunity.  </li>
            <li>I usually sweat it right off.  </li>
            <li>Considering how little you actually have to use each day, I think that it is really a fantastic value for the price (which is only $5 at Ulta and several other stores).</li>

            <li> As others have mentioned, a little bit goes a long way and you really need to take the time to blend well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m anxious to see how well this foundation sticks in the summertime when I am REALLY sweating.  </li>
            <li> so I order soft beige and it was a bit too dark.</li>
            <li> I usually use Revlon Photoready and much prefer that over this product.</li>
            <li> - it stays matte, meaning flat and without shine.  </li>
            <li> If your skin tends to be dry, this is definitely not a product for you.</li>
            <li> If your skin tends to be oily, leaving your makeup a mess by the middle of the day, Stay Matte Liquid Mousse Foundation is one definitely to try next time you hit the discount stores.</li>
            <li> I decided to try it anyway to see the other aspects of the foundation and was surprised again when I actually put the foundation on and it was too dark for my skin!  </li>
            <li> This bottle will last me for a long time unlike other products.</li>
            <li> it left no oily shiny patches on my chin or T zone ,, and it didn&#x27;t cause any problems in the other days like acne or so,,,&lt;br /&gt;now</li>
            <li> , my sister has dry skin , she tried to use it once ,, but it made her face flaky and extremely dry,, like every other single foundation she uses,,&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> This time I actually decided not to use primer, and I put on significantly less of the foundation -</li>
            <li> I used an amount less than the size of an eraser for my entire face &amp; blending into my neck.  </li>
            <li> Its super thick hard to apply</li>
            <li> everything I expected</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick, heavy coverage and at first feels kinda heavy and yucky on the skin but</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> After that week I was frustrated and went back to my old foundation.</li>
            <li> In fact, I was kind of frustrated at how difficult it was to get off...</li>
            <li> I would be one said woman if they removed this product from the market, which is usually what happens when I find something I like.</li>
            <li> The foundation is too thick and cakey for my taste.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the Soft Beige color of Rimmel Stay Matte Foundation.  </li>
            <li> It is VERY very thick for a &amp;#34;liquid&amp;#34; type of foundation.</li>
            <li> I do add a thin layer of powder over it after this liquid foundation has set .</li>
            <li> Not good!</li>
            <li> It looked a little bit cakey which was annoying</li>
    </ol>

            <li> One of the best drugstore beauty products. True to color and blends very easily.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;m wearing makeup it&#x27;s so light on my face and the coverage is AMAZING. A little goes a long way and I had to train myself to not use so much as I&#x27;m so used to others that I have to layer on to cover up my rosacea cheeks. Awesome stuff and I don&#x27;t look orange! :)</li>
            <li> I bought shade 100,  which is ivory.  This foundation definitely covers ALL flaws and gives skin a natural looking and luxurious finish. However, I don&#x27;t love how thick this feels on and I think that my skin looks more oily as the day goes on than when I wear a thinner foundation</li>
            <li> LOVE this foundation. It creates a smooth, matte finish and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Its super thick hard to apply</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!! I have very oily skin and prone to break outs. I also work 12 hour shifts 5 days a week. I apply this at 5:00 in the morning and when I come home at 6:30 that night, it still looks just as fresh as it did when I applied it that morning. No oil or shine comes thru, just a fresh matte look. I love the full coverage I get also. I covers any imperfections just beautifully!</li>
            <li> I use the Rimmel Stay Matte face primer, so I thought I would purchase this to see how they paired up together since I&#x27;m a fan of the primer. I have slightly oily skin, nothing over the top, but I live in Texas and the heat and humidity always gives me that lovely &amp;#34;shine factor&amp;#34; bleh. Anyway, When I first tried this product, I put the primer on first and then I put this on with a foundation brush. I did this for maybe the first week. The first day I put WAY too much on, less is more with this! Using the foundation brush wasn&#x27;t working too well for me. It looked a little bit cakey which was annoying and it didn&#x27;t blend well with my skin using the brush. After that week I was frustrated and went back to my old foundation. The next week I decided to give this another try using my beauty blender sponge and amazing results! You could tell I was wearing make up, obviously, but it was not cakey or overly done. It covered two small pimples that I had perfectly. I was very pleased! The trick to remember with this is blend it well and use sparingly! It is VERY very thick for a &amp;#34;liquid&amp;#34; type of foundation. It&#x27;s kind of mousse-y or like cake icing. Since tis is used to be matte, you have to watch out for it being caked on, really spread it out and thin for a nice coverage. This is definitely a love it or hat it product.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer..I&#x27;ve used Mary Kay for 7 years and have really high expectations...That being said, I was initially very impressed with this foundation!  The coverage is great..it applies very easily and smoothly...it makes your face look great! ...But it rubs off WAY too easily.  Hugged my boyfriend and pulled away to see foundation all over his white shirt.  If I touch my face at all there is foundation all over my hands.  If I have to blow my nose or wipe my mouth foundation is everywhere on the napkin.  I have really oily skin which is why I was looking forward to the &amp;#34;stay matte&amp;#34;...but this stuff seems to be barely sitting on my face waiting to fall off at any given opportunity.  As nice as the coverage is at first, unfortunately I&#x27;m going to have to switch to something else that stays on a bit better.  Recommendations are welcome ;)</li>
            <li> I love this foundation! It&#x27;s a thick, heavy coverage and at first feels kinda heavy and yucky on the skin but within a minute it turns to a powdery texture that feels so light! the perks are not having to use a concealer on those days or nights out, or any setting powder for us oily gals b/c this foundation gots us covered!</li>
            <li> I cannot believe that I found a foundation that covers so well, I don&#x27;t even have to use a powder overtop of it.  Normally I have to use a lot of foundation to cover my skin discolorations, then I have to put powder over that so that my face doesn&#x27;t look shiny.  Rimmel London Stay Matte Foundation is simply amazing because I don&#x27;t have to do that second step any more.  And, I don&#x27;t have to use a lot of product to make my skin look nice.  I am so impressed with this foundation, I&#x27;ve been telling everyone about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is on the oily side, and in the summer.....ugh!  I usually sweat it right off.  But the Stay Matte foundation does just what they say it does - it stays matte, meaning flat and without shine.  I love the way my face looks when I wear this foundation because it looks natural, not heavy, and it stays in place.  I would be one said woman if they removed this product from the market, which is usually what happens when I find something I like.</li>
            <li> I ve received full sized tube Rimmel Stay Matte liquid Mousse Foundation from influenster for sampling and testing purposes all for free. First , the color was perfect for my skin,, it was so matching, when i opened the tube , it has a nice light scent , it is non greasy , very soft, I applied a little to my face , and it was awesome,,, It offered great coverage,, although it faded after few hours and i had to reapply , but thats ok.. it left no oily shiny patches on my chin or T zone ,, and it didn&#x27;t cause any problems in the other days like acne or so,,,&lt;br /&gt;now , my sister has dry skin , she tried to use it once ,, but it made her face flaky and extremely dry,, like every other single foundation she uses,,&lt;br /&gt;For the price and the value, I guess it is really unbeatable,, and I recommend using it for ladies who got oily skin !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised other reviewers said this foundation is good for oily skin. Although I loved the ease of applying the makeup (it spreads on so smoothly), it looked thick and cakey. Later in the day, the makeup looked very greasy and shiny. Not good!</li>
            <li> everything I expected</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin and have been using primers since they first came on the scene. My most recent favorite was by Boots but either through my own ineptitude in application or a change in formula every time I applied it before foundation I was left with white flecks all over my face. So I decided to forgo primer altogether and was even more dissatisfied. I bought this on a whim and I can&#x27;t believe how great it is. I apply it with my fingers, don&#x27;t use a primer at all, and it holds up through my morning workout amazingly well. I have begun to stockpile it, it is that good!</li>
            <li> When I opened my Influenster﻿ UniVoxBox I was disappointed in the Soft Beige color of Rimmel Stay Matte Foundation.  I have naturally tan skin and was sure that the color provided would be too light.  I decided to try it anyway to see the other aspects of the foundation and was surprised again when I actually put the foundation on and it was too dark for my skin!  The color in the tube definitely did not match the color on the outside of the tube.  I also felt that it emphasized my pores and took a while to really blend in without looking streaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see, I normally wear airbrush foundation that goes on quickly, even, and perfectly matches my skin.  Knowing that my issues with the Rimmel Stay Matte Foundation could have been user error, I decided to give it another try.  This time I actually decided not to use primer, and I put on significantly less of the foundation - I used an amount less than the size of an eraser for my entire face &amp; blending into my neck.  I felt like the coverage was even, it was not as streaky, and my pores did not stand out as much.  Both times that I wore it, I was impressed at how matte the foundation actually was, how weightless it felt (and remember, I&#x27;m used to super lightweight airbrush foundation!), and how well it stuck to my skin all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have three kids ages 5, 3, &amp; 1 so I am constantly running around after them, and this foundation did not smear or run even when I was sweating.  In fact, I was kind of frustrated at how difficult it was to get off...but, really, I think that is a good problem to have.  I don&#x27;t want the hassle of having to carry around foundation to do touch-ups during the day (nor do I want to take the time to do them).  I&#x27;m anxious to see how well this foundation sticks in the summertime when I am REALLY sweating.  While my current tube was free for review, I would definitely buy this foundation for myself...but I would probably try it on before buying it instead of relying on the outside of the packaging to determine color.  Considering how little you actually have to use each day, I think that it is really a fantastic value for the price (which is only $5 at Ulta and several other stores).</li>
            <li> No problem with packaging or shipping. The foundation is too thick and cakey for my taste.</li>
            <li> If your skin tends to be oily, leaving your makeup a mess by the middle of the day, Stay Matte Liquid Mousse Foundation is one definitely to try next time you hit the discount stores. It&#x27;s a nice enough foundation, but the magical part is that it sops up the oil on your T-zone like mad, leaving you looking quite fresh throughout the day. If your skin tends to be dry, this is definitely not a product for you. I used this with a non-oily primer underneath, and it really did give me a \\&quot;flawless\\&quot; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice product at a budget -- definitely shop around.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, prone to some acne because I have oily skin. This makeup is very light, not cakey or thick, covers blemishes VERY well and a tiny dab goes a LONG way. This bottle will last me for a long time unlike other products. I do add a thin layer of powder over it after this liquid foundation has set . I think the only improvement they could make would be to add SPF to the product.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite foundation for my oily, acne-prone skin. It has great coverage, doesn&#x27;t look or feel heavy, and stays matte. When wearing this foundation, I&#x27;ve had several people tell me my skin looks clear and natural. It can be a little flaky if you don&#x27;t exfoliate and moisturizer well before wearing, but otherwise I love it!</li>
            <li> Perfect,decent price.  Bought again and im in love with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not the best foundation I&#x27;ve used but not the worse. I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the color selection. Ivory was too light for me so I order soft beige and it was a bit too dark. Blending is also vital. As others have mentioned, a little bit goes a long way and you really need to take the time to blend well. I haven&#x27;t had a problem applying with my fingers, but you should definitely pay attention to fine lines or creases and your jawbone/neckline area. This does seem to keep my face from getting as oily as it has been, but not substantially so that I will be purchasing this again. I usually use Revlon Photoready and much prefer that over this product.</li>
