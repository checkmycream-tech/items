            <li>The Bellizima Rose brush is clearly high quality.  </li>

            <li>but I like the feel of this flat top</li>
            <li>Also the flat top shape gives you even coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is delicate, soft and elegant just like a rose, yet so sturdy.  </li>

            <li>I got this flat top makeup brush as a gift for my wife and she told me she is amazed at how soft the bristles are.</li>
            <li>This denser flat top bristles offers you</li>
            <li>With my other brush I have to beat the top of it off before I apply because it just doesn&#x27;t grab the powder evenly.</li>

            <li>I always have trouble holding some of the other brands brushes, but this one is great.  </li>

            <li>the bristles are soft on my skin</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it will last for a long long time.</li>
            <li>The brush is soft, but when I tried to take it out of the package the brush came off of the handle.</li>
            <li>It is much nicer than some much more expensive brushes that I&#x27;ve seen</li>
            <li>It is firmly bunched unlike the other one my wife is using that is more like a pom pom, large in area but loose.  </li>

            <li>It puts powder down really evenly and gives you complete control over distribution.</li>

            <li> Works well for loose powder and blush.  </li>

            <li> Usually I go for the cheaper brushes but they always end up leaving scratches on my face or getting really dirty.</li>
            <li> and I was highly skeptical.</li>

            <li> So I got this brush as a gift and I was highly skeptical. I have been using the MaryKay mineral powder foundation brush for so long that I didn&#x27;t think any other could compare. This brush is much softer than my other brush I mean 100 times softer. It also grabs onto the powder better. With my other brush I have to beat the top of it off before I apply because it just doesn&#x27;t grab the powder evenly. I have found I do not need to do that with this brush. Great quality brush, wish the company made a line of commonly used brushes! I would highly recommend this brush to others for use with mineral powder foundation or loose powder application.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing! I have been using it for over a week now and it has officially replaced my other powder brushes. I use it for mineral powder. It gives great coverage and helps to blend the powder really well. And it’s super soft on the face. After using this brush, my MAC brushes just feel coarse on my skin. I haven’t dealt with any of the bristles falling out, which I’ve dealt with on other brushes. The brush feels like it’s made of good quality material and performs the same way too. I’m very happy with this brush. Money well spent.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful make-up brush for powdered concealer or blush. It is different than what I&#x27;m used to since it a flat top (I have been using a rounded brush) but I like the feel of this flat top brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is super soft and easy to grip. The brush comes with a plastic case to keep the bristles in shape and even though many may throw that out, I&#x27;ve keep it so I can store the brush in it to keep its shape. It puts powder down really evenly and gives you complete control over distribution. It&#x27;s hard to believe that these are synthetic bristles but they are so tightly packed and soft, you would never know it. I usually wash my brushes a few times a year. I haven&#x27;t washed this yet but It seems like it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles haven&#x27;t shed yet and the handle seems solid. It is comfortable in my hand as well. I was provided a sample for testing and review.</li>
            <li> This is a very soft brush, that is very effective with pressed powder makeup. Very good price. A good value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I had the Amazon reviews to help me decide to buy this brush. I lost the flat top brush that came with my Pur Minerals and new brushes by Pur were getting bad reviews. This brush is soft - so soft- and gentle on my sensitive skin and holds mineral perfectly. No bristle loss, feels good in the hand, nice weight. Brava! A real 5 star product.</li>
            <li> I was having second thoughts about buying this brush because of the price but I am so happy that I did!!! It is money well spent. I know this brush will last a long time looking and feeling like new. I used to buy brushes that would start loosing the bristles and falling apart within months. This brush has  dense and such soft bristles that you will just love the way it feels on your skin. I absolutely love  how it applies my powder evenly, flawlessly and without fallout. It does great honor to its name. It is delicate, soft and elegant just like a rose, yet so sturdy.  I strongly recommend it for you or a friend.</li>
            <li> It is more like a kabuki brush but it&#x27;s amazing for applying mineral foundation, my skin looks airbrushed! the bristles are soft on my skin</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a great multi-use makeup brush, this one is perfect!  I used this bush to apply loose powder as well as blush.  Both were flawless.  The brush is dense enough to deposit great color without looking over done or cakey.  Very little shedding and it washes really well!! This is a great product for the price. I&#x27;m in LOVE!</li>
            <li> Got this brush as a gift and I&#x27;m loving it so far. At first I was concerned because it felt very soft but after using it with my mineral foundation I was impressed ! The brush didn&#x27;t hold onto my make up and it went on smooth. It didn&#x27;t leave behind an strays either which is very important to me. I would recommand this brush to everyone I know. (just FYI before this brush I only used MAC)</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed for my mineral makeup powder.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> This makeup brush is made of the finest quality synthetic sable bristles, hygienic and cruelty-free.  The long metal ferrule holds the bristles tightly and there is no shedding at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head is very dense and plush with just the right amount of springiness.  The fibers are very even and uniform and the tips are almost indescribably soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The short, rounded handle is solid and has a smooth finish with the Bellizima Rose logo on it and is very comfortable to hold and maneuver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A reusable sleeve is included to protect the bristles when carried in a bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is ideal for blending and buffing powdered makeup with professional results and I really can&#x27;t think of any way it could be improved.  It is a pleasure to use.  It is much nicer than some much more expensive brushes that I&#x27;ve seen and  there is really no comparison to cheap brushes that don&#x27;t do a good job even when they&#x27;re new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample was provided for testing and evaluation.</li>
            <li> I got this flat top makeup brush as a gift for my wife and she told me she is amazed at how soft the bristles are. She used it as soon as she got it in the mail and told me she just loves how it applies mineral powder to her face. She said that the brush doesn&#x27;t shed and does a wonderful job. I recommend this brush to anyone hands down whether you are buying it for yourself or as a gift for someone who will appreciate such a high quality product.</li>
            <li> This brush is incredible! The bristles are amazingly soft and apply my powder makeup smoothly and easily. Usually I go for the cheaper brushes but they always end up leaving scratches on my face or getting really dirty. However the Bellizima Rose brush is high quality and I&#x27;m sure it will last for a long long time. This brush is definitely worth the money and I recommend it as a gift or for personal use!</li>
            <li> I use this brush with my Two Faced Cosmetics Primed and Poreless which results in a smooth application.  Bristles are soft and perfect!</li>
            <li> I got this brush as a gift for my girlfriend.  She used it and said that the bristles were extremely soft and she loves how easily and smoothly it applied the powder to her face and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t shed bristles one bit.  This is a high quality brush, I recommend it to anyone out there. Its a great buy!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo12DOWXB4K4CAZ]]Just perfect for applying blush on.  The brush feels like culled from angel&#x27;s hair.  It is firmly bunched unlike the other one my wife is using that is more like a pom pom, large in area but loose.  This denser flat top bristles offers you more control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle has a comfortable grip. Just the right weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I received free to review on my blog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flat top mineral makeup brush is really soft! It is gentle on your face and will not scratch your face like some other brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also is very wide and is great for applying powder to your whole face. Also the flat top shape gives you even coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I  would really recommend this makeup brush to you. It is great for all your loose and mineral powder make up applications!</li>
            <li> Great addition to my makeup tray.  Comfortable to use and the perfect size.  Really great grip on the handle, too.  I always have trouble holding some of the other brands brushes, but this one is great.  Works well for loose powder and blush.  Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Not that it is the products fault, but the brush was too small for what I was looking for.The brush is soft, but when I tried to take it out of the package the brush came off of the handle. Wasn&#x27;t for me, I sent it back.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing.  The bristles are amazingly soft and makeup application goes on smooth and easy; bristles also don&#x27;t fall out. The Bellizima Rose brush is clearly high quality.  My foundation looks like it is airbrushed.  Works beautifully with liquid, cream and powder foundation.  I loved it so much I bought a brush for my mom and two friends.  I am waiting for their next brushes to be introduced.  This is a winner!</li>
