            <li>Great wood quality, great price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It kind of looks like a mans jewelry chest...</li>
            <li>Looks very nice; seals well; hygrometer provided is adjustable; fit 39 Churchills in here.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure he will love this preset!</li>
            <li>This is a great little humidor, don&#x27;t forget to season it really well!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>So far excellent cigar box I love it.</li>
            <li>the picture does this no justice it is beautiful large and elegant.</li>
            <li>Easy to set up and has a nice seal.</li>
            <li>The humidor is pretty good quality and can fit about 15-20 good sized cigars.</li>
            <li>Mounting it with brass screws was a cinch, and it made the box look even more stylish.</li>
            <li>He was most pleased...</li>
            <li>and if it wasn&#x27;t more work than the $15 I paid for this</li>
            <li>Save up some caps and buy a better model, I wish I&#x27;d done that.</li>
            <li>Maybe more comments to come when it has been in use for some time.</li>
            <li>lovely gift for anybody.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually better than the picture on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I find myself opening this one way too often, and a glass top would eliminate 90% of those openings.    </li>
            <li>You will not find a better humidor at this price.</li>
            <li>Ths humidor box would probably cost 5X more elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Now I have it sitting in the humidor on the bottom, which takes up even more space.</li>
            <li>You will not find a better humidor for this price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more on the 50 side though.  </li>
            <li>Please make sure to get another device to bring up the humidity in the humidor because the stock one doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li>It looks great, the Spanish cedar aroma is delightful, and most importantly, it is keeping my cigars fresh.    </li>
            <li>As of right now, its performance has been good.  </li>
            <li>It came with instructions on how to season it and make sure the sensor was accurate.</li>
            <li>Humidor can easily fit 30 or more cigars</li>
            <li>On the other hand, if you&#x27;re on a budget like most of us, but still enjoy a good cigar, or know someone that does, this humidor will make a very handsome gift, or a fine addition for your own pleasure.  </li>

            <li>This little humidor is very good for a nice price.</li>
            <li>I also store some pipe tobacco in it so it is always full!</li>
            <li>I found it easy to prepare</li>
            <li>These couldn&#x27;t be as good as the high priced cigar store &#x27;</li>
            <li>Even though the packaging was very good, there were some minor scratches on the lid.</li>
            <li>with a jar of humidity crystals holds humidity at perfect level with little fluctuation.</li>
            <li>The description says it can hold 25-50 cigars which is accurate.  </li>
            <li>The humidor is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This humidor not only looks classy and handsome on my desk, but it&#x27;s also excellent at what its supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a hygrometer (which I haven&#x27;t calibrated or anything, but seems to move in line with moisture additions) and one of those plastic things to put water on to maintain humidity (I use the 2-way packs and crystals as I find the plastic water things cheap and unreliable).   </li>
            <li>it is the cheap magnets they give you to attach the vent with.  </li>
            <li>I bought digital one that works great.  </li>
            <li>A definite bargain for a well-made humidor with a great finish.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic humidor.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Only problem is: It came with a humidity disc &amp; a meter, which is great, except there are no instructions whatsoever.</li>
            <li>so far the humidity levels have been good and still stabilizing.  </li>
            <li>model looks beautiful in my apartment, comes with its own humdifier (solution not included), and has enough storage space for the number of cigars a new smoker like me tends to store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very nice find, for the price especially.</li>
            <li>The box shipped arrived on my door 5 later and is very nice looking.</li>
            <li>Keep my cigars fresh!</li>
            <li>Nice size with good hinges and closes tightly.  </li>
            <li>will tell if I have further issues, but so far its an excellent purchase.</li>
            <li>but with such a great price if he never puts a cigar into it I still feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>The outside finish looks great and after a proper priming, it holds a good consistent humidity.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;ll probably last me a good while.</li>
            <li>I am happy for my first humidor, however it came with the top of the case a little scratched up despite all of it&#x27;s protection that it was mailed with.</li>
            <li>The humidifier seems sturdy, the box closes tightly, and the case is beautiful.    </li>
            <li>It was shipped quickly, and exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>I love the look of this humidor and it is the perfect size for a casual cigar smoker like myself.</li>
            <li>The inside has a nice tight air seal, with nice golden colored hinges.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this handsome, quality built humidor either for yourself, or as a gift for the tobacco user in your family.</li>
            <li>The box is very pretty.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know and evidently, they aren&#x27;t telling!</li>
            <li>First humidor I ever purchased for my husband, He loves it!  </li>
            <li>Knowing how cheap he is, I knew that he would never get a new one for himself, (nor would his family, for they are cheap too).  </li>
            <li>Great little humidor.</li>
            <li>my moneys worth.  </li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>I only smoke premiums, and only 1-2 a week, so I needed something that could keep my nice cigars nice while they wait for me.  </li>
            <li>The sensor was right on @70.</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry climate, and gel works great.    </li>
            <li>A glass top is worth the extra expense.  </li>
            <li>Great humidor for your low to mid range priced stogies.</li>
            <li>The inside is fully Spanish cedar lined, very important.</li>
            <li>If you, or your intended are a serious cigar smoker who is used to nothing but the best as far as cigars or tobacco is concerned, perhaps hiking up your budget a smidgen and</li>
            <li>If you, or your intended are a serious cigar smoker who is used to nothing but the best as far as cigars or tobacco is concerned, perhaps hiking up your budget a smidgen and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on a tight budget with my cigars, so I needed something quality but cheap enough not to break the bank, and this humidor worked great.  </li>
            <li>The directions specifically say that the hygrometer may or may not have a screw on the back which you can turn to adjust the hygrometer to the appropriate humidty level (mine did not have the screw).  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product as my first humidor.  </li>
            <li>I bought one for a favorite uncle of mine that smokes cigars, and was having one of those big turning 70 parties.  </li>
            <li>I drop about a tablespoon of water in the moistener about once a week, and my tobacco is always fresh and ready to burn.  </li>
            <li>Very solid construction, looks a lot better than in the photograph.  </li>
            <li>and it is just about seasoned now.</li>
            <li>First humidor</li>
            <li>Definitely holds more than 25.</li>
            <li>This is my first humidor.</li>
            <li>This is my first humidor, so don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.  </li>
            <li>It took me about a week to get this humidor properly seasoned.  </li>
            <li>The mahogany finish is thick and very nicely polished.</li>
            <li>But it still cannot keep humidity up to a decent level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good looking on the outside, but simply doesn&#x27;t function adequately for the purpose for which I bought it.</li>
            <li>fit and finish was great, holds plenty of cigars for the casual smoker, and it maintains a consistent humidity level.</li>
            <li>This is a very affordable humidor that works very well and smells cedar fresh inside.</li>
            <li>My uncle was thrilled with it, and even told me that I shouldn&#x27;t have spent so much on him.  </li>
            <li>The adhesive does not stick very well to the inside of the wood, so at first it kept falling off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen the same exact model selling for $70 at a fine smoke shop.</li>
            <li>I started out looking in cigar stores for a humidor but very quickly learned that it was definitely not the place to go if you don&#x27;t want begin at a $100 minimum.</li>
            <li>so I am absolutely certain that my process is correct.  </li>
            <li>It probably really holds around 35 normal (5x50 or bigger) cigars, with corona&#x27;s or smaller ones you could fit more.</li>
            <li>Solidly crafted, with a moisture gauge that is relatively accurate for being analogue.  </li>
            <li>Basically, it does what it is supposed to do at a really reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>For real?  </li>
            <li>and it has preserved them very well.  </li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to a newcomer to the cigar life or someone who wants a humidor to leave at a friends house or vacation place.</li>
            <li>It was fast shipping and reliable.  </li>
            <li>and it closes with a gentle whoosh.  </li>
            <li>Once my patience paid off, the humidor&#x27;s RH is very stable around 68-70%.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve calibrated a digital hygrometer by the book with a kit &amp; have 3 drymistat humidifier tubes, plus the cheap humidity panel that came with</li>
            <li>It holds many cigars, completely seals of outside air.</li>
            <li>I am surprised to see so many glowing reviews, so I must be the only one with issues holding</li>
            <li>I officially give up and will probably have to buy a better box or actively recharge this one to keep my humidity level up.  </li>
            <li>Says it fits up to 50 cigars, but I&#x27;ve got more than that in there right now, mostly smaller ones, but I&#x27;m guessing it would fit 50 churchills or probably 100 petite coronas at least.     </li>
            <li>The humidor is very large and is indeed lined with cedar which you can def smell when you first open it.  </li>
            <li>I prefer mild, small cigars, and the box could easily hold a 50 plus of those types if it needed to.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not a problem, however, because the most of the free hygrometers are poor quality anyway.</li>
            <li>Nice tight seal, lined with Spanish cedar, nice looking, unbelievable price.    </li>
            <li>Rarely do I see the humidity above 62-64%.</li>
            <li>I seasoned it easily over a few days and am able to store my modest collection of about 20 cigars in it without any trouble.  </li>
            <li>I have a nice humidor waiting for me back there when I return, but I needed a solution to keep my prized imports fresh in the mean time.</li>
            <li>As others have pointed out it has a tight seal, lined with Spanish cedar, kind of pretty looking, and a low price.  </li>
            <li>They also sent me a second box free of charge to try the same thing</li>
            <li>The finish is done well and looks very classy.    </li>
            <li>This very same one I happen to find at a local smoke shop, and paid more for it there than it is currently being offered at here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>First when I received the humidor, I couldn&#x27;t believe the finish on the outside.  </li>
            <li>It is much more expensive looking than it actually will cost you, and in my opinion will last you for just as many years as some of the cigar store high end models...</li>
            <li>It is much more expensive looking than it actually will cost you, and in my opinion will last you for just as many years as some of the cigar store high end models...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, you get more than what you pay for in this little red box.</li>
            <li>I assume the real smokers, the pros, can never have enough humidors to store their cigars in!</li>
            <li>There is no question that there are far more expensive and quality humidors to be had, here on Amazon and at many other places.  </li>
            <li>There is no question that there are far more expensive and quality humidors to be had, here on Amazon and at many other places.  </li>
            <li>Unless you are a true cigar snob, and/or have a huge collection, for the price, I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li>Tight seal, nice little hygrometer and humidifier.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with this one, but I found that it filled up too quickly for my preferences.    </li>
            <li>I like filling my leather pipe pouches with tobacco and keeping them ready to go, rather than storing loose tobacco in a tin, or pipe humidor.  </li>
            <li>I also keep various incense bricks in the box for they burn slower and sweeter when kept from completely drying</li>
            <li>The box is much nicer than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li>But after the seasoning process was complete it wasn&#x27;t noticeable enough to discourage me from putting my cigars in it.   </li>
            <li>comes with a divider, hygrometer and humidifier all of which i will probably replace in the near future.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept a shot glass full of water with the humidor and a small number of cigars because I couldn&#x27;t keep the humdity above 65%.  </li>
            <li>My cigars do not dry out like they used to.  </li>
            <li>I can not think of any problems with this box or why anyone would spend 2-3x the price for one that would serve generally the same quality in its function</li>
            <li>It is very rich and expensive looking, far beyond what it actually cost.  </li>

            <li> It comes with a humidifier and good instructions.  </li>
            <li> Good hinges</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this humidor for about 2 weeks now and thought it was a good time for a review.  </li>
            <li> The quality is great, easy to set up and everything!</li>
            <li> The hinges work well, and the exterior fit and finish is very good.</li>
            <li> Great product, even better price.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed too very pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> Very well made, smells good, and looks great!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> He loves it, and that&#x27;s what matters most!</li>
            <li> it is amazing.</li>
            <li> Not complaining too much because the box does an excellent job!</li>
            <li> The box itself is quite nice.  </li>
            <li> Great wood quality, great price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It kind of looks like a mans jewelry chest...</li>
            <li> Looks very nice; seals well; hygrometer provided is adjustable; fit 39 Churchills in here.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure he will love this preset!</li>
            <li> This is a great little humidor, don&#x27;t forget to season it really well!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> So far excellent cigar box I love it.</li>
            <li> the picture does this no justice it is beautiful large and elegant.</li>
            <li> Easy to set up and has a nice seal.</li>
            <li> The humidor is pretty good quality and can fit about 15-20 good sized cigars.</li>
            <li> Mounting it with brass screws was a cinch, and it made the box look even more stylish.</li>
            <li> He was most pleased...</li>
            <li> and if it wasn&#x27;t more work than the $15 I paid for this</li>
            <li> Save up some caps and buy a better model, I wish I&#x27;d done that.</li>
            <li> Maybe more comments to come when it has been in use for some time.</li>
            <li> lovely gift for anybody.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually better than the picture on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I find myself opening this one way too often, and a glass top would eliminate 90% of those openings.    </li>
            <li> You will not find a better humidor at this price.</li>
            <li> Ths humidor box would probably cost 5X more elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Now I have it sitting in the humidor on the bottom, which takes up even more space.</li>
            <li> You will not find a better humidor for this price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more on the 50 side though.  </li>
            <li> Please make sure to get another device to bring up the humidity in the humidor because the stock one doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> It looks great, the Spanish cedar aroma is delightful, and most importantly, it is keeping my cigars fresh.    </li>
            <li> As of right now, its performance has been good.  </li>
            <li> It came with instructions on how to season it and make sure the sensor was accurate.</li>
            <li> Humidor can easily fit 30 or more cigars</li>
            <li> On the other hand, if you&#x27;re on a budget like most of us, but still enjoy a good cigar, or know someone that does, this humidor will make a very handsome gift, or a fine addition for your own pleasure.  </li>

            <li> This little humidor is very good for a nice price.</li>
            <li> I also store some pipe tobacco in it so it is always full!</li>
            <li> I found it easy to prepare</li>
            <li> These couldn&#x27;t be as good as the high priced cigar store &#x27;</li>
            <li> Even though the packaging was very good, there were some minor scratches on the lid.</li>
            <li> with a jar of humidity crystals holds humidity at perfect level with little fluctuation.</li>
            <li> The description says it can hold 25-50 cigars which is accurate.  </li>
            <li> The humidor is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> This humidor not only looks classy and handsome on my desk, but it&#x27;s also excellent at what its supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a hygrometer (which I haven&#x27;t calibrated or anything, but seems to move in line with moisture additions) and one of those plastic things to put water on to maintain humidity (I use the 2-way packs and crystals as I find the plastic water things cheap and unreliable).   </li>
            <li> it is the cheap magnets they give you to attach the vent with.  </li>
            <li> I bought digital one that works great.  </li>
            <li> A definite bargain for a well-made humidor with a great finish.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic humidor.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Only problem is: It came with a humidity disc &amp; a meter, which is great, except there are no instructions whatsoever.</li>
            <li> so far the humidity levels have been good and still stabilizing.  </li>
            <li> model looks beautiful in my apartment, comes with its own humdifier (solution not included), and has enough storage space for the number of cigars a new smoker like me tends to store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very nice find, for the price especially.</li>
            <li> The box shipped arrived on my door 5 later and is very nice looking.</li>
            <li> Keep my cigars fresh!</li>
            <li> Nice size with good hinges and closes tightly.  </li>
            <li> will tell if I have further issues, but so far its an excellent purchase.</li>
            <li> but with such a great price if he never puts a cigar into it I still feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> The outside finish looks great and after a proper priming, it holds a good consistent humidity.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;ll probably last me a good while.</li>
            <li> I am happy for my first humidor, however it came with the top of the case a little scratched up despite all of it&#x27;s protection that it was mailed with.</li>
            <li> The humidifier seems sturdy, the box closes tightly, and the case is beautiful.    </li>
            <li> It was shipped quickly, and exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> I love the look of this humidor and it is the perfect size for a casual cigar smoker like myself.</li>
            <li> The inside has a nice tight air seal, with nice golden colored hinges.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this handsome, quality built humidor either for yourself, or as a gift for the tobacco user in your family.</li>
            <li> The box is very pretty.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know and evidently, they aren&#x27;t telling!</li>
            <li> First humidor I ever purchased for my husband, He loves it!  </li>
            <li> Knowing how cheap he is, I knew that he would never get a new one for himself, (nor would his family, for they are cheap too).  </li>
            <li> Great little humidor.</li>
            <li> my moneys worth.  </li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> I only smoke premiums, and only 1-2 a week, so I needed something that could keep my nice cigars nice while they wait for me.  </li>
            <li> The sensor was right on @70.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate, and gel works great.    </li>
            <li> A glass top is worth the extra expense.  </li>
            <li> Great humidor for your low to mid range priced stogies.</li>
            <li> The inside is fully Spanish cedar lined, very important.</li>
            <li> If you, or your intended are a serious cigar smoker who is used to nothing but the best as far as cigars or tobacco is concerned, perhaps hiking up your budget a smidgen and</li>
            <li> If you, or your intended are a serious cigar smoker who is used to nothing but the best as far as cigars or tobacco is concerned, perhaps hiking up your budget a smidgen and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on a tight budget with my cigars, so I needed something quality but cheap enough not to break the bank, and this humidor worked great.  </li>
            <li> The directions specifically say that the hygrometer may or may not have a screw on the back which you can turn to adjust the hygrometer to the appropriate humidty level (mine did not have the screw).  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product as my first humidor.  </li>
            <li> I bought one for a favorite uncle of mine that smokes cigars, and was having one of those big turning 70 parties.  </li>
            <li> I drop about a tablespoon of water in the moistener about once a week, and my tobacco is always fresh and ready to burn.  </li>
            <li> Very solid construction, looks a lot better than in the photograph.  </li>
            <li> and it is just about seasoned now.</li>
            <li> First humidor</li>
            <li> Definitely holds more than 25.</li>
            <li> This is my first humidor.</li>
            <li> This is my first humidor, so don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.  </li>
            <li> It took me about a week to get this humidor properly seasoned.  </li>
            <li> The mahogany finish is thick and very nicely polished.</li>
            <li> But it still cannot keep humidity up to a decent level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good looking on the outside, but simply doesn&#x27;t function adequately for the purpose for which I bought it.</li>
            <li> fit and finish was great, holds plenty of cigars for the casual smoker, and it maintains a consistent humidity level.</li>
            <li> This is a very affordable humidor that works very well and smells cedar fresh inside.</li>
            <li> My uncle was thrilled with it, and even told me that I shouldn&#x27;t have spent so much on him.  </li>
            <li> The adhesive does not stick very well to the inside of the wood, so at first it kept falling off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen the same exact model selling for $70 at a fine smoke shop.</li>
            <li> I started out looking in cigar stores for a humidor but very quickly learned that it was definitely not the place to go if you don&#x27;t want begin at a $100 minimum.</li>
            <li> so I am absolutely certain that my process is correct.  </li>
            <li> It probably really holds around 35 normal (5x50 or bigger) cigars, with corona&#x27;s or smaller ones you could fit more.</li>
            <li> Solidly crafted, with a moisture gauge that is relatively accurate for being analogue.  </li>
            <li> Basically, it does what it is supposed to do at a really reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> For real?  </li>
            <li> and it has preserved them very well.  </li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to a newcomer to the cigar life or someone who wants a humidor to leave at a friends house or vacation place.</li>
            <li> It was fast shipping and reliable.  </li>
            <li> and it closes with a gentle whoosh.  </li>
            <li> Once my patience paid off, the humidor&#x27;s RH is very stable around 68-70%.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve calibrated a digital hygrometer by the book with a kit &amp; have 3 drymistat humidifier tubes, plus the cheap humidity panel that came with</li>
            <li> It holds many cigars, completely seals of outside air.</li>
            <li> I am surprised to see so many glowing reviews, so I must be the only one with issues holding</li>
            <li> I officially give up and will probably have to buy a better box or actively recharge this one to keep my humidity level up.  </li>
            <li> Says it fits up to 50 cigars, but I&#x27;ve got more than that in there right now, mostly smaller ones, but I&#x27;m guessing it would fit 50 churchills or probably 100 petite coronas at least.     </li>
            <li> The humidor is very large and is indeed lined with cedar which you can def smell when you first open it.  </li>
            <li> I prefer mild, small cigars, and the box could easily hold a 50 plus of those types if it needed to.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not a problem, however, because the most of the free hygrometers are poor quality anyway.</li>
            <li> Nice tight seal, lined with Spanish cedar, nice looking, unbelievable price.    </li>
            <li> Rarely do I see the humidity above 62-64%.</li>
            <li> I seasoned it easily over a few days and am able to store my modest collection of about 20 cigars in it without any trouble.  </li>
            <li> I have a nice humidor waiting for me back there when I return, but I needed a solution to keep my prized imports fresh in the mean time.</li>
            <li> As others have pointed out it has a tight seal, lined with Spanish cedar, kind of pretty looking, and a low price.  </li>
            <li> They also sent me a second box free of charge to try the same thing</li>
            <li> The finish is done well and looks very classy.    </li>
            <li> This very same one I happen to find at a local smoke shop, and paid more for it there than it is currently being offered at here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> First when I received the humidor, I couldn&#x27;t believe the finish on the outside.  </li>
            <li> It is much more expensive looking than it actually will cost you, and in my opinion will last you for just as many years as some of the cigar store high end models...</li>
            <li> It is much more expensive looking than it actually will cost you, and in my opinion will last you for just as many years as some of the cigar store high end models...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, you get more than what you pay for in this little red box.</li>
            <li> I assume the real smokers, the pros, can never have enough humidors to store their cigars in!</li>
            <li> There is no question that there are far more expensive and quality humidors to be had, here on Amazon and at many other places.  </li>
            <li> There is no question that there are far more expensive and quality humidors to be had, here on Amazon and at many other places.  </li>
            <li> Unless you are a true cigar snob, and/or have a huge collection, for the price, I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> Tight seal, nice little hygrometer and humidifier.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with this one, but I found that it filled up too quickly for my preferences.    </li>
            <li> I like filling my leather pipe pouches with tobacco and keeping them ready to go, rather than storing loose tobacco in a tin, or pipe humidor.  </li>
            <li> I also keep various incense bricks in the box for they burn slower and sweeter when kept from completely drying</li>
            <li> The box is much nicer than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> But after the seasoning process was complete it wasn&#x27;t noticeable enough to discourage me from putting my cigars in it.   </li>
            <li> comes with a divider, hygrometer and humidifier all of which i will probably replace in the near future.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept a shot glass full of water with the humidor and a small number of cigars because I couldn&#x27;t keep the humdity above 65%.  </li>
            <li> My cigars do not dry out like they used to.  </li>
            <li> I can not think of any problems with this box or why anyone would spend 2-3x the price for one that would serve generally the same quality in its function</li>
            <li> It is very rich and expensive looking, far beyond what it actually cost.  </li>
            <li> Thinking back on the price of this humidor I was expecting a dull looking, halfway decent humidor, but boy was I surprised.  </li>
            <li> However, if it does not have a screw then you are to make a mental note of the proper humidty and then take the difference from what the hygrometer actually displays.  </li>
            <li> and I am not frequently adding water to it.  </li>
            <li> I paid roughly $15 for this humidor and the quality is definitely reflected in the price.</li>
            <li> currently have 4 drymistat tubes and the element inside and the humidor is always closed.  </li>
            <li> I have four humidor&#x27;s, this being my smallest and least expensive, but this humidor holds humidity better than any of the rest of them!</li>
            <li> In Colorado it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> so I purchased some single tube humidifiers to bridge the gap.  </li>
            <li> The humidor had a bit of a gluey smell when it first arrived.</li>
            <li> I ended up spending a few bucks on a digital hygrometer and tossing the one this came with.</li>
            <li> Initially, I had some trouble stabilizing the temperature, but I think I have that under control.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This humidor is very solidly built, and heavy.  </li>
            <li> humidity bumps up a bit when I empty all the cigars &amp; dampen the cedar lining with distilled water.</li>
            <li> I had to evacuhike out of Vermont due to Irene and one of the few things I managed to carry out of the mountains on my back was my cigars.</li>
            <li> I am just starting out with a small cigar collection.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the other reviews led me to believe that it came with a hygrometer, but it DID NOT.</li>
            <li> Used the shot glass method, purchased the gel beads, and wiped down with a sponge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharp looking and does the job well, thank you!</li>
            <li> I had read the humidifier can be unpredictable</li>
            <li> You will need one of these if you are serious about properly storing your cigars.  </li>
            <li> This obviously isn&#x27;t a extremely expensive humidor, but I can&#x27;t see a reason that I would \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; later in life, apart from a possible capacity issue, and even then I would probably just get another one of these.</li>
            <li> You should use a digital hygrometer and humidity beads if you are serious about keeping your cigars well kept.    </li>
            <li> However, it is advertised as having everything you need, this is not true.  </li>
            <li> I took the green stuff out of the humidifier when I got it, replaced it with the gel, and I haven&#x27;t seen my humidity vary off 70 percent since.  </li>
            <li> and I wanted a small box.  </li>
            <li> as promised which I would&#x27;ve made a fuss about if I weren&#x27;t lazy and just bought the humidor gel.</li>
            <li> The humidor comes with a small shelf and a humidifier but does not come with a hygrometer.  </li>
            <li> The accessories are worthless, but they always are, even in more expensive humidors.</li>
            <li> I would have given this a 5, but the hydrometer was hard to calibrate.  </li>
            <li> Took about 2 days to season, and judging by the cigars I am putting in it, it will hold at least 50, I keep my lighter + cutter in with them for convenience.    </li>
            <li> My only gripe is that the hygrometer is a worthless piece of junk because you cannot calibrate it properly in the sense that you are unable to adjust it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit of a humidor snob and don&#x27;t like buying unnecessary multiples of things I already have.</li>
            <li> The adhesive is of poor quality and will fall off within a day.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the adhesive pad that came with the humidifier will not stick to the inside of the lid.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my hubby but he seems to be having a difficult time holding the humidity.</li>
            <li> I was wrong,.</li>
            <li> Really annoying.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I received the humidor on time but I did not know it did not come with the items needed like the solution to create humidity and a hygrometer. Once I had to buy those items, the price of the humidor shot up.</li>
            <li> The humidor is fantastic.  I seasoned it easily over a few days and am able to store my modest collection of about 20 cigars in it without any trouble.  It has a good seal and I am not frequently adding water to it.  Basically, it does what it is supposed to do at a really reasonable price.  My only gripe is that the hygrometer is a worthless piece of junk because you cannot calibrate it properly in the sense that you are unable to adjust it.  The directions specifically say that the hygrometer may or may not have a screw on the back which you can turn to adjust the hygrometer to the appropriate humidty level (mine did not have the screw).  However, if it does not have a screw then you are to make a mental note of the proper humidty and then take the difference from what the hygrometer actually displays.  You are then supposed to apply that difference to the number it displays when you put it inside your humidor.  For real?  What a piece of junk! Why not bump the price up $5 and include a hygrometer that you can calibrate properly? I ended up spending a few bucks on a digital hygrometer and tossing the one this came with.</li>
            <li> The humidor is very nice looking and a good buy. In Colorado it&#x27;s dry and I have to use 2 humidly control devices (the one it came with and a jar) but it works.</li>
            <li> This is a very affordable humidor that works very well and smells cedar fresh inside. I can not think of any problems with this box or why anyone would spend 2-3x the price for one that would serve generally the same quality in its function</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as my first humidor.  As of right now, its performance has been good.  Initially, I had some trouble stabilizing the temperature, but I think I have that under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept a shot glass full of water with the humidor and a small number of cigars because I couldn&#x27;t keep the humdity above 65%.  However, this ceased to be an issue and I have since removed the shot glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model looks beautiful in my apartment, comes with its own humdifier (solution not included), and has enough storage space for the number of cigars a new smoker like me tends to store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time will tell if I have further issues, but so far its an excellent purchase.</li>
            <li> I actually bought two of these humidors.  I bought one for a favorite uncle of mine that smokes cigars, and was having one of those big turning 70 parties.  I was at his house one night and noticed that his was starting to fall apart.  Knowing how cheap he is, I knew that he would never get a new one for himself, (nor would his family, for they are cheap too).  I started out looking in cigar stores for a humidor but very quickly learned that it was definitely not the place to go if you don&#x27;t want begin at a $100 minimum. This very same one I happen to find at a local smoke shop, and paid more for it there than it is currently being offered at here on Amazon.  And I still feel I got  my moneys worth.  This humidor is very solidly built, and heavy.  The mahogany finish is thick and very nicely polished. It is very rich and expensive looking, far beyond what it actually cost.  My uncle was thrilled with it, and even told me that I shouldn&#x27;t have spent so much on him.  (Assuming of course that I got it at a cigar store and took a bath on it).  I picked up one of those brass name plates at a local craft store and had his initials printed on it.  Mounting it with brass screws was a cinch, and it made the box look even more stylish. He was most pleased...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up returning to the smoke shop and buying one for myself to store both incense in, and to store my pipe tobacco pouches.  I like filling my leather pipe pouches with tobacco and keeping them ready to go, rather than storing loose tobacco in a tin, or pipe humidor.  This humidor not only looks classy and handsome on my desk, but it&#x27;s also excellent at what its supposed to do.  I drop about a tablespoon of water in the moistener about once a week, and my tobacco is always fresh and ready to burn.  I also keep various incense bricks in the box for they burn slower and sweeter when kept from completely drying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this handsome, quality built humidor either for yourself, or as a gift for the tobacco user in your family. And I also recommend buying it here on Amazon, for the price is excellent. There is no question that there are far more expensive and quality humidors to be had, here on Amazon and at many other places.  If you, or your intended are a serious cigar smoker who is used to nothing but the best as far as cigars or tobacco is concerned, perhaps hiking up your budget a smidgen and skipping this choice would be a good idea.  On the other hand, if you&#x27;re on a budget like most of us, but still enjoy a good cigar, or know someone that does, this humidor will make a very handsome gift, or a fine addition for your own pleasure.  It is much more expensive looking than it actually will cost you, and in my opinion will last you for just as many years as some of the cigar store high end models...obacco user in your family.

            <li> I am just starting out with a small cigar collection.  This humidor was perfect.  The outside finish looks great and after a proper priming, it holds a good consistent humidity.  Very nice find, for the price especially.</li>
            <li> Very solid construction, looks a lot better than in the photograph.  I am happy for my first humidor, however it came with the top of the case a little scratched up despite all of it&#x27;s protection that it was mailed with.</li>
            <li> I bought this humidor about a month ago.  It was shipped quickly, and exceeded my expectations.  It looks great, the Spanish cedar aroma is delightful, and most importantly, it is keeping my cigars fresh.    Unless you are a true cigar snob, and/or have a huge collection, for the price, I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t complain.  Solidly crafted, with a moisture gauge that is relatively accurate for being analogue.  I&#x27;ve had a ton of cigars in there for quite a while and it has preserved them very well.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Bought this Box 3 months ago for my Cuban cigars with a digital caliber. And yesterday i ordered 2 more for my brother,   this is a perfect product to keep your cigars in a good condition.</li>
            <li> Got this for my son for Christmas and he loves it. The wood is beautiful and the interior smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I had to evacuhike out of Vermont due to Irene and one of the few things I managed to carry out of the mountains on my back was my cigars. I have a nice humidor waiting for me back there when I return, but I needed a solution to keep my prized imports fresh in the mean time. In comes The Capri. The box is much nicer than I expected for the price. It comes with a hygrometer (which I haven&#x27;t calibrated or anything, but seems to move in line with moisture additions) and one of those plastic things to put water on to maintain humidity (I use the 2-way packs and crystals as I find the plastic water things cheap and unreliable).   The humidor had a bit of a gluey smell when it first arrived. Might have been the cedar, who knows. But after the seasoning process was complete it wasn&#x27;t noticeable enough to discourage me from putting my cigars in it.   I&#x27;m a bit of a humidor snob and don&#x27;t like buying unnecessary multiples of things I already have. The Capri suits my needs well and I would recommend it to a newcomer to the cigar life or someone who wants a humidor to leave at a friends house or vacation place.</li>
            <li> I paid roughly $15 for this humidor and the quality is definitely reflected in the price. Even after seasoning for a week I had to add a jar of crystals and the humidification sponge that came with the humidor to raise the humidity to 70%. I put in 2 cigars and it dropped to 68%. It does not appear to seal well and if it wasn&#x27;t more work than the $15 I paid for this I&#x27;d send it back. Save up some caps and buy a better model, I wish I&#x27;d done that.</li>
            <li> I have four humidor&#x27;s, this being my smallest and least expensive, but this humidor holds humidity better than any of the rest of them! I love it! It probably really holds around 35 normal (5x50 or bigger) cigars, with corona&#x27;s or smaller ones you could fit more. Great humidor!</li>
            <li> For the price this humidor is a good deal. Even though the packaging was very good, there were some minor scratches on the lid. These must have come from the manufacturer before packing. There is not a hygrometer with this humidor but there is a humidifier. Unfortunately the adhesive pad that came with the humidifier will not stick to the inside of the lid. I have purchased another humidifier and a digital hygrometer and it is just about seasoned now. Maybe more comments to come when it has been in use for some time.</li>
            <li> the picture does this no justice it is beautiful large and elegant. It holds many cigars, completely seals of outside air. so far the humidity levels have been good and still stabilizing.  buy it for the price it is amazing. get a digital hygrometer though</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase. Easy to set up and has a nice seal. Humidor can easily fit 30 or more cigars</li>
            <li> This Humidor is great for the money! It was fast shipping and reliable.  The quality is great, easy to set up and everything! There os really only 1 flaw and it is the cheap magnets they give you to attach the vent with.  They never stayed attached to the wood.  They give you magnets and they give you velcro for the hygrometer.  The velcro works great but the magnets don&#x27;t.  Not complaining too much because the box does an excellent job! Smells great and is always a topic for get togethers!</li>
            <li> First humidor so I probably should have gone for something with an externally-viewable hygrometer cause I keep opening it up to check the reading.  That said, this is doing a great job.</li>
            <li> I have just started smoking cigars.  I am just beginning and I wanted a small box.  As others have pointed out it has a tight seal, lined with Spanish cedar, kind of pretty looking, and a low price.  I found it easy to prepare and I don&#x27;t mind the fact that I have to open it to check on it - the scent that pours out of it is great on the nose!  I prefer mild, small cigars, and the box could easily hold a 50 plus of those types if it needed to.&lt;br /&gt;A lovely gift for anybody.  I assume the real smokers, the pros, can never have enough humidors to store their cigars in!</li>
            <li> Well worth it. Great price and good quality. I keep it well stocked! I keep my churchills and torpedos in there no problem. Definitely holds more than 25.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a Christmas gift for my father who will occasionally engage in a cigar with his buddies on the lake.  He wanted something to store them in the boat house, so I was looking for something simple and inexpensive.  The box shipped arrived on my door 5 later and is very nice looking. I had read the humidifier can be unpredictable so I purchased some single tube humidifiers to bridge the gap.  I have not gotten to see how it works yet, but with such a great price if he never puts a cigar into it I still feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> The humidor itself is off nice construction and has a beautiful look to it.  It comes with a humidifier and good instructions.  However, it is advertised as having everything you need, this is not true.  It does not come with a hydrometer, which is used to measure humidity in the humidor.  You will need one of these if you are serious about properly storing your cigars.  I had to go out and purchase a hydrometer separately.  Also, the humidifier comes with an adhesive strip on the back so that you can stick it to the lid.  The adhesive is of poor quality and will fall off within a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on a tight budget with my cigars, so I needed something quality but cheap enough not to break the bank, and this humidor worked great.  I only smoke premiums, and only 1-2 a week, so I needed something that could keep my nice cigars nice while they wait for me.  I took the green stuff out of the humidifier when I got it, replaced it with the gel, and I haven&#x27;t seen my humidity vary off 70 percent since.  Great product, even better price.</li>
            <li> Thinking back on the price of this humidor I was expecting a dull looking, halfway decent humidor, but boy was I surprised.  First when I received the humidor, I couldn&#x27;t believe the finish on the outside.  It&#x27;s actually better than the picture on Amazon.  The inside has a nice tight air seal, with nice golden colored hinges.  Beautiful box, don&#x27;t regret purchasing this item.  I would suggest a person that buys this humidor, also get a Hygrometer.  I purchased the Analog Hygrometer 2.25\\&quot; by Western Humidors, here in Amazon and it goes along well with this box.</li>
            <li> This is my first humidor. It came with instructions on how to season it and make sure the sensor was accurate. The sensor was right on @70. Took about 2 days to season, and judging by the cigars I am putting in it, it will hold at least 50, I keep my lighter + cutter in with them for convenience.    The hinges work well, and the exterior fit and finish is very good. This obviously isn&#x27;t a extremely expensive humidor, but I can&#x27;t see a reason that I would \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; later in life, apart from a possible capacity issue, and even then I would probably just get another one of these. I am very very happy.</li>
            <li> This is a great little humidor, don&#x27;t forget to season it really well!!!!!!!! Easily holds 50 church hills!!! well worth the money!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my first humidor, so don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.  That being said, it seems perfect!  Very well made, smells good, and looks great!</li>
            <li> The humidor is very nice for the money.  It keeps the humidity level at a constant 73% with distilled water only.  My cigars do not dry out like they used to.  I would have given this a 5, but the hydrometer was hard to calibrate.  I bought digital one that works great.  It holds a lot of cigars too.  The exterior finish is very nice and looks good on my dresser.</li>
            <li> Just got this as a gift, quality contruction, great finish, an what a wonderful smell!!!</li>
            <li> The box itself is quite nice.  Mine didn&#x27;t end up coming with a hygrometer as promised which I would&#x27;ve made a fuss about if I weren&#x27;t lazy and just bought the humidor gel.</li>
            <li> fit and finish was great, holds plenty of cigars for the casual smoker, and it maintains a consistent humidity level. It can&#x27;t be beat for the money.</li>
            <li> This humidor covers all the basics well.  Nice tight seal, lined with Spanish cedar, nice looking, unbelievable price.    Here are the reasons NOT to buy this one, but none of these justify dinging the star rating.    1.  You may, like me, find that you want a larger humidor.  There&#x27;s nothing wrong with this one, but I found that it filled up too quickly for my preferences.    2.  A glass top is worth the extra expense.  I find myself opening this one way too often, and a glass top would eliminate 90% of those openings.    That&#x27;s about it.  I use gel humidifier, and I believe a hygrometer is not necessary when using gel.  I live in a very dry climate, and gel works great.    You will not find a better humidor at this price.</li>
            <li> I bought this for his valetine&#x27;s present. I haven&#x27;t given Otto him yet, but he loves cigars so I&#x27;m sure he will love this preset!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful finish and the inside of the humidor smells delicious. I bought this as a gift for my hubby but he seems to be having a difficult time holding the humidity. 50%. Used the shot glass method, purchased the gel beads, and wiped down with a sponge. I question the reliability of the hygrometer. Also, it didn&#x27;t come with any instructions. Any helpful comments</li>
            <li> This little humidor is very good for a nice price. with a jar of humidity crystals holds humidity at perfect level with little fluctuation.</li>
            <li> Great little humidor. Tight seal, nice little hygrometer and humidifier. Holds humidity quite well for a humidor under $100.00. Great humidor for your low to mid range priced stogies. The only change I&#x27;d make would be to somehow have the hygrometer on the outside of the humidor so it could be read without opening the case.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, you get more than what you pay for in this little red box.</li>
            <li> The humidifier&#x27;s magnetic plate isn&#x27;t sticky enough to attach to the lid. Nothing double sided tap can&#x27;t cure.    Otherwise it does its job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this humidor for about a month now and it works great for 50 toro sized cigars (6.0 X 50).  Nice size with good hinges and closes tightly.  A definite bargain for a well-made humidor with a great finish.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic humidor. I&#x27;ve seen the same exact model selling for $70 at a fine smoke shop. It is well crafted. The finish is done well and looks very classy.    The inside is fully Spanish cedar lined, very important. The accessories are worthless, but they always are, even in more expensive humidors. You should use a digital hygrometer and humidity beads if you are serious about keeping your cigars well kept.    Says it fits up to 50 cigars, but I&#x27;ve got more than that in there right now, mostly smaller ones, but I&#x27;m guessing it would fit 50 churchills or probably 100 petite coronas at least.     excellent buy!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my now husband as a wedding gift. He loves it! He says it works as described and would recommend.</li>
            <li> This was a purchase I&#x27;ve put off for a while. These couldn&#x27;t be as good as the high priced cigar store &#x27;s. I was wrong,. Great price AND quality.</li>
            <li> Ths humidor box would probably cost 5X more elsewhere. Great wood quality, great price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I researched for days on humidors and finally decided on this one.  The humidor is very large and is indeed lined with cedar which you can def smell when you first open it.  The seal is also quality as i&#x27;ve done the lid drop test and it closes with a gentle whoosh.  comes with a divider, hygrometer and humidifier all of which i will probably replace in the near future.  Good hinges and it&#x27;ll probably last me a good while.</li>
            <li> The humidor is pretty good quality and can fit about 15-20 good sized cigars. I also store some pipe tobacco in it so it is always full! The only downside is the humidor disk. The adhesive does not stick very well to the inside of the wood, so at first it kept falling off. Now I have it sitting in the humidor on the bottom, which takes up even more space.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic. You will not find a better humidor for this price. The humidifier seems sturdy, the box closes tightly, and the case is beautiful.    My only complaint is that the other reviews led me to believe that it came with a hygrometer, but it DID NOT. That&#x27;s not a problem, however, because the most of the free hygrometers are poor quality anyway.</li>
            <li> Looks very nice; seals well; hygrometer provided is adjustable; fit 39 Churchills in here. This thing is made in China, but the cigars I put in it were made in Nicaragua.</li>
            <li> The box is very pretty. Only problem is: It came with a humidity disc &amp; a meter, which is great, except there are no instructions whatsoever.I mounted them to the box lid, the meter hasn&#x27;t moved from 60%. ????? Are you supposed to moisten the disc. I don&#x27;t know and evidently, they aren&#x27;t telling!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this humidor for about 2 weeks now and thought it was a good time for a review.  The humidor itself is well made and lined with Spanish cedar.  The description says it can hold 25-50 cigars which is accurate.  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more on the 50 side though.  The humidor comes with a small shelf and a humidifier but does not come with a hygrometer.  It took me about a week to get this humidor properly seasoned.  Once my patience paid off, the humidor&#x27;s RH is very stable around 68-70%.  I decided to use some beads instead of the included humidifier.  I would reccomend this humidor to anyone looking for a simple and understated humidor.</li>
            <li> So far excellent cigar box I love it. Does what it is supposed too very pleased with this item. Keep my cigars fresh!</li>
            <li> I am surprised to see so many glowing reviews, so I must be the only one with issues holding humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been trying for over 6 months to hold a humidity level with this box.  I even talked to a specialist from Quality Importers on the phone several times and followed the humidor seasoning process to make it work.  They also sent me a second box free of charge to try the same thing and it still drops the humidity level to below 60% within days of recharging my element and drymistat tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I currently have 4 drymistat tubes and the element inside and the humidor is always closed.  I also have two hygrometers that I calibrated with a Boveda pack so I am absolutely certain that my process is correct.  I officially give up and will probably have to buy a better box or actively recharge this one to keep my humidity level up.  Really annoying.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a wedding gift for my husband.  It&#x27;s an attractive box that holds his cigars beautifully.  He loves it, and that&#x27;s what matters most!</li>
            <li> First humidor I ever purchased for my husband, He loves it!  It kind of looks like a mans jewelry chest... It&#x27;s sharp looking and does the job well, thank you!</li>
            <li> Very nice humidor for the price. Came with a hygrometer. Remaining at a constant humidity for several weeks since purchase. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Rarely do I see the humidity above 62-64%. I&#x27;ve calibrated a digital hygrometer by the book with a kit &amp; have 3 drymistat humidifier tubes, plus the cheap humidity panel that came with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The humidity bumps up a bit when I empty all the cigars &amp; dampen the cedar lining with distilled water. But it still cannot keep humidity up to a decent level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good looking on the outside, but simply doesn&#x27;t function adequately for the purpose for which I bought it.</li>
            <li> I love the look of this humidor and it is the perfect size for a casual cigar smoker like myself. Please make sure to get another device to bring up the humidity in the humidor because the stock one doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
    </ol>
