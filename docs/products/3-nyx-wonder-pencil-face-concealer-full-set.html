            <li> These are a bit dry but they are similar to kohl pencil eye makeup.</li>
            <li> Works better than other expensive brands I have purchased.</li>
            <li> This pencil covers everything from dark inner eye areas to redness and blemishes.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a spot coverup like these for a long time!!!</li>
            <li> only use this a few times so</li>
            <li> I just dab a tad on that and a few other obvious age spots after putting on my face makeup and voila!</li>
            <li> I also have an annoying age spot right next to the inner part of one brow.  </li>
            <li> use the dark one to darken my scar, and the medium one to lighten my age spots.</li>
            <li> It matches the shade of my eyebrows and  makes my eyebrows look uneven.</li>
            <li> Before this, I was using a dab of pale blusher powder to hide the scar, but it would come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve aged, I&#x27;ve acquired thin veins that show up on my face/jaw area.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit hard to apply, it should be smoother</li>

            <li> I am 63 years old and my appearance has always been important to me.  I still look really good when I put on my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed to conceal a very white, obvious scar near my hairline.  It was very obvious and I was very self-conscious about it.  This wonderful pencil did the trick.  Plus, the texture makes it last.  Before this, I was using a dab of pale blusher powder to hide the scar, but it would come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I realized that I could also use it to hide prominent age spots (the size of freckles on my face - the ones that makeup doesn&#x27;t cover.  I also have an annoying age spot right next to the inner part of one brow.  It matches the shade of my eyebrows and  makes my eyebrows look uneven. I just dab a tad on that and a few other obvious age spots after putting on my face makeup and voila! The age spots disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the dark one to darken my scar, and the medium one to lighten my age spots.</li>
            <li> These work well in the waterline of eye, contouring, and concealing.  They do not stay in your water line all day though.  Does not have that kind of staying power, but for the price you really can&#x27;t beat these for a quick fix!!!  Received quickly upon ordering.</li>

            <li> Best concealer I&#x27;ve ever used for small areas- under brows, on blemishes</li>
            <li> I like these a lot.  They do a great job of covering.  I wish there was a darker shade to add.</li>
            <li> This pencil covers everything from dark inner eye areas to redness and blemishes. I love it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!! :)</li>
            <li> only use this a few times so do not know how many times it needs to be applied during the day.</li>

            <li> These are a bit dry but they are similar to kohl pencil eye makeup. I would say you can pass on these. And invest in a better well known brand.</li>
            <li> I love these wonder pencils. My color is the medium one but I could resist trying the others for different places in my face.&lt;br /&gt;I use my pencil every day to lighten up my lower eyebrows lines, gives my face the shine I need and frame the eyebrows perfectly. I also use it to conceal unwanted discoloration in my skin or hickies .&lt;br /&gt;Its perfect and really work with good blending.</li>
            <li> Works better than other expensive brands I have purchased. Will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit hard to apply, it should be smoother</li>
