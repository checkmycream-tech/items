            <li>Best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used!!!</li>
            <li>This product, is the best I have found for protecting my teeth and mouth from bacteria.</li>
            <li>It is also superb for keeping plaque off the teeth.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste was recommended by my dentist and it is awesome.  </li>
            <li>Pricewise, Amazon has the best deal on both</li>
            <li>However, this toothpaste lacks that entirely- in a very good way.</li>
            <li>Closys is an incredible toothpaste with zero abrasion, yet best cleaning power I have experienced in a toothpaste.</li>

            <li>This value is good &amp; delivery superb.</li>
            <li>Great toothpaste for teeth and gum health.  </li>
            <li>My dad switched too, after I raved about this, and his issues with gingivitis have been greatly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also read a really great review by a dentist for the product and it helped me validate my switch from Rembrandt.</li>
            <li>Great toothpaste, great taste.</li>
            <li>Great taste.</li>

            <li>My dentist is happy with the health of my gums &amp; teeth, so this is doing the trick.</li>
            <li>No foaming and great taste</li>
            <li>Great taste, too.</li>
            <li>Great for maintaining oral health</li>
            <li>toothpaste is great to anyone to use, but I buy it for my daughters who have problems with mouth sores.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is great.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li>It was a great idea</li>
            <li>It does a great job cleaning my teeth and mouth with the added benefit of not causing my cancer sores to flair up.</li>
            <li>The article went on to say that some consumers using toothpaste containing SLS experienced irritation of the mouth tissues, including outbreaks of canker sores.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended it to me and I have been quite happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I think the product would be very effective if you don&#x27;t have the taste bud problem.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>I am very happy with CloSYS and am glad I made the change.</li>
            <li>Leaves a pleasant taste and cleans like baking soda.</li>
            <li>she said it would be good for my gums and teeth.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get overly foamy, not chalky, tastes good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve switched for good.</li>
            <li>good stuff, recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li>good product&lt;</li>
            <li>I bought the toothpaste because I loved the mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>Good, but has just crossed $10 price tag on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Good enamel protection.</li>
            <li>It was priced fairly and arrived promptly and in good condition.</li>
            <li>I have always used and loved this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I have used Sensodyne for years but was recommend CloSYS by my dentist for an option with good fluoride presence.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>It does not taste as good like the brand name toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>A superior toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Leaves the mouth with a good feel.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my mouth feeling very clean and my checkups have been very good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non abrasive ness and yet superb cleaning power is the most amazing and effective combination I have found.</li>
            <li>This was recommended by my dentist and I am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Clo-sys is great toothpaste, but order from [...] or another reputable place.  </li>
            <li>Anyhoo, I also came to Amazon to get the Closys toothpaste, since CVS doesn&#x27;t carry it, and have been very pleased.  </li>
            <li>In addition to doing an excellent job of cleaning my teath, it leaves a fresh feeling in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>He was right because is the best for the gums.</li>
            <li>I am a retired dentist and feel this is the best toothpaste available, mild taste, has fluoride, no SLS, and is great for breath.</li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste!  </li>
            <li>more switching toothpastes for me!</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Great toothpaste and easy to order</li>
            <li>using closys toothpaste in combination with a waterpik with periogen has saved my teeth and made visits to my dentist much more pleasant.</li>
            <li>The bottles are huge and at a great price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but it&#x27;s a great sulfate free toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that I have exceptionally good smelling breath without smelling like a mint factory.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find a product that still adds fluoride but doesn&#x27;t contain sulfates.</li>
            <li>Nice flavor, not a gel, cleans well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my mucosa as toothpaste containing sodium laurate and/or a whitener.</li>
            <li>This is a great toothpaste, my gums bleed for years from brushing, this toothpaste has totally stopped it, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>After all a smile is priceless :-)</li>
            <li>nice thing about this toothpaste is that it&#x27;s basically &amp;#34;unscented.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I experienced a noticeably more healthy looking and feeling teethe and gums.  </li>
            <li>This one has a nice mint taste.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased and satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Clean teeth and light flavor!!!</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant, minty flavor I enjoy.</li>
            <li>Good mild mint taste!  </li>
            <li>They are healthy &amp; effective.</li>
            <li>Just leaves a cleaner taste in my mouth than more popular brands.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is great for anyone who seems to brush all the time but still has a not so fresh breath.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is the best for sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>For those who got canker sores from Sodium Laurel Sulfate in most popular brands, Closys does just as well without the worry of Canker Sores from the SLS.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best all natural toothpaste</li>
            <li>But my teeth are clean and my gums feel good.</li>
            <li>The taste of mint is mild and pleasant.</li>
            <li>It is surprising that how many toothpastes rely on abrasive ness to clean your teeth .</li>
            <li>That is a foaming agent so no foam is also nice for those with a strong gag reflex.  </li>
            <li>This an excellent Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) free toothpaste that leaves your mouth feeling minty clean and your breath fresh as a spring meadow breeze.  </li>
            <li>If you are going to brush you might as well use something that is going to help you have healthy teeth and gums and good, sweet breath.</li>
            <li>The non-sudsing feature helps prevent my gums and cheeks from flaring up even more during brushing.  </li>
            <li>and I think contain a lot more &#x27;additives&#x27;.</li>
            <li>changed the formula, now tastes and feels more like paste than a refreshing mouth cleaner.</li>
            <li>I thought, well, it can&#x27;t hurt, and it might work better than Listerine, so I&#x27;ll give it a shot.</li>
            <li>:) If anyone you care about has gingivitis, please share this with them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Closys for years &amp; have always been pleased with their products.</li>
            <li>It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and our gums do feel better after using this and the mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>It does not have a super strong minty taste, which is great for me as some toothpastes are too strong tasting for me.</li>
            <li>Love how it makes your teeth feel</li>
            <li>I have an allergy to many toothpastes but can use this one with no problem.</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums have never felt better since I started using Closys.</li>
            <li>Plus, this is a Much better price than Walgreens.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t inflame my mouth or have an overpowering medicinal taste or smell like so many toothpastes.  </li>
            <li>Better check ups, too.  </li>
            <li>Also their mint flavor is not overpowering like many others.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>She said it effects some people more than others.  </li>
            <li>My last cleaning was great, no bleeding, good gum health.</li>
            <li>Pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li>I love this product and love it that it&#x27;s made here in the States.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s phenomenal.</li>
            <li>Refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>PerioBrite products are better, IMO.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste keeps your gums and teeth their healthiest I love it</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I really love the toothpaste...</li>
            <li>A friend of mine told me about this toothpaste, I&#x27;m so glad I listened to him.</li>
            <li>More than meets my expectations</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Others make the inside of my mouth peel and develop sores, this one just keeps my teeth and gums healthy.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase this toothpaste mostly because of the reviews.</li>
            <li>It is safer than most in that it does NOT contain Sulfates / Foaming Agents.</li>
            <li>I want to love this stuff, but I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this mouthwash, you can opt not to flavor it as I do, so no lingering taste.</li>
            <li>Always love and trust this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I use to buy this product from my DDS but Amazon had a better price.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find it at CVS or Walgreen&#x27;s any longer, so buy it online</li>
            <li>My dentist also recommended it for healthy mouth atmosphere and to freshen my breath.  </li>
            <li>This product was recommended to me many years ago.</li>
            <li>Recommended to me by a top dentist.  </li>
            <li>I like this mouthwash way better than the stuff you can buy in the stores.</li>
            <li>I thought this was just a gimmick for the dentist to make more money from their patients.</li>
            <li>As a Dental Hygienist, I recommend it to all my patients as it does a fantastic job!</li>
            <li>I have recommended it and just as satisfied as I am are those to whom I recommended Closys.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After searching Amazon reviews for &amp;#34;Crest ProHealth Stains&amp;#34; I came across this toothpaste and mouthwash and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>CloSYS is better than advertised.</li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>but they do feel healthy and</li>
            <li>Works better than the mouthwash for me, since I brush my Invisilign with it too.</li>
            <li>Although the presence of SLS does nothing to enhance the performance of the product, consumers tend to believe that a product is working better if it produces suds.</li>
            <li>turned to Amazon and after reading many reviews I decided to try CloSYS.</li>
            <li>Alcohol free and non-staining!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!!!!</li>
            <li>This is the best toothpaste that I have used in a long time.  </li>
            <li>It tastes pretty good too.</li>
            <li>Since the rinse also has no alcohol, it is quite easy to swish the product in your mouth for more than the 10 seconds recommended.</li>
            <li>Some people are very sensitive to the foaming agent and I, for one, am happy to have found a product without it.</li>
            <li>love that it is sulfate free.  </li>
            <li>Cleans well and feels great on sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great if you are sensitive to sulphates.</li>
            <li>At 54 years old, that is a great thing to hear....</li>
            <li>The paste is great so far.</li>
            <li>they look so much better and feel so smooth</li>
            <li>And the taste is nice and minty fresh.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this toothpaste at the dentist office, but decided that it would be more convenient when I found it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It was originally recommended to me by my dentist many years ago, and I&#x27;ve used it ever since.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t foam so using it with an electric toothbrush is really easy.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste has a very mild flavor, and I like to use the rinse without the added flavoring.  </li>
            <li>As for the cost, since we have prime and I subscribed and saved, it was the easy choice.</li>
            <li>I love it, my teeth are so clean they squeak.</li>
            <li>Your mouth feels so clean after using this, and I love that it doesn&#x27;t have the foaming agent in it.</li>
            <li>The taste is pleasant and not over-powering and it leaves my breath fresh ready for the day!</li>
            <li>Very Pleased and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li>it seems fine.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is fine, I have used it before and like it.  </li>
            <li>The tongue scrapers are light and easy for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But after using it for a week, everything seems fine.</li>
            <li>So we switched to this toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t have that ingredient and it has helped tremendously!</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t say one single good thing about it.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended the mouthwash as being gentle (no alcohol, yet antibacterial), and I liked it so well that I decided to get the toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>The price doesn&#x27;t seem to be justified by the result.</li>
            <li>product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I have used the sodium laurel sulfate free toothpaste for years.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a great mouth feel, not gritty, not overly minty.</li>
            <li>She said a lot of their patients that had similar problems with bleeding gums and flossing wasn&#x27;t the issue, they had great results with the cloysys.  </li>
            <li>As an advanced age person, I have some recession and need to have an increased fluoride toothpaste to protection the exposed tooth.  </li>
            <li>This CloSYS type basically feels like your brushing your teeth with some lightly flavored water.</li>
            <li>Amazon provides a great price, especially if you use the subscribe &amp; save program.</li>
            <li>Rembrandt was a great toothpaste for preventing canker sores and whiten the teeth at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The taste is light and minty and my mouth feels so clean all day.</li>
            <li>Sulfates are cheap and make things foam more readily, but who needs that!</li>
            <li>This toothpaste leaves my teeth and breath fresh and clean too!  </li>
            <li>My mouth feels very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I had originally rated it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>and I fell in love after first use.</li>
            <li>It was originally recommended to me by my dentist.  </li>
            <li>My NEW hygienist wanted to know what I was doing to keep my teeth so nice..</li>
            <li>Clean tasting.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels clean and no lye bumps.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t foam AT ALL or clean.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clean at all.</li>
            <li>The POINT of toothpaste is to CLEAN.</li>
            <li>It did not leave a clean tasting mouth, at all.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost like you could get perfectly clean teeth without even brushing.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clean at all.</li>
            <li>I have to clean twice each time, and still doesn&#x27;t wash off any onion or fish breath.</li>
            <li>It says right on the label, in the fine print, of the Crest Pro-Health Rinse, that it may cause surface staining.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about these products.</li>
            <li>Last time I went to the dentist, they skipped the polishing because my teeth looked that good - I had been using this toothpaste for 6 months.</li>
            <li>It tastes good, low foaming &#x3D;</li>
            <li>no sulfates, cleans my mouth well as in glossy shiny, white teeth, and good breath.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind so much, but I do feel like I have to use more of it in general.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non-foaming, which I really like, and gives my mouth a very clean taste.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my mouth with a fresh and clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Recommended by dentist and it leaves your mouth fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, this toothpaste does nothing for a clean fresh mouth feeling.</li>
            <li>It leave you with a clean, fresh breath</li>
            <li>So the big tube lasts many many months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a mild minty taste.  </li>
            <li>I combine this with gel-kam for my &#x27;super teeth maintenance routine&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>The oral spray is great to carry for extra protection, for instance after a particularly spicy lunch.  </li>
            <li>It is much easier to feel how clean my teeth are when there isn&#x27;t a huge pile of foam in the way.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s very gentle on the teeth and get&#x27;s them clean.</li>
            <li>I really like it!!</li>
            <li>First time I don&#x27;t feel the &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; I am using to clean my teeth</li>
            <li>SLS toothpaste is fine, but does this company not realize they&#x27;re gentle surfactants they can use in their products?</li>
            <li>I love that it comes in a 7 ounce tube, and that the opening in the top is smaller, so you never dispense too much and waste the higher priced better product you are paying good money to use.  </li>
            <li>I use this and the CloSYS mouthwash together and it keeps my mouth minty fresh.  </li>
            <li>This is my personal review from properlyprepped.com where I post a more detailed review: Two in our family suffer with gingivitis.</li>
            <li>A few more options with Cloralstan (chlorine dioxide) would be nice, perhaps something that might appeal to kids.</li>
            <li>but I guess its worth it.</li>
            <li>This is such a nice product.  </li>
            <li>That would be worth 2 stars.</li>
            <li>mouth just feels so fresh after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth it to me.</li>
            <li>Has worked better than sensitive toothpaste for me</li>
            <li>This has fluoride, a fresh taste and NO SLS.  </li>
            <li>the results are worth it.  </li>
            <li>And let&#x27;s face it, we all want fresh breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Verve Ultra Fresh Mint toothpaste is the closest to what I am looking for.  </li>
            <li>It is the only sulfate free toothpaste that I have been able to find on the market.</li>
            <li>Have used another popular brand for years but this will be my regular toothpaste from now on.</li>
            <li>This, in combination with the mouth wash are worth the price.  </li>
            <li>The natural brands that are using peppermint oil and baking soda to clean teeth taste fine</li>
            <li>I got over the no foam thing pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>He said the tooth buildup is more pronounced in high protein diets, and those type of toothbrushes really do make a difference.  </li>
            <li>Foamer means cleaner right?</li>
            <li>I purchased my products at Walmart (because I wanted them right away) but the price on Amazon is competitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using this toothpaste for a couple months and at my last periodontist exam the dental hygienist saw a great improvement in my gums and teeth in general.  </li>
            <li>Really makes your teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li>Of course most of us usually do anyway, but it&#x27;s nice to not feel like you have to.</li>
            <li>Cool mint) is better than yellow), and floss once each day with a waxed floss (I like Glide Waxed).</li>
            <li>Costco has great sales on the units, but get replacement &#x27;small&#x27; brush heads on Amazon).  </li>
            <li>For me, that made the higher price tag worth</li>
            <li>When you wake up in the morning you don&#x27;t feel like the first thing you have to do is get up and brush your teeth right away.</li>
            <li>They are good for sensitive teeth and change the overall PH in your mouth resulting in fewer cavities.  </li>
            <li>but it just takes a little and a tube lasts a long time!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li>I would have liked it a little stronger but its not bad.  </li>
            <li>My dentist recommended it but seems like pretty pricey toothpaste.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended a pretty severe treatment, but also suggested trying this to stem the tide.  </li>
            <li>I only wish it were cheaper and more concentrated.</li>
            <li>SLS and flouride free and all natural.</li>
            <li>If you end up thinking it&#x27;s meh, put it in the guest bathroom ;)</li>
            <li>The first time I used this toothpaste I didn&#x27;t notice the buildup by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>At first I didnt care for it because it didnt foam up.</li>
            <li>I like the foamy refreshing feeling that a traditional toothpastes give making it at-least feel like its working.  </li>
            <li>It does not foam too much, cleans well, and leaves your mouth smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>This Closys Fluoride Toothpaste is the first one I have found that fits the bill.  </li>
            <li>First time ever I have looked forward to a visit to the dentist.</li>
            <li>and I love the taste of the toothpaste and also the mouthwash and use both daily.  </li>
            <li>The price is the same as what I paid here, but I love the fact that I can get in on Subscribe and Save.</li>
            <li>As other reviewer have said: This is by far the best toothpaste I have used in my entire life.</li>
            <li>Though I&#x27;ve read that 80% of adults would test positive for it, most people don&#x27;t have it significantly enough to realize they have it.</li>
            <li>It is not cloying like so many others and seems to be less sweet.  </li>
            <li>The mild and refreshing flavor of this toothpaste is so much nicer than any other I have tried.</li>
            <li>The taste is ok, but I like how clean it gets my teeth without being harsh.  </li>
            <li>plus squigle, Dr. Collins, and two different dentist only brands but none of them compared to how healthy and clean this brand has kept my teeth.</li>
            <li>Not gritty or salty or too strong tasting.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the clean mint flavor, but I wish there was other flavors to mix things up once in a while.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t understand any of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Apparently, that particular CloSYS is no longer available.  </li>
            <li>The whole family has noticed longer lasting fresh smelling breath, even the snorers who have a problem with fresh breath from mouth-breathing.  </li>
            <li>is hurting as much as helping</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>I used to purchase this when it was fluoride free and a different flavor.</li>
            <li>I will buy again  but will get fluoride free version next time.</li>
            <li>Really.  </li>
            <li>It really does help.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about toothpaste brands.</li>
            <li>; There&#x27;s no unnecessary ingredients and no sulfates, which I believe why it doesn&#x27;t foam very well.</li>
            <li>Too much mint in it for my taste.</li>
            <li>When used in combination with the mouthwash it leaves me with a very refreshed feeling.</li>
            <li>It seems to really kill off the morning breath germs.</li>
            <li>Wish I could continue using it, but the taste bud issue is too much.</li>
            <li>CloSYS also leaves my mouth feeling very refreshed post brushing.</li>
            <li>When Rembrandt Gentle went off the market</li>
            <li>This really took care of my breath issues.  </li>
            <li>The mouthwash also works but only in conjunction with the toothpaste; however, he has found that using the toothpaste and Listerine regularly is just as effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m waiting to see if my check up is better like other reviewers..</li>
            <li>For this price, I won&#x27;t be buying my CloSYS toothpaste anywhere other than on Amazon :)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have extra foam in the toothpaste but my teeth and breath feel glossy clean after brushing.  </li>
            <li>High fluoride toothpastes usually have something gross about them that keeps me from wanting to use them, but this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toothpaste if you are concerned about keeping your teeth as clean as possible.</li>
            <li>I contacted the maker, and you can unscrew the whole cap, like you normally do.  </li>
            <li>that is less potent in the mornings.</li>
            <li>I put CloSYS Fluoride Toothpaste in my top 3 with Colgate Total and Listerine Essential Care.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely more expensive than most brands</li>
            <li>Just want to aware everyone, if you go to Walgreen where they sell this, they have a Walgreens brand, I compared active/inactive ingredients, exactly the same.</li>
            <li>but they are steadily disappearing.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend CloSYS toothpaste for anyone that has a problem with tartar build up and gum disease.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toothpaste to anyone that has a problem with them.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.  </li>
            <li>Our dental hygienist highly recommends this brand.</li>
            <li>It leaves my mouth fresh and clean with little to no plaque build-up.</li>
            <li>The effects a little better then the store bought toothpaste</li>
            <li>It leaves a fresh, clean taste that is long lasting and has no obnoxious aftertaste.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve even gone back to a different toothpaste and ended up getting ulcers more frequently</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist gave me a sample of this a few years ago and I prefer it better than Sensodyne or Crest.</li>
            <li>So I taped it shut to stop the drying out, and just used it normally.  </li>
            <li>fresh mint flavor , white teeth .</li>
            <li>It is worth the extra $$$..</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s 3 times a normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li>This will not leave that foamy film on your tongue that normal off</li>
            <li>I got some at my local CVS right away.  </li>
            <li>and it seems like i am having many fewer flairs, when I do have one they don&#x27;t last near as long.</li>
            <li>We began searching for a new toothpaste that wasn&#x27;t going to cost an arm and a leg for a teeny amount.</li>
            <li>but we live a lot longer these days</li>
            <li>No sooner would one canker sore start to heal than a new one would begin to appear.</li>
            <li>There are other great toothpastes out there, different strokes for different folks, but for reasons such as reformulations or discontinued unavailability, these are the ones that are working for me.</li>
            <li>I use this toothpaste for one reason: It KILLS BAD BREATH longer and more effectively than all of the others.</li>
            <li>She was surprised I had found it on my own as it is not one of your typical big brand name toothpastes.</li>
            <li>I also appreciate how long it keeps my breath fresh.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using CloSYS Flouride Toothpaste ever since it was first offered to the public.</li>
            <li>My checkups are uneventful, and my mouth maintains that fresh feeling all day long.</li>
            <li>This is pretty standard toothpaste.</li>
            <li>have ordered this product in the past, and I am 99% sure it used to have a safety seal under the cap.  </li>
            <li>Instead of finding an answer to this question, they overnighted me another one, and required me to send back the first one for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>if no improvement we will have to go to the next step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After considering several options, I choose to use both the rinse and the toothpaste to see if it will make a significant difference.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a very big favor and get this paste and a SoniCare Diamond Clean Toothbrush (only use the small-head brush).</li>
            <li>I clean it very carefully, to get any buildup off the lid area</li>
            <li>The hubby has a clean, fresh mouth and no more pain or salt rinsing, or orajel, just to have dinner!</li>
            <li>Long story short, the price is worth it!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and this toothpaste works well for me.</li>
            <li>I like this toothpaste because it doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive like colgate and crest brands were.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a toothpaste without the foaming agent because I suspected that was causing my frequent mouth sores.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until a few years ago that my dentist told me to use SLS free toothpaste.</li>
            <li>that joke sensodyne uses to mask sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>My Dentist had suggested this toothpaste and also the mouth wash when I was getting canker sores frequently.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to replace the discontinued Rembrandt Gentle (canker sores) and have been trying several brands for something comparable.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t want to lose my teeth, and I would prefer to avoid deep scaling/planing, if I can help it.</li>
            <li>No chemicals no harsh additives to irritate your gums.</li>
            <li>My mom purchased this toothpaste at considerable expense directly from the dentist and gave it to me.</li>
            <li>I think for people in the same situation, this toothpaste is a reasonable solution.</li>
            <li>I do have quite sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth, and I&#x27;m terrified of the dentist, so this gets me through</li>
            <li>You will really see a difference at your next dental appointment.</li>
            <li>No matter how I cleaned the trays, my breath would still start to smell sulfur-y near the end of the two weeks.  </li>
            <li>They would last for 3-4 days and were an absolute misery.</li>
            <li>The tube is very big, so I feel it is worth the extra price.  </li>
            <li>Some simply do not last for more than a few hours.  </li>
            <li>Although it is expensive compared to most dental products it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It gives you a fresh mouth and keeps it longer than expected.</li>
            <li>Having tired just about every kind of toothpaste you can buy or make at home.</li>
            <li>I like that the product has the taste and smooth texture of regular toothpaste, as I&#x27;m not a fan of gritty textures or strange toothpaste flavors.</li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t help maintain fresh breath as well as some other products (looking at BreathRX).</li>
            <li>price is much higher at my local pharmacies, and my local grocery stores don&#x27;t carry it.</li>
            <li>It does not foam up like other toothpastes, so I do use a bit more than other pastes.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this from a personal point of view, that of having no dental or gum problems since using it.</li>
            <li>It is obviously more pricey than standard store bought paste, but since you only use a little, it will last for a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>and my teeth are almost back to normal.</li>
            <li>It did take a few times to get used to brushing with since it is not a mouth full of foam</li>
            <li>Other toothpastes seem more abrasive, have too much flavor, or leave a residue hard to get off of your tongue</li>
            <li>After using this product regularly,  my gums are very health, and I can be on a standard twice a year dental visits.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other SLS-free toothpastes, and they work just as well for this purpose, but this brand consistently has been the easiest to find.</li>
            <li>but it does not foam like any of the major brands</li>
            <li>All of the major brands do, so I decided to try CloSYS.</li>
            <li>No other toothpaste has performed like this.</li>
            <li>Very little flavor (which I like) and rinses clean and leaves no aftertaste.  </li>
            <li>Prior to using this paste, and on the rare occasion when he has to use something else because he did not have any, his breath invariably would overpower any other toothpaste and mouthwash.</li>
            <li>Great for bad breath.</li>
            <li>My General Practitioner recommended CloSYS.  </li>
            <li>twice daily with an electric or soft bristle manual brush, flossers, and ACT Flouride mouth wash.</li>
            <li>I also wanted something that had fluoride because while I do try to keep things natural and organic as much as possible</li>
            <li>As promised, the toothpaste does not foam and actually reminds me of the old Pearl Drops.</li>
            <li>I am not saying it makes canker sores better, just that it doesn&#x27;t make them worse like sudsing tooth pastes.</li>
            <li>Tastes ok, not great.</li>
            <li>[...] It basically shows in simple time tests with various mouth bacteria loaded in a petri dish with the active Closys ingredients (CLO2) compared to other mouth washes, it kills most of the bacteria, but not all as well.</li>
            <li>It works really well and doesn&#x27;t foam up the way other toothpastes do.</li>
            <li>I wanted something that kept me teeth white as some of the natural brands seemed to create a yellow cast after a month or so of use.  </li>
            <li>It also does not dry out your mouth like the alcohol based products.</li>
            <li>Rinse with Listerine (green (Fresh burst) or blue (</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s dentist had highly recommended this toothpaste for his on-going problem with continued &#x27;dry mouth&#x27;  especially at night time !</li>
            <li>It does not lather up like normal toothpaste but other than that</li>
            <li>This stuff is a little pricier than your normal drug store toothpaste, but the extra few dollars is worth it when I go sit in that dentist chair and know that Im not in for an hour of torture and pain.</li>
            <li>First a little bit goes a long way.  </li>

            <li> This product, is the best I have found for protecting my teeth and mouth from bacteria.</li>
            <li> It is also superb for keeping plaque off the teeth.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste was recommended by my dentist and it is awesome.  </li>
            <li> Pricewise, Amazon has the best deal on both</li>
            <li> However, this toothpaste lacks that entirely- in a very good way.</li>
            <li> Closys is an incredible toothpaste with zero abrasion, yet best cleaning power I have experienced in a toothpaste.</li>

            <li> My dentist recommended it to me and I have been quite happy with it.  </li>
            <li> I think the product would be very effective if you don&#x27;t have the taste bud problem.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with CloSYS and am glad I made the change.</li>
            <li> Leaves a pleasant taste and cleans like baking soda.</li>
            <li> she said it would be good for my gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get overly foamy, not chalky, tastes good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched for good.</li>
            <li> good stuff, recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> good product&lt;</li>
            <li> I bought the toothpaste because I loved the mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> Good, but has just crossed $10 price tag on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Good enamel protection.</li>
            <li> It was priced fairly and arrived promptly and in good condition.</li>
            <li> I have always used and loved this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I have used Sensodyne for years but was recommend CloSYS by my dentist for an option with good fluoride presence.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> It does not taste as good like the brand name toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> A superior toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Leaves the mouth with a good feel.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my mouth feeling very clean and my checkups have been very good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non abrasive ness and yet superb cleaning power is the most amazing and effective combination I have found.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dentist and I am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Clo-sys is great toothpaste, but order from [...] or another reputable place.  </li>
            <li> Anyhoo, I also came to Amazon to get the Closys toothpaste, since CVS doesn&#x27;t carry it, and have been very pleased.  </li>
            <li> In addition to doing an excellent job of cleaning my teath, it leaves a fresh feeling in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> He was right because is the best for the gums.</li>
            <li> I am a retired dentist and feel this is the best toothpaste available, mild taste, has fluoride, no SLS, and is great for breath.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste!  </li>
            <li> more switching toothpastes for me!</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste and easy to order</li>
            <li> using closys toothpaste in combination with a waterpik with periogen has saved my teeth and made visits to my dentist much more pleasant.</li>
            <li> The bottles are huge and at a great price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but it&#x27;s a great sulfate free toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that I have exceptionally good smelling breath without smelling like a mint factory.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find a product that still adds fluoride but doesn&#x27;t contain sulfates.</li>
            <li> Nice flavor, not a gel, cleans well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my mucosa as toothpaste containing sodium laurate and/or a whitener.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothpaste, my gums bleed for years from brushing, this toothpaste has totally stopped it, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> After all a smile is priceless :-)</li>
            <li> nice thing about this toothpaste is that it&#x27;s basically &amp;#34;unscented.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I experienced a noticeably more healthy looking and feeling teethe and gums.  </li>
            <li> This one has a nice mint taste.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased and satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Clean teeth and light flavor!!!</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant, minty flavor I enjoy.</li>
            <li> Good mild mint taste!  </li>
            <li> They are healthy &amp; effective.</li>
            <li> Just leaves a cleaner taste in my mouth than more popular brands.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is great for anyone who seems to brush all the time but still has a not so fresh breath.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is the best for sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> For those who got canker sores from Sodium Laurel Sulfate in most popular brands, Closys does just as well without the worry of Canker Sores from the SLS.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best all natural toothpaste</li>
            <li> But my teeth are clean and my gums feel good.</li>
            <li> The taste of mint is mild and pleasant.</li>
            <li> It is surprising that how many toothpastes rely on abrasive ness to clean your teeth .</li>
            <li> That is a foaming agent so no foam is also nice for those with a strong gag reflex.  </li>
            <li> This an excellent Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) free toothpaste that leaves your mouth feeling minty clean and your breath fresh as a spring meadow breeze.  </li>
            <li> If you are going to brush you might as well use something that is going to help you have healthy teeth and gums and good, sweet breath.</li>
            <li> The non-sudsing feature helps prevent my gums and cheeks from flaring up even more during brushing.  </li>
            <li> and I think contain a lot more &#x27;additives&#x27;.</li>
            <li> changed the formula, now tastes and feels more like paste than a refreshing mouth cleaner.</li>
            <li> I thought, well, it can&#x27;t hurt, and it might work better than Listerine, so I&#x27;ll give it a shot.</li>
            <li> :) If anyone you care about has gingivitis, please share this with them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Closys for years &amp; have always been pleased with their products.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and our gums do feel better after using this and the mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> It does not have a super strong minty taste, which is great for me as some toothpastes are too strong tasting for me.</li>
            <li> Love how it makes your teeth feel</li>
            <li> I have an allergy to many toothpastes but can use this one with no problem.</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums have never felt better since I started using Closys.</li>
            <li> Plus, this is a Much better price than Walgreens.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t inflame my mouth or have an overpowering medicinal taste or smell like so many toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> Better check ups, too.  </li>
            <li> Also their mint flavor is not overpowering like many others.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> She said it effects some people more than others.  </li>
            <li> My last cleaning was great, no bleeding, good gum health.</li>
            <li> Pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this product and love it that it&#x27;s made here in the States.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s phenomenal.</li>
            <li> Refreshing.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> PerioBrite products are better, IMO.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste keeps your gums and teeth their healthiest I love it</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I really love the toothpaste...</li>
            <li> A friend of mine told me about this toothpaste, I&#x27;m so glad I listened to him.</li>
            <li> More than meets my expectations</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Others make the inside of my mouth peel and develop sores, this one just keeps my teeth and gums healthy.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this toothpaste mostly because of the reviews.</li>
            <li> It is safer than most in that it does NOT contain Sulfates / Foaming Agents.</li>
            <li> I want to love this stuff, but I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this mouthwash, you can opt not to flavor it as I do, so no lingering taste.</li>
            <li> Always love and trust this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I use to buy this product from my DDS but Amazon had a better price.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find it at CVS or Walgreen&#x27;s any longer, so buy it online</li>
            <li> My dentist also recommended it for healthy mouth atmosphere and to freshen my breath.  </li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me many years ago.</li>
            <li> Recommended to me by a top dentist.  </li>
            <li> I like this mouthwash way better than the stuff you can buy in the stores.</li>
            <li> I thought this was just a gimmick for the dentist to make more money from their patients.</li>
            <li> As a Dental Hygienist, I recommend it to all my patients as it does a fantastic job!</li>
            <li> I have recommended it and just as satisfied as I am are those to whom I recommended Closys.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After searching Amazon reviews for &amp;#34;Crest ProHealth Stains&amp;#34; I came across this toothpaste and mouthwash and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> CloSYS is better than advertised.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> but they do feel healthy and</li>
            <li> Works better than the mouthwash for me, since I brush my Invisilign with it too.</li>
            <li> Although the presence of SLS does nothing to enhance the performance of the product, consumers tend to believe that a product is working better if it produces suds.</li>
            <li> turned to Amazon and after reading many reviews I decided to try CloSYS.</li>
            <li> Alcohol free and non-staining!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best toothpaste that I have used in a long time.  </li>
            <li> It tastes pretty good too.</li>
            <li> Since the rinse also has no alcohol, it is quite easy to swish the product in your mouth for more than the 10 seconds recommended.</li>
            <li> Some people are very sensitive to the foaming agent and I, for one, am happy to have found a product without it.</li>
            <li> love that it is sulfate free.  </li>
            <li> Cleans well and feels great on sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great if you are sensitive to sulphates.</li>
            <li> At 54 years old, that is a great thing to hear....</li>
            <li> The paste is great so far.</li>
            <li> they look so much better and feel so smooth</li>
            <li> And the taste is nice and minty fresh.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this toothpaste at the dentist office, but decided that it would be more convenient when I found it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It was originally recommended to me by my dentist many years ago, and I&#x27;ve used it ever since.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t foam so using it with an electric toothbrush is really easy.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste has a very mild flavor, and I like to use the rinse without the added flavoring.  </li>
            <li> As for the cost, since we have prime and I subscribed and saved, it was the easy choice.</li>
            <li> I love it, my teeth are so clean they squeak.</li>
            <li> Your mouth feels so clean after using this, and I love that it doesn&#x27;t have the foaming agent in it.</li>
            <li> The taste is pleasant and not over-powering and it leaves my breath fresh ready for the day!</li>
            <li> Very Pleased and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> it seems fine.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is fine, I have used it before and like it.  </li>
            <li> The tongue scrapers are light and easy for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But after using it for a week, everything seems fine.</li>
            <li> So we switched to this toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t have that ingredient and it has helped tremendously!</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t say one single good thing about it.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended the mouthwash as being gentle (no alcohol, yet antibacterial), and I liked it so well that I decided to get the toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> The price doesn&#x27;t seem to be justified by the result.</li>
            <li> product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I have used the sodium laurel sulfate free toothpaste for years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a great mouth feel, not gritty, not overly minty.</li>
            <li> She said a lot of their patients that had similar problems with bleeding gums and flossing wasn&#x27;t the issue, they had great results with the cloysys.  </li>
            <li> As an advanced age person, I have some recession and need to have an increased fluoride toothpaste to protection the exposed tooth.  </li>
            <li> This CloSYS type basically feels like your brushing your teeth with some lightly flavored water.</li>
            <li> Amazon provides a great price, especially if you use the subscribe &amp; save program.</li>
            <li> Rembrandt was a great toothpaste for preventing canker sores and whiten the teeth at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The taste is light and minty and my mouth feels so clean all day.</li>
            <li> Sulfates are cheap and make things foam more readily, but who needs that!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste leaves my teeth and breath fresh and clean too!  </li>
            <li> My mouth feels very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I had originally rated it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> and I fell in love after first use.</li>
            <li> It was originally recommended to me by my dentist.  </li>
            <li> My NEW hygienist wanted to know what I was doing to keep my teeth so nice..</li>
            <li> Clean tasting.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels clean and no lye bumps.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t foam AT ALL or clean.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clean at all.</li>
            <li> The POINT of toothpaste is to CLEAN.</li>
            <li> It did not leave a clean tasting mouth, at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like you could get perfectly clean teeth without even brushing.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clean at all.</li>
            <li> I have to clean twice each time, and still doesn&#x27;t wash off any onion or fish breath.</li>
            <li> It says right on the label, in the fine print, of the Crest Pro-Health Rinse, that it may cause surface staining.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about these products.</li>
            <li> Last time I went to the dentist, they skipped the polishing because my teeth looked that good - I had been using this toothpaste for 6 months.</li>
            <li> It tastes good, low foaming &#x3D;</li>
            <li> no sulfates, cleans my mouth well as in glossy shiny, white teeth, and good breath.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind so much, but I do feel like I have to use more of it in general.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non-foaming, which I really like, and gives my mouth a very clean taste.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my mouth with a fresh and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Recommended by dentist and it leaves your mouth fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, this toothpaste does nothing for a clean fresh mouth feeling.</li>
            <li> It leave you with a clean, fresh breath</li>
            <li> So the big tube lasts many many months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a mild minty taste.  </li>
            <li> I combine this with gel-kam for my &#x27;super teeth maintenance routine&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> The oral spray is great to carry for extra protection, for instance after a particularly spicy lunch.  </li>
            <li> It is much easier to feel how clean my teeth are when there isn&#x27;t a huge pile of foam in the way.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s very gentle on the teeth and get&#x27;s them clean.</li>
            <li> I really like it!!</li>
            <li> First time I don&#x27;t feel the &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; I am using to clean my teeth</li>
            <li> SLS toothpaste is fine, but does this company not realize they&#x27;re gentle surfactants they can use in their products?</li>
            <li> I love that it comes in a 7 ounce tube, and that the opening in the top is smaller, so you never dispense too much and waste the higher priced better product you are paying good money to use.  </li>
            <li> I use this and the CloSYS mouthwash together and it keeps my mouth minty fresh.  </li>
            <li> This is my personal review from properlyprepped.com where I post a more detailed review: Two in our family suffer with gingivitis.</li>
            <li> A few more options with Cloralstan (chlorine dioxide) would be nice, perhaps something that might appeal to kids.</li>
            <li> but I guess its worth it.</li>
            <li> This is such a nice product.  </li>
            <li> That would be worth 2 stars.</li>
            <li> mouth just feels so fresh after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Has worked better than sensitive toothpaste for me</li>
            <li> This has fluoride, a fresh taste and NO SLS.  </li>
            <li> the results are worth it.  </li>
            <li> And let&#x27;s face it, we all want fresh breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Verve Ultra Fresh Mint toothpaste is the closest to what I am looking for.  </li>
            <li> It is the only sulfate free toothpaste that I have been able to find on the market.</li>
            <li> Have used another popular brand for years but this will be my regular toothpaste from now on.</li>
            <li> This, in combination with the mouth wash are worth the price.  </li>
            <li> The natural brands that are using peppermint oil and baking soda to clean teeth taste fine</li>
            <li> I got over the no foam thing pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> He said the tooth buildup is more pronounced in high protein diets, and those type of toothbrushes really do make a difference.  </li>
            <li> Foamer means cleaner right?</li>
            <li> I purchased my products at Walmart (because I wanted them right away) but the price on Amazon is competitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste for a couple months and at my last periodontist exam the dental hygienist saw a great improvement in my gums and teeth in general.  </li>
            <li> Really makes your teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li> Of course most of us usually do anyway, but it&#x27;s nice to not feel like you have to.</li>
            <li> Cool mint) is better than yellow), and floss once each day with a waxed floss (I like Glide Waxed).</li>
            <li> Costco has great sales on the units, but get replacement &#x27;small&#x27; brush heads on Amazon).  </li>
            <li> For me, that made the higher price tag worth</li>
            <li> When you wake up in the morning you don&#x27;t feel like the first thing you have to do is get up and brush your teeth right away.</li>
            <li> They are good for sensitive teeth and change the overall PH in your mouth resulting in fewer cavities.  </li>
            <li> but it just takes a little and a tube lasts a long time!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> I would have liked it a little stronger but its not bad.  </li>
            <li> My dentist recommended it but seems like pretty pricey toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended a pretty severe treatment, but also suggested trying this to stem the tide.  </li>
            <li> I only wish it were cheaper and more concentrated.</li>
            <li> SLS and flouride free and all natural.</li>
            <li> If you end up thinking it&#x27;s meh, put it in the guest bathroom ;)</li>
            <li> The first time I used this toothpaste I didn&#x27;t notice the buildup by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> At first I didnt care for it because it didnt foam up.</li>
            <li> I like the foamy refreshing feeling that a traditional toothpastes give making it at-least feel like its working.  </li>
            <li> It does not foam too much, cleans well, and leaves your mouth smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> This Closys Fluoride Toothpaste is the first one I have found that fits the bill.  </li>
            <li> First time ever I have looked forward to a visit to the dentist.</li>
            <li> and I love the taste of the toothpaste and also the mouthwash and use both daily.  </li>
            <li> The price is the same as what I paid here, but I love the fact that I can get in on Subscribe and Save.</li>
            <li> As other reviewer have said: This is by far the best toothpaste I have used in my entire life.</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;ve read that 80% of adults would test positive for it, most people don&#x27;t have it significantly enough to realize they have it.</li>
            <li> It is not cloying like so many others and seems to be less sweet.  </li>
            <li> The mild and refreshing flavor of this toothpaste is so much nicer than any other I have tried.</li>
            <li> The taste is ok, but I like how clean it gets my teeth without being harsh.  </li>
            <li> plus squigle, Dr. Collins, and two different dentist only brands but none of them compared to how healthy and clean this brand has kept my teeth.</li>
            <li> Not gritty or salty or too strong tasting.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the clean mint flavor, but I wish there was other flavors to mix things up once in a while.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t understand any of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Apparently, that particular CloSYS is no longer available.  </li>
            <li> The whole family has noticed longer lasting fresh smelling breath, even the snorers who have a problem with fresh breath from mouth-breathing.  </li>
            <li> is hurting as much as helping</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste works very well for me.  </li>
            <li> I used to purchase this when it was fluoride free and a different flavor.</li>
            <li> I will buy again  but will get fluoride free version next time.</li>
            <li> Really.  </li>
            <li> It really does help.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about toothpaste brands.</li>
            <li> ; There&#x27;s no unnecessary ingredients and no sulfates, which I believe why it doesn&#x27;t foam very well.</li>
            <li> Too much mint in it for my taste.</li>
            <li> When used in combination with the mouthwash it leaves me with a very refreshed feeling.</li>
            <li> It seems to really kill off the morning breath germs.</li>
            <li> Wish I could continue using it, but the taste bud issue is too much.</li>
            <li> CloSYS also leaves my mouth feeling very refreshed post brushing.</li>
            <li> When Rembrandt Gentle went off the market</li>
            <li> This really took care of my breath issues.  </li>
            <li> The mouthwash also works but only in conjunction with the toothpaste; however, he has found that using the toothpaste and Listerine regularly is just as effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m waiting to see if my check up is better like other reviewers..</li>
            <li> For this price, I won&#x27;t be buying my CloSYS toothpaste anywhere other than on Amazon :)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have extra foam in the toothpaste but my teeth and breath feel glossy clean after brushing.  </li>
            <li> High fluoride toothpastes usually have something gross about them that keeps me from wanting to use them, but this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothpaste if you are concerned about keeping your teeth as clean as possible.</li>
            <li> I contacted the maker, and you can unscrew the whole cap, like you normally do.  </li>
            <li> that is less potent in the mornings.</li>
            <li> I put CloSYS Fluoride Toothpaste in my top 3 with Colgate Total and Listerine Essential Care.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely more expensive than most brands</li>
            <li> Just want to aware everyone, if you go to Walgreen where they sell this, they have a Walgreens brand, I compared active/inactive ingredients, exactly the same.</li>
            <li> but they are steadily disappearing.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend CloSYS toothpaste for anyone that has a problem with tartar build up and gum disease.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothpaste to anyone that has a problem with them.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.  </li>
            <li> Our dental hygienist highly recommends this brand.</li>
            <li> It leaves my mouth fresh and clean with little to no plaque build-up.</li>
            <li> The effects a little better then the store bought toothpaste</li>
            <li> It leaves a fresh, clean taste that is long lasting and has no obnoxious aftertaste.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve even gone back to a different toothpaste and ended up getting ulcers more frequently</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist gave me a sample of this a few years ago and I prefer it better than Sensodyne or Crest.</li>
            <li> So I taped it shut to stop the drying out, and just used it normally.  </li>
            <li> fresh mint flavor , white teeth .</li>
            <li> It is worth the extra $$$..</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s 3 times a normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This will not leave that foamy film on your tongue that normal off</li>
            <li> I got some at my local CVS right away.  </li>
            <li> and it seems like i am having many fewer flairs, when I do have one they don&#x27;t last near as long.</li>
            <li> We began searching for a new toothpaste that wasn&#x27;t going to cost an arm and a leg for a teeny amount.</li>
            <li> but we live a lot longer these days</li>
            <li> No sooner would one canker sore start to heal than a new one would begin to appear.</li>
            <li> There are other great toothpastes out there, different strokes for different folks, but for reasons such as reformulations or discontinued unavailability, these are the ones that are working for me.</li>
            <li> I use this toothpaste for one reason: It KILLS BAD BREATH longer and more effectively than all of the others.</li>
            <li> She was surprised I had found it on my own as it is not one of your typical big brand name toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I also appreciate how long it keeps my breath fresh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using CloSYS Flouride Toothpaste ever since it was first offered to the public.</li>
            <li> My checkups are uneventful, and my mouth maintains that fresh feeling all day long.</li>
            <li> This is pretty standard toothpaste.</li>
            <li> have ordered this product in the past, and I am 99% sure it used to have a safety seal under the cap.  </li>
            <li> Instead of finding an answer to this question, they overnighted me another one, and required me to send back the first one for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> if no improvement we will have to go to the next step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After considering several options, I choose to use both the rinse and the toothpaste to see if it will make a significant difference.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a very big favor and get this paste and a SoniCare Diamond Clean Toothbrush (only use the small-head brush).</li>
            <li> I clean it very carefully, to get any buildup off the lid area</li>
            <li> The hubby has a clean, fresh mouth and no more pain or salt rinsing, or orajel, just to have dinner!</li>
            <li> Long story short, the price is worth it!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and this toothpaste works well for me.</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste because it doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive like colgate and crest brands were.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a toothpaste without the foaming agent because I suspected that was causing my frequent mouth sores.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until a few years ago that my dentist told me to use SLS free toothpaste.</li>
            <li> that joke sensodyne uses to mask sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> My Dentist had suggested this toothpaste and also the mouth wash when I was getting canker sores frequently.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to replace the discontinued Rembrandt Gentle (canker sores) and have been trying several brands for something comparable.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t want to lose my teeth, and I would prefer to avoid deep scaling/planing, if I can help it.</li>
            <li> No chemicals no harsh additives to irritate your gums.</li>
            <li> My mom purchased this toothpaste at considerable expense directly from the dentist and gave it to me.</li>
            <li> I think for people in the same situation, this toothpaste is a reasonable solution.</li>
            <li> I do have quite sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth, and I&#x27;m terrified of the dentist, so this gets me through</li>
            <li> You will really see a difference at your next dental appointment.</li>
            <li> No matter how I cleaned the trays, my breath would still start to smell sulfur-y near the end of the two weeks.  </li>
            <li> They would last for 3-4 days and were an absolute misery.</li>
            <li> The tube is very big, so I feel it is worth the extra price.  </li>
            <li> Some simply do not last for more than a few hours.  </li>
            <li> Although it is expensive compared to most dental products it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It gives you a fresh mouth and keeps it longer than expected.</li>
            <li> Having tired just about every kind of toothpaste you can buy or make at home.</li>
            <li> I like that the product has the taste and smooth texture of regular toothpaste, as I&#x27;m not a fan of gritty textures or strange toothpaste flavors.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t help maintain fresh breath as well as some other products (looking at BreathRX).</li>
            <li> price is much higher at my local pharmacies, and my local grocery stores don&#x27;t carry it.</li>
            <li> It does not foam up like other toothpastes, so I do use a bit more than other pastes.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this from a personal point of view, that of having no dental or gum problems since using it.</li>
            <li> It is obviously more pricey than standard store bought paste, but since you only use a little, it will last for a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> and my teeth are almost back to normal.</li>
            <li> It did take a few times to get used to brushing with since it is not a mouth full of foam</li>
            <li> Other toothpastes seem more abrasive, have too much flavor, or leave a residue hard to get off of your tongue</li>
            <li> After using this product regularly,  my gums are very health, and I can be on a standard twice a year dental visits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other SLS-free toothpastes, and they work just as well for this purpose, but this brand consistently has been the easiest to find.</li>
            <li> but it does not foam like any of the major brands</li>
            <li> All of the major brands do, so I decided to try CloSYS.</li>
            <li> No other toothpaste has performed like this.</li>
            <li> Very little flavor (which I like) and rinses clean and leaves no aftertaste.  </li>
            <li> Prior to using this paste, and on the rare occasion when he has to use something else because he did not have any, his breath invariably would overpower any other toothpaste and mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Great for bad breath.</li>
            <li> My General Practitioner recommended CloSYS.  </li>
            <li> twice daily with an electric or soft bristle manual brush, flossers, and ACT Flouride mouth wash.</li>
            <li> I also wanted something that had fluoride because while I do try to keep things natural and organic as much as possible</li>
            <li> As promised, the toothpaste does not foam and actually reminds me of the old Pearl Drops.</li>
            <li> I am not saying it makes canker sores better, just that it doesn&#x27;t make them worse like sudsing tooth pastes.</li>
            <li> Tastes ok, not great.</li>
            <li> [...] It basically shows in simple time tests with various mouth bacteria loaded in a petri dish with the active Closys ingredients (CLO2) compared to other mouth washes, it kills most of the bacteria, but not all as well.</li>
            <li> It works really well and doesn&#x27;t foam up the way other toothpastes do.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that kept me teeth white as some of the natural brands seemed to create a yellow cast after a month or so of use.  </li>
            <li> It also does not dry out your mouth like the alcohol based products.</li>
            <li> Rinse with Listerine (green (Fresh burst) or blue (</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s dentist had highly recommended this toothpaste for his on-going problem with continued &#x27;dry mouth&#x27;  especially at night time !</li>
            <li> It does not lather up like normal toothpaste but other than that</li>
            <li> This stuff is a little pricier than your normal drug store toothpaste, but the extra few dollars is worth it when I go sit in that dentist chair and know that Im not in for an hour of torture and pain.</li>
            <li> First a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> When used with the CloSYS rinse and a dedicated program of daily oral hygiene you will feel you have had your teeth cleaned everyday by the dental hygienist - slick and squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> It a little weird to use, it kind of dries up in the mouth almost like your not using enough.</li>
            <li> The tube last a long time..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the few extra bucks to know my breath doesn&#x27;t smell like toxic waste.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel cleaner and less sensitive too.  </li>
            <li> I get cavities frequently, but have gotten a lot less using Closys products as our dentist recommended.  </li>
            <li> I am prone to canker sores (inner mouth sore), and normal toothpastes have SLS, a foaming agent that correlates with increased canker incidence, at least in me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a careful brusher all my life, but produce a lot of tartar, and I&#x27;ve tried lots of different toothpastes and toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> By the end of the day they feel rough and gross.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of getting used to as there aren&#x27;t any suds, but if it keeps me from having canker sores, I will be using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> Closys also has different ingredients than other toothpaste and mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go back to ordering from my other sources.  </li>
            <li> My husband had virtually constant problems with canker sores from other toothpastes with sulfate in them.</li>
            <li> a very long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This toothpaste doesn&#x27;t produce any foam, which makes it difficult to clean tooth surfaces.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t prevent the mouth sores, but when you get them, apparently the bubbles from normal toothpaste makes them worse.  </li>
            <li> The mouth rinse has very little taste--so far I don&#x27;t see any need to use the flavor supplement that comes with it.</li>
            <li> Many of their products have very scary reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Levels of overall tartar and plaque were way down.</li>
            <li> I mean big ones at the same time in multiple places.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t go back to any other toothpaste!  </li>
            <li> Avoid &#x27;Triclosan&#x27;, sand, &#x27;Tartar Control&#x27;, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, hard &amp; medium bristles, large and odd shaped brush-heads, and any toothpaste or floss, or brushes on sale at a store.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> thing about using this toothpaste is that when you wake up in the morning, you don&#x27;t get the dry mouth/morning dragon breath!</li>
            <li> In the nine months since using this product I&#x27;ve only gotten an occasional sore, usually from accidentally biting the inside of my cheek.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t seem to feel sensitive to hot and cold liquids.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 20 minutes since I&#x27;ve brushed, and I still have a odd metal taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is a pretty nasty chemical found in household cleaning products, laundry detergents, shampoo, toothpaste, and more.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for 4 weeks and my gums became very dry.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day its a solid product, albeit a little niche.</li>
            <li> CloSYS kills bad breath better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried and it does so for hours.</li>
            <li> This stuff kills the bad breath germs for many hours.</li>
            <li> I used this product for about a month and even after brushing after every meal and making sure I flossed and used a tongue cleaner, bad breathe would return in about an hour after use.</li>
            <li> If I use regular toothpaste, I get a canker at least a couple times a month, and it lasts a week, so I&#x27;m in nearly constant low-level pain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my teeth and the overall health of my gums after just a few weeks use.</li>
            <li> A few months ago, I suddenly began having recurring outbreaks of canker sores.</li>
            <li> A bit expensive, but since only a little toothpaste is necessary, a tube lasts a long time, and so I doubt it is any more expensive than other pastes.  </li>
            <li> If you really hate the harsh Alcohol taste in conventional dental products, then this is a good alternative.</li>
            <li> My mouth just feels clean, not coated in artificial flavorings like it used to.  </li>
            <li> Also, my mouth seems less dry, probably because the Closys toothpaste and rinse don&#x27;t disrupt the ph balance like other products.  </li>
            <li> what if other people don&#x27;t know and need this toothpaste?</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended that we get this toothpaste due to irritation of the gums.  </li>
            <li> But it is cheaper than other Chlorine Dioxided toothpastes like Oxyfresh.</li>
            <li> /&gt;He has tried a number of other brands.  </li>
            <li> Each time you brush, you only need to use a small dollop, about the size of a pea.</li>
            <li> It splatters, where other toothpaste doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Other than that issue</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether I&#x27;ll order a next one.</li>
            <li> I cannot stand any other toothpastes now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never use any other toothpaste again.</li>
            <li> Along with the other measures told to me by the dentist, my condition has improved.&lt;br</li>
            <li> will not change this product for any other.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not abrasive at all (some grit but definately not too abrasive compared to other toothpastes).  </li>
            <li> Found to be intolerable due to it altering my taste buds.  </li>
            <li> I have had Invisilign and other oral implements for TMJ for years now.  </li>
            <li> But the important factor is it takes away the bad breath cause by combination of medications.</li>
            <li> I saw an article about SLS (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate), a common chemical agent used in soaps, shampoos, toothpaste and numerous cleaning products.</li>
            <li> The stains on the back of my teeth caused by prohealth is slowly disappearing but the stains on the front of my teeth are basically gone.</li>
            <li> It cleans well and does not have the soapy, foamy, stuff that can get down your throat.  </li>
            <li> Our family will never use any other toothpaste, and I am so grateful that my friend told me about it!</li>
            <li> I realize that sounds like a commercial line, but I mean it.</li>
            <li> And at my next 6 month cleaning, no more blood shed!  </li>
            <li> There is only a faint hint of mint flavor and it had no long term effect on my breath.</li>
            <li> Since I started using it, the plaque issue is very minimal!</li>
            <li> I also noticed that it was not as harsh on my teeth as the other brand that I was using.</li>
            <li> and I hardly ever have canker sores (something I used to get a few times a yr when I used regular foaming toothpaste).  </li>
            <li> Since I switched to a chlorine dioxide regimen like Closys, I also have less build-up between dentist visits.</li>
            <li> seems like typical toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> and if you get canker sores or herpetic lesions on your lips you will get much less (if any) while using this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> As a Prime member, this price is $5.00 less than at our dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> This was recommended by my hygienist at my previous dentist.</li>
            <li> After using less than 1/2 a tube of this product I had to dispose of it.</li>
            <li> And not as expensive as the &#x27;professional&#x27; Colgate brand the dentist sells.</li>
            <li> My hygentist turned me on to this brand a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it on here because it was not available in my city.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste for a few years now</li>
            <li> Using this toothpaste was hard to get used to because it doesn&#x27;t foam up like other toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> My husband gets terrible mouth ulcers and we read that a certain ingredient (can&#x27;t remember at the moment) in normal toothpaste can cause them.</li>
            <li> Have tried both the plain and mint flavor and favor the latter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a new patient at a dentist office and after years of fighting with other hygentists who thought I was lying about flossing because my gums would bleed so bad during a cleaning, she suggest I give this a try.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint here is the quality control, and the unnecessary steps taken in my transaction with Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I usually get mouth sores and sometimes irritation from dental products, but not Closys.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;m not sure if I already reviewed this product??</li>
            <li> Now, no more puffy, swollen gums.  </li>
            <li> No more bleeding when I floss.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure I like it.</li>
            <li> Not sure I will keep using because its a tad runny when working with my Oral B electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> NO MORE CANKER SORES, since using this paste.</li>
            <li> I have been experimenting with toothpastes for the past year.  </li>
            <li> The container itself is difficult to open.  </li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this product and I have been using it for the past six months.  </li>
            <li> There are some small spots in corners and between my teeth still</li>
            <li> This toothpaste does the job,  Yes, it is expensive compared to regular brands, but it does offer and advantage.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste keeps them from being angered (as I usually explain it) and the sores can go away MUCH quicker.</li>
            <li> It is almost impossible to find adult type toothpaste OTC per say.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> It seems to make my breath fresher, but this toothpaste SUCKS at cleaning.</li>
            <li> After several months of this, I went on a desperate search for answers as to why these repeated outbreaks were occurring.</li>
            <li> Thy looked worse, not better.</li>
            <li> little expensive.</li>
            <li> While my three months are not up yet I do think that these two products are helping--I have less and less bleeding at that bad site with continued use.</li>
            <li> This is the only brand that he has found that does not affect taste but keeps bad breathe at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I have such bad teeth, always a cap, filling or a crown....</li>
            <li> Sometimes the ingredients in our common toothpaste make our breath worse.</li>
            <li> So, to the folks who complained about the lack of foam with this toothpaste: that&#x27;s the point!</li>
            <li> An expensive tooth paste that  has not shown to cure my excessive saliva problem and will be discontinued.</li>
            <li> One day, I was telling a friend about the ones in my family who suffer with this and how frustrating it is</li>
            <li> I have suffered from terrible mouth sores for my whole life.</li>
            <li> Plus it doesn&#x27;t have SLS in it which was really irritating my gums.</li>
            <li> No alcohol which can be irritating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of other products for bad breath but none even begin to compare with CloSYS.</li>
            <li> i will recommended to anyone who is very serious with dental hygiene</li>
            <li> so I was afraid switching from Sensodyne would be hard on my teeth</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> That means a plug of toothpaste inside the neck of the cap dries out and you have to dig it out, or squeeze it (and a lot of toothpaste behind it!)</li>
            <li> This stuff is weird.  </li>
            <li> Scary, because it makes swallowing difficult.  </li>
            <li> Worst of all, it is vastly overpriced.</li>
            <li> CloSYS is an expensive toothpaste, but once I started using it the canker</li>
            <li> my teeth became horribly stained brown / black.</li>
            <li> Wrong!  </li>
            <li> Others can control his breath but the sacrifice is that all food tastes unpleasant and medicine-like.</li>
            <li> Helps me with bad breath</li>
            <li> The taste is  not too bad either.</li>
            <li> Before using it, I always had bad plaque build up between cleanings.</li>
            <li> I suffered from bad breath for some time.</li>
            <li> However the results were that my bad breath subsided.</li>
            <li> It solved the problem of having a bad breath.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I worry that I may have bad breath.  </li>
            <li> I feel who ever buys this will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I used the prohealth for 1 month before I noticed (stupid me).</li>
            <li> But badly engineered container!  </li>
            <li> It can be truly miserable when flared up.  </li>
            <li> and I get a disgusting film on my gums and cheeks.</li>
            <li> I started using the Crest Pro-Health rinse to kill bacteria, and found it was causing terrible staining.  </li>
            <li> I thought I had a terrible disease!  </li>
            <li> This helps in the prevention of those awful mouth sores.</li>

            <li> My dentist recomended this paste after all of the Canker Sores I get from acidic foods.  The non-sudsing feature helps prevent my gums and cheeks from flaring up even more during brushing.  Definately start using this stuff instead of sudsing toothpaste if you have any mouth cuts. I am not saying it makes canker sores better, just that it doesn&#x27;t make them worse like sudsing tooth pastes.</li>
            <li> Very little flavor (which I like) and rinses clean and leaves no aftertaste.  My dentist recommended the mouthwash as being gentle (no alcohol, yet antibacterial), and I liked it so well that I decided to get the toothpaste.  Have been using for 2 years; tried others for a change of pace now and then, but always go back to Closys.  Other toothpastes seem more abrasive, have too much flavor, or leave a residue hard to get off of your tongue and I think contain a lot more &#x27;additives&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I use this and the CloSYS mouthwash together and it keeps my mouth minty fresh.  Won&#x27;t go back to regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> changed the formula, now tastes and feels more like paste than a refreshing mouth cleaner.</li>
            <li> Dentist recommended.  It is a god toothpaste.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t run out and buy it unless your dentist recommends it.</li>
            <li> This is my personal review from properlyprepped.com where I post a more detailed review: Two in our family suffer with gingivitis. Though I&#x27;ve read that 80% of adults would test positive for it, most people don&#x27;t have it significantly enough to realize they have it. It can be truly miserable when flared up.  One day, I was telling a friend about the ones in my family who suffer with this and how frustrating it is and she told me that her dentist had told them about a product called Closys. I immediately searched it out online and, though I found the product and tons of favorable reviews, no one mentioned that it kills gingivitis. I thought, well, it can&#x27;t hurt, and it might work better than Listerine, so I&#x27;ll give it a shot. I bought some of the toothpaste and the mouthwash. The way it was described to me and seems to sum it all up is this: It&#x27;s like hand sanitizer for your mouth but with out the burn! We all started using it! Closys also has different ingredients than other toothpaste and mouthwash.  Ever since we started using this toothpaste, there have been NO!...flare-ups. NONE! The whole family has noticed longer lasting fresh smelling breath, even the snorers who have a problem with fresh breath from mouth-breathing.  Our family will never use any other toothpaste, and I am so grateful that my friend told me about it! So then I thought...what if other people don&#x27;t know and need this toothpaste? I should share this!...so...now I have. :) If anyone you care about has gingivitis, please share this with them. Unless they already know about this product, they will thank you, I promise!hare this with them. Unless they already know about this product, they will thank you, I promise!</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste for teeth and gum health.  The tube is very big, so I feel it is worth the extra price.  I really like it!!</li>
            <li> I do not like this toothpaste but purchased it for my son who always uses it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Closys for years &amp; have always been pleased with their products. They are healthy &amp; effective. There are only needed ingredients &amp; no extra chemicals thrown in. This value is good &amp; delivery superb.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothpaste that I have used in a long time.  It makes your mouth feel like you just visited the dentist for a cleaning.</li>
            <li> This product is the best toothpaste I have ever used. I have problems with mouth sores caused by toothpastes and have tried just about every brand that claims to help. This is the only toothpaste that actually works. I also use their mouthwash product. Between the two I have improved my overall tooth and gum health. I also love the fact that I have exceptionally good smelling breath without smelling like a mint factory.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothpaste in October and received 2 (as stated) for $10.99.  This time I received 1 ?!?!?  Whats up with that???</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste for a couple months and at my last periodontist exam the dental hygienist saw a great improvement in my gums and teeth in general.  I highly recommend CloSYS toothpaste for anyone that has a problem with tartar build up and gum disease.</li>
            <li> Leaves my mouth with a fresh and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended it but seems like pretty pricey toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from terrible mouth sores for my whole life. Nothing has ever worked until I found Closys. I realize that sounds like a commercial line, but I mean it. It doesn&#x27;t prevent the mouth sores, but when you get them, apparently the bubbles from normal toothpaste makes them worse.  This toothpaste keeps them from being angered (as I usually explain it) and the sores can go away MUCH quicker.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended that we get this toothpaste due to irritation of the gums.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and our gums do feel better after using this and the mouthwash.  It does not have a super strong minty taste, which is great for me as some toothpastes are too strong tasting for me.</li>
            <li> About 10 years ago I was lax with my flossing and acquired severe gingivitis.  My dentist recommended a pretty severe treatment, but also suggested trying this to stem the tide.  It worked like a charm!  I did not need further treatments and I have had virtually no dental problems since.  I also use the rinse every day.</li>
            <li> When used with the CloSYS rinse and a dedicated program of daily oral hygiene you will feel you have had your teeth cleaned everyday by the dental hygienist - slick and squeaky clean. Recommended by my dentist as part of an oral ph program.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this toothpaste.  And not as expensive as the &#x27;professional&#x27; Colgate brand the dentist sells.</li>
            <li> Love how it makes your teeth feel like you just got your teeth cleaned</li>
            <li> First time I don&#x27;t feel the &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; I am using to clean my teeth is hurting as much as helping</li>
            <li> This toothpaste doesn&#x27;t produce any foam, which makes it difficult to clean tooth surfaces. I also feel some tooth sensitivity after using this. The price doesn&#x27;t seem to be justified by the result. I had to switch to my regular toothpaste before even finishing this one.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste!  Highly recommend. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste does not contain sodium lauryl sulfate (sp?). Any toothpaste  that does makes my mouth feel pasty and I get a disgusting film on my gums and cheeks. I have been using Closys for years to avoid that problem and have a healthier mouth.  Since I switched to a chlorine dioxide regimen like Closys, I also have less build-up between dentist visits. I only wish it were cheaper and more concentrated. But it is cheaper than other Chlorine Dioxided toothpastes like Oxyfresh. I wish it came in an unflavored version.</li>
            <li> As other reviewer have said: This is by far the best toothpaste I have used in my entire life. It&#x27;s non abrasive ness and yet superb cleaning power is the most amazing and effective combination I have found. It is surprising that how many toothpastes rely on abrasive ness to clean your teeth . (Crest pro health is one case in point). But over time those toothpastes damage your tooth enamel. Closys is an incredible toothpaste with zero abrasion, yet best cleaning power I have experienced in a toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste works very well for me.  I have an allergy to many toothpastes but can use this one with no problem. It cleans well and does not have the soapy, foamy, stuff that can get down your throat.  I have used it now for a number of years.</li>
            <li> I will buy this from now on. I use this and another more expensive toothpaste to strengthen enamel. I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my teeth and the overall health of my gums after just a few weeks use. It tastes pretty good too.</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums have never felt better since I started using Closys. I also use their mouthwash, and I recommend using them both.</li>
            <li> Having tired just about every kind of toothpaste you can buy or make at home. I put CloSYS Fluoride Toothpaste in my top 3 with Colgate Total and Listerine Essential Care. There are other great toothpastes out there, different strokes for different folks, but for reasons such as reformulations or discontinued unavailability, these are the ones that are working for me. I really enjoy the clean mint flavor, but I wish there was other flavors to mix things up once in a while. A few more options with Cloralstan (chlorine dioxide) would be nice, perhaps something that might appeal to kids. CloSYS kills bad breath better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried and it does so for hours. With that said however the only cons I can find is the cost.</li>
            <li> My gums had been bleeding, so my dentist suggested Closys...and it works !!!  The no alchohol rinse is wonderful too. I usually get mouth sores and sometimes irritation from dental products, but not Closys.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about these products.</li>
            <li> My husband gets terrible mouth ulcers and we read that a certain ingredient (can&#x27;t remember at the moment) in normal toothpaste can cause them. So we switched to this toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t have that ingredient and it has helped tremendously! We&#x27;ve even gone back to a different toothpaste and ended up getting ulcers more frequently so we switched back and will stick with this always. Plus, this is a Much better price than Walgreens.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist gave me a sample of this a few years ago and I prefer it better than Sensodyne or Crest.</li>
            <li> my dentist recommend this product for me. she said it would be good for my gums and teeth. I use it with my sonicare gum tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Bummer!!  I used to purchase this when it was fluoride free and a different flavor. I had originally rated it 5 stars. Apparently, that particular CloSYS is no longer available.  I cannot recommend this since I am not in favor of fluoride in my toothpaste.  I am onto JASON&#x27;s toothpaste.  SLS and flouride free and all natural.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get overly foamy, not chalky, tastes good. High fluoride toothpastes usually have something gross about them that keeps me from wanting to use them, but this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> The last time I went to the dentist, she was amazed.  Levels of overall tartar and plaque were way down. The only change I had made was to start using Closys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve been a careful brusher all my life, but produce a lot of tartar, and I&#x27;ve tried lots of different toothpastes and toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;This product is fantastic.  It doesn&#x27;t feel gritty, doesn&#x27;t increase the sensitivity of my teeth, and somehow is reducing my overall tartar and plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is sulfate free.  My dad switched too, after I raved about this, and his issues with gingivitis have been greatly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more switching toothpastes for me!</li>
            <li> My dentist approves. At 74 I&#x27;ve had only 3 cavities. We want to keep it that way!</li>
            <li> Recommended by Dentist. Expensive but I guess its worth it.</li>
            <li> I have only used this toothpaste for a month now and have noticed that my teeth have whitened a bit.  My teeth feel cleaner and less sensitive too.  This was recommended by my dentist and I am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my periodontist. Clean tasting.</li>
            <li> Really makes your teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li> Clo-sys is great toothpaste, but order from [...] or another reputable place.  When I received my order, I put the box aside because I didn&#x27;t need the toothpaste yet.  My mistake.  When I opened it, one of the toothpaste packages had been torn open and re-taped.  Not wanting to risk tampering, I tried to return, but had passed the return window.  Definitely my problem, but I&#x27;ll go back to ordering from my other sources.  Amazon may not be the best place to order healthcare products.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels very fresh and clean. It does not lather up like normal toothpaste but other than that seems like typical toothpaste.  I will buy again  but will get fluoride free version next time.</li>
            <li> This is such a nice product.  But badly engineered container!  How is that possible in 2013?  It doesn&#x27;t inflame my mouth or have an overpowering medicinal taste or smell like so many toothpastes.  Better check ups, too.  So will they please FIX the lid? That would be worth 2 stars. It doesn&#x27;t close.  Really.  I clean it very carefully, to get any buildup off the lid area but it always flops open.  I&#x27;ve tried snugging it against the edge of the drawer.  Nothing works, and tape is too fussy.  That means a plug of toothpaste inside the neck of the cap dries out and you have to dig it out, or squeeze it (and a lot of toothpaste behind it!) out.  I won&#x27;t buy another tube unless I can find another sample size - no problem with that lid.  ADDITIONAL COMMENT.  I contacted the maker, and you can unscrew the whole cap, like you normally do.  So I taped it shut to stop the drying out, and just used it normally.  Appreciate the manufacturer answering my email.</li>
            <li> Great for bad breath.</li>
            <li> I have used the sodium laurel sulfate free toothpaste for years.  I doesn&#x27;t have that foaming agent in it and if you get canker sores or herpetic lesions on your lips you will get much less (if any) while using this toothpaste.  A side effect is it tends t whiten your teeth.  Just saying.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find a product that still adds fluoride but doesn&#x27;t contain sulfates. Sulfates are cheap and make things foam more readily, but who needs that! Also their mint flavor is not overpowering like many others. I&#x27;ve switched for good.</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste. I love that it comes in a 7 ounce tube, and that the opening in the top is smaller, so you never dispense too much and waste the higher priced better product you are paying good money to use.  I use this, their mouth rinse, their toothpaste, and a Sonicecare toothbrush, after talking to my dentist in regard to my low carb/high protein diet. He said the tooth buildup is more pronounced in high protein diets, and those type of toothbrushes really do make a difference.  Back to the Closys info. I did a litttle searching ( I am an Engineer and want test data, not just reviews) and found this report: [...] It basically shows in simple time tests with various mouth bacteria loaded in a petri dish with the active Closys ingredients (CLO2) compared to other mouth washes, it kills most of the bacteria, but not all as well. If you really hate the harsh Alcohol taste in conventional dental products, then this is a good alternative. It also does not dry out your mouth like the alcohol based products.</li>
            <li> Been using the Closys line for a couple of years now and I hardly ever have canker sores (something I used to get a few times a yr when I used regular foaming toothpaste).  I also appreciate how long it keeps my breath fresh.</li>
            <li> I was a longstanding Rembrandt user until I decided to give this a shot. Have not looked back. In fact, I&#x27;m not sure if I already reviewed this product?? For a while I was concerned that Rembrandt Whitening was causing sensitivity and I have not had that experience with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a great mouth feel, not gritty, not overly minty. But my teeth are clean and my gums feel good. I also read a really great review by a dentist for the product and it helped me validate my switch from Rembrandt. Plus the gigantic tube lasts me and my SO a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it twice daily with an electric or soft bristle manual brush, flossers, and ACT Flouride mouth wash.</li>
            <li> As a Prime member, this price is $5.00 less than at our dentist&#x27;s office.  Great toothpaste!</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this toothpaste as part of his brushing routine for over 15 years.  Prior to using this paste, and on the rare occasion when he has to use something else because he did not have any, his breath invariably would overpower any other toothpaste and mouthwash. When brushing with this toothpaste, his breath is always kept under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has tried a number of other brands.  Some simply do not last for more than a few hours.  Others can control his breath but the sacrifice is that all food tastes unpleasant and medicine-like. This is the only brand that he has found that does not affect taste but keeps bad breathe at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has also used the mouthwash and oral spray.  The oral spray is great to carry for extra protection, for instance after a particularly spicy lunch.  The mouthwash also works but only in conjunction with the toothpaste; however, he has found that using the toothpaste and Listerine regularly is just as effective.</li>
            <li> I keep coming back to this toothpaste....mouth just feels so fresh after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely something to buy and try.... If you end up thinking it&#x27;s meh, put it in the guest bathroom ;)</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and this toothpaste works well for me.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste and easy to order</li>
            <li> Dentist recommended we use this toothpaste to prevent gum  disease.  Ever since we have been using this toothpaste we have had excellent reports from our dentist on our gum health.</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste because it doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive like colgate and crest brands were. Plus it doesn&#x27;t have SLS in it which was really irritating my gums. It doesn&#x27;t foam so using it with an electric toothbrush is really easy. The taste is pleasant and not over-powering and it leaves my breath fresh ready for the day!</li>
            <li> Last time I went to the dentist, they skipped the polishing because my teeth looked that good - I had been using this toothpaste for 6 months.</li>
            <li> I was so grateful my dentist recommended this toothpaste to me as I am one of those people with an allergy to sodium lauryl sulfate (in a toothpaste).  It causes cracking on the sides of my mouth and it took forever for me to figure out what the culprit was.  This toothpaste leaves my teeth and breath fresh and clean too!  It&#x27;s definitely more expensive than most brands but it just takes a little and a tube lasts a long time!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using CloSYS Flouride Toothpaste ever since it was first offered to the public. I will not change. It leaves my mouth fresh and clean with little to no plaque build-up. I have had NO dental or gum problems since using this toothpaste. Have tried both the plain and mint flavor and favor the latter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 7 ounce tube is the best bargain. Each time you brush, you only need to use a small dollop, about the size of a pea. So the big tube lasts many many months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this from a personal point of view, that of having no dental or gum problems since using it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a toothpaste without the foaming agent because I suspected that was causing my frequent mouth sores. In the nine months since using this product I&#x27;ve only gotten an occasional sore, usually from accidentally biting the inside of my cheek. So, to the folks who complained about the lack of foam with this toothpaste: that&#x27;s the point! Some people are very sensitive to the foaming agent and I, for one, am happy to have found a product without it. I&#x27;ll keep using this!</li>
            <li> This makes a big difference for my gums.  My General Practitioner recommended CloSYS.  It splatters, where other toothpaste doesn&#x27;t.  It takes me seconds to wipe the splatter.  Worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I am not even kidding. I am prone to canker sores (inner mouth sore), and normal toothpastes have SLS, a foaming agent that correlates with increased canker incidence, at least in me. If I use regular toothpaste, I get a canker at least a couple times a month, and it lasts a week, so I&#x27;m in nearly constant low-level pain. After I switched to this toothpaste, I get maybe two a year, and they disappear quicker. I&#x27;ve tried other SLS-free toothpastes, and they work just as well for this purpose, but this brand consistently has been the easiest to find. If you are similarly afflicted, make the switch.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My boyfriend got it as a trial and I fell in love after first use. I&#x27;ve always had a buildup problem on my front bottom teeth. By the end of the day they feel rough and gross. The first time I used this toothpaste I didn&#x27;t notice the buildup by the end of the day. It&#x27;s great! The taste is light and minty and my mouth feels so clean all day.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste, great taste.</li>
            <li> recommended by my dentist!. He was right because is the best for the gums. i will recommended to anyone who is very serious with dental hygiene</li>
            <li> good stuff, recommend to everyone. fresh mint flavor , white teeth . good product&lt;br /&gt;A little expensive. But it does work.</li>
            <li> The best toothpaste I have ever used. My checkups are uneventful, and my mouth maintains that fresh feeling all day long.</li>
            <li> Actually, it was the Closys rinse my hygienist recommended.  I have periodontal issues.  I&#x27;ve had the scaling and root planing.  I started using the Crest Pro-Health rinse to kill bacteria, and found it was causing terrible staining.  She suggested I try the Closys rinse.  I got some at my local CVS right away.  That was three months ago.  I just had a cleaning, and I had no staining, and I still drink coffee and tea, so it was definitely the Pro-Health rinse that was causing the staining.  It says right on the label, in the fine print, of the Crest Pro-Health Rinse, that it may cause surface staining.  She said it effects some people more than others.  Anyhoo, I also came to Amazon to get the Closys toothpaste, since CVS doesn&#x27;t carry it, and have been very pleased.  Since it doesn&#x27;t have the foaming sulfates, I don&#x27;t find myself gagging on a mouthful of foam halfway through brushing my teeth like I used to.  Also, my mouth seems less dry, probably because the Closys toothpaste and rinse don&#x27;t disrupt the ph balance like other products.  The toothpaste has a very mild flavor, and I like to use the rinse without the added flavoring.  My mouth just feels clean, not coated in artificial flavorings like it used to.  My last cleaning was great, no bleeding, good gum health.</li>
            <li> The dentist recommended this stuff. It works really well and doesn&#x27;t foam up the way other toothpastes do. Tastes ok, not great.</li>
            <li> My hygentist turned me on to this brand a few years ago.  I was a new patient at a dentist office and after years of fighting with other hygentists who thought I was lying about flossing because my gums would bleed so bad during a cleaning, she suggest I give this a try.  She said a lot of their patients that had similar problems with bleeding gums and flossing wasn&#x27;t the issue, they had great results with the cloysys.  At first I didnt care for it because it didnt foam up. Foamer means cleaner right? Wrong!  After about a month of using this line (toothpaste and mouth wash) I noticed a change in my gums.  I got over the no foam thing pretty quickly.  Now, no more puffy, swollen gums.  No more bleeding when I floss.  And at my next 6 month cleaning, no more blood shed!  I have used this product line exclusively for the last five years and I will continue to use it until the day I die!  This stuff is a little pricier than your normal drug store toothpaste, but the extra few dollars is worth it when I go sit in that dentist chair and know that Im not in for an hour of torture and pain.</li>
            <li> Cleans well and feels great on sensitive gums. Has worked better than sensitive toothpaste for me</li>
            <li> Been using it for years. Pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> As an advanced age person, I have some recession and need to have an increased fluoride toothpaste to protection the exposed tooth.  Nice flavor, not a gel, cleans well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my mucosa as toothpaste containing sodium laurate and/or a whitener.</li>
            <li> This stuff is weird.  I can&#x27;t speak to the cavity fighting properties (I just don&#x27;t know) but it does not foam like any of the major brands you are probably used to.  I like the foamy refreshing feeling that a traditional toothpastes give making it at-least feel like its working.  This CloSYS type basically feels like your brushing your teeth with some lightly flavored water. It does not foam at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just a personal preference but I&#x27;m not sure I like it.</li>
            <li> I love this product and love it that it&#x27;s made here in the States. It&#x27;s also cheaper on Amazon than in the store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great if you are sensitive to sulphates. And the taste is nice and minty fresh.</li>
            <li> My dentist in Huntington Beach CA recommended this toothpaste years ago and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  It&#x27;s non-foaming, which I really like, and gives my mouth a very clean taste.  I also use the oral rinse by Closys and recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothpaste I have ever found to fight morning breath.  It&#x27;s phenomenal. Great taste. Refreshing. When you wake up in the morning you don&#x27;t feel like the first thing you have to do is get up and brush your teeth right away. Of course most of us usually do anyway, but it&#x27;s nice to not feel like you have to.</li>
            <li> I went to the dentist several months ago and they said i needed to use listerine for the bleeding on my gums. Listerine give me lye bumps so i switched to listerine zero still same problem. I contacted my doctor via facebook they said try this and if this doesn&#x27;t help come in so we can see the problem. The lye bumps are gone and none have come back. It has been over a week. I love this stuff. I will be definetly be buying this again. My mouth feels clean and no lye bumps. Best thing in the world. I purchased it on here because it was not available in my city. Best decision I made in my life. I will be getting through the subscription. I would use this along with the mouth rinse.</li>
            <li> best toothpaste on the market</li>
            <li> PerioBrite products are better, IMO.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste keeps your gums and teeth their healthiest I love it and I like that it does not foam up your mouth.</li>
            <li> Clean teeth and light flavor!!! You will need to get use to no foam but there is no loss in effectiveness.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothpaste, my gums bleed for years from brushing, this toothpaste has totally stopped it, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I bought the toothpaste because I loved the mouthwash.  Not sure I will keep using because its a tad runny when working with my Oral B electric toothbrush.  Other than that issue it seems fine.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Always buy this along with mouth wash - dental checks great.</li>
            <li> I have gotten canker sores since I was a child (I&#x27;m in my mid-forties and female). It wasn&#x27;t until a few years ago that my dentist told me to use SLS free toothpaste. It really does help. Even when I have a canker sore it doesn&#x27;t burn to brush my teeth when I use this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This is pretty standard toothpaste. I was looking for a Clinpro replacement and this is not it. This doesn&#x27;t seem to have anymore Flouride than standard toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t foam AT ALL or clean. It seems to make my breath fresher, but this toothpaste SUCKS at cleaning. It doesn&#x27;t clean at all. SLS toothpaste is fine, but does this company not realize they&#x27;re gentle surfactants they can use in their products? The POINT of toothpaste is to CLEAN.</li>
            <li> Helps me with bad breath</li>
            <li> Used it lastnight I love it</li>
            <li> Great for kids!  My daughter struggled with transitioning from the kids toothpaste to a grown-up toothpaste.  She likes the taste of Closys as it doesn&#x27;t burn her mouth and gums, I like it because it has all that is needed in a toothpaste and whitens her teeth too.  No cavities so I&#x27;m a happy parent.</li>
            <li> I really love the toothpaste...It is worth the extra $$$.. The tube last a long time.. Will continue to use.. I&#x27;m waiting to see if my check up is better like other reviewers..</li>
            <li> My husband had virtually constant problems with canker sores from other toothpastes with sulfate in them. I mean big ones at the same time in multiple places. We began searching for a new toothpaste that wasn&#x27;t going to cost an arm and a leg for a teeny amount. CloSYS has been the perfect solution. NO MORE CANKER SORES, since using this paste. As for the cost, since we have prime and I subscribed and saved, it was the easy choice. It is obviously more pricey than standard store bought paste, but since you only use a little, it will last for a decent amount of time. The taste is  not too bad either. The hubby has a clean, fresh mouth and no more pain or salt rinsing, or orajel, just to have dinner!</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s dentist had highly recommended this toothpaste for his on-going problem with continued &#x27;dry mouth&#x27;  especially at night time !</li>
            <li> CloSys toothpaste just became my favourite. It does not foam too much, cleans well, and leaves your mouth smelling fresh. The taste of the toothpaste is also good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Good, but has just crossed $10 price tag on Amazon. That&#x27;s 3 times a normal toothpaste. I&#x27;m not sure whether I&#x27;ll order a next one.</li>
            <li> Sodium Laurel Sulfate (SLS) causes skin rashes if in shampoos or detergents.  In toothpaste, it causes my tongue to swell.  Scary, because it makes swallowing difficult.  I thought I had a terrible disease!  This has fluoride, a fresh taste and NO SLS.  That is a foaming agent so no foam is also nice for those with a strong gag reflex.  My dentist is happy with the health of my gums &amp; teeth, so this is doing the trick.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years.  No foaming and great taste that is less potent in the mornings.</li>
            <li> I have been experimenting with toothpastes for the past year.  I was looking for something without sulfates as I&#x27;ve read that they can be harmful to the ph in your mouth.  I wanted something that kept me teeth white as some of the natural brands seemed to create a yellow cast after a month or so of use.  I also wanted something that had fluoride because while I do try to keep things natural and organic as much as possible I think that there is a balance between nature and science.  The natural brands that are using peppermint oil and baking soda to clean teeth taste fine but we live a lot longer these days and I&#x27;d rather bet on the side of fluoride to prolong the health of my teeth.  This Closys Fluoride Toothpaste is the first one I have found that fits the bill.  It tastes good, low foaming &#x3D; no sulfates, cleans my mouth well as in glossy shiny, white teeth, and good breath.  It has the fluoride to protect my teeth from cavities and while it has no numbing agents like that joke sensodyne uses to mask sensitive teeth I don&#x27;t seem to feel sensitive to hot and cold liquids.  It did take a few times to get used to brushing with since it is not a mouth full of foam but I adjusted and the results are worth it.  I tried the commercial brands colgate, sensodyne, crest, etc. plus squigle, Dr. Collins, and two different dentist only brands but none of them compared to how healthy and clean this brand has kept my teeth.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothpaste per my dentist&#x27;s recommendation.  I have found it Ok.  I don&#x27;t know much about toothpaste brands.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine told me about this toothpaste, I&#x27;m so glad I listened to him. I love it, my teeth are so clean they squeak. First time ever I have looked forward to a visit to the dentist.</li>
            <li> More than meets my expectations</li>
            <li> I use this toothpaste for one reason: It KILLS BAD BREATH longer and more effectively than all of the others. I&#x27;ve tried them all. This stuff kills the bad breath germs for many hours. I love this stuff. It&#x27;s worth the few extra bucks to know my breath doesn&#x27;t smell like toxic waste.</li>
            <li> made no difference and don&#x27;t like the taste. will not buy again</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have extra foam in the toothpaste but my teeth and breath feel glossy clean after brushing.  I use this toothpaste with a Sonic toothbrush and get excellent results.</li>
            <li> The best toothpaste I have ever used. Others make the inside of my mouth peel and develop sores, this one just keeps my teeth and gums healthy. LOVE IT. Great taste, too. Not gritty or salty or too strong tasting.</li>
            <li> Great for maintaining oral health</li>
            <li> Love it!  It&#x27;s the best</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste for about 6 years now, ever since my dentist recommended it. I cannot stand any other toothpastes now. The mild and refreshing flavor of this toothpaste is so much nicer than any other I have tried. My husband use to use Crest until he ran out and had to start using my Closys. That was 3 years ago and he refuses to use anything else now as well.</li>
            <li> Closys has become an essential staple in my house; I have the mouth wash as well and now that I have tried their toothpaste I will never go back to Crest. Simpler and cleaner in every way.</li>
            <li> I never though I&#x27;d be writing a review for toothpaste. I decided to purchase this toothpaste mostly because of the reviews. Come to find out it&#x27;s the toothpaste that my dentists husband uses. She was surprised I had found it on my own as it is not one of your typical big brand name toothpastes. It is safer than most in that it does NOT contain Sulfates / Foaming Agents. It takes some getting used to, but I actually prefer to brush without foam. It is much easier to feel how clean my teeth are when there isn&#x27;t a huge pile of foam in the way. I also find that I can brush longer before I have to spit as the foam isn&#x27;t filling my cheeks to the point of explosion. Long story short, the price is worth it! After all a smile is priceless :-)</li>
            <li> Good enamel protection.</li>
            <li> I want to love this stuff, but I don&#x27;t. I think it&#x27;s very gentle on the teeth and get&#x27;s them clean. But it doesn&#x27;t help maintain fresh breath as well as some other products (looking at BreathRX). And let&#x27;s face it, we all want fresh breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nice thing about this toothpaste is that it&#x27;s basically &amp;#34;unscented.&amp;#34; There&#x27;s no unnecessary ingredients and no sulfates, which I believe why it doesn&#x27;t foam very well. That part about it tends to drive my girlfriend nuts. I don&#x27;t mind so much, but I do feel like I have to use more of it in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d prefer to give it 3 1/2 stars, but I&#x27;m giving it 4. At the end of the day its a solid product, albeit a little niche.</li>
            <li> Recommended by dentist and it leaves your mouth fresh and clean.  Keeps teeth white and the wife also loves it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have a problem with foamy toothpaste. It makes me want to gag. However, this toothpaste lacks that entirely- in a very good way. I&#x27;ll never use any other toothpaste again.</li>
            <li> Too much mint in it for my taste. dId not notice it contained floride..</li>
            <li> I love this mouthwash, you can opt not to flavor it as I do, so no lingering taste. No alcohol!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Closys toothpaste for 7 years. My dentist recommended it after I had porcelain veneers put on several of my teeth. He said it one of only 3 brands he&#x27;d recommend for its low abrasiveness on teeth, and to remove the bacterial biofilm that forms in the pockets inbetween teeth. I like the flavor, find it cleans well, and have stuck with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is much higher at my local pharmacies, and my local grocery stores don&#x27;t carry it. Amazon provides a great price, especially if you use the subscribe &amp; save program.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is fine, I have used it before and like it.  My only complaint here is the quality control, and the unnecessary steps taken in my transaction with Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered this product in the past, and I am 99% sure it used to have a safety seal under the cap.  When I received the product, there was no seal, and I called Amazon to see if this product was manufactured with a seal.  Instead of finding an answer to this question, they overnighted me another one, and required me to send back the first one for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;Well, the second one also had no safety seal, so I assumed that they don&#x27;t use one anymore.  If Amazon had just answered my question instead of all that extra expense for them (and hassle for me to return), everyone would have benefitted.</li>
            <li> Always love and trust this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This product is really wonderful.  I can&#x27;t stand to use regular toothpaste anymore!  Your mouth feels so clean after using this, and I love that it doesn&#x27;t have the foaming agent in it.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  Just leaves a cleaner taste in my mouth than more popular brands.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste for the last 10 years. I use to buy this product from my DDS but Amazon had a better price.</li>
            <li> My Dentist had suggested this toothpaste and also the mouth wash when I was getting canker sores frequently.  This was 5 years ago and I have used it ever since then.  I don&#x27;t get them any longer and I love the taste of the toothpaste and also the mouthwash and use both daily.  I couldn&#x27;t go back to any other toothpaste!  I haven&#x27;t been able to find it at CVS or Walgreen&#x27;s any longer, so buy it online now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cindy F.&lt;br /&gt;Indialantic, Florida</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my hygienist at my previous dentist. At that point, it was being sold at Walgreens, I cant find it anymore there or at CVS or Riteaid. I can only find it here. I can only say, that since using this product, i have only had 6 month appointments, I have such bad teeth, always a cap, filling or a crown....My NEW hygienist wanted to know what I was doing to keep my teeth so nice..At 54 years old, that is a great thing to hear....closys, I AM A FAN FOIR LIFE!</li>
            <li> Leaves a pleasant taste and cleans like baking soda.</li>
            <li> I get cavities frequently, but have gotten a lot less using Closys products as our dentist recommended.  They are good for sensitive teeth and change the overall PH in your mouth resulting in fewer cavities.  Good mild mint taste!  I also like the mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to replace the discontinued Rembrandt Gentle (canker sores) and have been trying several brands for something comparable. I&#x27;ve brushed once with CloSYS, and I&#x27;m tossing it.  It did not leave a clean tasting mouth, at all.  It&#x27;s been about 20 minutes since I&#x27;ve brushed, and I still have a odd metal taste in my mouth. In my opinion, this toothpaste does nothing for a clean fresh mouth feeling. Verve Ultra Fresh Mint toothpaste is the closest to what I am looking for.  It leaves a fresh, clean taste that is long lasting and has no obnoxious aftertaste.</li>
            <li> Been using this toothpaste for several years now. Before using it, I always had bad plaque build up between cleanings. Since I started using it, the plaque issue is very minimal!</li>
            <li> Closys Toothpaste was recommended to me by my dentist.  In addition to doing an excellent job of cleaning my teath, it leaves a fresh feeling in my mouth.  My dentist also recommended it for healthy mouth atmosphere and to freshen my breath.  I am very pleased and satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this toothpaste at the dentist office, but decided that it would be more convenient when I found it here on Amazon. The price is the same as what I paid here, but I love the fact that I can get in on Subscribe and Save. Makes my life a lot easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste is great to anyone to use, but I buy it for my daughters who have problems with mouth sores. This toothpaste doesn&#x27;t have sodium lauryl sulfate which can contribute to mouth sores. It is almost impossible to find adult type toothpaste OTC per say. This helps in the prevention of those awful mouth sores. I highly recommend this toothpaste to anyone that has a problem with them.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! It&#x27;s almost like you could get perfectly clean teeth without even brushing. Feels like I&#x27;ve been to the dentist for a cleaning each time I use it.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dental hygienist because I was starting to develop gum disease.  I have used this toothpaste along with the CloSYS mouth wash.  Along with the other measures told to me by the dentist, my condition has improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste is white in color and has a medium minty taste.  It does not foam up like other toothpastes, so I do use a bit more than other pastes.  The container itself is difficult to open.  My daughter who also uses it always need help to lift the cap.  The paste is great so far.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clean at all. I have to clean twice each time, and still doesn&#x27;t wash off any onion or fish breath.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with my order of Closys tooth paste. It was priced fairly and arrived promptly and in good condition. I would order this product again.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for 4 weeks and my gums became very dry. Thy looked worse, not better. I have switched&lt;br /&gt;To a hydrogen peroxide and water rinse and am having excellent results. Would not purchase this again</li>
            <li> This is an excellent for anyone with an allergy to sulfate in regulat toothpaste. It is the only sulfate free toothpaste that I have been able to find on the market.</li>
            <li> If you are prone to canker sores you want to start using this toothpaste.  I haven&#x27;t had one since I started using it.  That has been almost two years.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is great. When used in combination with the mouthwash it leaves me with a very refreshed feeling. Have used another popular brand for years but this will be my regular toothpaste from now on.</li>
            <li> I started using Closys products after having a dental checkup where I had one tooth with a &amp;#34;6&amp;#34; gap. Yikes! I really don&#x27;t want to lose my teeth, and I would prefer to avoid deep scaling/planing, if I can help it. I have been given three months where I was told to be religious about taking care of my teeth--if no improvement we will have to go to the next step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After considering several options, I choose to use both the rinse and the toothpaste to see if it will make a significant difference. While my three months are not up yet I do think that these two products are helping--I have less and less bleeding at that bad site with continued use. NOTE: neither product foams, so you have to get used to that. The mouth rinse has very little taste--so far I don&#x27;t see any need to use the flavor supplement that comes with it. Since the rinse also has no alcohol, it is quite easy to swish the product in your mouth for more than the 10 seconds recommended. I purchased my products at Walmart (because I wanted them right away) but the price on Amazon is competitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update after my next dentist appt.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me many years ago. No chemicals no harsh additives to irritate your gums. No alcohol which can be irritating.</li>
            <li> This, in combination with the mouth wash are worth the price.  Recommended to me by a top dentist.  Excellent results.</li>
            <li> The bottles are huge and at a great price. I like this mouthwash way better than the stuff you can buy in the stores.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste for a few years now and it&#x27;s the only one I trust. This toothpaste is great for anyone who seems to brush all the time but still has a not so fresh breath. Sometimes the ingredients in our common toothpaste make our breath worse. This was my case and after using this with the Smartmouth mouth wash (the Closys mouthwash did not work for me) the problem was solved. This works for my son as well. I am so happy that Amazon carries it. It&#x27;s hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Just want to aware everyone, if you go to Walgreen where they sell this, they have a Walgreens brand, I compared active/inactive ingredients, exactly the same. Its only$5 for a tube. Just wanted to help you guys save money and time</li>
            <li> After using less than 1/2 a tube of this product I had to dispose of it. I honestly can&#x27;t say one single good thing about it. It&#x27;s almost as if this &amp;#34;toothpaste&amp;#34; dissolves in your mouth as you begin brushing. There is no foam or paste to trap the residual particles that your brush dislodges, so you may as well be brushing with water. There is only a faint hint of mint flavor and it had no long term effect on my breath. Worst of all, it is vastly overpriced. I really can&#x27;t understand any of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I suffered from bad breath for some time. My mom purchased this toothpaste at considerable expense directly from the dentist and gave it to me. I thought this was just a gimmick for the dentist to make more money from their patients. However the results were that my bad breath subsided. I also noticed that it was not as harsh on my teeth as the other brand that I was using. I think for people in the same situation, this toothpaste is a reasonable solution.</li>
            <li> I have always used and loved this toothpaste.  As a Dental Hygienist, I recommend it to all my patients as it does a fantastic job!</li>
            <li> Using this toothpaste was hard to get used to because it doesn&#x27;t foam up like other toothpastes.  It was recommended by my dental office so I gave it a try.  Now that I am used to the low foam, I like it.  It seems to really kill off the morning breath germs.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is the best for sensitive teeth.  I started to experience tooth pain, so my dentist recommended this product.  It was a great idea and I would totally recommend it to people.</li>
            <li> This an excellent Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) free toothpaste that leaves your mouth feeling minty clean and your breath fresh as a spring meadow breeze.  A lot of people, including myself, have an allergy to SLS and if you are getting canker sores often it could be from using an SLS toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best thing about using this toothpaste is that when you wake up in the morning, you don&#x27;t get the dry mouth/morning dragon breath!</li>
            <li> One of the very best. Dentist created. Now contains fluoride. Best for breath and taste.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this toothpaste and also the Closys mouthwash.  It has a mild minty taste.  It has some sort of bleach (not whitening) and leaves white spots wherever it might splash while brushing.  Leaves my mouth feeling very clean and my checkups have been very good.  A bit expensive, but since only a little toothpaste is necessary, a tube lasts a long time, and so I doubt it is any more expensive than other pastes.  I&#x27;d recommend it for adults.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this product and I have been using it for the past six months.  I have recommended it and just as satisfied as I am are those to whom I recommended Closys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not change this product for any other.  It leave you with a clean, fresh breath and I noticed my teeth are even whiter.  The tongue scrapers are light and easy for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is magnificient.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but it&#x27;s a great sulfate free toothpaste.</li>
            <li> After using Crest ProHealth mouthwash by P&amp;G my teeth became horribly stained brown / black. I used the prohealth for 1 month before I noticed (stupid me). After searching Amazon reviews for &amp;#34;Crest ProHealth Stains&amp;#34; I came across this toothpaste and mouthwash and I am so glad I did. I am banning P&amp;G products. Google P&amp;G products before you purchase them, I didn&#x27;t and I paid the price. Many of their products have very scary reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has now been about a month since I started using CloSys and my teeth are almost back to normal. The stains on the back of my teeth caused by prohealth is slowly disappearing but the stains on the front of my teeth are basically gone. There are some small spots in corners and between my teeth still but they are steadily disappearing. I could not be happier. Also I used both CloSys toothepaste and mouthwash together. I also mixed the mouthwash at night with 1/3 peroxide and 2/3 ciosys mouthwash - I started this 2 weeks after I started the ciosys regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now switched out all crest tooth pastes and mouthwashes in the house to CloSys. Very Pleased and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> CloSYS is better than advertised. It was originally recommended to me by my dentist.  After I started using it I experienced a noticeably more healthy looking and feeling teethe and gums.  I recommend it highly.  Amazon has the best price I can find on CloySYS.  Although it is expensive compared to most dental products it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste.  It&#x27;s not abrasive at all (some grit but definately not too abrasive compared to other toothpastes).  The taste is ok, but I like how clean it gets my teeth without being harsh.  I have switched from a non-fluoride toothpaste (Jason sea-fresh) to this one.</li>
            <li> Used this toothpaste along with the rinse.  Found to be intolerable due to it altering my taste buds.  It created a salty, sugary, metallic taste that doesn&#x27;t go away.  Also, the toothpaste was runny.  It didn&#x27;t work well with my sonicare toothbrush.  I think the product would be very effective if you don&#x27;t have the taste bud problem.  It whitened my teeth and helped with a gingivitis problem I had with 1 tooth.  Wish I could continue using it, but the taste bud issue is too much.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste does the job,  Yes, it is expensive compared to regular brands, but it does offer and advantage.  First a little bit goes a long way.  Second, with regular use this will keep plaque from building up.  Third, gums shape up and stay health.  As we know the plaque in your mouth, contribuates to heart issues. I was having to go to the dentist every 3 months just for cleaning.  .  After using this product regularly,  my gums are very health, and I can be on a standard twice a year dental visits.</li>
            <li> I am a retired dentist and feel this is the best toothpaste available, mild taste, has fluoride, no SLS, and is great for breath. Get it on Amazon. Do yourself a very big favor and get this paste and a SoniCare Diamond Clean Toothbrush (only use the small-head brush). Costco has great sales on the units, but get replacement &#x27;small&#x27; brush heads on Amazon).  Rinse with Listerine (green (Fresh burst) or blue (Cool mint) is better than yellow), and floss once each day with a waxed floss (I like Glide Waxed). You will save your money, protect your investment, time, and suffering, and not have oral health frustrations. Please do not believe that any toothpaste whitens teeth, unless one doesn&#x27;t brush at all and starts using toothpaste. Avoid &#x27;Triclosan&#x27;, sand, &#x27;Tartar Control&#x27;, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, hard &amp; medium bristles, large and odd shaped brush-heads, and any toothpaste or floss, or brushes on sale at a store.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this, only use it, will buy again, and hope this helps someone.</li>
            <li> I have used Sensodyne for years but was recommend CloSYS by my dentist for an option with good fluoride presence. I do have quite sensitive teeth so I was afraid switching from Sensodyne would be hard on my teeth but I haven&#x27;t noticed anything since switching over 3-months ago. I am very happy with CloSYS and am glad I made the change. Can&#x27;t say my teeth are cleaner/whiter but they do feel healthy and CloSYS also leaves my mouth feeling very refreshed post brushing. For this price, I won&#x27;t be buying my CloSYS toothpaste anywhere other than on Amazon :)</li>
            <li> If you are going to brush you might as well use something that is going to help you have healthy teeth and gums and good, sweet breath.</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used!!! It was originally recommended to me by my dentist many years ago, and I&#x27;ve used it ever since. I highly recommend it!!!!!</li>
            <li> I combine this with gel-kam for my &#x27;super teeth maintenance routine&#x27;.  I have sensitive teeth, and I&#x27;m terrified of the dentist, so this gets me through</li>
            <li> Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is a pretty nasty chemical found in household cleaning products, laundry detergents, shampoo, toothpaste, and more. After doing some research, I decided I wanted to find a toothpaste that didn&#x27;t contain SLS. All of the major brands do, so I decided to try CloSYS. Without the SLS, the toothpaste does NOT foam up - so it might seem like it&#x27;s &amp;#34;not working&amp;#34;. But after using it for a week, everything seems fine.</li>
            <li> I have been using Closys fluoride toothpaste for years.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. My dentist approves.</li>
            <li> I give this toothpaste one star because it doesn&#x27;t do what it should do.  This toothpaste has been giving me canker sores every night.  I usually only use this toothpaste at night.  Each morning after using the toothpaste, I wake up with a canker sore.  It doesn&#x27;t do anything to help with whiting the teeth, either.  Rembrandt was a great toothpaste for preventing canker sores and whiten the teeth at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using mouthwash when the canker sores appear, the canker sores then go away.  I refuse to use the product anymore.</li>
            <li> This product, is the best I have found for protecting my teeth and mouth from bacteria. It is also superb for keeping plaque off the teeth. No other toothpaste has performed like this. I highly recommend this toothpaste if you are concerned about keeping your teeth as clean as possible. You will really see a difference at your next dental appointment.</li>
            <li> It does a great job cleaning my teeth and mouth with the added benefit of not causing my cancer sores to flair up. and it seems like i am having many fewer flairs, when I do have one they don&#x27;t last near as long.</li>
            <li> It a little weird to use, it kind of dries up in the mouth almost like your not using enough. The effects a little better then the store bought toothpaste</li>
            <li> using closys toothpaste in combination with a waterpik with periogen has saved my teeth and made visits to my dentist much more pleasant.</li>
            <li> I recommend people try this toothpaste. I feel who ever buys this will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day. It solved the problem of having a bad breath. It does not taste as good like the brand name toothpaste.  But the important factor is it takes away the bad breath cause by combination of medications.</li>
            <li> For those who got canker sores from Sodium Laurel Sulfate in most popular brands, Closys does just as well without the worry of Canker Sores from the SLS. When Rembrandt Gentle went off the market I was concerned. I tried this, Squigle and Tom&#x27;s and my dentist told me to stick with Closys. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> I have had Invisilign and other oral implements for TMJ for years now.  No matter how I cleaned the trays, my breath would still start to smell sulfur-y near the end of the two weeks.  I even tried putting the Invisilign in the dishwasher.  (I don&#x27;t recommend it, makes them brittle.)  This really took care of my breath issues.  Works better than the mouthwash for me, since I brush my Invisilign with it too.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist. An expensive tooth paste that  has not shown to cure my excessive saliva problem and will be discontinued.</li>
            <li> Our dental hygienist highly recommends this brand.</li>
            <li> I have used this toothpaste for over 3 years now. Absolutely love it! It gives you a fresh mouth and keeps it longer than expected. I also use the same brand mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I worry that I may have bad breath.  This toothpaste was recommended by my dentist and it is awesome.  I also buy the mouthwash.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of other products for bad breath but none even begin to compare with CloSYS.</li>
            <li> A few months ago, I suddenly began having recurring outbreaks of canker sores. They would last for 3-4 days and were an absolute misery. No sooner would one canker sore start to heal than a new one would begin to appear. After several months of this, I went on a desperate search for answers as to why these repeated outbreaks were occurring. I tried changing my diet, eliminated citrus fruits, etc., and tried numerous topical remedies, all to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I saw an article about SLS (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate), a common chemical agent used in soaps, shampoos, toothpaste and numerous cleaning products. The only purpose of SLS is to make the product produce foam. Although the presence of SLS does nothing to enhance the performance of the product, consumers tend to believe that a product is working better if it produces suds. The article went on to say that some consumers using toothpaste containing SLS experienced irritation of the mouth tissues, including outbreaks of canker sores. I went on a search for SLS-free toothpaste in my area and had no luck finding any, even at the big chain drug stores. I also discovered that even the so-called &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; toothpastes on the shelf contained SLS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I turned to Amazon and after reading many reviews I decided to try CloSYS. I like that the product has the taste and smooth texture of regular toothpaste, as I&#x27;m not a fan of gritty textures or strange toothpaste flavors. It has a pleasant, minty flavor I enjoy. As promised, the toothpaste does not foam and actually reminds me of the old Pearl Drops. CloSYS is an expensive toothpaste, but once I started using it the canker sore outbreaks stopped and haven&#x27;t occurred since. For me, that made the higher price tag worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s only been a couple months since I began using CloSYS, so it may be too soon to know whether my canker sore problem will return. I&#x27;ll update this review if that happens.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a toothpaste that I could use without having to worry to chew gum throughout the day. I used this product for about a month and even after brushing after every meal and making sure I flossed and used a tongue cleaner, bad breathe would return in about an hour after use. I would not recommend buying this product if you dont want to worry about having to chew gum or use mints throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I was given a tube of this paste from my dentist and have not looked back since and that was around 10 years ago.  This will not leave that foamy film on your tongue that normal off the drug store shelf paste will leave.</li>
            <li> I needed a toothpaste that didn&#x27;t suds like regular toothpaste. I suffer from canker sores and this was recommended by a friend.  Since using it, I haven&#x27;t had any flare ups from canker sores.  The taste of mint is mild and pleasant. I would have liked it a little stronger but its not bad.  It takes a bit of getting used to as there aren&#x27;t any suds, but if it keeps me from having canker sores, I will be using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I no longer get canker sores in my mouth since using this toothpaste.  It&#x27;s the best all natural toothpaste</li>
            <li> A superior toothpaste. It might just save your gums.</li>
            <li> Alcohol free and non-staining!  This oral health system has saved my teeth.  Recommended by my dentist at UCSF--the second finest school of dentistry in the world (next to Harvard).</li>
            <li> this toothpaste worked well on my teeth they look so much better and feel so smooth like if have been to the dentist for a cleaning</li>
            <li> I like the flavor.  It is not cloying like so many others and seems to be less sweet.  Leaves the mouth with a good feel.  My dentist recommended it to me and I have been quite happy with it.  I also use Closys rinse.  Pricewise, Amazon has the best deal on both and they will autoship.</li>
            <li> This one has a nice mint taste.  The level of abrasiveness does seem to be low since I don&#x27;t get any canker sores with use.  I can also attest to its whitening effect with regular use.</li>
