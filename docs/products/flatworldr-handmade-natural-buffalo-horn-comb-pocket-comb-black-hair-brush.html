    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The comb is too perfect to be \\&quot;hand-carved\\&quot;, but maybe machined with the help of power</li>
            <li>I immediately was impressed with the packaging.  </li>
            <li>What a Great product!</li>
            <li>The teeth can flex side-to-side, but they have a wonderful tapered design that keeps them from flexing front-to-back as you comb hair.</li>
            <li>Well, I was quite impressed.</li>
            <li>Actually, I&#x27;m impressed by the gift box.</li>
            <li>Then this would be the perfect gift for them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful object, and quite a relief from plastic combs.</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful comb and it&#x27;s unisex.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Heavy and substantial feeling in the hand, this is a great comb.</li>
            <li>Feels great on my scalp (almost like a massage</li>
            <li>It feels great to use.  </li>
            <li>A couple of times using it on our girls&#x27; shampooed and conditioned hair in the tub took care of that, though, and now it has no discernible scent and has been working great.</li>
            <li>I would happily recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Something like this would make for a great gift.</li>
            <li>It would make a great gift and as you know Christmas is coming.</li>
            <li>It feels great going across your scalp as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>packaging was very nice too... but was not in English.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li>wife says it is very nice to use in combing your hair.</li>

            <li>This comb is absolutely gorgeous.</li>
            <li>Very nice artwork on the front of the box and a nicely made interior.  </li>
            <li>To be fair to plastic combs, I tend to be an excellent conductor, generating an unusual amount of static electricity under the best of circumstances.</li>
            <li>others have mentioned, the presentation box is lovely and exotic, making this a perfect gift.</li>
            <li>truly is a quality comb, so nice it could be given as a gift you would be proud to give, and comes in a nice looking gift box.</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Great horn comb for those who are fed up with static electricity and damaged hair.</li>

            <li>/&gt;Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>Nice gift box</li>
            <li>was provided this product in exchange for my honest feedback.</li>
            <li>All of my reviews are comprised of my unbiased, honest opinions.</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t call this a pocket comb, but otherwise it&#x27;s quite nice.</li>
            <li>All thoughts are my own.</li>
            <li>As you can see from the photos here the comb comes in a nice presentation box and the comb itself lives up to the presentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>comb is sturdy and has some nice weight to it, which I like a lot.  </li>
            <li>you are looking for a smooth fine-toothed comb, this is a nice choice with a surprising material that also makes it good for gifting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everyone should own one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Sample</li>
            <li>Everyone should own one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Sample</li>
            <li>All the teeth have a nice, rounded curve to them.</li>
            <li>I was provided with a sample of this comb for evaluation and review, and this is my own unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
            <li>It just makes a nice presentation piece.&lt;br</li>
            <li>company gave me a comb, in exchange for an honest review of the product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It came in a nice presentable box with a satin like fabric as a backdrop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think this is a rather unique and nice gift, for those on the list who have sufficient hair to make good use of this comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a really nice comb, but the packaging is also lovely.</li>
            <li>Unlike plastic combs it has a hefty weight, is smooth/polished material that feels nice in the hand, and the teeth are completely smooth and nicely spaced.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable and the teeth do not poke the scalp.&lt;br</li>
            <li>advertised, unlike plastic combs, this one does not pick up static from hair or clothes (I rubbed it against a wool sweater to test).</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, the horn comb naturally attracts dander/dandruff from your hair on its own to make grooming even more effective.</li>
            <li>It looks much better in person than in the photos.</li>
            <li>It arrived in a lovely box with a storage pouch.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice looking comb to adorn the dressing table though.&lt;br /&gt;[Received a free sample for review]</li>
            <li>The comb seems to slip better through hair&lt;</li>
            <li>It would make a lovely gift for either a man or woman.</li>
            <li>, I have had static issues with plastic combs.</li>
            <li>That seems the more sensible course.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The comb is geared to do more than just run teeth through your hair.  </li>
            <li>wife is from Fujian, the province that manufactures and exports buffalo horn combs, and she&#x27;s used many in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>However, the description mentions not causing static because it is made of horn, and I can say that when I used this on my pooch Niki, there was zero static -</li>
            <li>and yes didn&#x27;t give off static electricity like plastic</li>
            <li>Anyone would love this comb, provided two things--  1.</li>
            <li>and it is thoughtfully packaged, suitable for gifting.</li>
            <li>I was offered this beautifully crafted handmade natural Buffalo horn comb for review and I jumped at the chance.  </li>
            <li>It has a super nice feel to it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First, the presentation case with Chinese writing (no English) is really beautiful and would make a wonderful gift or Christmas stocking stuffer.  </li>
            <li>It glides nicely through all my girls&#x27; hair,  and it does a great job of de-tangling all those wind-blown little girl hairdos that nice weather has brought with it at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>The comb feels nice in my hand; powerful somehow, like holding a knife.</li>
            <li>It is exceptionally well finished, with teeth much smoother than any nylon or plastic comb I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>Easily glides through my hair.</li>
            <li>The teeth are strategically placed for moving easily through thicker hair, or tangled hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the first really nice quality comb I have ever used</li>
            <li>/&gt;The comb arrives in a beautiful gift box, inspired by Chinese art.  </li>
            <li>I say that because fellow reviewer Rob has very kindly sacrificed his own comb in the interest of clarifying this important point, and as you can see from his video review posted to this product, he broke the comb in half so that he could determine for himself whether or not it was plastic, or horn as claimed.</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:9d38d0d3b62dcbb7fb3e6a71c9a2d23f]]This is a beautiful traditional natural ox horn comb and it comes in a lovely box suitable for gifting.</li>
            <li>Feel free to comment if you find something else.  </li>
            <li>When it would break or get lost, I would buy another cheap comb and keep going.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes in a simple but attractive gift box with a gold-colored satin cloth and two gold-colored elastic bands to hold the comb inside.</li>
            <li>: I was sent a free product sample for review.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you plan to give this as a gift, the box is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well made and comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There aren&#x27;t any photos of the box, and the pictures of the comb don&#x27;t give you much context or show off the wonderful quality of the product, so I made a short video.</li>
            <li>However, this  six inch comb is all natural, has a good heft to it, and is made with quality.</li>
            <li>did not experience any static electricity while combing my hair or right after combing my hair.</li>
            <li>Though certainly not necessary this is a very nice</li>
            <li>The comb has a nice weight to it and feels extremely high quality.</li>
            <li>One experiences no static charge, and the teeth are perfect.</li>
            <li>I think this comb is more pretty than functional and can be used in a pinch</li>
            <li>This comb felt substantial, and it just feels better when using it than cheap plastic combs; it feels much smoother running across my head than the plastic points on plastic combs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You may think it may hurt your scalp but on the contrary, if they are well polished as these combs are, they are more gentle and just glide smoothly on your scalp.  </li>
            <li>and I admit that I find myself surprised to be saying this...very nice.  </li>
            <li>This comb is different and I have had no issues at all with static when I comb with it; even trying to generate static with it,</li>
            <li>yes,  the comb hits on the scalp and will increase pressure more than a normal comb.  </li>
            <li>One of the most important aspects of any comb is that it has no sharp edges, which can fray hair over time.  </li>
            <li>So I was quite pleased that I generated zero static with this comb over the course of an hour or more of near constant combing.</li>
            <li>Either way the comb itself is worth it no matter the material because of it its thickness, length, and presentation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a nicely made comb that should last years.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think you can know that for sure, as it could be Taiwan or conceivably even Japan), or anything else.</li>
            <li>Also, one note,  it comes in its own gift box, but the lettering and/or info is not in English.  </li>
            <li>horn feel&#x27;s so powerful</li>
            <li>This is for male - females use and will make a nice</li>
            <li>、 Use a very soft brush to clean between the teeth with cool water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped quickly at weight: 0.3 ounces.&lt;br</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>Use a very soft brush to clean between the teeth with cool water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He has always used the cheap plastic black combs costing about $2.00 and was thrilled to try this handmade comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I honestly expected the teeth to be slightly uneven, but they were perfect in every way, polished to a high gloss, very smooth.</li>
            <li>Moreover, natural matters are always more safe, sane, and biodegradable; horn is made of keratine and azote and will last forever if you take care of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not surprised that it&#x27;s nice, mind you.  </li>
            <li>Nice heft without being heavy, and completely smooth all around.  </li>
            <li>It has a very classic look to it and it does a great job of combing my hair as well, which is really all that matters when it comes down to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It combs through hair with no snags or pulls and is very comfortable on the scalp with smooth ends of teeth that massage scalp instead of sharp scratching.  </li>
            <li>The feel is smooth with a polished finish and just plain nice to hold.</li>
            <li>No review or particular rating was promised in return, and the opinions expressed here are my own following my first-hand experiences with this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I am a believer in Asian medicine, I wouldn&#x27;t doubt any of the claims of a healthier scalp and better circulation.  </li>
            <li>comb arrived in a lovely box with a floral line drawing print as well as a monochrome gray watercolor print, and a logo label in Chinese.</li>
            <li>Well....  First of all,  I have no idea</li>
            <li>The above is per my lovely wife.</li>
            <li>This is a super high quality comb.</li>
            <li>At $9.99, I may order several more, so my husband can have one of his own and I can stash them in my car&#x27;s glove box and other purses.</li>
            <li>Anyone using a plastic comb would probably stop using it right away and switch to this much nicer one</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes packaged in a nice box, entirely labeled and decorated in Chinese, very nice but very unhelpful in knowing anything about how it is made, where it is from (obviously China although unless you can read Chinese</li>
            <li>Even though they were flimsy and pretty much disposable</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve have used it several time&#x27;s and from my result&#x27;s of grooming my hair the comb has not broken as of yet plus is incredibly strong the reason for that saying</li>
            <li>The style is traditional, with relatively fine</li>
            <li>The unsightly detritus is highly visible against the comb&#x27;s smooth black surface and can be wiped off easily with your fingers or a cloth/tissue.</li>
            <li>I would say this is a real Ox Buffalo Horn  Comb based on examination.  </li>
            <li>It is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thus, if like me disentangle hair means suffering and sometimes tears, you really need horn combs.</li>
            <li>When running through your hair, it feels much smoother than a plastic comb, perhaps because the tines are not as sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t it is made of real ox horn or</li>
            <li>This buffalo horn comb is very well smoothed, with rounded edges.  </li>
            <li>For this quality it is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>A tool that I&#x27;ve used for decades and never given much thought, and yet - I&#x27;m saying it.  </li>
            <li>Please go to Rob&#x27;s review and give him a &#x27;helpful&#x27; vote because I think that he deserves it more than any other reviewer here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;What makes this different, and rather special, is this - it does seem to indeed be made from horn, as the description claims here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Combing your hair is easy, since your hair glides through the smooth, thick teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having heard all of the hype about using natural horn combs, I wanted to test this product on my fine fragile</li>
            <li>It is definitely more substantial than a typical plastic comb, it is hand-made so it has some uniqueness to it</li>
            <li>received this comb from the manufacturer in return for a realistic review.</li>
            <li>It is more expensive than a plastic comb, but the quality and durability is the reason it costs more and</li>
            <li>; in length, you can keep it in the main bathroom,  throw it in a bag,  and even in a shirt pocket.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>*  Avoid throwing, bending and high temperatures.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks and feels as high quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li>A really high quality buffalo horn comb should be heavier, conform to the curvature of the horn, and have visible growth pattern texture of the horn itself that cannot be smoothed</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this</li>
            <li>/&gt;2、Avoid throwing, bending and the high</li>
            <li>It is really nicely finished and hard to believe that it is buffalo horn.</li>
            <li>If I also use natural shampoos (no paraben, etc), I definitively think that thanks to horn combs</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re getting it for yourself, it&#x27;s a bit of an unexpected treat - but the real value (IMO) is if you send this as a gift.  </li>
            <li>you need a new comb, spend the money and get yourself one of these.</li>
            <li>Given To Me For An Honest Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flatworld® Handmade Natural Ox Buffalo Horn Comb Pocket Comb - Black Hair Brush (Classic Black A) by Flatworld is simple design and is hand carved with smooth edged teeth.</li>
            <li>how &#x27;endangered&#x27; or not buffalo are, but I am sensitive to the fact that products such as this one have, over the years, been responsible for the devastation of certain kinds of animals.</li>
            <li>For thousands of years, combs were made from natural materials, such as bone, tortoiseshell, ivory, rubber, wood, and metal, but in the 19th century cheap plastic all but eliminated traditional combs.</li>
            <li>Today, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided with a sample of this comb for evaluation and review, and this is my own unbiased and honest opinion.my cupboard and then one day open the paper to read about how buffalo are now extinct in China because they&#x27;ve all been killed in order to harvest their horn materials.</li>
            <li>pulling means less further damage, so I&#x27;m pleased with</li>
            <li>Also less likely to get charged with static electricity.  </li>
            <li>Also, the teeth in the comb are large enough that they never feel like they are poking at my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It will fit in a pocket but it might be a little bulky for that.</li>
            <li>is a natural, renewable and fully biodegradable material.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Grinding is natural, using a mixture of pumice and water.</li>
            <li>And to have it made of Natural Ox Buffalo Horn is a plus.</li>
            <li>I have always used basic plastic combs to comb my hair and never thought much about the quality of the comb I used.</li>
            <li>It respects the scalp, does not break hair, but just eliminate the ones which fell naturally.</li>
            <li>At 45 years old, I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve ever owned anything but a plastic comb.  </li>
            <li>Looking at the bristles from the side reveals the natural contours of the horn.  </li>
            <li>comb itself it as others have described it, heavy and smooth.</li>
            <li>Electricity and I are old enemies.</li>
            <li>what Natural Ox Buffalo Horn is or how it feels.  </li>
            <li>completely unlike when I use either a plastic or metal comb on her.</li>
            <li>Yep, it&#x27;s definitely natural horn.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The natural buffalo horn comb</li>
            <li>split end&#x27;s because of a known natural protein found in the horn of buffalo.</li>
            <li>The gift box, and the natural elegance of the comb, will impress whomever you would give it</li>
            <li>It feels good in the hand, smooths through the hair, and just feels expensive.</li>
            <li>The outside of the box is printed with Chinese characters and a pretty scene.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclosure: Item offered free in exchange for a review, I&#x27;am open to negative and positive comment&#x27;s</li>
            <li>it is hand carves and as a result it has minor imperfections that won’t be present with a poured and molded plastic comb, and these minor variances will make each comb unique and special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fact we received them for free has no bearing on our review, and we have written negative reviews in the past for products we were sent for free.</li>
            <li>The tines are a little further apart than a standard combs wider spacing (not the fine spacing).</li>
            <li>It is about 6\\&quot; long and 2\\&quot; high.  </li>
            <li>However, the teeth are straight edge and wide and the edges tended to catch on my hair.</li>
            <li>It has been 5 years I use only natural matter combs</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised that I&#x27;m actually saying that about a COMB.  </li>
            <li>a typical comb, it passes the grade and is perfectly normal, without any noticeable issues, but it is not a 5-star rating, high quality comb.</li>
            <li>It is solid black - I sort of expected it to be more &amp;#34;grained&amp;#34; than it is - it is a true solid black, but that makes no real difference.</li>
            <li>but apparently they manufacture these combs in China regularly.  </li>
            <li>The teeth of a new plastic comb have rough ends and scratch my scalp, not so with this horn comb.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a nice comb, but it&#x27;s likely that the comb was made from other buffalo parts such as compressed grounded hooves or other hard substance found on an buffalo.</li>
            <li>daughter tried it on her straight long hair and it took a lot of effort to drag through her long hair.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> The comb is too perfect to be \\&quot;hand-carved\\&quot;, but maybe machined with the help of power</li>
            <li> I immediately was impressed with the packaging.  </li>
            <li> What a Great product!</li>
            <li> The teeth can flex side-to-side, but they have a wonderful tapered design that keeps them from flexing front-to-back as you comb hair.</li>
            <li> Well, I was quite impressed.</li>
            <li> Actually, I&#x27;m impressed by the gift box.</li>
            <li> Then this would be the perfect gift for them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful object, and quite a relief from plastic combs.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful comb and it&#x27;s unisex.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Heavy and substantial feeling in the hand, this is a great comb.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my scalp (almost like a massage</li>
            <li> It feels great to use.  </li>
            <li> A couple of times using it on our girls&#x27; shampooed and conditioned hair in the tub took care of that, though, and now it has no discernible scent and has been working great.</li>
            <li> I would happily recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Something like this would make for a great gift.</li>
            <li> It would make a great gift and as you know Christmas is coming.</li>
            <li> It feels great going across your scalp as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> packaging was very nice too... but was not in English.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li> wife says it is very nice to use in combing your hair.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful comb that would make a nice gift.</li>
            <li> And I loved it.</li>
            <li> This comb is absolutely gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Very nice artwork on the front of the box and a nicely made interior.  </li>
            <li> To be fair to plastic combs, I tend to be an excellent conductor, generating an unusual amount of static electricity under the best of circumstances.</li>
            <li> others have mentioned, the presentation box is lovely and exotic, making this a perfect gift.</li>
            <li> truly is a quality comb, so nice it could be given as a gift you would be proud to give, and comes in a nice looking gift box.</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Great horn comb for those who are fed up with static electricity and damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price and a perfect gift for anyone with hair!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> Nice gift box</li>
            <li> was provided this product in exchange for my honest feedback.</li>
            <li> All of my reviews are comprised of my unbiased, honest opinions.</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t call this a pocket comb, but otherwise it&#x27;s quite nice.</li>
            <li> All thoughts are my own.</li>
            <li> As you can see from the photos here the comb comes in a nice presentation box and the comb itself lives up to the presentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> comb is sturdy and has some nice weight to it, which I like a lot.  </li>
            <li> you are looking for a smooth fine-toothed comb, this is a nice choice with a surprising material that also makes it good for gifting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everyone should own one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Sample</li>
            <li> Everyone should own one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Sample</li>
            <li> All the teeth have a nice, rounded curve to them.</li>
            <li> I was provided with a sample of this comb for evaluation and review, and this is my own unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
            <li> It just makes a nice presentation piece.&lt;br</li>
            <li> company gave me a comb, in exchange for an honest review of the product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It came in a nice presentable box with a satin like fabric as a backdrop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think this is a rather unique and nice gift, for those on the list who have sufficient hair to make good use of this comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a really nice comb, but the packaging is also lovely.</li>
            <li> Unlike plastic combs it has a hefty weight, is smooth/polished material that feels nice in the hand, and the teeth are completely smooth and nicely spaced.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable and the teeth do not poke the scalp.&lt;br</li>
            <li> advertised, unlike plastic combs, this one does not pick up static from hair or clothes (I rubbed it against a wool sweater to test).</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, the horn comb naturally attracts dander/dandruff from your hair on its own to make grooming even more effective.</li>
            <li> It looks much better in person than in the photos.</li>
            <li> It arrived in a lovely box with a storage pouch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice looking comb to adorn the dressing table though.&lt;br /&gt;[Received a free sample for review]</li>
            <li> The comb seems to slip better through hair&lt;</li>
            <li> It would make a lovely gift for either a man or woman.</li>
            <li> , I have had static issues with plastic combs.</li>
            <li> That seems the more sensible course.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The comb is geared to do more than just run teeth through your hair.  </li>
            <li> wife is from Fujian, the province that manufactures and exports buffalo horn combs, and she&#x27;s used many in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> However, the description mentions not causing static because it is made of horn, and I can say that when I used this on my pooch Niki, there was zero static -</li>
            <li> and yes didn&#x27;t give off static electricity like plastic</li>
            <li> Anyone would love this comb, provided two things--  1.</li>
            <li> and it is thoughtfully packaged, suitable for gifting.</li>
            <li> I was offered this beautifully crafted handmade natural Buffalo horn comb for review and I jumped at the chance.  </li>
            <li> It has a super nice feel to it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the presentation case with Chinese writing (no English) is really beautiful and would make a wonderful gift or Christmas stocking stuffer.  </li>
            <li> It glides nicely through all my girls&#x27; hair,  and it does a great job of de-tangling all those wind-blown little girl hairdos that nice weather has brought with it at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> The comb feels nice in my hand; powerful somehow, like holding a knife.</li>
            <li> It is exceptionally well finished, with teeth much smoother than any nylon or plastic comb I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> Easily glides through my hair.</li>
            <li> The teeth are strategically placed for moving easily through thicker hair, or tangled hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the first really nice quality comb I have ever used</li>
            <li> /&gt;The comb arrives in a beautiful gift box, inspired by Chinese art.  </li>
            <li> I say that because fellow reviewer Rob has very kindly sacrificed his own comb in the interest of clarifying this important point, and as you can see from his video review posted to this product, he broke the comb in half so that he could determine for himself whether or not it was plastic, or horn as claimed.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:9d38d0d3b62dcbb7fb3e6a71c9a2d23f]]This is a beautiful traditional natural ox horn comb and it comes in a lovely box suitable for gifting.</li>
            <li> Feel free to comment if you find something else.  </li>
            <li> When it would break or get lost, I would buy another cheap comb and keep going.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes in a simple but attractive gift box with a gold-colored satin cloth and two gold-colored elastic bands to hold the comb inside.</li>
            <li> : I was sent a free product sample for review.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you plan to give this as a gift, the box is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well made and comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There aren&#x27;t any photos of the box, and the pictures of the comb don&#x27;t give you much context or show off the wonderful quality of the product, so I made a short video.</li>
            <li> However, this  six inch comb is all natural, has a good heft to it, and is made with quality.</li>
            <li> did not experience any static electricity while combing my hair or right after combing my hair.</li>
            <li> Though certainly not necessary this is a very nice</li>
            <li> The comb has a nice weight to it and feels extremely high quality.</li>
            <li> One experiences no static charge, and the teeth are perfect.</li>
            <li> I think this comb is more pretty than functional and can be used in a pinch</li>
            <li> This comb felt substantial, and it just feels better when using it than cheap plastic combs; it feels much smoother running across my head than the plastic points on plastic combs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You may think it may hurt your scalp but on the contrary, if they are well polished as these combs are, they are more gentle and just glide smoothly on your scalp.  </li>
            <li> and I admit that I find myself surprised to be saying this...very nice.  </li>
            <li> This comb is different and I have had no issues at all with static when I comb with it; even trying to generate static with it,</li>
            <li> yes,  the comb hits on the scalp and will increase pressure more than a normal comb.  </li>
            <li> One of the most important aspects of any comb is that it has no sharp edges, which can fray hair over time.  </li>
            <li> So I was quite pleased that I generated zero static with this comb over the course of an hour or more of near constant combing.</li>
            <li> Either way the comb itself is worth it no matter the material because of it its thickness, length, and presentation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a nicely made comb that should last years.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you can know that for sure, as it could be Taiwan or conceivably even Japan), or anything else.</li>
            <li> Also, one note,  it comes in its own gift box, but the lettering and/or info is not in English.  </li>
            <li> horn feel&#x27;s so powerful</li>
            <li> This is for male - females use and will make a nice</li>
            <li> 、 Use a very soft brush to clean between the teeth with cool water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped quickly at weight: 0.3 ounces.&lt;br</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> Use a very soft brush to clean between the teeth with cool water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He has always used the cheap plastic black combs costing about $2.00 and was thrilled to try this handmade comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I honestly expected the teeth to be slightly uneven, but they were perfect in every way, polished to a high gloss, very smooth.</li>
            <li> Moreover, natural matters are always more safe, sane, and biodegradable; horn is made of keratine and azote and will last forever if you take care of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not surprised that it&#x27;s nice, mind you.  </li>
            <li> Nice heft without being heavy, and completely smooth all around.  </li>
            <li> It has a very classic look to it and it does a great job of combing my hair as well, which is really all that matters when it comes down to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It combs through hair with no snags or pulls and is very comfortable on the scalp with smooth ends of teeth that massage scalp instead of sharp scratching.  </li>
            <li> The feel is smooth with a polished finish and just plain nice to hold.</li>
            <li> No review or particular rating was promised in return, and the opinions expressed here are my own following my first-hand experiences with this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I am a believer in Asian medicine, I wouldn&#x27;t doubt any of the claims of a healthier scalp and better circulation.  </li>
            <li> comb arrived in a lovely box with a floral line drawing print as well as a monochrome gray watercolor print, and a logo label in Chinese.</li>
            <li> Well....  First of all,  I have no idea</li>
            <li> The above is per my lovely wife.</li>
            <li> This is a super high quality comb.</li>
            <li> At $9.99, I may order several more, so my husband can have one of his own and I can stash them in my car&#x27;s glove box and other purses.</li>
            <li> Anyone using a plastic comb would probably stop using it right away and switch to this much nicer one</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes packaged in a nice box, entirely labeled and decorated in Chinese, very nice but very unhelpful in knowing anything about how it is made, where it is from (obviously China although unless you can read Chinese</li>
            <li> Even though they were flimsy and pretty much disposable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve have used it several time&#x27;s and from my result&#x27;s of grooming my hair the comb has not broken as of yet plus is incredibly strong the reason for that saying</li>
            <li> The style is traditional, with relatively fine</li>
            <li> The unsightly detritus is highly visible against the comb&#x27;s smooth black surface and can be wiped off easily with your fingers or a cloth/tissue.</li>
            <li> I would say this is a real Ox Buffalo Horn  Comb based on examination.  </li>
            <li> It is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thus, if like me disentangle hair means suffering and sometimes tears, you really need horn combs.</li>
            <li> When running through your hair, it feels much smoother than a plastic comb, perhaps because the tines are not as sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t it is made of real ox horn or</li>
            <li> This buffalo horn comb is very well smoothed, with rounded edges.  </li>
            <li> For this quality it is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> A tool that I&#x27;ve used for decades and never given much thought, and yet - I&#x27;m saying it.  </li>
            <li> Please go to Rob&#x27;s review and give him a &#x27;helpful&#x27; vote because I think that he deserves it more than any other reviewer here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;What makes this different, and rather special, is this - it does seem to indeed be made from horn, as the description claims here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Combing your hair is easy, since your hair glides through the smooth, thick teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having heard all of the hype about using natural horn combs, I wanted to test this product on my fine fragile</li>
            <li> It is definitely more substantial than a typical plastic comb, it is hand-made so it has some uniqueness to it</li>
            <li> received this comb from the manufacturer in return for a realistic review.</li>
            <li> It is more expensive than a plastic comb, but the quality and durability is the reason it costs more and</li>
            <li> ; in length, you can keep it in the main bathroom,  throw it in a bag,  and even in a shirt pocket.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> *  Avoid throwing, bending and high temperatures.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks and feels as high quality.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> A really high quality buffalo horn comb should be heavier, conform to the curvature of the horn, and have visible growth pattern texture of the horn itself that cannot be smoothed</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this</li>
            <li> /&gt;2、Avoid throwing, bending and the high</li>
            <li> It is really nicely finished and hard to believe that it is buffalo horn.</li>
            <li> If I also use natural shampoos (no paraben, etc), I definitively think that thanks to horn combs</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re getting it for yourself, it&#x27;s a bit of an unexpected treat - but the real value (IMO) is if you send this as a gift.  </li>
            <li> you need a new comb, spend the money and get yourself one of these.</li>
            <li> Given To Me For An Honest Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flatworld® Handmade Natural Ox Buffalo Horn Comb Pocket Comb - Black Hair Brush (Classic Black A) by Flatworld is simple design and is hand carved with smooth edged teeth.</li>
            <li> how &#x27;endangered&#x27; or not buffalo are, but I am sensitive to the fact that products such as this one have, over the years, been responsible for the devastation of certain kinds of animals.</li>
            <li> For thousands of years, combs were made from natural materials, such as bone, tortoiseshell, ivory, rubber, wood, and metal, but in the 19th century cheap plastic all but eliminated traditional combs.</li>
            <li> Today, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided with a sample of this comb for evaluation and review, and this is my own unbiased and honest opinion.my cupboard and then one day open the paper to read about how buffalo are now extinct in China because they&#x27;ve all been killed in order to harvest their horn materials.</li>
            <li> pulling means less further damage, so I&#x27;m pleased with</li>
            <li> Also less likely to get charged with static electricity.  </li>
            <li> Also, the teeth in the comb are large enough that they never feel like they are poking at my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will fit in a pocket but it might be a little bulky for that.</li>
            <li> is a natural, renewable and fully biodegradable material.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Grinding is natural, using a mixture of pumice and water.</li>
            <li> And to have it made of Natural Ox Buffalo Horn is a plus.</li>
            <li> I have always used basic plastic combs to comb my hair and never thought much about the quality of the comb I used.</li>
            <li> It respects the scalp, does not break hair, but just eliminate the ones which fell naturally.</li>
            <li> At 45 years old, I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve ever owned anything but a plastic comb.  </li>
            <li> Looking at the bristles from the side reveals the natural contours of the horn.  </li>
            <li> comb itself it as others have described it, heavy and smooth.</li>
            <li> Electricity and I are old enemies.</li>
            <li> what Natural Ox Buffalo Horn is or how it feels.  </li>
            <li> completely unlike when I use either a plastic or metal comb on her.</li>
            <li> Yep, it&#x27;s definitely natural horn.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The natural buffalo horn comb</li>
            <li> split end&#x27;s because of a known natural protein found in the horn of buffalo.</li>
            <li> The gift box, and the natural elegance of the comb, will impress whomever you would give it</li>
            <li> It feels good in the hand, smooths through the hair, and just feels expensive.</li>
            <li> The outside of the box is printed with Chinese characters and a pretty scene.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclosure: Item offered free in exchange for a review, I&#x27;am open to negative and positive comment&#x27;s</li>
            <li> it is hand carves and as a result it has minor imperfections that won’t be present with a poured and molded plastic comb, and these minor variances will make each comb unique and special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fact we received them for free has no bearing on our review, and we have written negative reviews in the past for products we were sent for free.</li>
            <li> The tines are a little further apart than a standard combs wider spacing (not the fine spacing).</li>
            <li> It is about 6\\&quot; long and 2\\&quot; high.  </li>
            <li> However, the teeth are straight edge and wide and the edges tended to catch on my hair.</li>
            <li> It has been 5 years I use only natural matter combs</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised that I&#x27;m actually saying that about a COMB.  </li>
            <li> a typical comb, it passes the grade and is perfectly normal, without any noticeable issues, but it is not a 5-star rating, high quality comb.</li>
            <li> It is solid black - I sort of expected it to be more &amp;#34;grained&amp;#34; than it is - it is a true solid black, but that makes no real difference.</li>
            <li> but apparently they manufacture these combs in China regularly.  </li>
            <li> The teeth of a new plastic comb have rough ends and scratch my scalp, not so with this horn comb.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice comb, but it&#x27;s likely that the comb was made from other buffalo parts such as compressed grounded hooves or other hard substance found on an buffalo.</li>
            <li> daughter tried it on her straight long hair and it took a lot of effort to drag through her long hair.</li>
            <li> The comb itself is very solidly crafted and small enough to fit in a small clutch purse.</li>
            <li> Remember to not wash it with shampoos or agressive products, but just natural soaps or water; always dry your comb if it is wet and try to not drop it on the floor because it would break.</li>
            <li> I can see this comb lasting a really long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> flat world comb has just become a fixture in my purse.</li>
            <li> This is a major selling point because the feeling of static electricity clacking as I comb my hair is unpleasant, as well as causing dust and dander to stick it, creating an embarrassing powdery look.</li>
            <li> This absolutely doesn&#x27;t come in a plain cardboard box!  </li>
            <li> Like all natural buffalo horn, there is a little bit of variation to the color, throughout the comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> DISCLOSURE : Product received to test with the option to review. I have no affiliation with any manufacturer or distributor other than choosing to review their item. Monetary compensation Is NEVER accepted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having heard all of the hype about using natural horn combs, I wanted to test this product on my fine fragile hair.&lt;br /&gt;While I don&#x27;t notice a difference in the overall condition of my processed-to-death hair that I can definitively attribute to the comb, the style of it does make for less pulling and tangling.&lt;br /&gt;Less pulling means less further damage, so I&#x27;m pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, the presentation box is lovely and exotic, making this a perfect gift.</li>
            <li> This is a super high quality comb. One experiences no static charge, and the teeth are perfect. It&#x27;s a beautiful object, and quite a relief from plastic combs.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:9d38d0d3b62dcbb7fb3e6a71c9a2d23f]]This is a beautiful traditional natural ox horn comb and it comes in a lovely box suitable for gifting. It&#x27;s lined on the inside with a padded yellow fabric. The back is entirely in Chinese, and likely speaks to the comb&#x27;s benefits and some history, but I&#x27;ll try to find a translator and update my review when available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As advertised, unlike plastic combs, this one does not pick up static from hair or clothes (I rubbed it against a wool sweater to test). This is a major selling point because the feeling of static electricity clacking as I comb my hair is unpleasant, as well as causing dust and dander to stick it, creating an embarrassing powdery look. Surprisingly, the horn comb naturally attracts dander/dandruff from your hair on its own to make grooming even more effective. The unsightly detritus is highly visible against the comb&#x27;s smooth black surface and can be wiped off easily with your fingers or a cloth/tissue. It&#x27;s very comfortable and the teeth do not poke the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There aren&#x27;t any photos of the box, and the pictures of the comb don&#x27;t give you much context or show off the wonderful quality of the product, so I made a short video. It looks much better in person than in the photos. The comb is too perfect to be \\&quot;hand-carved\\&quot;, but maybe machined with the help of power tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heavy and substantial feeling in the hand, this is a great comb. After trying this, I will never use a plastic comb ever again. Manufacturer provided evaluation unit for impartial review.</li>
            <li> This is a sturdy wide toothed comb made of natural ox buffalo horn. It arrived in a lovely box with a storage pouch. The comb itself is very solidly crafted and small enough to fit in a small clutch purse. However, the teeth are straight edge and wide and the edges tended to catch on my hair. It does feel soothing on the scalp but I accidentally dropped it on my scalp when it caught on my hair and it&#x27;s heavy enough to hurt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter tried it on her straight long hair and it took a lot of effort to drag through her long hair. It&#x27;s definitely not meant to be a detangling comb. Due to it&#x27;s heavy weight it&#x27;s a bit heavy to carry in the purse as well. I think this comb is more pretty than functional and can be used in a pinch but I would not use it regularly. It&#x27;s a nice looking comb to adorn the dressing table though.&lt;br /&gt;[Received a free sample for review]</li>
            <li> Likes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Nice gift box (you get a presentation box with at least 3 inches of extra room)&lt;br /&gt;• Comb is thick and really hard to bend..although the bristles bend side to side, but not really front to back)&lt;br /&gt;• Feels great on my scalp (almost like a massage tool)&lt;br /&gt;• I can see this comb lasting a really long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• This comb does look like it would be plastic. It’s almost like the bone(comb) has been covered with some type of black resin.&lt;br /&gt;• I’m not sure what the bristles are made of but they appear to be the same material&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never heard of an Ox Buffalo Horn comb before but apparently they manufacture these combs in China regularly.  I did some googling and found this guide:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to recognize real ox horn comb and fake ox horn comb???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1, Real ox horn comb heavy feeling, while the fake one does not&lt;br /&gt;2, Real ox horn with ox smell after burning while fake one does not&lt;br /&gt;3, Real ox horn with translucent polish, while fake one does not&lt;br /&gt;4, Real ox horn with texture while the fake one does not&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I would say this is a real Ox Buffalo Horn  Comb based on examination.  Feel free to comment if you find something else.  Either way the comb itself is worth it no matter the material because of it its thickness, length, and presentation.&lt;br /&gt;I Hope this helps you make your decision.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided this product in exchange for my honest feedback. All of my reviews are comprised of my unbiased, honest opinions.</li>
            <li> For thousands of years, combs were made from natural materials, such as bone, tortoiseshell, ivory, rubber, wood, and metal, but in the 19th century cheap plastic all but eliminated traditional combs. We have lost something with the transition. I have never used a horn comb before, so when asked to review this item, I decided to give it a look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t call this a pocket comb, but otherwise it&#x27;s quite nice. The teeth of a new plastic comb have rough ends and scratch my scalp, not so with this horn comb. My wife has long hair, so I had her give it a try. No static! Advantages of horn combs include:&lt;br /&gt;* No static electricity&lt;br /&gt;* The comb seems to slip better through hair&lt;br /&gt;* Hair seems shinier&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike a plastic comb, a horn comb can dry out, and requires some maintenance, so it should be oiled once or twice a year, using lanolin, almond oil, coconut oil, jojoba oil, olive oil, etc. Take care of your comb, and it will take care of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nos peignes respectent la nature&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our combs respect nature&lt;br /&gt;Horn is a natural, renewable and fully biodegradable material. The residues from the manufacturing processe are used to make buttons or are crushed into powder and used as natural fertilizer by farmers and local gardeners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grinding is natural, using a mixture of pumice and water. Combs are polished mechanically with a cloth. The manufacturing process does not use any solvent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fabriqu&amp;eacute; en France</li>
            <li> There is just something about a solid, sturdy comb. It feels good in the hand, smooths through the hair, and just feels expensive. And to have it made of Natural Ox Buffalo Horn is a plus. No plastics that will eventually end up in landfills, polluting the ecosphere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a really nice comb, but the packaging is also lovely. You can see photos of it in other reviews so I won&#x27;t repost photos. It would make a lovely gift for either a man or woman. It is solid black - I sort of expected it to be more &amp;#34;grained&amp;#34; than it is - it is a true solid black, but that makes no real difference. It is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a new comb, spend the money and get yourself one of these. It will last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this comb from the manufacturer in return for a realistic review. All thoughts are my own.</li>
            <li> I have always used basic plastic combs to comb my hair and never thought much about the quality of the comb I used. When it would break or get lost, I would buy another cheap comb and keep going. This is the first really nice quality comb I have ever used and I can see a big difference between it and cheaper plastic combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike a plastic comb, this one is made from a buffalo horn. It is very stiff, substantially stronger and definitely heavier. It is very difficult to scratch the surface of it though it can probably be done with a sharp object (not recommended). Being made of a single piece of horn it is hand carves and as a result it has minor imperfections that won’t be present with a poured and molded plastic comb, and these minor variances will make each comb unique and special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being the dead of winter as I write this, I have had static issues with plastic combs. This comb is different and I have had no issues at all with static when I comb with it; even trying to generate static with it, I can’t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a simple but attractive gift box with a gold-colored satin cloth and two gold-colored elastic bands to hold the comb inside. Though certainly not necessary this is a very nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the nicest comb I have ever used and I am very pleased with it. It is definitely more substantial than a typical plastic comb, it is hand-made so it has some uniqueness to it and it is thoughtfully packaged, suitable for gifting. It is more expensive than a plastic comb, but the quality and durability is the reason it costs more and the asking price is not unreasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.</li>
            <li> Great horn comb for those who are fed up with static electricity and damaged hair. Horn respects all types of hair and especially the curly and thick ones that are difficult to comb. Thus, if like me disentangle hair means suffering and sometimes tears, you really need horn combs. Not only horn combs are not aggressive for hair because they just slide on it, but above all they help to close the cuticle layers which prevents damages. It respects the scalp, does not break hair, but just eliminate the ones which fell naturally. Personally I bought a bunch of combs on Amazon, all from different sellers, but all made of horn. It has been 5 years I use only natural matter combs and I saw improvements.  If I also use natural shampoos (no paraben, etc), I definitively think that thanks to horn combs my hair is smoother, shinier and easier to comb. Moreover, natural matters are always more safe, sane, and biodegradable; horn is made of keratine and azote and will last forever if you take care of it. Remember to not wash it with shampoos or agressive products, but just natural soaps or water; always dry your comb if it is wet and try to not drop it on the floor because it would break.</li>
            <li> At 45 years old, I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve ever owned anything but a plastic comb.  Even though they were flimsy and pretty much disposable I figured they did the job.  When I received this comb I immediately was impressed with the packaging.  As you can see from the photos here the comb comes in a nice presentation box and the comb itself lives up to the presentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb is sturdy and has some nice weight to it, which I like a lot.  It does not bend like a plastic comb does and each individual tooth is quite sturdy as well.  It has a very classic look to it and it does a great job of combing my hair as well, which is really all that matters when it comes down to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a nicely made comb that should last years.  Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:7b6c5ee016c930551df6c5c69fd1f817]] I was offered this beautifully crafted handmade natural Buffalo horn comb for review and I jumped at the chance.  I usually use a brush for my rather thick hair, but my husband with thinning hair prefers a comb.  He has always used the cheap plastic black combs costing about $2.00 and was thrilled to try this handmade comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the presentation case with Chinese writing (no English) is really beautiful and would make a wonderful gift or Christmas stocking stuffer.  The comb itself is dark, almost black with a hint of tortoise shell. It is considerably thicker than a plastic comb, over twice as thick measuring over 1/4\\&quot; at it&#x27;s thickest point. It is about 6\\&quot; long and 2\\&quot; high.  The tines are a little further apart than a standard combs wider spacing (not the fine spacing). The feel is smooth with a polished finish and just plain nice to hold. When running through your hair, it feels much smoother than a plastic comb, perhaps because the tines are not as sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I am a believer in Asian medicine, I wouldn&#x27;t doubt any of the claims of a healthier scalp and better circulation.  Well worth the price and a perfect gift for anyone with hair!</li>
            <li> One of the tooth splitted into two pieces. I don&#x27;t it is made of real ox horn or maybe it is made by two pieces stick together.</li>
            <li> What a Great product! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> One of the most important aspects of any comb is that it has no sharp edges, which can fray hair over time.  Plastic combs are particularly bad, since they have a seam.  This buffalo horn comb is very well smoothed, with rounded edges.  It feels great to use.  Looking at the bristles from the side reveals the natural contours of the horn.  Otherwise, it is polished piano black.  The style is traditional, with relatively fine teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a smooth fine-toothed comb, this is a nice choice with a surprising material that also makes it good for gifting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you to the company for a review unit.</li>
            <li> I admit it, I was skeptical when Flatworld asked me to test their comb. Ox Buffalo Horn? Having used plastic combs all my life, I didn&#x27;t see a need any longer for combs to be made of horn. I thought this practice had ended. Although I have a degree in Zoology, I&#x27;m not opposed to using animal horn. I eat beef, why not use the entire animal, hoof to tail? That seems the more sensible course. So with no moral objections, I decided to give it a test run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My comb arrived in a lovely box with a floral line drawing print as well as a monochrome gray watercolor print, and a logo label in Chinese. The comb was secured in a silk-lined tray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb itself it as others have described it, heavy and smooth. It is exceptionally well finished, with teeth much smoother than any nylon or plastic comb I&#x27;ve ever owned. It also lacks the slightly rough nibs and seams that often mark such combs. I honestly expected the teeth to be slightly uneven, but they were perfect in every way, polished to a high gloss, very smooth. This is a solid old-school grooming device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In usage, I was surprised to find that I could comb my long (mid-back) hair all evening and raise no static. To be fair to plastic combs, I tend to be an excellent conductor, generating an unusual amount of static electricity under the best of circumstances. In dry weather I get shocked hundreds of times a day. During thunderstorms, while grocery shopping, I can draw an electrical arc with my fingertips from a can of vegetables over 6&amp;#34; away. Electricity and I are old enemies. So I was quite pleased that I generated zero static with this comb over the course of an hour or more of near constant combing. I know others have noticed the same effect, but when it happens to me, that&#x27;s something, because plastic combs ALWAYS raise electricity in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flat world comb has just become a fixture in my purse. At $9.99, I may order several more, so my husband can have one of his own and I can stash them in my car&#x27;s glove box and other purses. Everyone should own one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Sample provided for testing and review**and I can stash them in my car&#x27;s glove box and other purses. Everyone should own one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Sample provided for testing and review**</li>
            <li> I have one complaint and one complaint only about this comb: it smelled super-weird when I first took it out of the box. A couple of times using it on our girls&#x27; shampooed and conditioned hair in the tub took care of that, though, and now it has no discernible scent and has been working great. The teeth can flex side-to-side, but they have a wonderful tapered design that keeps them from flexing front-to-back as you comb hair. All the teeth have a nice, rounded curve to them. It glides nicely through all my girls&#x27; hair,  and it does a great job of de-tangling all those wind-blown little girl hairdos that nice weather has brought with it at the end of the day. The comb has a nice weight to it and feels extremely high quality. I would happily recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product for the purposes of examination and review. No review or particular rating was promised in return, and the opinions expressed here are my own following my first-hand experiences with this product.</li>
            <li> Hey, it&#x27;s just a comb right? Well, I was quite impressed. I guess because I&#x27;ve never had a come this luxurious... they&#x27;ve all been plastic, at least as far as I can remember. This comb felt substantial, and it just feels better when using it than cheap plastic combs; it feels much smoother running across my head than the plastic points on plastic combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something like this would make for a great gift. It&#x27;s not really that expensive but it is very likely to get used a lot. Anyone using a plastic comb would probably stop using it right away and switch to this much nicer one (I am!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was very nice too... but was not in English.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I was sent a free product sample for review. I was not paid or told what to write.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2015-06-05: Be careful not to drop this comb. I &amp;#34;lost a tooth&amp;#34; by doing so onto a tile floor.</li>
            <li> Easily glides through my hair. Very little scent. The comb feels nice in my hand; powerful somehow, like holding a knife.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have described this well - it is rather large, appears to be plastic in that it has a glossy black finish, but it is heavier than you would normally expect for a plastic comb, and it does not necessarily sound like plastic if you rap it against another hard surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes packaged in a nice box, entirely labeled and decorated in Chinese, very nice but very unhelpful in knowing anything about how it is made, where it is from (obviously China although unless you can read Chinese I don&#x27;t think you can know that for sure, as it could be Taiwan or conceivably even Japan), or anything else. Whatever you are going to learn about this product, you will get it here on this Amazon page, period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife says it is very nice to use in combing your hair. Myself being follicle deficient, that is less easily determined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes this different, and rather special, is this - it does seem to indeed be made from horn, as the description claims here on Amazon. I say that because fellow reviewer Rob has very kindly sacrificed his own comb in the interest of clarifying this important point, and as you can see from his video review posted to this product, he broke the comb in half so that he could determine for himself whether or not it was plastic, or horn as claimed. Please go to Rob&#x27;s review and give him a &#x27;helpful&#x27; vote because I think that he deserves it more than any other reviewer here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For ten bucks I think this is a rather unique and nice gift, for those on the list who have sufficient hair to make good use of this comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do feel that I should add this one reservation - I have no idea how &#x27;endangered&#x27; or not buffalo are, but I am sensitive to the fact that products such as this one have, over the years, been responsible for the devastation of certain kinds of animals. Elephants come to mind, where they have been harvested simply to get their tusks, for the creation of little trinkets similar to this comb. I wouldn&#x27;t want to have this comb in my cupboard and then one day open the paper to read about how buffalo are now extinct in China because they&#x27;ve all been killed in order to harvest their horn materials. You see what I mean? So I hate to throw a damper on this whole horn thing, but I do have to admit that I might have reservations myself in buying one of these. Even if there are lots of buffalo around to supply horn material for them.

            <li> Well....  First of all,  I have no idea what Natural Ox Buffalo Horn is or how it feels.  But this comb is tough, sturdy, hard.  So, that is one indication that it must be ox buffalo horn.  There is a 6-month guarantee if you break it, but it is so sturdy that you will lose it before you break it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb is geared to do more than just run teeth through your hair.  It is designed to massage your scalp....yes, a few strokes and it does that;  increase blood circulation......  yes,  the comb hits on the scalp and will increase pressure more than a normal comb.  The teeth are strategically placed for moving easily through thicker hair, or tangled hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again,  this is a heavy duty, thick, sturdy comb, and not plastic.  It does what it set out to do....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With 5&amp;#34; in length, you can keep it in the main bathroom,  throw it in a bag,  and even in a shirt pocket.  Also, one note,  it comes in its own gift box, but the lettering and/or info is not in English.  Review for product.  Rizzo</li>
            <li> Given To Me For An Honest Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flatworld® Handmade Natural Ox Buffalo Horn Comb Pocket Comb - Black Hair Brush (Classic Black A) by Flatworld is simple design and is hand carved with smooth edged teeth. It came with the following note:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  Keep away from fire.&lt;br /&gt;*  Avoid throwing, bending and high temperatures.&lt;br /&gt;*  Don&#x27;t put it in the sun for longer exposure.&lt;br /&gt;*  Keep it in a ventilated enviroment.&lt;br /&gt;*  Use a very soft brush to clean between the teeth with cool water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not experience any static electricity while combing my hair or right after combing my hair. And I loved it. This is definitely not a plastic comb. It looks and feels as high quality. The picture does not do it justice. This is a beautiful comb and it&#x27;s unisex. For this quality it is reasonably priced. It would make a great gift and as you know Christmas is coming. I highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> (Disclaimer - My wife and I were invited by the seller to try and review their products. We only agree to these requests when it&#x27;s something we would actually use. The fact we received them for free has no bearing on our review, and we have written negative reviews in the past for products we were sent for free. Also, for this type of invited review, we always begin with a disclaimer.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife is from Fujian, the province that manufactures and exports buffalo horn combs, and she&#x27;s used many in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a typical comb, it passes the grade and is perfectly normal, without any noticeable issues, but it is not a 5-star rating, high quality comb. A really high quality buffalo horn comb should be heavier, conform to the curvature of the horn, and have visible growth pattern texture of the horn itself that cannot be smoothed away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice comb, but it&#x27;s likely that the comb was made from other buffalo parts such as compressed grounded hooves or other hard substance found on an buffalo. It&#x27;s unlikely it is made from the horn, since a real buffalo horn comb would be a lot more expensive and look/feel different.</li>
            <li> Love this! I&#x27;ll never go back to plastic combs</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:c5d53148047c9a55ef20d93488266001]] Please note: I received a free sample for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made the video to show off both the comb and the box.  If you plan to give this as a gift, the box is fantastic.  This absolutely doesn&#x27;t come in a plain cardboard box!  Very nice artwork on the front of the box and a nicely made interior.  If you&#x27;re getting it for yourself, it&#x27;s a bit of an unexpected treat - but the real value (IMO) is if you send this as a gift.  It just makes a nice presentation piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb itself is...and I admit that I find myself surprised to be saying this...very nice.  I&#x27;m not surprised that it&#x27;s nice, mind you.  I&#x27;m surprised that I&#x27;m actually saying that about a COMB.  A tool that I&#x27;ve used for decades and never given much thought, and yet - I&#x27;m saying it.  :)  It has a super nice feel to it.  Nice heft without being heavy, and completely smooth all around.  Also, the teeth in the comb are large enough that they never feel like they are poking at my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I make a remark in the video about not really knowing if it&#x27;s natural horn or plastic.  I didn&#x27;t mean that as an insult to the product, but rather simply acknowledging that this could actually be plastic and probably still feel like it does.  However, the description mentions not causing static because it is made of horn, and I can say that when I used this on my pooch Niki, there was zero static - completely unlike when I use either a plastic or metal comb on her. [UPDATE: I washed the comb off and smelled it.  Yep, it&#x27;s definitely natural horn.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I find myself oddly enamored by this comb.  It&#x27;s well made and comfortable to use.  I give it two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> 5 stars - Quality comb!&lt;br /&gt;This truly is a quality comb, so nice it could be given as a gift you would be proud to give, and comes in a nice looking gift box. Unlike plastic combs it has a hefty weight, is smooth/polished material that feels nice in the hand, and the teeth are completely smooth and nicely spaced.  It combs through hair with no snags or pulls and is very comfortable on the scalp with smooth ends of teeth that massage scalp instead of sharp scratching.  Another plus is no static when combing, even in dry Santa Ana type weather.  This solid comb won&#x27;t bend out of shape and is sized to carry with you.  I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;PS:&lt;br /&gt;  The above is per my lovely wife. MY USMC Haircut was lost on this.</li>

            <li> Plastic combs are a thing of the past! This is a beautiful comb that would make a nice gift. It will fit in a pocket but it might be a little bulky for that. It is really nicely finished and hard to believe that it is buffalo horn. Since buffalo don&#x27;t shed their horns, it comes as a bi-product of the ever growing bison meat market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes packaged in a cardboard box with a yellow satin interior. The outside of the box is printed with Chinese characters and a pretty scene. It feels great going across your scalp as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> This comb is absolutely gorgeous. Produced from buffalo horn, it harkens back to an era before plastics dominated every element of our lives--our foods are contained in plastic, our cloths are made from it,  our furniture, our appliances, I even have a plastic tooth in my mouth.  However, this  six inch comb is all natural, has a good heft to it, and is made with quality. Its affordable luxury. Combing your hair is easy, since your hair glides through the smooth, thick teeth. Like all natural buffalo horn, there is a little bit of variation to the color, throughout the comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb arrives in a beautiful gift box, inspired by Chinese art.  Actually, I&#x27;m impressed by the gift box. For that reason, I&#x27;d like to suggest to anyone considering a purchase of this comb, to go ahead and buy two of them. One for yourself, and one to keep back to give for a birthday present, or for a Holiday gift. Anyone would love this comb, provided two things--  1. They are a mammal, with hair on their heads.  2. They don&#x27;t wear dreadlocks. So perhaps your mother, sister, wife or daughter is a mammal, and isn&#x27;t a Rastafarian. Then this would be the perfect gift for them. The gift box, and the natural elegance of the comb, will impress whomever you would give it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company gave me a comb, in exchange for an honest review of the product.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:bb7911fbfef3a60e3c2c767378bcabff]]I remember these way back when I was a kid.  These are not cheap plastic combs although they may seem like if you haven&#x27;t touched it yet.  The one we had before are smaller and lighter.  They are naturally dark brown to black in color. They are tough as a nail.  You may think it may hurt your scalp but on the contrary, if they are well polished as these combs are, they are more gentle and just glide smoothly on your scalp.  Also less likely to get charged with static electricity.  They are durable that I have seen some that passes as a heirloom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came in a nice presentable box with a satin like fabric as a backdrop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample item was sent to me for review and evaluation.</li>
