            <li>You can just imagine how many.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the fact it is comprised of organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li>but it sure doesn&#x27;t take them away.</li>
            <li>This cream does the magic.</li>
            <li>The lotion was ok</li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Its very soothing and smells great.</li>
            <li>I do t think i have found something that does this and smells so lovely.</li>
            <li>The cream is not greasy at all, leaves my skin feeling so soft and smooth, and the scent of the cream is so pleasant!</li>
            <li>but i can tell my skin is more smooth where the marks are.</li>
            <li>For men the scent may come off to strong but as far as a woman I feel like it would be a great cream.</li>
            <li>easy to apply, no greasy or sticky residue.</li>
            <li>No fake rose scent here</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using it</li>
            <li>Lotion is smooth.</li>
            <li>It is light on the skin.</li>
            <li>This is smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>I used the product at night after my shower and before bed and the rose scent was really relaxing, however if I were to put it on in the morning I could not wear perfume as the scents would have been overlapping.</li>
            <li>product was sent to me free for a review.</li>
            <li>, it goes on smoothly and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice cream, it smell like fresh roses very softly and it feels super silky in the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really excited to see my end results in about a month or two.</li>
            <li>It is so rich that it just melts into the skin.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t like rose scented body products but since this has an authentic rose scent it is different for me</li>
            <li>My skin feels super smooth and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I have to say it&#x27;s as good as anything I&#x27;ve ever used and makes me realize that I don&#x27;t need to spend over a hundred dollars to get the same luxury.</li>
            <li>While I can&#x27;t be sure that the cream stopped the stretch marks, I&#x27;m pleased to report that after applying it every day in the last 4 months of pregnancy, I remained stretch mark free.</li>
            <li>I use it on my feet as well, and it has accomplished what many feet creams can&#x27;t do.  </li>
            <li>It is marketed as a body cream, but it is of such good quality that I am using it on my face,</li>
            <li>but the scent is pretty strong.</li>
            <li>I bought this lotion when I was pregnant in order to moisturize my skin and remove stretch marks.</li>
            <li>It smells like heaven on Earth, it&#x27;s not greasy, but super hydrating, and it makes your skin feel like silk.</li>
            <li>texture of the cream is very light as well as the smell, it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy and it absorbs pretty fast; it feels luxurious.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it so far</li>
            <li>The scent is also like fresh roses.</li>
            <li>I am surprised I liked this scent so much.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a very nice moisturizer, makes your skin soft and silky.</li>
            <li>In addition, the packaging is very pretty and the cream is luxurious; thick and beautifully scented.</li>
            <li>I truly believe after few more weeks the results will be even better.</li>
            <li>and if you like me moisturize every day it would last you 3 weeks top.</li>
            <li>i love this product, i recently lost weight and this helps on my stomach and outer thighs.</li>
            <li>This product feels absolutely decadent!  </li>
            <li>As far as the looks of the product goes, its very classy and I am able to bring the jar with me even to work and no one knows the difference between a skin moisturizing lotion and a stretch mark cream lotion.</li>
            <li>I try to live a chemical free life whenever possible , so when this cream was recommended to me my first question was is it paraben free .</li>
            <li>but I thought this cream deserved it because within 2 months of use the stretch marks have pretty much</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t have very high hopes for that.</li>
            <li>There is very little of it, though, so I am glad I didn&#x27;t pay full price.</li>
            <li>Very watery.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen much results with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting ready for summer.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It moisturized really well without leaving my skin greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Very exspensive</li>
            <li>I get very dry skin on my face due to using face washes, and this cream is a much better moisturizer for my face than what I was using before (cocoa butter) because even though it was a good moisturizer, it left my face shiny and oily.</li>
            <li>and it is very light for everyday use</li>
            <li>packaging is high end.</li>
            <li>As for the stretch marks and scars I will see what happens in the next few weeks, but thought it was so amazingly soft and made me skin feel so smooth that I thought I should share!!</li>
            <li>and hence my belly was pretty big during pregnancy (everybody kept asking me if I was having twins, which was not the case).</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>My marks are not completely gone, of course, but they are so much lighter!</li>
            <li>and I like that the ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li>I hope all the stretch marks will completely disappear.</li>
            <li>and it makes my skin so soft</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and the ingredient list is reassuring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think a cream has made my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>The cream for me was relatively expensive but certainly worth it as the results have been outstanding.</li>
            <li>It softens your skin well but can be a problem for pregnant women due to its high strange aroma</li>
            <li>The rose pedals scent isn&#x27;t to bad but being 7 months pregnant</li>
            <li>The jar is now pretty much empty, so I decided to try out 5 others and this was one of them.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any new stretch marks in this current pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pregnant and I&#x27;ve used 2 times everyday.</li>
            <li>I used it second trimester onward and have had no stretch marks so far!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The heavy glass jar has a wide metal lid that is easy to open and it is packaged in a recyclable box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a little bit of stretch mark on my line cause I tends to gain weight there first.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive and very dry skin</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I bought this lotion when I was pregnant in order to moisturize my skin and remove stretch marks. It smells nice if you like rose water you would like it but the scent is pretty strong. It doesn&#x27;t last very long because that jar is pretty shallow and if you like me moisturize every day it would last you 3 weeks top. It didn&#x27;t fade my stretchmarks but I didn&#x27;t have very high hopes for that. Overall it&#x27;s a very nice moisturizer, makes your skin soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Smells great it&#x27;s not oily at all, might have to order more.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice cream, it smell like fresh roses very softly and it feels super silky in the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have notice it moisturize my skin and leave it much better looking. I really enjoy using it and it is very light for everyday use</li>
            <li> I love this cream!  I&#x27;m on my third jar and can&#x27;t get enough of it.  My husband got it for me to prevent stretch marks. I&#x27;m expecting twins and with my belly growing and expanding (I&#x27;m 6 months), I have not seen 1 single stretch mark- knock on wood.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the results and the smell is divine!  We&#x27;ll continue buying it.  The price is excellent too.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> My second child was a big baby and hence my belly was pretty big during pregnancy (everybody kept asking me if I was having twins, which was not the case). After he was born the stretch marks appeared and I discovered the product about 4 months after giving birth. I thought since time had passed it&#x27;d be harder to get rid of them (if that was possible at all) but this miracle cream made it happen.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not one to write reviews that often, but I thought this cream deserved it because within 2 months of use the stretch marks have pretty much vanished!&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the cream is very light as well as the smell, it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy and it absorbs pretty fast; it feels luxurious.&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a little over a month and I must say I&#x27;m suprised and so happy it seems to be working so well. My marks are not completely gone, of course, but they are so much lighter! I&#x27;ll definitely keep using it. In fact I just got my second jar!!!</li>
            <li> Non greasy, smells great, easily absorbed into the skin and love the fact that it is chemical free. I used it second trimester onward and have had no stretch marks so far!</li>
            <li> Very watery. Haven&#x27;t seen much results with this product. The rose pedals scent isn&#x27;t to bad but being 7 months pregnant I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> The smell is really nice. Lotion is smooth. There is very little of it, though, so I am glad I didn&#x27;t pay full price. I don&#x27;t have any stretch marks and I like that the ingredients are natural. Product also arrived on time.</li>
            <li> It smells so good and I loved the texture.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any new stretch marks in this current pregnancy.</li>
            <li> This product was shipped to my residence approximately 3 weeks ago. I have managed to use this product at least once a day if not twice (before I go to bed). As far as the looks of the product goes, its very classy and I am able to bring the jar with me even to work and no one knows the difference between a skin moisturizing lotion and a stretch mark cream lotion. So far its hard to tell whether or not the product is reducing the appearance of stretch marks or not. At times, there seems to be a difference and in other lighting it doesn&#x27;t look as though.  For the price and the reviews I feel like the cream is well worth the money as it does seem to moisturize the skin and has a wonderful smell of a rose. For men the scent may come off to strong but as far as a woman I feel like it would be a great cream.</li>
            <li> I try to live a chemical free life whenever possible , so when this cream was recommended to me my first question was is it paraben free . It is , it&#x27;s also smells beautiful and feels wonderful on , this is one cream I&#x27;m very happy with</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband who used to be obese and had horrible stretch marks when he lost so much weight. This cream seems to of worked really well and has helped him greatly. The cream is soothing and smells nice so its not a problem to use it.</li>
            <li> My husband bought it for me as a gift, but I use it as a moisturizer, not a stretch mark cream. It&#x27;s the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth, not oily at all. I get very dry skin on my face due to using face washes, and this cream is a much better moisturizer for my face than what I was using before (cocoa butter) because even though it was a good moisturizer, it left my face shiny and oily. Wonderful cream, and not just for stretchmarks!</li>
            <li> Oh where do i start...I have 7 kids and a ton of stretch marks. You can just imagine how many. My body is covered in them. I&#x27;v been searching for a stretch mark cream forever. I have only been using this for a week now but i can tell my skin is more smooth where the marks are. I&#x27;m really excited to see my end results in about a month or two. I&#x27;m getting ready for summer. So hopefully by then i will see a change. I will update in about a month.</li>
            <li> I have a little bit of stretch mark on my line cause I tends to gain weight there first. I think this helps to make the stretch mark appear less visible.</li>
            <li> This product is incredible! I&#x27;ve been dealing with dry, rough skin for as long as I can remember, and with this product, I no longer have to worry about it. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> WOW! I am overly impressed by this stretch mark cream! My girlfriend has been using it since she gave birth and the stretch marks have literally just disappeared! The cream for me was relatively expensive but certainly worth it as the results have been outstanding.</li>
            <li> i love this product, i recently lost weight and this helps on my stomach and outer thighs. easy to apply, no greasy or sticky residue. already noticing a difference after 2 weeks. looking forward to the results in 2 months...</li>
            <li> This is an amazing cream for stretch marks. I have been putting them on for only a week and I can already see results. I couldn&#x27;t believe it is actually fading little by little. I can&#x27;t wait to use for one month. I hope all the stretch marks will completely disappear.</li>
            <li> This product feels absolutely decadent!  It has a rich and creamy quality that has had a wonderful impact on the texture of my skin.  I love the smell and the fact it is comprised of organic ingredients.  I will be a repeat customer!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells a, azing! I love it so far and it makes my skin so soft</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using the cream for a few weeks and it&#x27;s nit doing anything for my stretch marks. Maybe it helps prevent them but it sure doesn&#x27;t take them away. Good moisturizer but for stretch marks I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it ..There are no result after i use two cans of cream</li>
            <li> This is really great product for stretch marks. I hate to see stretch marks on my belly, arms and legs which are now faded away. I am so amazed to see it.&lt;br /&gt;It has great scent into it. It does not leave greasy effect on my skin. I have tried few creams in the past but nothing worked. This cream does the magic. I have sensitive and very dry skin and this keeps my body moist and does its job to fade the stretch marks away.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is high end. It has great rose scent. It is light on the skin. None greasy effect.</li>
            <li> This is smooth and creamy. I use it nightly to help lighten my tummy</li>
            <li> I dont have stretch mark, but used to hate putting skin moisturizer because it feel sticky. But this actually different. It dies not leave that type of feeling at all. It makes the skin smoother.</li>
            <li> This cream is great. I had 3 kids so trust me my skin can use some amazing cellulite  cream and this is it....it works wonders and I can see results after just few days of using it. My skin feels firmer and stronger. I truly believe after few more weeks the results will be even better.</li>
            <li> Stretch marks have always been a problem for me, so I jumped at the chance to try this cream. I got really bad stretch marks on my stomach after having my daughter, and started using this right away, and I think they are starting to fade already! The cream is not greasy at all, leaves my skin feeling so soft and smooth, and the scent of the cream is so pleasant! Would definitely purchase again!  I did receive this product at a reduced rate to give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pregnant and I&#x27;ve used 2 times everyday. I like the scent and hydrating and hopefully not get stretch marks until the end of pregnancy in 2015/March</li>
            <li> The lotion was ok but I did not like the smell</li>
            <li> The product is amazing, I used it as just a body lotion, not to reduce stretch marks. It moisturized really well without leaving my skin greasy at all. I used the product at night after my shower and before bed and the rose scent was really relaxing, however if I were to put it on in the morning I could not wear perfume as the scents would have been overlapping. I wish the product had come in a plastic container so I didn&#x27;t need to worry about dropping it while putting it on after my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was sent to me free for a review.</li>
            <li> I treated myself to a jar of Crème de la Mer whilst on vacation recently and adored the thickness of the cream and the feeling of luxury when applying it. The jar is now pretty much empty, so I decided to try out 5 others and this was one of them. I have to say it&#x27;s as good as anything I&#x27;ve ever used and makes me realize that I don&#x27;t need to spend over a hundred dollars to get the same luxury. In addition, the packaging is very pretty and the cream is luxurious; thick and beautifully scented.</li>
            <li> I have just started using this cream. I like how it makes my skin feel after using it, it goes on smoothly and is not greasy. I have been using it on trouble spots from having kids and it is already helping I can start to see my stretch marks starting to fade. I received this item in exchange for an honest review</li>
            <li> I cannot stand the smell of this cream. After some hours of having it applied, it starts smelling really bad. It softens your skin well but can be a problem for pregnant women due to its high strange aroma</li>
            <li> My mother didn&#x27;t get stretch marks during pregnancy but my sister did so I didn&#x27;t want to take any chances... While I can&#x27;t be sure that the cream stopped the stretch marks, I&#x27;m pleased to report that after applying it every day in the last 4 months of pregnancy, I remained stretch mark free. One tub also lasted for 4 months and smells great.</li>
            <li> OMG!!!!!!!!! Love this moisturizer.  It smells like heaven on Earth, it&#x27;s not greasy, but super hydrating, and it makes your skin feel like silk. My skin feels super smooth and hydrated.  I use it on my feet as well, and it has accomplished what many feet creams can&#x27;t do.  Love It!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a luscious skin butter with a wonderful rose scent. It has a pale pink color and the consistency of whipped mayonnaise. It is so rich that it just melts into the skin. It is marketed as a body cream, but it is of such good quality that I am using it on my face, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It immediately improves the appearance of dry, flaky, or ashy areas. Apply it after bathing to moisturize, condition, and protect the skin against drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and the ingredient list is reassuring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heavy glass jar has a wide metal lid that is easy to open and it is packaged in a recyclable box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maroc100 provided a jar for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredient list from label: Deionized Water, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Emulsifying Wax NF, Stearic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Vitis Vinifera (Grape Seed) Oil, Argania Spinosa (Argan Oil), Organic Alcohol, Organic Camellia sinensis (Green Tea) Extract, Organic Aphanizomenon flos aquae (Blue Green Algae) Extract, Organic Urtica dioica (Nettle) Extract, Organic Stellaria media (Chickweed) Extract, Organic Ulmus rubra (Slippery Elm) Extract, Organic Silybum marianum (Milk Thistle) Extract, Organic Althaea officinalis (Marshmallow Root) Extract, and Organic Avena sativa (Oatstraw) Extract, Glyceryl Monostearate, Fragrance, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Allantoin, Phenoxyethanol and Caprylyl Glycol (Optiphen®).</li>
            <li> Its very soothing and smells great. Would be great if quantity is increased</li>
            <li> the smell of this is so so strong you can&#x27;t put this on!! The scent stays all day too. I have allergies and it is just tooo over bearing! Very exspensive</li>
            <li> I have only been using this cream for a few days, but it has such a velvety buttery feel to the skin. I don&#x27;t think a cream has made my skin feel so soft. The scent is also like fresh roses. No fake rose scent here and it lingers for quite a while. If you do not like the scent of roses you mean get not care for this, but I normally don&#x27;t like rose scented body products but since this has an authentic rose scent it is different for me some how. I am surprised I liked this scent so much. As for the stretch marks and scars I will see what happens in the next few weeks, but thought it was so amazingly soft and made me skin feel so smooth that I thought I should share!! What a great gift in my opinion too. I do t think i have found something that does this and smells so lovely.</li>
            <li> The best cream ever it feels great</li>
