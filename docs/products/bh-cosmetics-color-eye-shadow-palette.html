            <li>I can honestly tell you that this is the best color palette I have used under $[...]!</li>
            <li>Ive have a Shanny shimmer palette and its great</li>
            <li>I decided to buy this because of the great reviews.  </li>
            <li>(great size for traveling which is a plus.    </li>

            <li>Great colors.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and would order again.</li>
            <li>The colors blend very nicely with this technique as well.</li>
            <li>BH Cosmetics is a great company with good quality, affordable products.</li>
            <li>i love it its awesome</li>
            <li>The colors are lovely but the quality is amature at best.</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful and the packaging is so nice.</li>
            <li>my professional blush palette came in PERFECT condition, and my liquid eyeliner pen is perfect as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is good if you&#x27;re just getting in to makeup, and you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot on an eye shadow palette.</li>
            <li>so I thought hey they must be good</li>
            <li>I have a good impression from this branch.</li>
            <li>Some of the colors are a bit powdery but are still fairly pigmented.</li>
            <li>But this is still a good product</li>
            <li>The makeup itself is good.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was a good product to buy.</li>
            <li>This is good palette for the price</li>
            <li>This has to be applied with a good brush and a primer.</li>
            <li>Not all of the colors are matte but the shimmer ones are at a minimum and are actually good to add with the matte colors in my opinion.</li>
            <li>If you work with it, you can get a good payoff, but you do have to work at it.</li>
            <li>The color is good</li>
            <li>but its a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li>Hey I ordered my palette &amp; it came pretty quick,however one or two of the colors were alittle smudged up which i wasnt happy about however the quality &amp; colors were great!!</li>
            <li>I had heard SO many great things about it.</li>
            <li>Cute colors, great price.</li>
            <li>what can I say I love it!  </li>
            <li>I rather spend one or two dollars more to have it not damaged that to have it come in the condition I received mine in!</li>
            <li>Love my shadows!</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this out when I got it!</li>
            <li>The colors are amazing...</li>
            <li>I love the bright colors.  </li>
            <li>so I decided to purchase the product because there were a lot of colors I don&#x27;t have in my own collection.</li>
            <li>I will probaly give it to my nice since she likes to play around with make up.  </li>
            <li>it is gorgeous :)...</li>
            <li>I make my own with a combination of oils and beeswax.</li>
            <li>The variety of colors are good, filling in where I don&#x27;t have the color I want in my better brands.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the absolute best</li>
            <li>THE COLORS ARE GROUPED IN COOL AND WARM SHADES, AND IT IS VERY EASY TO PICK OUT WHAT COLORS GO GREAT TOGETHER.</li>
            <li>Except the color&#x27;s fall out very easily.</li>
            <li>Most of them are though and the ones that aren&#x27;t are still nice colors that I will and have used.</li>
            <li>i love the BH Cosmetics line and it has been an amazing experience to find such a perfect product.</li>
            <li>but with some colors you will need to scrape the top to pick up the shadow with your brush.</li>
            <li>i love the color..</li>
            <li>I received the product and it was just okay.</li>
            <li>but it wasnt that much.u wuld definately need a primer to make sure the color lasts all day.</li>
            <li>so with that in mind, i say this palette is ok.</li>
            <li>it culd&#x27;ve been packaged better and</li>
            <li>I would recommend you to take caution before buying :-)</li>
            <li>but overall, its GREAT !</li>
            <li>not so sure..  </li>
            <li>I love this color palette, looking forward to getting another one.</li>
            <li>It is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>They are not as pigmented as the 88 shimmer palette which i&#x27;ve had for about a year (and love it)</li>
            <li>Most of the colors are matte but there are about 5 or so</li>
            <li>All the videos showed them touching the palette with tons of color coming off</li>
            <li>and pinks are ok...</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>They treated me with respect and really care that I was happy.</li>
            <li>more stunning on the eye than in the kit.  </li>
            <li>Need better packaging.</li>
            <li>With BH, it does give me a better color.</li>
            <li>With this, I&#x27;m satisfied with the</li>
            <li>I was very excited to recieve this item in the mail</li>
            <li>( it is great because it has every color you could ever need) or even to older girls who want to expand their collection but do not want to spend alot of money.</li>
            <li>I managed to get the beautiful, rich color I wanted that was very close to the color in the pan.</li>
            <li>i was sooo excited to get this!</li>
            <li>it was worth the money!!....  </li>
            <li>The colors looked so good on screen &amp; the reviews all spoke positive about this palette.</li>
            <li>it was so clean!</li>
            <li>and the most important</li>
            <li>it arrived in beautiful packaging but the eyeshadows are sooo cheap and chalky once on the eyes, yet they feel soft when i swatched them with my finger tip.</li>
            <li>The product came sooner than I expected, and in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li>This palette so far has been great.</li>
            <li>This may be a good starter tool for a teenager or some one not in to make-up that much.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much, I ended up using a bit of it myself.</li>
            <li>Honestly though this was worth the money.</li>
            <li>but overall, great product :)</li>
            <li>Straight from the pan onto the lid, no base, gives you a fairly transparent color.</li>
            <li>I just received my eye shadow palette by BH cosmetics, I usually don&#x27;t take the time to write reviews,  this is a great color set of eye shadows, hey are rich and great matte colors,  </li>
            <li>The package it came in was pretty beat up, but we all know things kind of get tossed around in transit.</li>
            <li>but once I did that it was fine.</li>
            <li>These eye shadows are great, the only problem I have is not all of them are matte</li>
            <li>And I am definately glad I bought it, definately worth the money.</li>
            <li>The colors look great in the pan, but they simply aren&#x27;t as pigmented as my Larenim or my BareMinerals.</li>
            <li>I have ordered the 88 neutral palette directly from them and really loved it</li>
            <li>I wouldnt buy another pallette since this one has so many colors, but i will definitely put this one too good use.</li>
            <li>they look really pretty!!    </li>
            <li>I am sooo very satisfied, the colors are very rich and vibrant, looks exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast and everything arrived safe and secure.  </li>
            <li>Actually, I&#x27;m pretty sure that some of my co-workers have already started the process in ordering theirs.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product and was extremely excited to get it.</li>
            <li>so get the Shipping right!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been in to makeup, and I thought with this palette it would be a good starting point, with all the colors to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They arent very pigmented, but thankfully I have my nyx jumbo eyeshadow pencil in milk that I put on my lid first that makes them pretty bright, so</li>
            <li>The colors are true and stay on all day.</li>
            <li>My complexion is dark and these colors show up beautifully.  </li>
            <li>A good make-up brush is essential for packing on the shadows.    </li>
            <li>Overall this is a good product.</li>
            <li>Some colors won&#x27;t apply very well but most do.  </li>
            <li>I bought this palette because there are a ton of colors, which is true.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion - You&#x27;ll get a lot of different colors for a good price, but expect what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Well when I opened it up it read \\&quot;cool matte\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>but overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>And while it doesn&#x27;t smudge as in the first experiment, the shadow creases very quickly, within an hour.</li>
            <li>The colors come out so rich, not like other cheap brands that look good in the package</li>
            <li>I AM TRYING TO LEARN DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES OF MAKE-UP, AND THIS IS THE PERFECT STARTING KIT.</li>
            <li>I am use to using MAC eye shadows, which have highly pigmented &amp; sexy colors.</li>
            <li>This make-up is great, I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking for a little fun in their life!</li>
            <li>Favorite new palette I&#x27;ve gotten.</li>
            <li>Buy this if you want a hot look!</li>
            <li>The colors are decently pigmented on my eyelid without a primer, so I can only imagine how nicely they&#x27;ll show up with a primer!</li>
            <li>Amazing quality brushes for a low cost.</li>
            <li>Bought each of my daughters this set for Christmas and they were thrilled and still use it now over a year later!</li>
            <li>so none came broken, the colors are great quality (but you should always use primer for even better quality), not all the colors are matte, some have a shimmer too(but</li>
            <li>I will try and keep at with the hopes of loving it in the future.</li>
            <li>The colors are very pigmented and they last for a good while.</li>
            <li>I mean, considering how many colors I got, it was a REALLY good deal.  </li>
            <li>most of the colors come out pretty nicely, some of them seemed chalky and kindof broke off a little when i used my fingers to pick up some of the color.    </li>
            <li>The reason why I gave it one star is because the eyeshadows are highly pigmented, which is a good thing in my opinion since they are only about the size of a dime.  </li>
            <li>I know it was damaged right away because</li>
            <li>and right away I pulled out my brushes and started playing with colors.</li>
            <li>Okay let me first say I did not order this from Amazon but from BH directly and from their website.</li>
            <li>Although the colors were very colorful and vibrant, I had to dig into the colors just to put sum on the brush.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping</li>
            <li>it was a good buy since the colors are rich in texture &amp; pigment because it would surely last me a long time.</li>
            <li>The hinge that makes it so that you can open the top was bracken so the top and bottom were totally separated, and there was rainbow eyeshadow EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li>i was actually deciding between BH &amp; coastal scents, but heard BH pigment is better.</li>
            <li>But I know I am definitely going to buy another eye shadow palette that promises better results in the depth of their colors.</li>
            <li>Thanks BH !</li>
            <li>overall it&#x27;s an ok product..for the price.</li>
            <li>I guess the eyeshadows are just more fragile than everything else.</li>
            <li>However, in terms of quality, it&#x27;s exactly what you&#x27;re paying for you.</li>
            <li>The colors in this palette are pigmented and you get more than enough.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not all matte (but it works out very well!)</li>
            <li>Fair price, but some of the colors don&#x27;t have much pigmentation, like the dark ones.&lt;br /&gt;Reds</li>
            <li>the color is so beautiful on the dark ones but the color falls off almost instantly!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried various things, playing with different application techniques to get a good color, and here are my results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received my palette super fast and was excited to open it up and try it.</li>
            <li>This palette is small, compact, and good for the price.</li>
            <li>and I like what I created but, even with using a primer or NYX Milk &amp; Pure Gold Jumbo Pencil</li>
            <li>But I called the bh cosmetics company and they sent me a new set, free of charge, which surprised me.</li>
            <li>there is much to choose from.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>These eyeshadows hurt my eyes so much that I had to stand under a shower, fully clothed, and wash my eyes out.</li>
            <li>have used the color palette because one of my friends owns it, but I really wanted it.</li>
            <li>the item came a whole lot sooner than what i had anticipated it to come.</li>
            <li>You have to REALLY dig in to it, to get the colors to stand out the way that you would want them to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the palette is still unusual to deal with.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t work very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I would recommend this to all of my friends that enjoy doing make-up and experimenting with different eye looks.</li>
            <li>Secondly, I would like to state that I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, and can wear things that most people can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>im sure nobody wants a palette with a crushed eyeshadow    </li>
            <li>I recommend this product and I am definitely buying it again- maybe trying it in warm colors or tropical next time!</li>
            <li>I still use this today and honestly I don&#x27;t use makeup everyday, but with that being said I haven&#x27;t reached the bottom of any colors.</li>
            <li>, colors are very pigmented; the only thing is that I thought the circle shape of each shadow was bigger, but in general as it is the very first palette I own</li>
            <li>I believe the prices are the same, the only difference is that you may have to pay for shipping on the bh cosmetics website, but IT IS WORTH IT!!!</li>
            <li>Just like many other people leaving reviews, my palette arrived damaged.</li>
            <li>I am able to get enough product to stick to my lid to get a decent opacity, but couldn&#x27;t get a really good, dramatic effect.</li>
            <li>so u will only get a full refund.</li>
            <li>i have to just sit the top of the case on the bottom half (if that makes sense)</li>
            <li>Once applied the colors were not as vibrant as they seem in the packed.</li>
            <li>but no, it&#x27;s actually quite compact and smaller than most netbooks.</li>
            <li>High pigmentation.</li>
            <li>and I saw that it was highly rated</li>
            <li>the colors r tiny but its worth 16.95.</li>
            <li>(I use it everyday and you can make so many looks with it)!I</li>
            <li>There is still enough of it left for the event I needed it for, and the rest of the colors will be nice to have for future events.</li>
            <li>I always wanted to buy this product and finally did and its pretty decent.</li>
            <li>so I also recommend this to new makeup users to get you started</li>
            <li>I just ordered the 120 palette and can&#x27;t wait to try some new colors.</li>
            <li>My two only draw backs were the cost of shipping (more so the custom taxes) which should have been expected</li>
            <li>First off, there is no red in this palette.</li>
            <li>but this was my first non-book shipment &amp; the actual size of the eyeshadow pieces.</li>
            <li>First, I ONLY purchased this because I thought it was TALC-FREE ..</li>
            <li>I was not expecing to see any shimmer, but I find that I use these colors pretty regularly.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to bother returning it because the price was so cheap that it&#x27;s not worth the hassle.  </li>
            <li>Maybe next time around I&#x27;ll get EXACTLY what I ordered.....</li>
            <li>I have to continuously dab for more and by that time I have made such a mess.</li>
            <li>I bought this palette because it clearly states \\&quot;matte palette\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t surprised.</li>
            <li>After hearing so much about this palette on YouTube and from devoted customers, I finally decided to purchase this palette.  </li>
            <li>The first problem was that the product took a long time to arrive.</li>
            <li>I did not order this product on Amazon but directly from the company directly.</li>
            <li>The color is very pigmented and there is a big difference between the matte and shimmer, I recommend buying both</li>
            <li>I got it in the mail last week and was very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>Nor is it shifting and creasing so far,</li>
            <li>Eh.  Ended up giving to my 13 year old niece.</li>
            <li>With my two quality brands, the effect is amazing, they give a very vibrant color and literally last all day, even in very dramatic, intense applications.</li>
            <li>all the youtube videos I watched showed that the colors are highly pigmented (though all the ones I saw had gotten the palette for free from the company) but they are just to hard and some shades wont stick to my brush  or finger.</li>
            <li>THAN I EXPECTED IT, AND I AM POSITIVE</li>
            <li>Such a wide range of colors to choose from, the fun I have mixing and combing different shades.</li>
            <li>(please remember to use primer, as it holds the colors true and deep)  please note that there are a few shimmer color shades in the kit,</li>
            <li>Let me just say that the pigments &amp; quality in these colors are really amazing, the quality and variety of colors were all satisfactory, the only thing is the absense of a dark blue but you can still mix blue &amp; purple/ black to get a darker hue.</li>
            <li>On top of that, the black goes on green and all of the silvers don&#x27;t show once you get them on.</li>
            <li>,the color is the same in your eyelid than in the palette not like other brands  its very good,and for the price,i would buy another one!</li>
            <li>If they all work as well as I&#x27;ve managed to do in the last experiment, I&#x27;d probably get it again simply to fill in, as I said, where I don&#x27;t have the right shade in my other brands.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow that is supoosedly red goes on pink, no matter how much you apply.</li>
            <li>Mine has about three and a half rows of different shades of green, I thought it was going to come with a lot more variety of colors.      </li>
            <li>that have a tiny bit of sparkle to them but its barely noticable.</li>
            <li>and I expected more, am not satisfied with that product!!</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I ordered the neutral palette from the bh cosmetics website and it came in PERFECT condition, you could see your self on the cover</li>

            <li> With a good primer you&#x27;ll have no problems!</li>
            <li> This palette es beautiful</li>
            <li> It is great for travel.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this palette, I&#x27;m thinking about getting the shimmering set.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for people who like matte.</li>
            <li> I can honestly tell you that this is the best color palette I have used under $[...]!</li>
            <li> Ive have a Shanny shimmer palette and its great</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this because of the great reviews.  </li>
            <li> (great size for traveling which is a plus.    </li>
            <li> here&#x27;s to great looking eyes</li>
            <li> Great colors.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and would order again.</li>
            <li> The colors blend very nicely with this technique as well.</li>
            <li> BH Cosmetics is a great company with good quality, affordable products.</li>
            <li> i love it its awesome</li>
            <li> The colors are lovely but the quality is amature at best.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful and the packaging is so nice.</li>
            <li> my professional blush palette came in PERFECT condition, and my liquid eyeliner pen is perfect as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is good if you&#x27;re just getting in to makeup, and you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot on an eye shadow palette.</li>
            <li> so I thought hey they must be good</li>
            <li> I have a good impression from this branch.</li>
            <li> Some of the colors are a bit powdery but are still fairly pigmented.</li>
            <li> But this is still a good product</li>
            <li> The makeup itself is good.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was a good product to buy.</li>
            <li> This is good palette for the price</li>
            <li> This has to be applied with a good brush and a primer.</li>
            <li> Not all of the colors are matte but the shimmer ones are at a minimum and are actually good to add with the matte colors in my opinion.</li>
            <li> If you work with it, you can get a good payoff, but you do have to work at it.</li>
            <li> The color is good</li>
            <li> but its a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> Hey I ordered my palette &amp; it came pretty quick,however one or two of the colors were alittle smudged up which i wasnt happy about however the quality &amp; colors were great!!</li>
            <li> I had heard SO many great things about it.</li>
            <li> Cute colors, great price.</li>
            <li> what can I say I love it!  </li>
            <li> I rather spend one or two dollars more to have it not damaged that to have it come in the condition I received mine in!</li>
            <li> Love my shadows!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this out when I got it!</li>
            <li> The colors are amazing...</li>
            <li> I love the bright colors.  </li>
            <li> so I decided to purchase the product because there were a lot of colors I don&#x27;t have in my own collection.</li>
            <li> I will probaly give it to my nice since she likes to play around with make up.  </li>
            <li> it is gorgeous :)...</li>
            <li> I make my own with a combination of oils and beeswax.</li>
            <li> The variety of colors are good, filling in where I don&#x27;t have the color I want in my better brands.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the absolute best</li>
            <li> THE COLORS ARE GROUPED IN COOL AND WARM SHADES, AND IT IS VERY EASY TO PICK OUT WHAT COLORS GO GREAT TOGETHER.</li>
            <li> Except the color&#x27;s fall out very easily.</li>
            <li> Most of them are though and the ones that aren&#x27;t are still nice colors that I will and have used.</li>
            <li> i love the BH Cosmetics line and it has been an amazing experience to find such a perfect product.</li>
            <li> but with some colors you will need to scrape the top to pick up the shadow with your brush.</li>
            <li> i love the color..</li>
            <li> I received the product and it was just okay.</li>
            <li> but it wasnt that much.u wuld definately need a primer to make sure the color lasts all day.</li>
            <li> so with that in mind, i say this palette is ok.</li>
            <li> it culd&#x27;ve been packaged better and</li>
            <li> I would recommend you to take caution before buying :-)</li>
            <li> but overall, its GREAT !</li>
            <li> not so sure..  </li>
            <li> I love this color palette, looking forward to getting another one.</li>
            <li> It is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> They are not as pigmented as the 88 shimmer palette which i&#x27;ve had for about a year (and love it)</li>
            <li> Most of the colors are matte but there are about 5 or so</li>
            <li> All the videos showed them touching the palette with tons of color coming off</li>
            <li> and pinks are ok...</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> They treated me with respect and really care that I was happy.</li>
            <li> more stunning on the eye than in the kit.  </li>
            <li> Need better packaging.</li>
            <li> With BH, it does give me a better color.</li>
            <li> With this, I&#x27;m satisfied with the</li>
            <li> I was very excited to recieve this item in the mail</li>
            <li> ( it is great because it has every color you could ever need) or even to older girls who want to expand their collection but do not want to spend alot of money.</li>
            <li> I managed to get the beautiful, rich color I wanted that was very close to the color in the pan.</li>
            <li> i was sooo excited to get this!</li>
            <li> it was worth the money!!....  </li>
            <li> The colors looked so good on screen &amp; the reviews all spoke positive about this palette.</li>
            <li> it was so clean!</li>
            <li> and the most important</li>
            <li> it arrived in beautiful packaging but the eyeshadows are sooo cheap and chalky once on the eyes, yet they feel soft when i swatched them with my finger tip.</li>
            <li> The product came sooner than I expected, and in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li> This palette so far has been great.</li>
            <li> This may be a good starter tool for a teenager or some one not in to make-up that much.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much, I ended up using a bit of it myself.</li>
            <li> Honestly though this was worth the money.</li>
            <li> but overall, great product :)</li>
            <li> Straight from the pan onto the lid, no base, gives you a fairly transparent color.</li>
            <li> I just received my eye shadow palette by BH cosmetics, I usually don&#x27;t take the time to write reviews,  this is a great color set of eye shadows, hey are rich and great matte colors,  </li>
            <li> The package it came in was pretty beat up, but we all know things kind of get tossed around in transit.</li>
            <li> but once I did that it was fine.</li>
            <li> These eye shadows are great, the only problem I have is not all of them are matte</li>
            <li> And I am definately glad I bought it, definately worth the money.</li>
            <li> The colors look great in the pan, but they simply aren&#x27;t as pigmented as my Larenim or my BareMinerals.</li>
            <li> I have ordered the 88 neutral palette directly from them and really loved it</li>
            <li> I wouldnt buy another pallette since this one has so many colors, but i will definitely put this one too good use.</li>
            <li> they look really pretty!!    </li>
            <li> I am sooo very satisfied, the colors are very rich and vibrant, looks exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast and everything arrived safe and secure.  </li>
            <li> Actually, I&#x27;m pretty sure that some of my co-workers have already started the process in ordering theirs.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and was extremely excited to get it.</li>
            <li> so get the Shipping right!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been in to makeup, and I thought with this palette it would be a good starting point, with all the colors to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They arent very pigmented, but thankfully I have my nyx jumbo eyeshadow pencil in milk that I put on my lid first that makes them pretty bright, so</li>
            <li> The colors are true and stay on all day.</li>
            <li> My complexion is dark and these colors show up beautifully.  </li>
            <li> A good make-up brush is essential for packing on the shadows.    </li>
            <li> Overall this is a good product.</li>
            <li> Some colors won&#x27;t apply very well but most do.  </li>
            <li> I bought this palette because there are a ton of colors, which is true.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusion - You&#x27;ll get a lot of different colors for a good price, but expect what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Well when I opened it up it read \\&quot;cool matte\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> but overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> And while it doesn&#x27;t smudge as in the first experiment, the shadow creases very quickly, within an hour.</li>
            <li> The colors come out so rich, not like other cheap brands that look good in the package</li>
            <li> I AM TRYING TO LEARN DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES OF MAKE-UP, AND THIS IS THE PERFECT STARTING KIT.</li>
            <li> I am use to using MAC eye shadows, which have highly pigmented &amp; sexy colors.</li>
            <li> This make-up is great, I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking for a little fun in their life!</li>
            <li> Favorite new palette I&#x27;ve gotten.</li>
            <li> Buy this if you want a hot look!</li>
            <li> The colors are decently pigmented on my eyelid without a primer, so I can only imagine how nicely they&#x27;ll show up with a primer!</li>
            <li> Amazing quality brushes for a low cost.</li>
            <li> Bought each of my daughters this set for Christmas and they were thrilled and still use it now over a year later!</li>
            <li> so none came broken, the colors are great quality (but you should always use primer for even better quality), not all the colors are matte, some have a shimmer too(but</li>
            <li> I will try and keep at with the hopes of loving it in the future.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pigmented and they last for a good while.</li>
            <li> I mean, considering how many colors I got, it was a REALLY good deal.  </li>
            <li> most of the colors come out pretty nicely, some of them seemed chalky and kindof broke off a little when i used my fingers to pick up some of the color.    </li>
            <li> The reason why I gave it one star is because the eyeshadows are highly pigmented, which is a good thing in my opinion since they are only about the size of a dime.  </li>
            <li> I know it was damaged right away because</li>
            <li> and right away I pulled out my brushes and started playing with colors.</li>
            <li> Okay let me first say I did not order this from Amazon but from BH directly and from their website.</li>
            <li> Although the colors were very colorful and vibrant, I had to dig into the colors just to put sum on the brush.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping</li>
            <li> it was a good buy since the colors are rich in texture &amp; pigment because it would surely last me a long time.</li>
            <li> The hinge that makes it so that you can open the top was bracken so the top and bottom were totally separated, and there was rainbow eyeshadow EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li> i was actually deciding between BH &amp; coastal scents, but heard BH pigment is better.</li>
            <li> But I know I am definitely going to buy another eye shadow palette that promises better results in the depth of their colors.</li>
            <li> Thanks BH !</li>
            <li> overall it&#x27;s an ok product..for the price.</li>
            <li> I guess the eyeshadows are just more fragile than everything else.</li>
            <li> However, in terms of quality, it&#x27;s exactly what you&#x27;re paying for you.</li>
            <li> The colors in this palette are pigmented and you get more than enough.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not all matte (but it works out very well!)</li>
            <li> Fair price, but some of the colors don&#x27;t have much pigmentation, like the dark ones.&lt;br /&gt;Reds</li>
            <li> the color is so beautiful on the dark ones but the color falls off almost instantly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various things, playing with different application techniques to get a good color, and here are my results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received my palette super fast and was excited to open it up and try it.</li>
            <li> This palette is small, compact, and good for the price.</li>
            <li> and I like what I created but, even with using a primer or NYX Milk &amp; Pure Gold Jumbo Pencil</li>
            <li> But I called the bh cosmetics company and they sent me a new set, free of charge, which surprised me.</li>
            <li> there is much to choose from.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> These eyeshadows hurt my eyes so much that I had to stand under a shower, fully clothed, and wash my eyes out.</li>
            <li> have used the color palette because one of my friends owns it, but I really wanted it.</li>
            <li> the item came a whole lot sooner than what i had anticipated it to come.</li>
            <li> You have to REALLY dig in to it, to get the colors to stand out the way that you would want them to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the palette is still unusual to deal with.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t work very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I would recommend this to all of my friends that enjoy doing make-up and experimenting with different eye looks.</li>
            <li> Secondly, I would like to state that I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, and can wear things that most people can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> im sure nobody wants a palette with a crushed eyeshadow    </li>
            <li> I recommend this product and I am definitely buying it again- maybe trying it in warm colors or tropical next time!</li>
            <li> I still use this today and honestly I don&#x27;t use makeup everyday, but with that being said I haven&#x27;t reached the bottom of any colors.</li>
            <li> , colors are very pigmented; the only thing is that I thought the circle shape of each shadow was bigger, but in general as it is the very first palette I own</li>
            <li> I believe the prices are the same, the only difference is that you may have to pay for shipping on the bh cosmetics website, but IT IS WORTH IT!!!</li>
            <li> Just like many other people leaving reviews, my palette arrived damaged.</li>
            <li> I am able to get enough product to stick to my lid to get a decent opacity, but couldn&#x27;t get a really good, dramatic effect.</li>
            <li> so u will only get a full refund.</li>
            <li> i have to just sit the top of the case on the bottom half (if that makes sense)</li>
            <li> Once applied the colors were not as vibrant as they seem in the packed.</li>
            <li> but no, it&#x27;s actually quite compact and smaller than most netbooks.</li>
            <li> High pigmentation.</li>
            <li> and I saw that it was highly rated</li>
            <li> the colors r tiny but its worth 16.95.</li>
            <li> (I use it everyday and you can make so many looks with it)!I</li>
            <li> There is still enough of it left for the event I needed it for, and the rest of the colors will be nice to have for future events.</li>
            <li> I always wanted to buy this product and finally did and its pretty decent.</li>
            <li> so I also recommend this to new makeup users to get you started</li>
            <li> I just ordered the 120 palette and can&#x27;t wait to try some new colors.</li>
            <li> My two only draw backs were the cost of shipping (more so the custom taxes) which should have been expected</li>
            <li> First off, there is no red in this palette.</li>
            <li> but this was my first non-book shipment &amp; the actual size of the eyeshadow pieces.</li>
            <li> First, I ONLY purchased this because I thought it was TALC-FREE ..</li>
            <li> I was not expecing to see any shimmer, but I find that I use these colors pretty regularly.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to bother returning it because the price was so cheap that it&#x27;s not worth the hassle.  </li>
            <li> Maybe next time around I&#x27;ll get EXACTLY what I ordered.....</li>
            <li> I have to continuously dab for more and by that time I have made such a mess.</li>
            <li> I bought this palette because it clearly states \\&quot;matte palette\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t surprised.</li>
            <li> After hearing so much about this palette on YouTube and from devoted customers, I finally decided to purchase this palette.  </li>
            <li> The first problem was that the product took a long time to arrive.</li>
            <li> I did not order this product on Amazon but directly from the company directly.</li>
            <li> The color is very pigmented and there is a big difference between the matte and shimmer, I recommend buying both</li>
            <li> I got it in the mail last week and was very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Nor is it shifting and creasing so far,</li>
            <li> Eh.  Ended up giving to my 13 year old niece.</li>
            <li> With my two quality brands, the effect is amazing, they give a very vibrant color and literally last all day, even in very dramatic, intense applications.</li>
            <li> all the youtube videos I watched showed that the colors are highly pigmented (though all the ones I saw had gotten the palette for free from the company) but they are just to hard and some shades wont stick to my brush  or finger.</li>
            <li> THAN I EXPECTED IT, AND I AM POSITIVE</li>
            <li> Such a wide range of colors to choose from, the fun I have mixing and combing different shades.</li>
            <li> (please remember to use primer, as it holds the colors true and deep)  please note that there are a few shimmer color shades in the kit,</li>
            <li> Let me just say that the pigments &amp; quality in these colors are really amazing, the quality and variety of colors were all satisfactory, the only thing is the absense of a dark blue but you can still mix blue &amp; purple/ black to get a darker hue.</li>
            <li> On top of that, the black goes on green and all of the silvers don&#x27;t show once you get them on.</li>
            <li> ,the color is the same in your eyelid than in the palette not like other brands  its very good,and for the price,i would buy another one!</li>
            <li> If they all work as well as I&#x27;ve managed to do in the last experiment, I&#x27;d probably get it again simply to fill in, as I said, where I don&#x27;t have the right shade in my other brands.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow that is supoosedly red goes on pink, no matter how much you apply.</li>
            <li> Mine has about three and a half rows of different shades of green, I thought it was going to come with a lot more variety of colors.      </li>
            <li> that have a tiny bit of sparkle to them but its barely noticable.</li>
            <li> and I expected more, am not satisfied with that product!!</li>
            <li> a little bit really does go a long way!    </li>
            <li> Using this same technique and my other two brands, I usually go literally eight hours without a crease if I do it right.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t expect the quality to be the same as MAC, because you aren&#x27;t paying $20 for a single eyeshadow here, you&#x27;re paying $20 (regular price) for 88 eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> im guessing a good primer or another white base might help.</li>
            <li> Only downside is that within ten mins of getting it one of the pins holding the case together came out and the palette won&#x27;t snap close, then after using it, the other pin came out and so its not even a palette anymore</li>
            <li> Once on the brush, I had to layer and layer and layer, just to see a little eye action.</li>
            <li> Just for future refenerences though, when it comes to a gentle or fragile product to notify so for shipping purchases because i don&#x27;t think it started off broken.</li>
            <li> like the different colors, but they are not rich enough.</li>
            <li> Some of them are so true to the color and some are a little weak.</li>
            <li> Since I checked out all reviews on their website and saw how every single review had 5 stars I was sold.</li>
            <li> Even though the picture was a little larger, I still found it to be sorta misleading with respect to the size of the case.</li>
            <li> if its just because matte shadows are harder?</li>
            <li> I of coarse had to immediately start playing with the colors and there were a few colors I needed to scratch at to get it to come off</li>
            <li> One of the colors that was broken was one of the main reasons I bought the silly thing in the first place.</li>
            <li> Will stick with my other brands.</li>
            <li> i found that at least ten of them had shimmer</li>
            <li> purple, dark brown and black  </li>
            <li> when I opened the black packaging that says \\&quot;Bh</li>
            <li> The second was that when it did arrive, two of the eyeshadow slots were broken and the excess shadow from them was all over the other eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> (A few colors in this set do have a sparkle to them).</li>
            <li> A waste of $24.40.</li>
            <li> &quot; is that there are a few shimmery colors included in this \\&quot;matte\\&quot; palette.  </li>
            <li> then dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> I also chose the matte palette because I can use the neutral colors for everyday wear without looking shimmery.</li>
            <li> I have already tried on a few color I wanted to wear this weekend,  </li>
            <li> However, there is not very much product in the little circles of shadow, and a few of them were broken when it came.</li>
            <li> I was just really disappointed in the black eyeshadow which doesn&#x27;t sit very well</li>
            <li> Shipping sucked some of the palettes were badly damaged leaving me very upset.</li>
            <li> so please pleas please girls dont buy this waste!</li>
            <li> but im not sure</li>
            <li> this palette was not what I expected and it came to me broken in pieces.</li>
            <li> Applied the same eyeshadow base, then covered my lid with a black pencil eyeliner, quite dark where I wanted the richest color, fading to gray where I wanted less intensity.</li>
            <li> The palette came with three cracked eyeshadows and I belive that it&#x27;s due to the poor packaging (was not bubble wrapped).</li>
            <li> Combined with NYX Eyeshadow Base Eye Shadow Primer,my eyeshadow lasted all day (which is a first for me).    </li>
            <li> Either the first color doesn&#x27;t show through, or the color I&#x27;m trying to blend into the base color just doesn&#x27;t take.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are hard to find in stores, so this is prefect.  </li>
            <li> I even tried wetting my brush a little and that seemed to make it worse.</li>
            <li> With the base, the BH did blend very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, they are VERY small, but I hate it when my eyeshadow palettes are big and bulky, because it&#x27;s harder to take them places.</li>
            <li> With my normal eyeshadow base - here, I must give an explanation.</li>
            <li> Packaging was not good at all.  </li>
            <li> Not good quality.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I actually got the package because with the amount of money I paid for shipping &amp; handling (the size was a letdown).    </li>
            <li> I even put on MAC eye primer and the eyeshadow still looked very dull.</li>
            <li> Three of my colors were all broken.</li>
            <li> Approximately 6 of the colors are duplicated and therefore NOT an 88 color palette.  </li>
            <li> But when i found it on here and decided to order a palette, when i recieved it and it was broken along with the makeup broken as well.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad damage, mind you, but one of the eyeshadows broke, and it moved around inside the palette, getting pinky dust in some of the other colors.</li>
            <li> Even the dark colors are very disappointing.</li>
            <li> It was not damaged like one of the shadows cracked, but 10 times worse!</li>
            <li> weird.</li>
            <li> sorry but its the truth</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> beats spending the $$$ on the expensive lines at the mall.   </li>
            <li> I have to admit I was a bit hesitant when buying this product since I&#x27;ve had bad experiences with brands I didn&#x27;t know, but this makeup proved me wrong!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stay in place well, but smudge and smear quite badly.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> i was really shocked!    </li>
            <li> and once i did i was VERY disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in the color payoff.</li>
            <li> beacuse this BH cosmetics copy of it is horrible, litterally dollar store eyeshadow quality!!!</li>
            <li> They are awful.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My BH 88 Palette what can I say I love it!  I luv the colors they do pop when applied but with some colors you will need to scrape the top to pick up the shadow with your brush. I like the palette there is much to choose from. Get one! However!! Shipping sucked some of the palettes were badly damaged leaving me very upset. so get the Shipping right! Thanks</li>
            <li> i love the color.. they look really pretty!!    and the most important,the color is the same in your eyelid than in the palette not like other brands  its very good,and for the price,i would buy another one!</li>
            <li> I have wrinkled eyebrows so I can&#x27;t wear anything but matte eyeshadows. These are hard to find in stores, so this is prefect.  It is great for travel. Buy it now.</li>
            <li> Okay let me first say I did not order this from Amazon but from BH directly and from their website. Since I checked out all reviews on their website and saw how every single review had 5 stars I was sold. I received the product and it was just okay. It&#x27;s not like a name brand eyeshadow like MAC or NARS etc. etc. I think I have used it twice. Some of the colors won&#x27;t go on my brushes. I have to continuously dab for more and by that time I have made such a mess. I will stick to the dept stores for my makeup. I did post a review on BH website BUT they never posted it. I guess because I didn&#x27;t give their product 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this palette, I&#x27;m thinking about getting the shimmering set. (A few colors in this set do have a sparkle to them). The colors come out so rich, not like other cheap brands that look good in the package and then when you go to put them on you can&#x27;t even see them. This make-up is great, I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking for a little fun in their life!</li>
            <li> First off, there is no red in this palette. The eyeshadow that is supoosedly red goes on pink, no matter how much you apply. Secondly, I would like to state that I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, and can wear things that most people can&#x27;t. These eyeshadows hurt my eyes so much that I had to stand under a shower, fully clothed, and wash my eyes out. And they stain your eye lids. On top of that, the black goes on green and all of the silvers don&#x27;t show once you get them on. Plus, this palette is supposed to be matte, not shimmer, but about 10 of the shadows have glitter in them. A waste of $24.40. I do not recommend this palette for any person. By the way, I tried multiple primers, none of which helped. And yes, I cleaned my lids before trying again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this palette from Trinidad &amp; Tobago through a courier service because I couldn&#x27;t resist the temptation. The colors looked so good on screen &amp; the reviews all spoke positive about this palette. Let me just say that the pigments &amp; quality in these colors are really amazing, the quality and variety of colors were all satisfactory, the only thing is the absense of a dark blue but you can still mix blue &amp; purple/ black to get a darker hue. Combined with NYX Eyeshadow Base Eye Shadow Primer,my eyeshadow lasted all day (which is a first for me).    My two only draw backs were the cost of shipping (more so the custom taxes) which should have been expected but this was my first non-book shipment &amp; the actual size of the eyeshadow pieces. Even though the picture was a little larger, I still found it to be sorta misleading with respect to the size of the case. I was disappointed when I actually got the package because with the amount of money I paid for shipping &amp; handling (the size was a letdown).    All in all it was a good buy since the colors are rich in texture &amp; pigment because it would surely last me a long time. I would recommend this to anyone. Actually, I&#x27;m pretty sure that some of my co-workers have already started the process in ordering theirs.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for people who like matte. i found that at least ten of them had shimmer but it wasnt that much.u wuld definately need a primer to make sure the color lasts all day. the colors r tiny but its worth 16.95. they have an automated refund policy so returning was simple. when i recieved my palette one of the colors already broke and i requested an exhchange but they won&#x27;t let u so u will only get a full refund. so with that in mind, i say this palette is ok. it culd&#x27;ve been packaged better and im sure nobody wants a palette with a crushed eyeshadow    I would recommend you to take caution before buying :-)</li>
            <li> BH Cosmetics is a great company with good quality, affordable products. I have ordered the 88 neutral palette directly from them and really loved it (I use it everyday and you can make so many looks with it)!I have used the color palette because one of my friends owns it, but I really wanted it. I can honestly tell you that this is the best color palette I have used under $[...]! But when i received the product, it was damaged. It was not damaged like one of the shadows cracked, but 10 times worse! The hinge that makes it so that you can open the top was bracken so the top and bottom were totally separated, and there was rainbow eyeshadow EVERYWHERE. I know it was damaged right away because when I opened the black packaging that says \\&quot;Bh cosmetics 88 color palette\\&quot; on the front it was covered in blue powder. I do not blame BH Cosmetics for this at all. THIS IS ALL BECAUSE OF AMAZON! I ordered the neutral palette from the bh cosmetics website and it came in PERFECT condition, you could see your self on the cover it was so clean! I suggest you order from bh cosmetics. I believe the prices are the same, the only difference is that you may have to pay for shipping on the bh cosmetics website, but IT IS WORTH IT!!! I rather spend one or two dollars more to have it not damaged that to have it come in the condition I received mine in! Im only 13 but I have been using makeup since I was 9 or 10 so I also recommend this to new makeup users to get you started( it is great because it has every color you could ever need) or even to older girls who want to expand their collection but do not want to spend alot of money.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve seen this product on youtube plenty of times. i was actually deciding between BH &amp; coastal scents, but heard BH pigment is better. most of the colors come out pretty nicely, some of them seemed chalky and kindof broke off a little when i used my fingers to pick up some of the color.    the item came a whole lot sooner than what i had anticipated it to come. i was really shocked!    but overall, great product :)</li>
            <li> I AM TRYING TO LEARN DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES OF MAKE-UP, AND THIS IS THE PERFECT STARTING KIT. THE COLORS ARE GROUPED IN COOL AND WARM SHADES, AND IT IS VERY EASY TO PICK OUT WHAT COLORS GO GREAT TOGETHER. THIS ITEM ARRIVED ALOT SOONER THAN I EXPECTED IT, AND I AM POSITIVE I WILL BE ORDERING ALOT OF PRODUCTS FROM THEM IN THE FUTURE!!</li>
            <li> These eye shadows are great, the only problem I have is not all of them are matte but I did see this is another review so I wasn&#x27;t surprised. Most of them are though and the ones that aren&#x27;t are still nice colors that I will and have used.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to recieve this item in the mail and once i did i was VERY disappointed. Three of my colors were all broken. Although the colors were very colorful and vibrant, I had to dig into the colors just to put sum on the brush. Once applied the colors were not as vibrant as they seem in the packed. I even put on MAC eye primer and the eyeshadow still looked very dull. I gave this product to my younger sister. I will stick with my MAC.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been in to makeup, and I thought with this palette it would be a good starting point, with all the colors to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;I like the different colors, but they are not rich enough. I have to put on a heckeva lot to get to the richness of the color to stand out. Sometimes, I have to use tweezers to scratch up some of the eyeshadow, just so that the color can be deeper, brighter.&lt;br /&gt;It does last, I give it that. But you just have to apply alot to get the color to do what you would like.&lt;br /&gt;One swoop of the brush is just not gonna work. You have to REALLY dig in to it, to get the colors to stand out the way that you would want them to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was swift, I didn&#x27;t have any issues with cracked eye shadows or anything like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is good if you&#x27;re just getting in to makeup, and you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot on an eye shadow palette. I mean, considering how many colors I got, it was a REALLY good deal.  But I know I am definitely going to buy another eye shadow palette that promises better results in the depth of their colors.</li>
            <li> So, I would like to start by saying I have only worn make up for the last year or so...I&#x27;m still learning how to properly use it. First, I ONLY purchased this because I thought it was TALC-FREE .. turns out, it wasn&#x27;t. Talc is the same mineral as baby powder, meaning the shadow is powdery...HOWEVER, it is not too powdery and GOES ON GREATTTTT!! Its very bright and pigmented!! Thanks BH ! Only downside is that within ten mins of getting it one of the pins holding the case together came out and the palette won&#x27;t snap close, then after using it, the other pin came out and so its not even a palette anymore, it doesn&#x27;t close i have to just sit the top of the case on the bottom half (if that makes sense) .. but overall, its GREAT !</li>
            <li> High pigmentation. The package arrived with none of the eyeshadow shattered. The colors are beautiful and the packaging is so nice. I recommend this product and I am definitely buying it again- maybe trying it in warm colors or tropical next time!</li>
            <li> i was sooo excited to get this! it arrived in beautiful packaging but the eyeshadows are sooo cheap and chalky once on the eyes, yet they feel soft when i swatched them with my finger tip. weird. the color is so beautiful on the dark ones but the color falls off almost instantly! and i use really good eye primer! so please pleas please girls dont buy this waste! buy it from coastal scents instead! beacuse this BH cosmetics copy of it is horrible, litterally dollar store eyeshadow quality!!! sorry but its the truth</li>
            <li> So I did a lot of research on this and all the youtube videos I watched showed that the colors are highly pigmented (though all the ones I saw had gotten the palette for free from the company) but they are just to hard and some shades wont stick to my brush  or finger. They arent very pigmented, but thankfully I have my nyx jumbo eyeshadow pencil in milk that I put on my lid first that makes them pretty bright, so im guessing a good primer or another white base might help. Im going to try and fix the hardness of them by spraying them with either a mixing medium or MAC fix+.  I noticed the beauty guru Juicystar07 uses them so I thought hey they must be good but im just not so sure..  Another thing, they use mineral oil which is used in cheep products and they have the plastic like smell that a lot of cheep makeup has (like my eyeshadow from Clairs)  Ive have a Shanny shimmer palette and its great so you could try there If you like but im not sure if its just because matte shadows are harder?</li>
            <li> I love this color palette, looking forward to getting another one. Such a wide range of colors to choose from, the fun I have mixing and combing different shades. Awesome!!!</li>
            <li> Bought each of my daughters this set for Christmas and they were thrilled and still use it now over a year later! The colors are true and stay on all day. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was a bit hesitant when buying this product since I&#x27;ve had bad experiences with brands I didn&#x27;t know, but this makeup proved me wrong! I can definitely say that these eyshadows came well packaged so none came broken, the colors are great quality (but you should always use primer for even better quality), not all the colors are matte, some have a shimmer too(but they aren&#x27;t too shimmery!). Each color is about the size of a dime, so I don&#x27;t recommend daily use of a specific color. It&#x27;s definitely a great buy!</li>
            <li> This palette es beautiful, colors are very pigmented; the only thing is that I thought the circle shape of each shadow was bigger, but in general as it is the very first palette I own I have a good impression from this branch.</li>
            <li> I bought the 88 color eyes shadow and I expected more, am not satisfied with that product!!</li>
            <li> After hearing so much about this palette on YouTube and from devoted customers, I finally decided to purchase this palette.  It is fantastic!  The shipping was very fast and everything arrived safe and secure.  The colors are amazing...a little bit really does go a long way!    My complexion is dark and these colors show up beautifully.  You do need to use a primer (I like Urban Decay Primer Potion or Two Faced Shadow Insurance), but these colors last from 7am until after midnight with NO touch-ups!    A good make-up brush is essential for packing on the shadows.    The only thing that I could say is a \\&quot;con\\&quot; is that there are a few shimmery colors included in this \\&quot;matte\\&quot; palette.  I was not expecing to see any shimmer, but I find that I use these colors pretty regularly.    I just ordered the 120 palette and can&#x27;t wait to try some new colors.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a good product. Some of the colors are a bit powdery but are still fairly pigmented. They are not as pigmented as the 88 shimmer palette which i&#x27;ve had for about a year (and love it) But this is still a good product and I do like all of the colors. Most of the colors are matte but there are about 5 or so that have a tiny bit of sparkle to them but its barely noticable. I would recommend this product if you are looking for matte colors but dont want to spend a lot of money. And I am definately glad I bought it, definately worth the money.</li>
            <li> Product got here the next day.  Very fast shipping but when i received it a couple of colors were broke and color was everywhere.  Packaging was not good at all.  The makeup itself is good.  Some colors won&#x27;t apply very well but most do.  I love the bright colors.  overall it&#x27;s an ok product..for the price.</li>
            <li> I watched the reviews on the bh cosmetics website and others on youtube and I saw that it was highly rated so I decided to purchase the product because there were a lot of colors I don&#x27;t have in my own collection. I received my palette super fast and was excited to open it up and try it. The package it came in was pretty beat up, but we all know things kind of get tossed around in transit. The eyeshadows were all intact to my surprise and right away I pulled out my brushes and started playing with colors. I was very disappointed in the color payoff. All the videos showed them touching the palette with tons of color coming off and that is NOT the case. I even tried wetting my brush a little and that seemed to make it worse. I do NOT recommend this product and will be ordering the Coastal Scents palette.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and was extremely excited to get it. I had heard SO many great things about it. The first problem was that the product took a long time to arrive. The second was that when it did arrive, two of the eyeshadow slots were broken and the excess shadow from them was all over the other eyeshadows. I am now returning the shadows. Also, the shadows are TINY.. smaller than the dime. And the price is 3 dollars cheaper on bh cosmetics.com</li>
            <li> Just like many other people leaving reviews, my palette arrived damaged. It wasn&#x27;t bad damage, mind you, but one of the eyeshadows broke, and it moved around inside the palette, getting pinky dust in some of the other colors. I don&#x27;t understand why that happened, considering my professional blush palette came in PERFECT condition, and my liquid eyeliner pen is perfect as well. I guess the eyeshadows are just more fragile than everything else. I emailed BH Cosmetics support yesterday, asking if I could have a replacement since their policy takes liability for products that arrive damaged, but they haven&#x27;t replied yet.   However, in terms of quality, it&#x27;s exactly what you&#x27;re paying for you. The colors are decently pigmented on my eyelid without a primer, so I can only imagine how nicely they&#x27;ll show up with a primer! Yes, they are VERY small, but I hate it when my eyeshadow palettes are big and bulky, because it&#x27;s harder to take them places. This palette is small, compact, and good for the price. You can&#x27;t expect the quality to be the same as MAC, because you aren&#x27;t paying $20 for a single eyeshadow here, you&#x27;re paying $20 (regular price) for 88 eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> I did not order this product on Amazon but directly from the company directly. I found that the company was having a sale and got the matte and shimmer palettes for $12 each!! I ordered on Thursday and received on Monday. There were no issues with my product, every shadow was in perfect condition for both palettes. I of coarse had to immediately start playing with the colors and there were a few colors I needed to scratch at to get it to come off but once I did that it was fine. The color is very pigmented and there is a big difference between the matte and shimmer, I recommend buying both</li>
            <li> I watched a lot of reviews about BH cosmetics on Youtube. I thought it was a good product to buy. I am use to using MAC eye shadows, which have highly pigmented &amp; sexy colors. With MAC, you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to see it. With BH I had to scrape the powder in order to get it on the brush. Once on the brush, I had to layer and layer and layer, just to see a little eye action. I used different combos and I like what I created but, even with using a primer or NYX Milk &amp; Pure Gold Jumbo Pencil the palette is still unusual to deal with. I will try and keep at with the hopes of loving it in the future. If not I will try the next, product people are trying or give it to my niece to play with. SN: This may be a good starter tool for a teenager or some one not in to make-up that much.</li>
            <li> Fair price, but some of the colors don&#x27;t have much pigmentation, like the dark ones.&lt;br /&gt;Reds and pinks are ok...purple, dark brown and black  don&#x27;t work very well.&lt;br /&gt; I wouldn&#x27;t buy again. Sorry</li>
            <li> The colors in this palette are pigmented and you get more than enough. I love this and I would recommend this to all of my friends that enjoy doing make-up and experimenting with different eye looks.</li>
            <li> Cute colors, great price.</li>
            <li> I bought this palette for my sister for Christmas, and it&#x27;s amazing!!! I loved it so much, I ended up using a bit of it myself. But my sister loves it as well... I&#x27;ll buy this again soon.</li>
            <li> This is good palette for the price but if you do not use have an eye primer then dont waste your money. This has to be applied with a good brush and a primer. I like it bc there are alot of color options. Not all of the colors are matte but the shimmer ones are at a minimum and are actually good to add with the matte colors in my opinion. I wouldnt buy another pallette since this one has so many colors, but i will definitely put this one too good use.</li>
            <li> I have had a few problems with some of my orders because my delievery man does not care about what he is suppose to handle gently. But I called the bh cosmetics company and they sent me a new set, free of charge, which surprised me. They treated me with respect and really care that I was happy. Love my shadows!</li>
            <li> Hey I ordered my palette &amp; it came pretty quick,however one or two of the colors were alittle smudged up which i wasnt happy about however the quality &amp; colors were great!! it was worth the money!!....  Very good product!</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this because of the great reviews.  I got it in the mail last week and was very dissapointed. The palette came with three cracked eyeshadows and I belive that it&#x27;s due to the poor packaging (was not bubble wrapped). I bought this palette because it clearly states \\&quot;matte palette\\&quot;.  Not all the eyeshadows are matte. Mine came with about 16 shimmery shadows.  Approximately 6 of the colors are duplicated and therefore NOT an 88 color palette.  Mine has about three and a half rows of different shades of green, I thought it was going to come with a lot more variety of colors.      The reason why I gave it one star is because the eyeshadows are highly pigmented, which is a good thing in my opinion since they are only about the size of a dime.  I&#x27;m not going to bother returning it because the price was so cheap that it&#x27;s not worth the hassle.  I will probaly give it to my nice since she likes to play around with make up.  Will NEVER recommend these palettes. They are awful.  I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> i love the BH Cosmetics line and it has been an amazing experience to find such a perfect product. But when i found it on here and decided to order a palette, when i recieved it and it was broken along with the makeup broken as well. Just for future refenerences though, when it comes to a gentle or fragile product to notify so for shipping purchases because i don&#x27;t think it started off broken.</li>
            <li> I bought this palette because there are a ton of colors, which is true. However, there is not very much product in the little circles of shadow, and a few of them were broken when it came. One of the colors that was broken was one of the main reasons I bought the silly thing in the first place. There is still enough of it left for the event I needed it for, and the rest of the colors will be nice to have for future events. I won&#x27;t have to buy individual shadow colors for every event anymore. I also chose the matte palette because I can use the neutral colors for everyday wear without looking shimmery.</li>
            <li> i love it its awesome</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this out when I got it! I am sooo very satisfied, the colors are very rich and vibrant, looks exactly as pictured. I thought it was going to be some clunky thing the size of my Dell laptop, but no, it&#x27;s actually quite compact and smaller than most netbooks. Buy this if you want a hot look!</li>
            <li> I just received my eye shadow palette by BH cosmetics, I usually don&#x27;t take the time to write reviews,  this is a great color set of eye shadows, hey are rich and great matte colors,  I have already tried on a few color I wanted to wear this weekend,  it is gorgeous :)... more stunning on the eye than in the kit.  (please remember to use primer, as it holds the colors true and deep)  please note that there are a few shimmer color shades in the kit, so it&#x27;s not all matte (but it works out very well!) The product came sooner than I expected, and in perfect condition.  (great size for traveling which is a plus.    I will definitely purchase this line in the future. beats spending the $$$ on the expensive lines at the mall.   all in all very, very happy with this purchase.    here&#x27;s to great looking eyes</li>
            <li> Great colors. Need better packaging.</li>
            <li> Amazing quality brushes for a low cost. Favorite new palette I&#x27;ve gotten.</li>
            <li> I received my BH Cosmetics 88 Color Eye Shadow Palette in the mail.  This is a great product and would order again.</li>
            <li> The colors look great in the pan, but they simply aren&#x27;t as pigmented as my Larenim or my BareMinerals. I&#x27;ve tried various things, playing with different application techniques to get a good color, and here are my results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- Straight from the pan onto the lid, no base, gives you a fairly transparent color. Even the dark colors are very disappointing. They don&#x27;t stay in place well, but smudge and smear quite badly. Yet they don&#x27;t blend well. Either the first color doesn&#x27;t show through, or the color I&#x27;m trying to blend into the base color just doesn&#x27;t take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2- With my normal eyeshadow base - here, I must give an explanation. I make my own with a combination of oils and beeswax. With my two quality brands, the effect is amazing, they give a very vibrant color and literally last all day, even in very dramatic, intense applications. With BH, it does give me a better color. I am able to get enough product to stick to my lid to get a decent opacity, but couldn&#x27;t get a really good, dramatic effect. And while it doesn&#x27;t smudge as in the first experiment, the shadow creases very quickly, within an hour. Using this same technique and my other two brands, I usually go literally eight hours without a crease if I do it right. With the base, the BH did blend very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3- Best results: Applied the same eyeshadow base, then covered my lid with a black pencil eyeliner, quite dark where I wanted the richest color, fading to gray where I wanted less intensity. THAT was the answer. I managed to get the beautiful, rich color I wanted that was very close to the color in the pan. Nor is it shifting and creasing so far, which has been about an hour. The colors blend very nicely with this technique as well. With this, I&#x27;m satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion - You&#x27;ll get a lot of different colors for a good price, but expect what you pay for. If you work with it, you can get a good payoff, but you do have to work at it. The variety of colors are good, filling in where I don&#x27;t have the color I want in my better brands. Whether or not I&#x27;ll buy BH again remains to be seen. I&#x27;ve not used all of the colors yet. If they all work as well as I&#x27;ve managed to do in the last experiment, I&#x27;d probably get it again simply to fill in, as I said, where I don&#x27;t have the right shade in my other brands.</li>
            <li> The colors are lovely but the quality is amature at best. Colors do not stay on even with a primer.</li>
            <li> this palette was not what I expected and it came to me broken in pieces. I would not buy this product again</li>
            <li> This palette so far has been great. The colors are very pigmented and they last for a good while. With a good primer you&#x27;ll have no problems!</li>
            <li> Some of them are so true to the color and some are a little weak. No pigment or anything and others are just beyond my expectations. Honestly though this was worth the money. I still use this today and honestly I don&#x27;t use makeup everyday, but with that being said I haven&#x27;t reached the bottom of any colors. [excluding the one that broke somehow.]</li>
            <li> Eh.  Ended up giving to my 13 year old niece. Not good quality. Chalky just eh.  Will stick with my other brands. Lorac, urban decay, mac etc</li>
            <li> I just received the palette and even though I like it I was under the impression that all color were Matte and that is not the case.&lt;br /&gt;there are several colors with shimmer on it.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this palette expecting the 88 matte palette. Well when I opened it up it read \\&quot;cool matte\\&quot;. This IS NOT what i wanted at all! But after trying out some different looks I decided not to send it back. Maybe next time around I&#x27;ll get EXACTLY what I ordered.....</li>
            <li> Daughter loves it! Except the color&#x27;s fall out very easily.</li>
            <li> I ordered this in the matte and it came in shimmer I was disappointed. The color is good but I wish it was matte.</li>
            <li> I always wanted to buy this product and finally did and its pretty decent. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the absolute best but its a good deal for the price. I was just really disappointed in the black eyeshadow which doesn&#x27;t sit very well but overall it&#x27;s a good product. Lots of different colors.</li>
            <li> I will buy this again</li>
