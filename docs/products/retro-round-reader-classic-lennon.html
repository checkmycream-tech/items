            <li> I have had numerous compliments on these glasses.  Quality at a reasonable price.  I love them. They were exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Great Buy I&#x27;m very satisfied and happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> I get compliments on these glasses every time I wear them.  They are comfortable and I like them a lot.  I can recommend them with no reservation.</li>
            <li> Although the glasses are adequate and are not mis-advertised, but I thought the glasses were more lightweight and flimsy than I had anticipated.</li>
            <li> Reading glasses don&#x27;t last long for me. I tend to abuse them (have them in my back pocket and sit on them, etc). These are sturdy, comfortable and have a unique look.</li>
            <li> These glasses are great! Usually when I buy plastic readers at a store they are a bit snug around my face on the sides in front of my ears or they bother the backs of my ears. I will wear this all day without problems. They&#x27;re very good quality for the price. I&#x27;ll buy them again before I run out to the local drugstore to pick some up for twice the price and not as fashionable. My only complaint is that they cover your entire eye area so in order to see distances again (i.e. someone coming through your office door), you must take them completely off.</li>
            <li> My students love my new look.</li>
            <li> Very good quality. I&#x27;m quite pleased with these glasses and would highly recommend these guys if you need some cheaters.</li>
            <li> I got two of these. The first one fell apart within a week, and the second a few weeks later. A complete waste.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Everybody asks where I got these cool glasses. Just purchased another pair so I will always have a spare.</li>
            <li> I like them a lot. Nice quality.  A bit big for my face.</li>
            <li> I really like these glasses! I originally bought them as reading glasses when I wear my contacts. They look so good on me that I&#x27;m going to get a pair of these with prescription lenses.</li>
            <li> Lennon retro readers are well made,substantive and stylish.Much better than what you find at brick and mortar for a similar price.</li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t like them, but I do because they are unique.  Very John Lennon looking. I highly recommend this purchase.</li>
            <li> Very nice weight.  Clear lens. Fits great. So nice that I keep them in a case.  Much better than $Tree by far.  Friends and family have love them. Would repurchase definitely!</li>
            <li> No way John Lennon would have even worn these dorky glasses. That said, I&#x27;m giving these 1-star based on my personal opinion (of how goofy they look). Fit and finish seem fine and they are cheep. Rather than the trouble of returning, I&#x27;ll donate them.</li>
            <li> Flexible, strong, and clear.  These glasses are just right for reading glasses while still looking stylish  Thinking about buying another pair.</li>
            <li> These are a nice quality pair of glasses that have a nice feel. people have remarked on the look in a positive way.</li>
            <li> Got what I was looking for.  Tortoise shell and round.  Different from run-of-the-mill readers.  Received a few comments on them.</li>
            <li> They look very cute, are light weight, yet sturdy. I would recommend these glasses, I wish that they would come in black too.</li>
            <li> Like the glasses, but a bit bigger than what i thought.  Love the hinged temples.  Lenses are clear and sharp.</li>
            <li> I love these reading glasses!  They look great, they fit great and are a great value, for the price paid.  I ordered two pair to begin with, because of the great reviews and I ordered another pair a couple of days ago.  I am so pleased to have come upon these, and it is because of the awesome Amazon customers who take the time to leave reviews for others.  I noted that the weaker strengths are out-of-stock-today ... I will watch for them to be replenished, as I do not want to run out of these!</li>
