            <li>Great sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen worked way better than any I&#x27;ve ever used in my life!!</li>
            <li>Decided to try this Natures Gate produce based on the good reviews.</li>
            <li>Really good Sunscreen lotion.  </li>
            <li>Nature&#x27;s Gates has a good product that you can trust.</li>
            <li>Works good.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve read the EWGs sunscreen analysis and you&#x27;re looking for a choice that doesn&#x27;t break the bank, this is a good option.  </li>
            <li>It rubs in nicely and gives good coverage.  </li>
            <li>There has to be something better!</li>
            <li>LOVE!</li>
            <li>We love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>but this is amazing.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product: Natural ingredients + highly effective.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t smell, and, I can honestly say that my dermatologist is very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I use this because the Environmental Work Group says that, unlike a lot of sunscreens, it&#x27;s both safe and effective.  </li>
            <li>Best of all it is a safe and natural product.</li>
            <li>I love that it lacks the chemicals</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The best sunscreen I have found that lasts several hours in the water.</li>
            <li>It has no odors and you can pronounce and understand what most of the ingredients are on the tube.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I would avoid putting this sunscreen on the face and neck area all together unless you are OK with the stickiness.</li>
            <li>I was able to order it online at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Cruelty Free!</li>
            <li>even though it has a white sheen, it&#x27;s great for surfing!</li>
            <li>Dries matt, so also good for a hot steamy day without the feeling of being slathered in oil.</li>
            <li>but it is a fantastic alternative to the more toxic chemical-laden products out there.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a red head with fair skin and after a week in Hawaii, in and out of the water, I wasn&#x27;t burnt at all!</li>
            <li>/&gt;very easy to apply</li>
            <li>Spreads easily on the skin and does not wash off.  </li>
            <li>This is sunscreen that actually works beautifully.</li>
            <li>Great for daily use, I use it before I got for a run and before I take my dog for a walk in the morning.</li>
            <li>I have an extremely light complexion  </li>
            <li>With the curse of sensitive fair skin, sunscreen is a must for our family.</li>
            <li>We are sun lovers &amp; feel good about putting natural stuff on our bodies.</li>
            <li>It stays on for a long time and is very effective under strong sun.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to many skincare products, so I have to go with natural ones for the most part.</li>
            <li>although the fianc&amp;eacute; (who&#x27;s spent a lot more time at the beach) feels that that&#x27;s the sign of a good sunscreen that will stick around longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many other &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; sunscreens with just zinc or titanium oxide, and I find that they don&#x27;t do as good a job as this one, which does have some chemical blocks included.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it is good for the days you anticipate water play, but not for every day use.</li>
            <li>however this places a good second!</li>
            <li>Still looking for a good daily wear sunscreen though.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen takes a little extra effort to rub in during application, but it provides superb coverage and doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor.  </li>
            <li>We spend quite a bit of time in the sun and have often found it hard to get a good quality sunscreen, that is safe, and that works.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a more natural sunscreen lotion, I would try this product.</li>
            <li>and I never taste it once absorbed.</li>
            <li>Almost bought this sunscreen because I thought it was a natural safe product...</li>
            <li>I needed a solution that would be affordable and not just rinse right off as soon as they hop in the water.</li>
            <li>True that it is very water resistant.  </li>
            <li>Although we do try to limit our sun exposure, we also enjoy water sports and we live Hawaii.</li>
            <li>and I wanted something natural but strong for my trip to Cancun.</li>
            <li>I like that it is paraben free and seems to absorb or adhere to the skin better than other water resistant products.</li>
            <li>I brought this sunscreen to Hawaii assuming I would need a water resistant sunscreen that also provided higher SPF protection.</li>
            <li>there is nothing more protective than a physical block for sunscreen (i.e. zinc oxide) - this product is 10% zinc oxide.     </li>
            <li>i was upset at first when i used this on my face.</li>
            <li>Sure it may go on a little greasy, but that makes it easy to cover your skin.  </li>
            <li>but I also ride horses nearly every day, so an effective sunscreen is critical.</li>
            <li>My husband has super sensitive skin and wears this when he surfs.</li>
            <li>I have often consulted the skin deep web site to make sure that I buy the least hazardous sun screens I can find for my family.  </li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s really saying something considering</li>
            <li>Seems very waterproof, doesn&#x27;t hurt the eyes either.</li>
            <li>which just means it is really water resistant.</li>
            <li>My kids prefer the spray, but I&#x27;m only using this from now on because it&#x27;s a one time application and is free of the chemicals in sprays that soak in and get in their bloodstream.</li>
            <li>Nobody wants to rub sunblock all over their bodies that has been once used on tortured puppies, cats and bunnies.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different brands of sunscreen and this stuff is by far my #1 choice.</li>
            <li>my face with  my other products placed on top did leave my skin feeling a tad sticky :</li>
            <li>I ordered Very WAter Resistant, but the Normal Water Resistant is delivered to me instead.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It actually works better than the standard brands.</li>
            <li>would send it back for an exchange, but the international shipping cost more than the product itself...</li>
            <li>You do have to spend more time rubbing this in than traditional brands - in order to get all the white lotion to disappear -</li>
            <li>This includes reapplying it every couple of hours, which can be pretty gross if one is sweaty and it&#x27;s a hot day.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It comes in a relatively high SPF</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen for my little guy.  </li>
            <li>Not great if it gets in eyes, but I still haven&#x27;t found a good sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>so I decided to use this product instead of our usual SPF 35 Burn Out for Kids which I love.  </li>
            <li>but I am not exposed to direct sunlight</li>
            <li>Sometimes you suffer effectiveness when using a natural product, but not here.</li>
            <li>my kids and I are out swimming nearly every day.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so soft too.</li>
            <li>left it very shinny</li>
            <li>Works well to protect sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It lacks chemicals that could hurt my sensitive skin!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Daughter burned even with frequent reapplications of this product AND broke out in a rash.  </li>
            <li>We use it on the two year old all they way to the adults.</li>
            <li>So far, the sunscreen I use with no toxic chemicals, etc, is Badger sports sunblock...</li>
            <li>I have used several others and this is by far the least greasiest of the safe sun screens.</li>
            <li>After much effort, the white streaks finally disappeared.</li>
            <li>No other product compares for protection in the surf.</li>
            <li>it was thick  and went on smooth  </li>
            <li>I am a natural products person who has tried about every single natural product in the market.  </li>
            <li>Is hard to clean off though</li>
            <li>My daughter is naturally olive-skinned and burning has never been an issue even spending long days all summer at the beach.  </li>
            <li>It is true that it is thick and sticky, but I think that is why it works so well.</li>
            <li>Very thick coat when you apply on skin but really protects the skin very well!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little bit hard to rub in to the skin at first (I would recommend dotting it before attempting to rub it all in), but it&#x27;s not greasy, and it doesn&#x27;t have a powerful sunblock-scent (which I don&#x27;t mind, but it&#x27;s something I noticed).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just spent the past week swimming and kayaking in the ocean and this product was fabulous at protecting my skin.</li>
            <li>It seems to go away after 30 minutes or so, and they&#x27;re young and don&#x27;t care, so it&#x27;s only a minor</li>
            <li>She got a little too much sun one day</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It seems to go away after 30 minutes or so, and they&#x27;re young and don&#x27;t care, so it&#x27;s only a minor</li>
            <li> She got a little too much sun one day</li>
            <li> I workout pretty enthusiastically, but no matter how hard I sweat, I feel that this sunscreen is always there protecting me.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s thick but it rubs in pretty well</li>
            <li> other major brands include.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The 30 spf version of this product prevented us from burning when we were vacationing on the beach in Mexico or the Caribbean, even with only a single application in the morning.  </li>
            <li> It actually dries dry!</li>
            <li> So you really have to rub it in hard to get it to soak in.</li>
            <li> I have vitiligo, so have to be extra careful,</li>
            <li> We use this all summer long.</li>
            <li> Spent 10 days in the British Virgin islands.  </li>
            <li> This product protected us all summer long - even during a week-long retreat on the Alabama Gulf Shores without a day of rain.  </li>
            <li> They have medium- to dark-brown skin, so once the sunscreen has been applied - even if it&#x27;s totally rubbed in and not visible - it makes their skin look a corpse-like grey color once they&#x27;re wet.</li>
            <li> If they could find a way to make it dry to touch after application, I would give this 5 stars, but if they did this I believe it would probably compromise  its water resistance and sweat proof qualities.</li>
            <li> However, I am uncomfortable using cheap, mainstream brands with harmful chemicals, especially for everyday use.</li>
            <li> It feels slightly tacky, but not enough to bother me.</li>
            <li> And even then, it will leave a ever so slight white tint over darker skin or tattoos.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as sticky and thick as similar products, but it&#x27;s pretty sticky and thick.  </li>
            <li> We use it for surfing, snorkeling, kayaking, hiking, or days spent in the sun.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that the sunscreen can make my kids&#x27; skin look grey once they get in the water.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend using this on your face as it is far too thick and leaves a slight residue feeling on the skin.</li>
            <li> I even used it on my face and it did not clog the pores and cause acne which all other products do.</li>
            <li> other than that, i will give it a 5 as i have used it before.</li>
            <li> Other reviews have already said it</li>
            <li> With other brands his face would be burnt after a surf session...not anymore.</li>
            <li> I am continually disappointed by the thin consistency and odor of many of the natural products.  </li>
            <li> One tube leaked and made a mess of other two tubes in the package.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m annoyed that they advertise it being a natural sunscreen when it&#x27;s not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I would have reapplied, I assume I&#x27;d have less tan.</li>
            <li> The only catch is that the lotion is very thick.</li>
            <li> My only issue is with how thick it is... hard to apply...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pale pale ginger who works outdoors doing manual labor all day and can sweat a ton!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We went kayaking and the one small spot I missed with this sunscreen by my knee got burnt pretty badly, but the rest of me was fully protected.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s no junky ingredients, but it is a little thick to apply.</li>
            <li> Nobody has gotten burned, nobody has broken out in rashes (like we do with some of those chemical-filled brands), and you don&#x27;t need a ton of it for coverage, so the bottles have lasted longer than expected.</li>
            <li> Even scrubbing with soap and water, it&#x27;s hard to get the sticky feeling off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get it on and spread it over your skin.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena irritates my skin so badly that my face starts to chap and turn red after a few days.      </li>
            <li> This stuff is so thick and pasty.</li>
            <li> My one complaint is that the lotion is so incredibly thick!</li>
            <li> The sunscreen is very thick and hard to apply evenly.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is very thick and stays on well even while my kids are swimming.</li>
            <li> Also very difficult to wash off after an active day outdoors.</li>
            <li> I am uncomfortable with all the chemicals in Aveeno and Neutrogena.  </li>
            <li> Sorry to give this sunscreen a bad review</li>
            <li> Difficult to wash off in the shower!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate sunscreen that leave your skin feeling oily</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This sunscreen takes a little extra effort to rub in during application, but it provides superb coverage and doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor.  We went kayaking and the one small spot I missed with this sunscreen by my knee got burnt pretty badly, but the rest of me was fully protected.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen for my little guy.  It rubs in nicely and gives good coverage.  I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just spent the past week swimming and kayaking in the ocean and this product was fabulous at protecting my skin. I tend to burn fairly easily especially when I spend hours in the water. I even used it on my face and it did not clog the pores and cause acne which all other products do. Best of all it is a safe and natural product. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use this to mix it with my liquid foundation and it makes me skin glow - but I am not exposed to direct sunlight so I do not know if it will prevent a burn</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product: Natural ingredients + highly effective. I am allergic to many skincare products, so I have to go with natural ones for the most part. Sometimes you suffer effectiveness when using a natural product, but not here. It actually works better than the standard brands. It is true that it is thick and sticky, but I think that is why it works so well.</li>
            <li> Now that we have a pool, my kids and I are out swimming nearly every day. With the curse of sensitive fair skin, sunscreen is a must for our family. However, I am uncomfortable using cheap, mainstream brands with harmful chemicals, especially for everyday use. I needed a solution that would be affordable and not just rinse right off as soon as they hop in the water. This stuff is PERFECT. Nobody has gotten burned, nobody has broken out in rashes (like we do with some of those chemical-filled brands), and you don&#x27;t need a ton of it for coverage, so the bottles have lasted longer than expected. I have tried many different brands of sunscreen and this stuff is by far my #1 choice.</li>
            <li> I have often consulted the skin deep web site to make sure that I buy the least hazardous sun screens I can find for my family.  I have used several others and this is by far the least greasiest of the safe sun screens.</li>
            <li> I brought this sunscreen to Hawaii assuming I would need a water resistant sunscreen that also provided higher SPF protection. I like that it is paraben free and seems to absorb or adhere to the skin better than other water resistant products. My one complaint is that the lotion is so incredibly thick! After much effort, the white streaks finally disappeared. On the second day of my vacation I decided to save myself from the tiring application process and used my friend&#x27;s sunscreen instead. I do not recommend using this on your face as it is far too thick and leaves a slight residue feeling on the skin. Overall, it is good for the days you anticipate water play, but not for every day use.</li>
            <li> This is sunscreen that actually works beautifully. I have vitiligo, so have to be extra careful, but I also ride horses nearly every day, so an effective sunscreen is critical. This is the best one I&#x27;ve used and a good value, too. Goes on white, but disappears nearly instantly and doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is very thick and stays on well even while my kids are swimming. I love that it lacks the chemicals other major brands include.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the sunscreen can make my kids&#x27; skin look grey once they get in the water. They have medium- to dark-brown skin, so once the sunscreen has been applied - even if it&#x27;s totally rubbed in and not visible - it makes their skin look a corpse-like grey color once they&#x27;re wet. It seems to go away after 30 minutes or so, and they&#x27;re young and don&#x27;t care, so it&#x27;s only a minor drawback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price for the three-pack is a great deal, too!</li>
            <li> Great product. Not greasy, dosn&#x27;t smell, works great.  We are sun lovers &amp; feel good about putting natural stuff on our bodies. We use this all summer long. Love it.</li>
            <li> The best sunscreen I have found that lasts several hours in the water. No other product compares for protection in the surf.</li>
            <li> this works, protects well however it is stickier and the zinc in it leaves my bathing suits on the white side (Straps) so I prefer BLue Lizard however this places a good second!</li>
            <li> I am a natural products person who has tried about every single natural product in the market.  And I have also tried Aveeno and Neutrogena products as well.  I am continually disappointed by the thin consistency and odor of many of the natural products.  And my husband burns with almost all of them.  I am uncomfortable with all the chemicals in Aveeno and Neutrogena.  Neutrogena irritates my skin so badly that my face starts to chap and turn red after a few days.      The 30 spf version of this product prevented us from burning when we were vacationing on the beach in Mexico or the Caribbean, even with only a single application in the morning.  Now they offer 50 spf!  It has no odors and you can pronounce and understand what most of the ingredients are on the tube.  there is nothing more protective than a physical block for sunscreen (i.e. zinc oxide) - this product is 10% zinc oxide.     Try it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Works great.  You do need to reapply of course after an hour or 2 in the water.  I will buy this next summer again</li>
            <li> This sun block works great and it is waterproof. It makes my skin feel so soft too. I love it</li>
            <li> Arrived damaged.  One tube leaked and made a mess of other two tubes in the package.  Very thick coat when you apply on skin but really protects the skin very well!</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a sunscreen that did not have the harmful chemicals. Decided to try this Natures Gate produce based on the good reviews. I have to say, I am not a fan of it. The sunscreen is very thick and hard to apply evenly. Also very difficult to wash off after an active day outdoors. Even scrubbing with soap and water, it&#x27;s hard to get the sticky feeling off. I would avoid putting this sunscreen on the face and neck area all together unless you are OK with the stickiness. There has to be something better!</li>
            <li> Really good Sunscreen lotion.  I would recommend it to anyone who wishes great sunscreen protection at a great price.</li>
            <li> i was upset at first when i used this on my face. left it very shinny of course i let it set into my skin. but after i did my routine it worked out great! my face with  my other products placed on top did leave my skin feeling a tad sticky :[. so this will do until its gone</li>
            <li> Works well to protect sensitive skin. Not great if it gets in eyes, but I still haven&#x27;t found a good sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. It stays on for a long time and is very effective under strong sun.</li>
            <li> We spend quite a bit of time in the sun and have often found it hard to get a good quality sunscreen, that is safe, and that works. This sunscreen is great. We use it for surfing, snorkeling, kayaking, hiking, or days spent in the sun. Although we do try to limit our sun exposure, we also enjoy water sports and we live Hawaii. Nature&#x27;s Gates has a good product that you can trust.</li>
            <li> I just reapply this stuff every 2 hours, as recommended, and haven&#x27;t burnt yet! And that&#x27;s really saying something considering I&#x27;m a pale pale ginger who works outdoors doing manual labor all day and can sweat a ton!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great things about this sunscreen to me!&lt;br /&gt;  It&#x27;s vegan!&lt;br /&gt;  It lacks chemicals that could hurt my sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;  It&#x27;s waterproof so I can&#x27;t sweat it off!&lt;br /&gt;  It actually dries dry! I hate sunscreen that leave your skin feeling oily&lt;br /&gt;  It doesn&#x27;t get in my eyes as I sweat or work like non-waterproof oily sunscreen does&lt;br /&gt;  It comes in a relatively high SPF</li>
            <li> My daughter is naturally olive-skinned and burning has never been an issue even spending long days all summer at the beach.  She got a little too much sun one day so I decided to use this product instead of our usual SPF 35 Burn Out for Kids which I love.  Daughter burned even with frequent reapplications of this product AND broke out in a rash.  I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
            <li> I use this every day under my make up. It blends well and stays on and I use it to protect any freckles from popping up on my upper lip. LOVE!</li>
            <li> Works v. well, almost too well. Difficult to wash off in the shower!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit hard to rub in to the skin at first (I would recommend dotting it before attempting to rub it all in), but it&#x27;s not greasy, and it doesn&#x27;t have a powerful sunblock-scent (which I don&#x27;t mind, but it&#x27;s something I noticed). Great for daily use, I use it before I got for a run and before I take my dog for a walk in the morning. It feels slightly tacky, but not enough to bother me. If you&#x27;re looking for a more natural sunscreen lotion, I would try this product.</li>
            <li> Has a whitish cast when you put it on but then disappears after a bit. Seems very waterproof, doesn&#x27;t hurt the eyes either. Best protection for the pool. Dries matt, so also good for a hot steamy day without the feeling of being slathered in oil.</li>
            <li> Sure it may go on a little greasy, but that makes it easy to cover your skin.  I workout pretty enthusiastically, but no matter how hard I sweat, I feel that this sunscreen is always there protecting me.  I&#x27;ve used many other &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; sunscreens with just zinc or titanium oxide, and I find that they don&#x27;t do as good a job as this one, which does have some chemical blocks included.  If they could find a way to make it dry to touch after application, I would give this 5 stars, but if they did this I believe it would probably compromise  its water resistance and sweat proof qualities.</li>
            <li> After reading in a health magazine about this product, I decided to try it when we went to our family vacation at the beach.  Neither my husband or I had any sunburn and I will definitely use it again.  I was able to order it online at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Spent 10 days in the British Virgin islands.  Snorkeled  every day  and did not get sunburn on any places  where the sun block was applied.  it was thick  and went on smooth  WILL USE AGAIN</li>
            <li> My daughter seems to get burned every time I use this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> We love it! the bottle leaks the stuff ...so be on notice when throwing in the drawer or a bag!</li>
            <li> Works good.  We haven&#x27;t burned.  Is hard to clean off though which just means it is really water resistant.</li>
            <li> does the job&lt;br /&gt;very water resistant&lt;br /&gt;reasonably priced&lt;br /&gt;nicely packaged&lt;br /&gt;easy to use&lt;br /&gt;excellent ingredients&lt;br /&gt;not greasy&lt;br /&gt;very easy to apply</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!! I have an extremely light complexion  and I wanted something natural but strong for my trip to Cancun. This sunscreen worked way better than any I&#x27;ve ever used in my life!! All the darker people all around me were burning and I wasn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> I ordered Very WAter Resistant, but the Normal Water Resistant is delivered to me instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would send it back for an exchange, but the international shipping cost more than the product itself...other than that, i will give it a 5 as i have used it before.</li>
            <li> Apply this once in the morning and it works ALL DAY even with swimming. My kids prefer the spray, but I&#x27;m only using this from now on because it&#x27;s a one time application and is free of the chemicals in sprays that soak in and get in their bloodstream.</li>
            <li> Excellent protectant. Non-greasy and no odor. A little goes a long way. Spreads easily on the skin and does not wash off.  I would still recommend reapplying every two hours for ultimate protection. I bought three tubes. One for home, one in my golf bag and one spare. [[ASIN:B000WRZPOW Nature&#x27;s Gate Aqua Block SPF 50 Sunscreen -- 4 fl oz]]</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Cruelty Free! Nobody wants to rub sunblock all over their bodies that has been once used on tortured puppies, cats and bunnies. YUCK! The product really blocks out the harsh rays. I use it over my tattoos to keep them protected. The only catch is that the lotion is very thick. So you really have to rub it in hard to get it to soak in. And even then, it will leave a ever so slight white tint over darker skin or tattoos.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen.  Never burns the eyes and I never taste it once absorbed.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve read the EWGs sunscreen analysis and you&#x27;re looking for a choice that doesn&#x27;t break the bank, this is a good option.  It is zinc oxide based so it&#x27;s thick but it rubs in pretty well so you don&#x27;t look white.  True that it is very water resistant.  I&#x27;m a red head with fair skin and after a week in Hawaii, in and out of the water, I wasn&#x27;t burnt at all!</li>
            <li> This product protected us all summer long - even during a week-long retreat on the Alabama Gulf Shores without a day of rain.  It is absolutely necessary to follow the directions and re-apply every 1.5 hours.  You do have to spend more time rubbing this in than traditional brands - in order to get all the white lotion to disappear - but it is a fantastic alternative to the more toxic chemical-laden products out there.  Thank you, Nature&#x27;s Gate!</li>
            <li> I use this because the Environmental Work Group says that, unlike a lot of sunscreens, it&#x27;s both safe and effective.  It&#x27;s not as sticky and thick as similar products, but it&#x27;s pretty sticky and thick.  It seems to prevent sunburn if used as directed.  This includes reapplying it every couple of hours, which can be pretty gross if one is sweaty and it&#x27;s a hot day.</li>
            <li> Other reviews have already said it so I won&#x27;t repeat it all but this is amazing. My husband has super sensitive skin and wears this when he surfs. His face is oily and this stuff stays put. With other brands his face would be burnt after a surf session...not anymore. We use it on the two year old all they way to the adults. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Almost bought this sunscreen because I thought it was a natural safe product... Luckily, I double checked the ingredients and it contains octinoxate and octocrylene (which can increase incidence of malignant melanoma). When will these sunscreen makers stop putting this junk in their sunscreen? I want it to decrease my risk of cancer... not increase it! Sorry to give this sunscreen a bad review but I&#x27;m annoyed that they advertise it being a natural sunscreen when it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. So far, the sunscreen I use with no toxic chemicals, etc, is Badger sports sunblock... even though it has a white sheen, it&#x27;s great for surfing! Still looking for a good daily wear sunscreen though.</li>
            <li> I must use a total sunscreen protection product, and this product provides that!  It goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t smell, and, I can honestly say that my dermatologist is very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> One of the bottles lasted a week at the beach (with just me using it), but only applying once per day. We might have been in the sun for 4-5 hours max per session. I got some tan and no burn. If I would have reapplied, I assume I&#x27;d have less tan. My only issue is with how thick it is... hard to apply... although the fianc&amp;eacute; (who&#x27;s spent a lot more time at the beach) feels that that&#x27;s the sign of a good sunscreen that will stick around longer.</li>
            <li> I like that there&#x27;s no junky ingredients, but it is a little thick to apply.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so thick and pasty. It&#x27;s hard to get it on and spread it over your skin. Once it dries, though, you won&#x27;t get a sunburn. Don&#x27;t put it on your face unless you want your pores clogged.</li>
