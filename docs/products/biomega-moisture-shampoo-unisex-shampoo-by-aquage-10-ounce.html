            <li>Gave my hair a great feeling of softness and fullness.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a good price.</li>
            <li>AND WAS A GOOD PRICE.</li>
            <li>I have found them to be really good products without leaving my hair stripped or too greasy.  </li>
            <li>that was full of split ends and breakage to, beautiful, healthier, and shiny in about two weeks of use!</li>
            <li>the combo of shampoo/conditioner is sensational...</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells great and makes my hair squeaky clean!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks amazing.  </li>
            <li>Smells amazing, feels amazing...</li>
            <li>it is so nice and leaves my hair that way......</li>
            <li>When I use Biomega Moisture Shampoo my hair is shiny and easy to manage!</li>
            <li>Most people feel that it makes your hair cleaner</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and love it.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and leaves your hair instantly silky, even while in the shower.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for 2 years, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>This leads me to wash my hair every day to try and get more volume and clarify my hair once a week.  </li>
            <li>A LOT BETTER THAN AT THE SALON</li>
            <li>just love it.</li>
            <li>Love love love LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>and I love how smoothly u r hair feels afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Clean n&#x27; fresh would have been nice.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo, especially for colored hair.</li>
            <li>If you use this shampoo and conditioner then your hair still gets clean, but doesn&#x27;t strip your hair of its oils</li>
            <li>I only have to get a cut every 2-3 months since my ends rarely split (but I also use Argan Oil which is another great product if you use a lot of heat).  </li>
            <li>I love this whole line.</li>
            <li>Came quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially great for my super long, colored, coarse hair.</li>
            <li>The ingredients were intriguing so it caught my attention.</li>
            <li>I am able to use a pea size amount of the product but still have really good results so they also last a very long time.</li>
            <li>I now have long, full, healthy and shiny hair.</li>
            <li>Very gentle.</li>
            <li>Since it seems as if sulfate-free shampoos are causing more damage than good, I am going back to using sulfates, and just washing my hair every few days.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>Not unscented, just kind of odd smelling.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much, so the bottle goes farther than you would expect.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t complain.  </li>
            <li>I went through between 2 bottles of each shampoo and conditioner for the whole year.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much conditioner at all.</li>
            <li>Recommended by my Salon Owner, but much cheaper on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Silk Shampoo and Intense Conditioner as of late but the moisturizing and volumizing are good too.</li>
            <li>Smells great and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have fine, curly/wavy hair that gets very dry at the ends.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have long, semi-wavy thick hair and its a great choice.</li>
            <li>is the case I have had with two other sulfate free shampoos I have used (Shea Moisture Thickening, and Say Yes to Cucumbers).  </li>
            <li>This leaves my hair super dry and defeats the purpose of using the sulfate-free shampoo anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Normal shampoos and conditioners contain sulfur in them which strips your hair of its natural oils.</li>
            <li>(Everyone says its gross at first</li>
            <li>It also made my hair not feel as soft.</li>
            <li>Lastly, it wasn&#x27;t the easiest to get through or out of my hair; it just didn&#x27;t feel like my hair was really cleansed or treated.</li>
            <li>My hair has been completely reborn.</li>
            <li>This leaves your hair feeling cleaner for a little while but makes it more oily in the long run (about 24 hours).  </li>
            <li>This particular shampoo didn&#x27;t come close enough to my needs &amp; expectations.</li>
            <li>The only down side for the shampoo is that it does not have a rich lather.  </li>
            <li>My hair barely needs any product after washing it with this stuff.</li>
            <li>I keep wanting to like this shampoo, and I&#x27;ve actually almost used the whole bottle within the last few months, but I really just don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>There is only a very faint (pleasant) smell.</li>
            <li>The proof was in the pudding when my fine, color processed hair was totally void of shine, body &amp; moisture, and from feedback, rather flat, dull &amp; frizzy.</li>

            <li> Because of this, there will be very little suds.  </li>
            <li> My hair went from dull frizzy</li>

            <li> I have been using this product with the Biomega Intensive conditioner for about two weeks, and am really impressed with the improvement of the condition of my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t take much, so the bottle goes farther than you would expect.  The only down side for the shampoo is that it does not have a rich lather.  But considering I went from having to use everything from detanglers, to shine spray, and everything in between to the ease of just brushing my hair once when it&#x27;s wet, and then going about my day... I really can&#x27;t complain.  My hair went from dull frizzy that was full of split ends and breakage to, beautiful, healthier, and shiny in about two weeks of use!</li>
            <li> Not worth what I paid for it</li>
            <li> About a year ago I was educated about the difference between regular shampoo/conditioner and their sulfur-less counterparts. Normal shampoos and conditioners contain sulfur in them which strips your hair of its natural oils. Most people feel that it makes your hair cleaner but it doesn&#x27;t. Your hair actually starts to replenish the oils and when you use sulfur that strips away all the oils, your scalp over compensates. This leaves your hair feeling cleaner for a little while but makes it more oily in the long run (about 24 hours).  If you use this shampoo and conditioner then your hair still gets clean, but doesn&#x27;t strip your hair of its oils and so you don&#x27;t have to wash as often. I wash my hair every other day, but some people I know go longer. (Everyone says its gross at first but it&#x27;s not, you can shower without washing your hair every time). I now have long, full, healthy and shiny hair. I&#x27;ve been using this product line for over a year (Shampoo, Conditioner, and Leave in Conditioner). I blow dry, and use a curler or straightener every time. I only have to get a cut every 2-3 months since my ends rarely split (but I also use Argan Oil which is another great product if you use a lot of heat).  It&#x27;s also a good price. I went through between 2 bottles of each shampoo and conditioner for the whole year. You don&#x27;t need much conditioner at all. I have been using the Silk Shampoo and Intense Conditioner as of late but the moisturizing and volumizing are good too.</li>
            <li> When I use Biomega Moisture Shampoo my hair is shiny and easy to manage! I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and love it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve tried multiple other brands and always resort back to this. It smells wonderful and leaves your hair instantly silky, even while in the shower. I have long, semi-wavy thick hair and its a great choice. It&#x27;s also one of the only shampoos that hasn&#x27;t caused a ton of breakage in my hair, plus its also sulfate-free!</li>
            <li> I love this whole line. It&#x27;s especially great for my super long, colored, coarse hair. My hair barely needs any product after washing it with this stuff. The scent doesn&#x27;t linger on my hair and a little actually goes a long way for once.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 2 years, and I love it.  I gave some to my granddaughter and she loves it.  Apply to wet hair and when your hair dries, it is so soft. My hair seems to not be as dry.</li>
            <li> I keep wanting to like this shampoo, and I&#x27;ve actually almost used the whole bottle within the last few months, but I really just don&#x27;t.  I have fine, curly/wavy hair that gets very dry at the ends.  My hair stylist works for Aquage and recommended this shampoo and conditioner, because I&#x27;ve been sulfate-free for the last couple years.  However this shampoo always weighs down my hair and leaves it greasy in the back.  I will rub in the shampoo all over and try to rinse it all out, but it leaves a film on my scalp no matter how hard I try to gently rub it out with my fingers in the shower.  This leads me to wash my hair every day to try and get more volume and clarify my hair once a week.  This leaves my hair super dry and defeats the purpose of using the sulfate-free shampoo anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the case I have had with two other sulfate free shampoos I have used (Shea Moisture Thickening, and Say Yes to Cucumbers).  Since it seems as if sulfate-free shampoos are causing more damage than good, I am going back to using sulfates, and just washing my hair every few days.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, so I was very happy to have found it at this price. It has no detergents in it, which is what I wanted for my colored &amp; highlighted hair. Because of this, there will be very little suds.  Very gentle. There is only a very faint (pleasant) smell. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is an imitation of the shampoo. I bought one from Amazon and compared it to the one I purchased at a salon. The Amazon shampoo is not as thick and is a different color than the salon shampoo. It also made my hair not feel as soft.</li>
            <li> LIKE THE SHAMPOO AND WAS A GOOD PRICE. I FOUND THIS PRICE A LOT BETTER THAN AT THE SALON THAT I GO TO...</li>
            <li> I lovvvvvve the way this stuff makes my hair feel!!  It&#x27;s amazing.  I am a die hard fan of Pureology and vowed not to use anything else but that line.  I had to switch shampoo&#x27;s for a while and chose this.  My hair looks amazing.  It&#x27;s going to be hard to go back.</li>
            <li> great shampoo....conditioner is great too....i am a wen girl...occasionally i use this...only other product i will use besides wen.......it is so nice and leaves my hair that way......it doesnt lather alot but i am used to that........the combo of shampoo/conditioner is sensational...</li>
            <li> I bought this product from my hairdresser, and then she moved. Smells amazing, feels amazing...just love it. I ordered it on Amazon, and the consistency was way off. It&#x27;s so liquidy, half of the amount I put in my hair, ended up all over the tub. Maybe I just got a bad bottle? Wasn&#x27;t happy with it this time.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells great and makes my hair squeaky clean! Love that it doesn&#x27;t have all the bad ingredients that a lot of shampoos have.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo, especially for colored hair. Smells great and a little goes a long way. Recommended by my Salon Owner, but much cheaper on Amazon.com. Came quickly and packaged well. Try it!</li>
            <li> The Aquage brand has been around for awhile &amp; so when their Biomega line came out, I was curious to try out some of the products. The ingredients were intriguing so it caught my attention. This particular shampoo didn&#x27;t come close enough to my needs &amp; expectations. Not one for heavily floral or perfumey scents, however, this one is really nondescript. Not unscented, just kind of odd smelling. Clean n&#x27; fresh would have been nice. Lastly, it wasn&#x27;t the easiest to get through or out of my hair; it just didn&#x27;t feel like my hair was really cleansed or treated. The proof was in the pudding when my fine, color processed hair was totally void of shine, body &amp; moisture, and from feedback, rather flat, dull &amp; frizzy. Impulsive buy &amp; absolutely not a good one.</li>
            <li> I use all of the Biomega product line on my hair.  I have found them to be really good products without leaving my hair stripped or too greasy.  I am able to use a pea size amount of the product but still have really good results so they also last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Love love love LOVE this product. My hair has been completely reborn. My hair stylist is a freaking godsend ANGEL for introducing this to me.</li>
            <li> Gave my hair a great feeling of softness and fullness. I will definitely keep using this shampoo along with the conditioner and hair spray.</li>
            <li> I have used Biomega shampoo before and I love how smoothly u r hair feels afterwards.  I highly recommend it!!</li>
