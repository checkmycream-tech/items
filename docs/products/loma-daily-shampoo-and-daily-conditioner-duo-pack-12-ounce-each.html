            <li> It smells fresh (a little bit like citrus) and feels like a high end salon brand.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel so much healthier than the products I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> left my hair feeling dry and tangled.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a shampoo that is just a shampoo and isn&#x27;t for curly hair, or straight hair or frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> cause my hair turn out to get dry with it</li>
            <li> It was a big mess.</li>
            <li> but I thought, maybe the moisturizing would be too heavy for every other day shampooing.  </li>
            <li> I actually believe this was a fake of the product.</li>
            <li> Tape was hard to remove as packaged, but thank you.</li>
            <li> At least on my hair.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner wasn&#x27;t as bad as the shampoo, but I had to re-wash &amp; re-condition with other products immediately after using this.</li>
            <li> This shampoo left my hair feeling sticky and awful, like I&#x27;d put marshmallow in my hair instead of shampoo.</li>
            <li> Well, I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> This is a FAKE or outdated product!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it ended up drying my hair out quite a bit and made it brittle and unmanageable.</li>

            <li> Not the real stuff at all</li>
            <li> Love the lemon smell, fabulous organic shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> This shampoo left my hair feeling sticky and awful, like I&#x27;d put marshmallow in my hair instead of shampoo. I like that it&#x27;s mostly(?) organic, but would definitely not use it again. The conditioner wasn&#x27;t as bad as the shampoo, but I had to re-wash &amp; re-condition with other products immediately after using this. My color-treated hair was not moisturized or nice feeling after trying these. Oh, and the shampoo also leaked a bit in shipping. Gross.</li>
            <li> I order the combo because most raved about how wonderful their hair looked. It&#x27;s OK. Not my favorite. It&#x27;s a daily shampoo and I don&#x27;t shampoo daily, but I thought, maybe the moisturizing would be too heavy for every other day shampooing.  Well, I was wrong.  Daily is drying.  At least on my hair.  I will finish using it but will mix this shampoo with another conditioner. I really can&#x27;t say I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Smells great (citris) but it didn&#x27;t work as well as I would have hoped. Not hydrating enough.</li>
            <li> I try this shampoo from the store and i noticed that my hait getting shiny and soft, but  when i order it from  amazon i didnt  have the same results and the smell is not the same so im pretty sure it is mix with something else cause my hair turn out to get dry with it</li>
            <li> Really great products!</li>
            <li> Definitely highly recommended!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does what it promises!</li>
            <li> Not at good as Pureology. left my hair feeling dry and tangled.</li>
            <li> This is a FAKE or outdated product!  Do not buy. I have purchased in the salon and it is WAY different in consistency, smell AND quality. Do not trust this.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product at my hair salon and it was incredible. I purchased this product once on amazon and it was the same. However, the last bottle I purchased had a different smell, texture, etc...I actually believe this was a fake of the product.</li>
            <li> Excellent hampoo and Conditioner. It has turned my hair into beautiful healthy hair!</li>
            <li> love love love the loma line and i can get it cheaper on here then in stores- will buy again but the bigger bottles</li>
            <li> Love this product. Makes my hair feel so much healthier than the products I&#x27;ve tried in the past. If you&#x27;re looking for a good product without sulfates or parabens this is the combination to try!</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a shampoo that is just a shampoo and isn&#x27;t for curly hair, or straight hair or frizzy hair.  This shampoo is perfect for every day and the conditioner works great.  very light, and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling heavy.  Smells good, too.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. It smells amazing and conditions very nicely. It&#x27;s also gluten free. The package came on time and the product was packaged nicely. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product, however when it was mailed the bottles had leaked and almost half was gone. It was a big mess.</li>
            <li> Great seller.  Shampoo and conditioner came packaged as a set in a box and the bottles were shrink wrapped.  I love all Loma products.  My hair feels soft and healthy.  The scent of the product is light and not overpowering too.</li>
            <li> Great product and gentle on colored hair, no sulfates</li>
            <li> Great.  Tape was hard to remove as packaged, but thank you.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite organic brand of shampoo/conditioner. It smells fresh (a little bit like citrus) and feels like a high end salon brand.</li>
            <li> Second time I&#x27;ve bought this line of Shampoo &amp; Conditioner. I like it.</li>
            <li> Great for my fine, oil-prone hair! Will definitely be finishing the set and ordering more.  Update (5/1/15) - Unfortunately it ended up drying my hair out quite a bit and made it brittle and unmanageable. As a results I&#x27;m dropping my rating from 5 to 2 stars.</li>
            <li> Loma products are great!!</li>
            <li> My hisband loves this. His hair is now shiny and soft</li>
