            <li>However, I think regardless of how it works on acne scars, I will re-buy this product because of how great it makes my skin feel and how glowy it looks afterwards!</li>
            <li>I bought this after seeing excellent results on /r/skincareaddiction.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not the greatest fan of skin care gels.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d use this product with a bha to get the best results.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the result!</li>
            <li>I am SO happy I started my face routine using a product like this one.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Great price and</li>
            <li>This works great to reveal radiant skin</li>
            <li>This is a very effective exfoliant.</li>
            <li>It is amazing!  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re both amazing!</li>
            <li>know Paula says not to purchase jars because the good stuff oxidize</li>
            <li>I have oversized pores and acne scars and my skin has never looked so good.</li>
            <li>I also would have liked to know of their referal prigram sooner</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can get a cheaper and just as effective product from Alpha Hydrox</li>
            <li>but they lack the nice blend of anti-irritants and &amp;#34;good for skin&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Smooth, bright, and bouncy.</li>
            <li>How can a product be good for you when it is filled with cancer causing parabens ?</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>Comes in a nice easy to use pump dispenser.</li>
            <li>I figure the emollient qualities for moisture are what I need on top of the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff is acne fighting magic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for over 10 years and have never found anything better</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>love it, has made quite a difference in texture..</li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks I&#x27;m already noticing my face becoming softer to the touch.</li>
            <li>http://goo.gl/J5uNbc Enjoy :)</li>
            <li>Such a nice non greasy, non-drying formula... really good for day time....</li>
            <li>and there is def finely improvement.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so smooth after using.</li>
            <li>First off - I have mostly hormonal acne.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m looking at you, St. Ives apricot scrub), but within a few weeks I was able to stop wearing foundation because my skin looked so good.</li>
            <li>I find I have to quickly follow with a moisturizer before it dries and peels if I rub it.</li>
            <li>overall I am satisfied with my purchase and will most like buy it again.</li>
            <li>Cool stuff right here.</li>
            <li>Skin is so much smoother!!  </li>
            <li>Product is exactly as shown, no complaints!</li>
            <li>Completely changed my skin, for the better.</li>
            <li>I finally relegated this gel for use on my bikini area to help with ingrown hairs and it seems to be effective.</li>
            <li>Even Paula&#x27;s Choice seems to put more time and research into developing a wide range of BHA&#x27;s but not so much love for AHA&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to see Paula&#x27;s Choice develop a rich cream formula (similar to their cream BHA)</li>
            <li>Not to harsh on my skin but very effective.</li>
            <li>so I found doing 1 pump at night every other day for a week was a good way to acclamate to it.</li>
            <li>Really good for getting rid of closed comedones and acne scarring, both which are really had for me to get rid of.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to put on at night only and use moisturizer!</li>
            <li>so I will share mine: here is a link for $10 OFF your first Paula&#x27;s Choice online order:</li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;ll still get an occasional pimple or two around that time of the month, but it cleared up most of the issues that I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>My first Paula&#x27;s Choice product.</li>
            <li>I was able to use the product every single night, right from the beginning, without experiencing any dryness.</li>
            <li>I can finally wear less makeup and feel good about my face!</li>
            <li>They too easily can be sticky but that can somewhat be remedied by applying only tiniest amount.  </li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t find a moisturizer in a tube on Amazon that sounded as though it would be rich enough.</li>
            <li>My pores and dented scars are less noticible and already my hyperpigmentation scars have mostly faded.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have found this doesn&#x27;t upset it in any way!  </li>
            <li>It does what it promises, however it reminded me why I dislike skin products in gel form: it slips on and dries to a sticky, tight film that seems to sit on top of your skin instead of sinking in.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also clear, and doesnt really have an odor.</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin and this product keeps me cells turned over quickly</li>
            <li>These have the same active ingredients and work better in my opinion but are literally 1/8 the cost.</li>
            <li>Makes my face really soft.</li>
            <li>Some nights I&#x27;ve forgotten to moisturize and this product has still not dried my skin</li>
            <li>Can me slightly sensitive but the benefits of exfoliation are undeniable.</li>
            <li>I struggled with hormonal breakouts and really didn&#x27;t get the results I wanted after being prescribed topical antibiotics.</li>
            <li>first I thought it was pretty pricey, however once I received the product I realized that you use so little for your face so it will probably last forever.</li>
            <li>but I generally have sensitive skin when it comes to AHA.</li>
            <li>I live this product and will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li>Anytime I try out a new skin product, I am always very worried that it will dry my skin out as I have extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li>It left my face feeling so soft, and did not dry me out at all!!</li>
            <li>My skin is so much clearer than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>When I first put this on my face, I panicked a little since it did sting a bit.</li>
            <li>I have relatively sensitive skin, and this product does not irritate or make my skin overly dry.</li>
            <li>This actually irritated my skin pretty heavily</li>
    </ol>

            <li> but I gave 4 stars because it&#x27;s very slow to diminish my sunspots and other signs of aging.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After a couple of weeks I&#x27;m already noticing my face becoming softer to the touch. A drop about the size of a pea provides enough coverage. Instead of following up with an expensive moisturizer I&#x27;m using Eucerin at $10.00 for a small jar. Since the gel packs a punch I figure the emollient qualities for moisture are what I need on top of the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know Paula says not to purchase jars because the good stuff oxidize so perhaps I&#x27;ll upgrade. I just didn&#x27;t find a moisturizer in a tube on Amazon that sounded as though it would be rich enough.</li>
            <li> This stuff is acne fighting magic. I noticed a difference in my skin in a week. Makes my face really soft. Just make sure to put on at night only and use moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin and this product keeps me cells turned over quickly so I never have flaky skin.  It is amazing!  I&#x27;ve used it for over 10 years and have never found anything better</li>
            <li> I heard about this product on the r/skincareaddiction subreddit. I was looking for a product to help with fading acne scars. Anytime I try out a new skin product, I am always very worried that it will dry my skin out as I have extremely dry skin. When I first put this on my face, I panicked a little since it did sting a bit. I moisturized with Cerave moisturizing cream afterwards but was still worried I&#x27;d wake up with dry, flaky skin like every other &amp;#34;harsh&amp;#34; skin product I&#x27;ve tried. I was very pleased with the result! It left my face feeling so soft, and did not dry me out at all!! I was able to use the product every single night, right from the beginning, without experiencing any dryness. Some nights I&#x27;ve forgotten to moisturize and this product has still not dried my skin out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for fading acne scars, it is a slow process but I am seeing results! However, I think regardless of how it works on acne scars, I will re-buy this product because of how great it makes my skin feel and how glowy it looks afterwards!</li>
            <li> Completely changed my skin, for the better. I have had pigment problems for years, thanks to acne scars and harsh exfoliators (I&#x27;m looking at you, St. Ives apricot scrub), but within a few weeks I was able to stop wearing foundation because my skin looked so good.</li>
            <li> I am SO happy I started my face routine using a product like this one. I also would have liked to know of their referal prigram sooner so I will share mine: here is a link for $10 OFF your first Paula&#x27;s Choice online order: http://goo.gl/J5uNbc Enjoy :)</li>
            <li> Skin is so much smoother!!  It does &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; a little bit when I first started using it, but other than that I will keep buying this product.</li>
            <li> This actually irritated my skin pretty heavily but I generally have sensitive skin when it comes to AHA.</li>
            <li> Can me slightly sensitive but the benefits of exfoliation are undeniable. Price is a little high for poor college student.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t quite combat my acne, so I think next time I will buy a BHA. But it does what an AHA is supposed to do! Tastes a bit funky, don&#x27;t get it around your lips. Comes in a nice easy to use pump dispenser. It&#x27;s also clear, and doesnt really have an odor.</li>
            <li> I got this with the BHA liquid and I&#x27;m not really sure why. It does what it promises, however it reminded me why I dislike skin products in gel form: it slips on and dries to a sticky, tight film that seems to sit on top of your skin instead of sinking in. I find I have to quickly follow with a moisturizer before it dries and peels if I rub it. I prefer a cream, lotion, or liquid. I finally relegated this gel for use on my bikini area to help with ingrown hairs and it seems to be effective.</li>
            <li> This is a very effective exfoliant. I have sensative skin so I found doing 1 pump at night every other day for a week was a good way to acclamate to it. It&#x27;s been about a month and there is def finely improvement. I have oversized pores and acne scars and my skin has never looked so good. Smooth, bright, and bouncy. My pores and dented scars are less noticible and already my hyperpigmentation scars have mostly faded.</li>
            <li> Cool stuff right here.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have found this doesn&#x27;t upset it in any way!  My skin feels so smooth after using.</li>
            <li> It does not work for my acne, maybe the concentration is not enough. I will try 12% next time.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I have used for several years!</li>
            <li> I love it. Great price and it works!!</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as shown, no complaints!</li>
            <li> This works great to reveal radiant skin but I gave 4 stars because it&#x27;s very slow to diminish my sunspots and other signs of aging. Be patient!</li>
            <li> love it, has made quite a difference in texture..I  use 2x daily. Would recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this not even two weeks and already my post-acne erythema is fading. I live this product and will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing excellent results on /r/skincareaddiction. I struggled with hormonal breakouts and really didn&#x27;t get the results I wanted after being prescribed topical antibiotics. After using this for around 2 weeks (in conjunction with my salicylic acid astringent pads) I am hooked. My skin is so much clearer than I expected it to be. I know I&#x27;ll still get an occasional pimple or two around that time of the month, but it cleared up most of the issues that I&#x27;ve had. A little goes a long way, so I expect this to last me awhile.</li>
            <li> Contains 5 different parabens. Wished I had noticed that before. No thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Back it goes.</li>
            <li> I got this one and the salicylic acid serum. They&#x27;re both amazing! Not to harsh on my skin but very effective. I got these serums to replace my $100/ oz luzern serums. These have the same active ingredients and work better in my opinion but are literally 1/8 the cost.</li>
            <li> First off - I have mostly hormonal acne. I have redness on my cheeks and acne scarring. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days and so far all the redness and scars are fading! I can finally wear less makeup and feel good about my face! Love love love!</li>
            <li> AHA&#x27;s were all the rage 20 years ago but skin care companies seem to have forgotten about them nowadays.  Even Paula&#x27;s Choice seems to put more time and research into developing a wide range of BHA&#x27;s but not so much love for AHA&#x27;s.  And that&#x27;s too bad because AHA&#x27;s remain a first choice for those who are struggling with dry and sun damaged skin or for anyone who wants the long term benefits of exfoliating the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can get a cheaper and just as effective product from Alpha Hydrox but they lack the nice blend of anti-irritants and &amp;#34;good for skin&amp;#34; extras that this product does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not the greatest fan of skin care gels.  They too easily can be sticky but that can somewhat be remedied by applying only tiniest amount.  If only used on your face, expect this product to last for quite some time. I&#x27;d love to see Paula&#x27;s Choice develop a rich cream formula (similar to their cream BHA) but I doubt we&#x27;ll see it anytime soon.  Until then, this dated product remains one of the few modestly priced AHA options out there.</li>
            <li> Such a nice non greasy, non-drying formula... really good for day time.... as for results, i will have to try this out longer to let you all know.</li>
            <li> How can a product be good for you when it is filled with cancer causing parabens ? No. Just no.</li>
            <li> My first Paula&#x27;s Choice product. I purchased it because it was recommended from a few friends. I have relatively sensitive skin, and this product does not irritate or make my skin overly dry. I use this product in conjunction with a standard face wash and some lotion. Nothing too special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought it was pretty pricey, however once I received the product I realized that you use so little for your face so it will probably last forever. I am still dialing in how often I need to use this product for my skin type, but overall I am satisfied with my purchase and will most like buy it again.</li>
            <li> Really good for getting rid of closed comedones and acne scarring, both which are really had for me to get rid of. I&#x27;d use this product with a bha to get the best results.</li>
