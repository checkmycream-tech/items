    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is a wonderful lip balm that doesn&#x27;t feel waxy, like the Chapstick brand tends to, and doesn&#x27;t have salicylic acid in it, like the Carmex brand does.</li>
            <li>It smells delicious.</li>
            <li>i have used rosebud balm for years but this is the best.</li>
            <li>It smells delicious</li>
            <li>Now I buy it for myself and appreciate the healing it provides along with the delightful fragrance.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s very good for every day wear</li>
            <li>The retro-style tin is also very cute!</li>
            <li>A great product, and well-worth the price.</li>
            <li>great fr the winter time,</li>
            <li>This lip balm lasts forever, smells great, and does a great job of keeping my lips hydrated.</li>
            <li>Great salve...</li>
            <li>You might ask yourself what the heck a Brambleberry is but don&#x27;t worry about it, just get it because it smells great-</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>Very Nice lip moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The case is also delightfully retro-looking and is easy to find in your purse.</li>
            <li>But it is an ample tin, and a good product.</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly and does a great job moisturizing my lips!</li>
            <li>my Grandmother used the Rosebud Salve on my scrapes and I loved the smell.</li>
            <li>This light lip tint and excellent moisturizer is probably one of the best on the market and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>This stuff is nice and smells good.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite lip balm!</li>
            <li>The packaging is adorable!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite scent out of all the rosebud salves!</li>
            <li>I love this product !</li>
            <li>It smells yummy and has a nice maroony-rosish color (I hope that made sense).</li>
            <li>with a hint of rose.</li>
            <li>My sister gave me one with rose</li>
            <li>Lip Balm, Brambleberry Rose:</li>
            <li>Loving using it at night, the scent is relaxing.</li>
            <li>While the Minted Rose remains my favorite flavor, I am in love with the Brambleberry Rose because it leaves a nice, light pinky-purple sheen!</li>
            <li>like straight out of a magazine gorgeous!</li>
            <li>This rubs off very easily and is mostly petroleum.</li>
            <li>It smells lovely and feels very smooth on the lips.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get much better than this.  </li>
            <li>many of the stars use this, so I had to try it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, but beware toting it around with you in your purse/makeup bag, or in the car, as if it warms up</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been using one jar every day through most of my pregnancy...</li>
            <li>I love the packaging.</li>
            <li>do wish they made this in a squeeze tube for more sanitary application.</li>
            <li>oh and i LOVE the retro packaging too.</li>
            <li>looks looking healthy.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s velvety smooth!</li>
            <li>Love this product, I also have it in the tube form.</li>
            <li>Sure I will try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But the fragrance is a bit too overpowering for me (more of a perfume smell than I would like).  </li>
            <li>but I think this would be a much better product if they used just a fraction of the perfume.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite lip balm to wear.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that moisturizes your lips really well.</li>
            <li>the lip balms we have make my lips  more chapped than they are</li>
            <li>Looking for a replacement for my favorite salve which seems to have gone off the market.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Just a dab makes my lips feel very soft and smells great with just a hint of color.</li>
            <li>Consistency is fine but the smell is incredibly overwhelming.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very strong rose fragrance smell which is too much for me</li>
            <li>the best- leaves your lips pink and shiny-</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells lovely, and exactly as I would imagine a Brambleberry Rose would smell.</li>
            <li>have tried many lip balms, but few are as delightful as this.</li>
            <li>The scent is so delicious, and my lips really feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It smells more like candy, just really sweet.</li>
            <li>super cute</li>
            <li>I was really excited to receive this in the mail after reading so many positive reviews and seeing photos of shiny, healthy, pinky lips</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the flavor or the smell.</li>
            <li>really candy nice smelling berry-esque balm, non sticky yet moisturizing.</li>
            <li>no matter how chapped they are it always seems to make them perfectly smooth-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s seriously the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever purchased, the consistency is almost like vaseline but better.</li>
            <li>main issue with this product is it does not smell like rose at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as moisturizing as the original salve.</li>
            <li>That said it does not seem to be as moisturizing as the original Rosebud Lip Balm.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very nice and light and the gloss has a nice balance between being slimy and sticky and too hard.</li>
            <li>Great bargain as it lasts for a long time!</li>
            <li>it also seemed to have healed the chapped areas almost right away!</li>
            <li>used to bite my lips a lot and wet them with my tongue a lot but not anymore&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with it ..</li>
            <li>And it is true.</li>
            <li>The latter point is also good because you&#x27;re not supposed to use products with salicylic acid when you&#x27;re pregnant</li>
            <li>Rosebud is fine, nice fragrance, like the bigger tin.</li>
            <li>simply super.</li>
            <li>Love the lip balm but didn&#x27;t like dealing with this particular container.</li>
            <li>As for moisturizing, it&#x27;s about the same as Vaseline or the original Rosebud formula would do although the shea butter in here is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>The product is fine as far as softening but the fragrance is way, way too strong.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny...</li>
            <li>But it is worth a try if you are a fan of this brand.</li>
            <li>Smells good but the consistency is too thick and it made my lips feel more chapped.</li>
            <li>I  just wish it was made with all natural ingredients, still a favorite of mine</li>
            <li>When I first opened the tin, I almost couldn&#x27;t use it because of the overpowering sweet smell.</li>
            <li>Now, to address Brambleberry Rose: I prefer the Strawberry for my lips and that is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 Stars.</li>
            <li>This is a very clean and soft balm.</li>
            <li>to more than likely end up all over the inside of your purse or makeup bag.</li>
            <li>and if I&#x27;d known that beforehand I most likely wouldn&#x27;t have given into the impulse to buy it.</li>
            <li>Okay, must have had some temperature changes during shipping and some of the ingredients have separated, no big deal</li>
            <li>husband was keenly interested as I&lt;br /&gt;unpeeled</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not upset enough to return it, as I love the packaging and the moisture.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was a really oily, watery surface of the lip balm...</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like this.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really describe it very well</li>
            <li>, it not only keeps my lips smooth</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>very fruity- not too floral.</li>
            <li>it is reasonable in price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>even my cat would bent on my lips to smell it very keenly!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>really recommend it&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also makes my lips look healthy and pink</li>
            <li>Sun, wind, very low humidity, and in the winter, a good deal of cold weather &#x3D; you need good lip</li>
            <li>Perhaps, like me,  you are compelled to have an iconic something or other in your life, for validation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of greasy,  and does not last long at all.</li>
            <li>I love trying new lip balms, and was curious to try this one.  </li>
            <li>If you prefer a lot less color on your lips, then you will be pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>I purchased several for gifts &amp; most of my friends discarded them because they couldn&#x27;t get it open.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a lot easier to throw a tin of Rosebud Brambleberry Rose Lip Balm in the back pocket of your jeans than it is to drag a [NOTE::::spoiler alert!]</li>
            <li>I love the little tin.  </li>
            <li>It makes my lips really soft, even when they are very chapped.</li>
            <li>It gives your lips a lovely sheer sheen and softens them all day long.</li>
            <li>i love this product so much but finding this particular flavor / scent is hard</li>
            <li>It does get quite soft when it&#x27;s hot out, like one reviewer noted, but as long as you&#x27;re not just keeping it in your hot car it does get firmer again.</li>
            <li>It smells a little different than the original, but not bad.</li>
            <li>I put the product on, really loved the shine, moisturizing and how long it lasted on my lips, but I just can&#x27;t get past this wretched rotting smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to utilize the rubber band trick to get this open the first time</li>
            <li>I actually had to fight him off in order to be the first one to touch the lip&lt;br</li>
            <li>The flavor and fragrance is really unique and i will never go back to the regular rosebud for lip balm again!</li>
            <li>my order of this new lip balm arrived, I noticed it wasn&#x27;t a bit like my old favourite.</li>
            <li>it becomes VERY \\&quot;liquidy\\&quot; in a relatively short amount of time ~ which gives it oportunity</li>
            <li>about 5-6 months so far, and the jar still has some in it.</li>
            <li>Makes my lips so soft</li>
            <li>It goes on soft and silky, not like a waxy Chapstick.</li>
            <li>Which is nothing like &#x27;A blend of wild berry flavors with overtones of honey and vanilla&#x27; as the product description suggests...</li>
            <li>1 pot of this lasts you for nearly 1 year even if you are a lip gloss whore.</li>
            <li>However, I have an uncanny ability to roll with the punches as far as makeup is concerned.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Sort of a wild Berry/Rose fragrance.</li>
            <li>Balm is long lasting, fragrance is mild and luxurious.  </li>
            <li>I had high expectations and can&#x27;t believe I actually prefer Maybelline Baby Lips to this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little gooey at first, but then it smooths on and makes my lips feel very soft.</li>
            <li>Moisturizing and comes in a cute tin, but has an extremely oily texture and horrendous HEAVY floral smell.</li>
            <li>The name \\&quot;Brambleberry Rose\\&quot; and the kitschy packaging certainly lured me in but in reality it&#x27;s not what I&#x27;d imagine brambleberries to smell like, and certainly not roses.</li>
            <li>/&gt;balm.&lt;br /&gt;Words were exchanged which are not for a family website such as Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;Christmas cheer was clearly over,</li>
            <li>And, as always, these are some of the only products that don&#x27;t completely suck the life out of my lips.</li>
            <li>The pink tint isn&#x27;t very pigmented</li>
            <li>I am obsessed with rose scented things, and that is why I bought this product to begin with.</li>
            <li>This came in handy when I went to New York during November and the wind and cold practically sucked the moisture out of my lips and face.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a lot of product for the money, and it works quickly at bringing very dry, chapped lips back to soft, supple beauty.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for four years now, but that is not a very good judge of how long it lasts because I keep misplacing it and getting excited all over again when I find it.</li>
            <li>I wish it came in a tube, since I really can&#x27;t bear the Mocha Rose scent. :(</li>
            <li>As with all of these balms the tin is sometimes hard if not impossible to open</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last very long and must be applied frequently though.</li>

            <li> Now, to address Brambleberry Rose: I prefer the Strawberry for my lips and that is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 Stars.</li>
            <li> This is a very clean and soft balm.</li>
            <li> to more than likely end up all over the inside of your purse or makeup bag.</li>
            <li> and if I&#x27;d known that beforehand I most likely wouldn&#x27;t have given into the impulse to buy it.</li>
            <li> Okay, must have had some temperature changes during shipping and some of the ingredients have separated, no big deal</li>
            <li> husband was keenly interested as I&lt;br /&gt;unpeeled</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not upset enough to return it, as I love the packaging and the moisture.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was a really oily, watery surface of the lip balm...</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like this.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really describe it very well</li>
            <li> , it not only keeps my lips smooth</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> very fruity- not too floral.</li>
            <li> it is reasonable in price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> even my cat would bent on my lips to smell it very keenly!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> really recommend it&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also makes my lips look healthy and pink</li>
            <li> Sun, wind, very low humidity, and in the winter, a good deal of cold weather &#x3D; you need good lip</li>
            <li> Perhaps, like me,  you are compelled to have an iconic something or other in your life, for validation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of greasy,  and does not last long at all.</li>
            <li> I love trying new lip balms, and was curious to try this one.  </li>
            <li> If you prefer a lot less color on your lips, then you will be pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> I purchased several for gifts &amp; most of my friends discarded them because they couldn&#x27;t get it open.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a lot easier to throw a tin of Rosebud Brambleberry Rose Lip Balm in the back pocket of your jeans than it is to drag a [NOTE::::spoiler alert!]</li>
            <li> I love the little tin.  </li>
            <li> It makes my lips really soft, even when they are very chapped.</li>
            <li> It gives your lips a lovely sheer sheen and softens them all day long.</li>
            <li> i love this product so much but finding this particular flavor / scent is hard</li>
            <li> It does get quite soft when it&#x27;s hot out, like one reviewer noted, but as long as you&#x27;re not just keeping it in your hot car it does get firmer again.</li>
            <li> It smells a little different than the original, but not bad.</li>
            <li> I put the product on, really loved the shine, moisturizing and how long it lasted on my lips, but I just can&#x27;t get past this wretched rotting smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to utilize the rubber band trick to get this open the first time</li>
            <li> I actually had to fight him off in order to be the first one to touch the lip&lt;br</li>
            <li> The flavor and fragrance is really unique and i will never go back to the regular rosebud for lip balm again!</li>
            <li> my order of this new lip balm arrived, I noticed it wasn&#x27;t a bit like my old favourite.</li>
            <li> it becomes VERY \\&quot;liquidy\\&quot; in a relatively short amount of time ~ which gives it oportunity</li>
            <li> about 5-6 months so far, and the jar still has some in it.</li>
            <li> Makes my lips so soft</li>
            <li> It goes on soft and silky, not like a waxy Chapstick.</li>
            <li> Which is nothing like &#x27;A blend of wild berry flavors with overtones of honey and vanilla&#x27; as the product description suggests...</li>
            <li> 1 pot of this lasts you for nearly 1 year even if you are a lip gloss whore.</li>
            <li> However, I have an uncanny ability to roll with the punches as far as makeup is concerned.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Sort of a wild Berry/Rose fragrance.</li>
            <li> Balm is long lasting, fragrance is mild and luxurious.  </li>
            <li> I had high expectations and can&#x27;t believe I actually prefer Maybelline Baby Lips to this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little gooey at first, but then it smooths on and makes my lips feel very soft.</li>
            <li> Moisturizing and comes in a cute tin, but has an extremely oily texture and horrendous HEAVY floral smell.</li>
            <li> The name \\&quot;Brambleberry Rose\\&quot; and the kitschy packaging certainly lured me in but in reality it&#x27;s not what I&#x27;d imagine brambleberries to smell like, and certainly not roses.</li>
            <li> /&gt;balm.&lt;br /&gt;Words were exchanged which are not for a family website such as Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;Christmas cheer was clearly over,</li>
            <li> And, as always, these are some of the only products that don&#x27;t completely suck the life out of my lips.</li>
            <li> The pink tint isn&#x27;t very pigmented</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with rose scented things, and that is why I bought this product to begin with.</li>
            <li> This came in handy when I went to New York during November and the wind and cold practically sucked the moisture out of my lips and face.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s a lot of product for the money, and it works quickly at bringing very dry, chapped lips back to soft, supple beauty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for four years now, but that is not a very good judge of how long it lasts because I keep misplacing it and getting excited all over again when I find it.</li>
            <li> I wish it came in a tube, since I really can&#x27;t bear the Mocha Rose scent. :(</li>
            <li> As with all of these balms the tin is sometimes hard if not impossible to open</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last very long and must be applied frequently though.</li>
            <li> I also am not a great fan of the flavor, and again prefer the original.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried nearly all of the Rosebud balms and this one seems to be less moisturizing than the others.</li>
            <li> and I notice that my lips feel soft and less chapped than they were before</li>
            <li> I like the lip balm, but it has a strange texture to it.</li>
            <li> dye from crushed beetles), red 7 lake, tutti fruitti flavor (benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, cinnaminic aid, citronellol, d-limonene, eugenol, isoeugenol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;And, indeed, it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am keeping this stuff around as long as it lasts.</li>
            <li> (if I am not in the mood for heavy lipstick I apply it and it gives me a natural look )</li>
            <li> Tin is cute, but very difficult to open.</li>
            <li> It provided my lips with much needed moisture and because it is a thick formula, it stayed on.</li>
            <li> I spent my time outside and at the end of the trip I had no cracked dry lips.</li>
            <li> The original Rosebud balm doesn&#x27;t share this type of fake and sickly-sweet scent.</li>
            <li> (my lips are very dry).  </li>
            <li> Not very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a hint of a pink tint to it, but I wouldn&#x27;t count on it for use as my lipstick of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps I&#x27;ve received a defective product, but it&#x27;s not worth the trouble of sending back a $5 tub of lip balm.</li>
            <li> When applied, not much of a tint shows up on my lips at all, just a slight trace of pink.</li>
            <li> I am not ashamed to admit that I decided to purchase it due to its name &amp;#34;Brambleberry Rose&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> like the product but the packaging too hard to get open.</li>
            <li> I saw one user said the tin was hard to open, but that was not my experience.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the real ingredient list isn&#x27;t shown on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It is moisturizing and gentle, unlike the Carmex that I find very harsh and irritating.</li>
            <li> example, if something isn&#x27;t approximately 9 years old, dried out, dented, or pre-used, it has my name all over it.</li>
            <li> I do like the color - provides a slight bit of tint to my lips.  </li>
            <li> A slight twist and a pull</li>
            <li> When I was a little girl in the 50s</li>
            <li> and I use everyday.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what all the fuss is about.</li>
            <li> On the lips it doesn&#x27;t have that sticky slick feeling and unnatural shine.</li>
            <li> No rose, no berry.</li>
            <li> This is a thick formula.</li>
            <li> Rather than being thick and emollient it has a thinner, watery texture.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the lid is so very difficult to take off.</li>
            <li> However, the pot is very difficult to open sometimes</li>
            <li> but it hasn&#x27;t been as tough since.</li>
            <li> It feels icky and smells bad.  </li>
            <li> Smells weird</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with how artificial and unberry</li>
            <li> I wish i have read all the bad reviews about this product before i purchased it :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> That was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> When I put it on my kids and husband hate the smell.</li>
            <li> smells disgusting and was misshaped when it got here</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;balm\\&quot; is awful and the smell is disgusting/cheap.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just a dab makes my lips feel very soft and smells great with just a hint of color. Worth every penny...this can will probably last me for years!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get much better than this.  Balm is long lasting, fragrance is mild and luxurious.  I love the little tin.  I read somewhere many of the stars use this, so I had to try it. I had never heard of it.  But it is an ample tin, and a good product.</li>
            <li> I grew up using the regular Rosebud lip balm, so when I saw this version of it, I decided to give it a try. It smells a little different than the original, but not bad. I love this stuff, but beware toting it around with you in your purse/makeup bag, or in the car, as if it warms up it becomes VERY \\&quot;liquidy\\&quot; in a relatively short amount of time ~ which gives it oportunity to more than likely end up all over the inside of your purse or makeup bag. Other than that, it&#x27;s a lot of product for the money, and it works quickly at bringing very dry, chapped lips back to soft, supple beauty.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful lip balm that doesn&#x27;t feel waxy, like the Chapstick brand tends to, and doesn&#x27;t have salicylic acid in it, like the Carmex brand does. The latter point is also good because you&#x27;re not supposed to use products with salicylic acid when you&#x27;re pregnant and I&#x27;ve been using one jar every day through most of my pregnancy...about 5-6 months so far, and the jar still has some in it. It smells lovely and feels very smooth on the lips. The case is also delightfully retro-looking and is easy to find in your purse. It does get quite soft when it&#x27;s hot out, like one reviewer noted, but as long as you&#x27;re not just keeping it in your hot car it does get firmer again. A great product, and well-worth the price.</li>
            <li> Very Nice lip moisturizer. It smells delicious. It doesn&#x27;t last very long and must be applied frequently though. I love the packaging.</li>
            <li> I like the lip balm, but it has a strange texture to it. It&#x27;s a little gooey at first, but then it smooths on and makes my lips feel very soft.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the lid is so very difficult to take off. Makes my lips so soft and I even like the smell.</li>
            <li> There is an advertisement for some Colorado-based service on the TV that makes a point of distinguishing Colorado as &#x27;the place where lip balm is an object of worship.&#x27; And it is true. Sun, wind, very low humidity, and in the winter, a good deal of cold weather &#x3D; you need good lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many lip balms, but few are as delightful as this. It smells like wine, berries and roses. It is moisturizing and gentle, unlike the Carmex that I find very harsh and irritating. It goes on soft and silky, not like a waxy Chapstick. It imparts a bit of soft pink color and shine to the lips as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish they made this in a squeeze tube for more sanitary application.</li>
            <li> This is a thick formula. I am not ashamed to admit that I decided to purchase it due to its name &amp;#34;Brambleberry Rose&amp;#34;. It smells yummy and has a nice maroony-rosish color (I hope that made sense). It provided my lips with much needed moisture and because it is a thick formula, it stayed on. This came in handy when I went to New York during November and the wind and cold practically sucked the moisture out of my lips and face. I needed something to hold up to that and this came through. I spent my time outside and at the end of the trip I had no cracked dry lips.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lip balm! It makes my lips really soft, even when they are very chapped. I wear it to bed each night and I also use it over a lip stain for a non-sticky shine. Great bargain as it lasts for a long time!</li>
            <li> really candy nice smelling berry-esque balm, non sticky yet moisturizing. great fr the winter time, oh and i LOVE the retro packaging too. super cute</li>
            <li> The name \\&quot;Brambleberry Rose\\&quot; and the kitschy packaging certainly lured me in but in reality it&#x27;s not what I&#x27;d imagine brambleberries to smell like, and certainly not roses. I was disappointed with how artificial and unberry-like this ended up tasting and smelling. Unfortunately, the real ingredient list isn&#x27;t shown on Amazon. This is the ingredient list from the back of the tin I received:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Petrolatum, tutti fruitti aroma OS w/sweetener, N&amp;A #6528483, beeswax, shea butter, vitamin E, carmine (dye from crushed beetles), red 7 lake, tutti fruitti flavor (benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, cinnaminic aid, citronellol, d-limonene, eugenol, isoeugenol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does however, smell like tutti fruitti jelly beans (the white ones, I think) and if I&#x27;d known that beforehand I most likely wouldn&#x27;t have given into the impulse to buy it. The original Rosebud balm doesn&#x27;t share this type of fake and sickly-sweet scent. As for moisturizing, it&#x27;s about the same as Vaseline or the original Rosebud formula would do although the shea butter in here is a nice touch. When applied, not much of a tint shows up on my lips at all, just a slight trace of pink. I had high expectations and can&#x27;t believe I actually prefer Maybelline Baby Lips to this.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to receive this in the mail after reading so many positive reviews and seeing photos of shiny, healthy, pinky lips I *must* have! The first thing I noticed was a really oily, watery surface of the lip balm...Okay, must have had some temperature changes during shipping and some of the ingredients have separated, no big deal, I&#x27;lll work around that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the smell...Which is nothing like &#x27;A blend of wild berry flavors with overtones of honey and vanilla&#x27; as the product description suggests...It&#x27;s a rancid rotting cheese/feet aroma...with a hint of rose. I put the product on, really loved the shine, moisturizing and how long it lasted on my lips, but I just can&#x27;t get past this wretched rotting smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I&#x27;ve received a defective product, but it&#x27;s not worth the trouble of sending back a $5 tub of lip balm. Guess I&#x27;ll eat the cost and try another one of their products. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> My sister gave me one with rose and I use everyday. I got this one for my friend and she loves it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is nice and smells good.  It leaves just a hint of color on your lips which I like.  However, the pot is very difficult to open sometimes and I find myself avoiding using it because of that reason.  I just go for chapstick or another lip gloss to avoid struggling to open the pot.  Maybe mine is just defective...but I would not reorder this.</li>
            <li> Consistency is fine but the smell is incredibly overwhelming. It&#x27;s a very strong rose fragrance smell which is too much for me</li>
            <li> smells disgusting and was misshaped when it got here</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like this.  It feels icky and smells bad.  Waste of money.  Get Wholly Hemp lip balm for only $3...it is terrific!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy again. It&#x27;s not as moisturizing as the original salve. Thought this was the same as the original but with a little hint of color, but the formulation is a little different.</li>
            <li> This smells like berries and roses, yummy! I&#x27;ve tried nearly all of the Rosebud balms and this one seems to be less moisturizing than the others. Rather than being thick and emollient it has a thinner, watery texture. Because of this I prefer to use this during they day and use my thicker Rosebud balms overnight (my lips are very dry).  As with all of these balms the tin is sometimes hard if not impossible to open so if that is a dealbreaker for you consider buying something in a tube instead. I had to utilize the rubber band trick to get this open the first time but it hasn&#x27;t been as tough since.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the flavor or the smell. But it is worth a try if you are a fan of this brand.</li>
            <li> Just got this in the mail today. While the Minted Rose remains my favorite flavor, I am in love with the Brambleberry Rose because it leaves a nice, light pinky-purple sheen! Don&#x27;t even need to layer it with lip color, it leaves lips looks looking healthy. And, as always, these are some of the only products that don&#x27;t completely suck the life out of my lips. I use them at night and during the day - always got a tin in my purse or on my bedside table. So addicting!</li>
            <li> It looks  expired, oil and ointment was separated.</li>
            <li> i love this product so much but finding this particular flavor / scent is hard so i decided to order it from Amazon.com. 1 pot of this lasts you for nearly 1 year even if you are a lip gloss whore.</li>
            <li> If you prefer a lot less color on your lips, then you will be pleased with this product.  I have a lipstick brush that I use with this product and it glides the balm onto my lips.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I got along without this product. It&#x27;s seriously the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever purchased, the consistency is almost like vaseline but better. I can&#x27;t really describe it very well, it&#x27;s velvety smooth! The pink tint isn&#x27;t very pigmented so it&#x27;s very good for every day wear, it not only keeps my lips smooth it also seemed to have healed the chapped areas almost right away! Love this product, I also have it in the tube form. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This lip balm lasts forever, smells great, and does a great job of keeping my lips hydrated. Will order again immediately!</li>
            <li> Smells good but the consistency is too thick and it made my lips feel more chapped. i won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great salve...I have used this brand for over 50 years.</li>
            <li> Of all of their lip balms I think I like this one the best- leaves your lips pink and shiny- no matter how chapped they are it always seems to make them perfectly smooth- like straight out of a magazine gorgeous! You might ask yourself what the heck a Brambleberry is but don&#x27;t worry about it, just get it because it smells great- very fruity- not too floral.</li>
            <li> Not sure what all the fuss is about. This rubs off very easily and is mostly petroleum. Not very moisturizing. Tin is cute, but very difficult to open. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Perhaps, like me,  you are compelled to have an iconic something or other in your life, for validation.&lt;br /&gt;It is a lot easier to throw a tin of Rosebud Brambleberry Rose Lip Balm in the back pocket of your jeans than it is to drag a [NOTE::::spoiler alert!] child&#x27;s sled around, lashed to your psyche.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my order of this new lip balm arrived, I noticed it wasn&#x27;t a bit like my old favourite. However, I have an uncanny ability to roll with the punches as far as makeup is concerned.&lt;br /&gt;But that is just me.&lt;br /&gt;For example, if something isn&#x27;t approximately 9 years old, dried out, dented, or pre-used, it has my name all over it. Sure I will try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this lip balm as a Christmas present. It arrived rapidly and frankly just in time to cure the after-Christmas blues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband was keenly interested as I&lt;br /&gt;unpeeled the side wrapper. I actually had to fight him off in order to be the first one to touch the lip&lt;br /&gt;balm.&lt;br /&gt;Words were exchanged which are not for a family website such as Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;Christmas cheer was clearly over, Johnny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the lip balm after we both stopped yelling around.&lt;br /&gt;First, we smelled it together.&lt;br /&gt;It smells lovely, and exactly as I would imagine a Brambleberry Rose would smell. Sort of a wild Berry/Rose fragrance. The berry was the stronger note.&lt;br /&gt;The scent evokes the play, \\&quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream\\&quot;. It is entrancing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a hint of a pink tint to it, but I wouldn&#x27;t count on it for use as my lipstick of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I applied it, my husband said, \\&quot;Kiss me!\\&quot; and so I did. I kissed him, wearing Rosebud Lip Balm, Brambleberry Rose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then he said, \\&quot;Hey! this is GREAT!\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, indeed, it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am keeping this stuff around as long as it lasts. Maybe I&#x27;ll even get it again--it is reasonable in price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosebud Lip Balm, Brambleberry Rose: simply super. Try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks, jean</li>
            <li> The scent is so delicious, and my lips really feel smooth and soft. Loving using it at night, the scent is relaxing. I  just wish it was made with all natural ingredients, still a favorite of mine</li>
            <li> i have used rosebud balm for years but this is the best. The flavor and fragrance is really unique and i will never go back to the regular rosebud for lip balm again!</li>
            <li> The packaging is adorable! The product is so-so. It&#x27;s kind of greasy,  and does not last long at all. It does help moisturize lips, the shine just does not last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main issue with this product is it does not smell like rose at all. I am obsessed with rose scented things, and that is why I bought this product to begin with. It smells more like candy, just really sweet. No rose, no berry. That was very disappointing. I&#x27;m not upset enough to return it, as I love the packaging and the moisture. However, I will definitely not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Smells weird but I still like it. When I put it on my kids and husband hate the smell. But I like the way it makes my lips feel.</li>
            <li> Keep it by my bed at night. Love it! My lips stay moist! Also, I keeps some in my purse and gave some to my boyfriend. He likes it too!</li>
            <li> I love trying new lip balms, and was curious to try this one.  I do like the color - provides a slight bit of tint to my lips.  But the fragrance is a bit too overpowering for me (more of a perfume smell than I would like).  And it is a bit on the sticky side.</li>
            <li> This light lip tint and excellent moisturizer is probably one of the best on the market and the price is very reasonable. I have them stashed everywhere, home, purse, office, etc...</li>
            <li> Moisturizing and comes in a cute tin, but has an extremely oily texture and horrendous HEAVY floral smell. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> like the product but the packaging too hard to get open. I purchased several for gifts &amp; most of my friends discarded them because they couldn&#x27;t get it open.  Sorry.</li>
            <li> The product is fine as far as softening but the fragrance is way, way too strong. When I first opened the tin, I almost couldn&#x27;t use it because of the overpowering sweet smell. I&#x27;m leaving the tin open and the smell has lessened but I think this would be a much better product if they used just a fraction of the perfume.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent out of all the rosebud salves! I wish it came in a tube, since I really can&#x27;t bear the Mocha Rose scent. :(</li>
            <li> Love the lip balm but didn&#x27;t like dealing with this particular container.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite lip balm to wear.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;balm\\&quot; is awful and the smell is disgusting/cheap. I wish i have read all the bad reviews about this product before i purchased it :(</li>
            <li> This is a great product that moisturizes your lips really well. That said it does not seem to be as moisturizing as the original Rosebud Lip Balm. I also am not a great fan of the flavor, and again prefer the original.</li>
            <li> This is a very clean and soft balm. On the lips it doesn&#x27;t have that sticky slick feeling and unnatural shine. It gives your lips a lovely sheer sheen and softens them all day long.</li>
            <li> I love this product ! We don&#x27;t have it in my country (Saudi Arabia)All the lip balms we have make my lips  more chapped than they are&lt;br /&gt;but not Rosebud Lip Balm&lt;br /&gt;few days and I notice that my lips feel soft and less chapped than they were before&lt;br /&gt;I used to bite my lips a lot and wet them with my tongue a lot but not anymore&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with it ..It smells delicious even my cat would bent on my lips to smell it very keenly!&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend it&lt;br /&gt;It also makes my lips look healthy and pink (if I am not in the mood for heavy lipstick I apply it and it gives me a natural look )&lt;br /&gt;I ordered another one of a different color ..I guess I will get all the colors !!&lt;br /&gt;Mai&lt;br /&gt;Saudi Arabia</li>
            <li> Looking for a replacement for my favorite salve which seems to have gone off the market. Rosebud is fine, nice fragrance, like the bigger tin.</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law gave me this as a gift at my bachelorette party and I LOVE it. The fragrance is very nice and light and the gloss has a nice balance between being slimy and sticky and too hard. It glides on smoothly and does a great job moisturizing my lips! I will definitely replace this when it&#x27;s gone. I saw one user said the tin was hard to open, but that was not my experience. A slight twist and a pull and it comes off like butter. I&#x27;ve had mine for four years now, but that is not a very good judge of how long it lasts because I keep misplacing it and getting excited all over again when I find it. lol The retro-style tin is also very cute!</li>
            <li> This is the third product I have purchased from the company that has been making Rosebud Salve for forEVER! When I was a little girl in the 50s my Grandmother used the Rosebud Salve on my scrapes and I loved the smell. Now I buy it for myself and appreciate the healing it provides along with the delightful fragrance. My second experience was with the Strawberry Lip Balm and I like it a lot. Now, to address Brambleberry Rose: I prefer the Strawberry for my lips and that is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 Stars.</li>
