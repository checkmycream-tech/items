            <li> This product makes you feel like a new man.  Ok, I&#x27;m a first timer on this product and took a chance, and man I glad I did.  I buy alot of products on Amazon and I\\&quot;m a number# 1 fan.  When I got this I really really works.  I use all over my body.  I like it so much that I need to buy more.  I used it inside my tennis shoe and it keep your feet from sweat and fungus.  What will a man do without this stuff.  I brought this to the gym and everybody want to use this and told I bought this on Amazon.  I had to tell them to go and get their own.  AWESOME CAN I SAY MORE?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Men, if you want to smell like a NEW man this is for you. You will for the first time.  I need to buy more.</li>
            <li> Jewel Dust keeps my skin dry, smooth and fresh smelling throughout my daily grind.  I always have at least two bottles on hand to make sure I won&#x27;t have to live without it.      Thanks Jewel Dust! Keep up the great work!</li>
            <li> If you want to keep your friends down low so fresh and so clean-clean, this a good powder!</li>
            <li> OK, but, nothing spectacular.  Smells nice, keeps the boys dry, but, I can buy a boxcar full of powder in CVS for the price of this and it would work just as well.</li>
            <li> To me, this powder is no different than baby powder with a different scent. Also I think its overpriced for what it is.</li>
            <li> fine powder - does a nice job - decent fragrance - works with my after shave  - the ladies seem to like it</li>
            <li> Will order again! Just be careful how hard you squeeze the container.. Big mess! Not very much comes out when you just shake it.</li>
            <li> I live in the desert and when the summer hits, you&#x27;re going to need some help with moisture. Jewel Dust takes care of that and more. It&#x27;s been my daily go to for 5 years.</li>
            <li> use this and avoid swamp a$$</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a male friend.  He loves the product and wants more.  I love the name and it does have a good fragrance to it.</li>
            <li> works very well. it has a light scent to it. overall a nice product and i would recomend to someone looking for a good product</li>
            <li> I love the way I can pull up my pants and have my boys feel fresh and clean. Nothing is worse than having my boys stick to my leg in the heat of the day.</li>
            <li> Nice scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t like the smell. In addition, the powder was a bit difficult to shake out.  Shower to shower works better for me @ 1/3 the cost.</li>
            <li> Nice product with good scent and feel. Keeps you dry. I will be purchasing more in the future. Good value.</li>
            <li> It seems to help and smells good.</li>
            <li> I sweat, a lot. Hyperhidrosis, meaning everywhere.  Thought this might do better because all the baby powders or corn starch powders I have tried do not work with me.  Unfortunately this wasn&#x27;t the best for my problem.  The best I have found so far is Balla, another clever product for men in \\&quot;that\\&quot; region, but it is very pricey for as often as I have to use it.</li>
            <li> The best powder I have every used. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Although it is a bit expensive the shipping time was great. The dust itself works as advertised and the aroma is good. Living and working in the heat of Texas staying dry is really an issue. the right under garment and some jewel dust and the jewels stay dry.</li>
            <li> A wonderful scent. However it is a Christmas gift so the recepient hasn&#x27;t used it yet. I love what I read about the product and I&#x27;m quite sure it will meet all expections.</li>
            <li> This is the best power I have used, keeps you dry all day. You only need to use a little because it goes a long way. I could not find a better talc anywhere .</li>
            <li> Great product.  Will be re-ordering.</li>
            <li> poor quality container.  Poor quality powder.</li>
            <li> I have been using body powder for years. Jewel dust comes in a very cheap looking and feeling container, it is difficult to get a decent amount of product without squeezing the bottle. The scent it very strong and personally, I don&#x27;t favor it. Scent is a personal opinion though. The powder itself is fine and smooth, no drawbacks from that aspect. The price is a little over the top for what it is. I will be switching back to balla powder tingle formula when it&#x27;s time to purchase again</li>
