            <li>So glad to have them!</li>
            <li>Great pumps that fit the tresemme bottle</li>
            <li>Good price and was able to cut length and use on shorter bottle, too.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>These are precisely what I was searching for!</li>
            <li>love these pumps for my matrix biolage products</li>
            <li>Even though the description and packaging state these pumps will fit most liter shampoo/conditioner bottles...</li>
            <li>so I snipped off the end of the tube to make it fit</li>
            <li>I bought these for my Enjoy liter bottles and then put them in my AG bottles.  </li>
            <li>They fit all my big bottles from various brands and work great!</li>
            <li>Other than that they are a great pump.  </li>
            <li>I bought a huge bottle of tresemme shampoo and dropped it on my toe the first time I tried to pour some in my hand in the shower...</li>
            <li>fits my kereatese 1litre bottles once I cut a bit off the tube, but this was no drama and it ensures that the tube goes right to the bottom</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Simply a solidly made, quality product that performs just as described, won&#x27;t break, delivers generous quantity easily.</li>
            <li>Really like these pumps.  </li>
            <li>So much nicer than lifting the liter bottles every time I wash my hair.</li>
            <li>Fits very well.  </li>
            <li>They are about 2 inches too short considering most 1 liter bottles I&#x27;ve seen are the same size.  </li>
            <li>But, seem like they are decent quality.</li>
            <li>Maybe a real fat short 1 liter bottle.  </li>
            <li>No more need to pick up the giant bottle - and no more drops - and all happy toes.</li>

            <li> Was hard to get started at first but has worked every time.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, they were a bit long for the height of this giant bottle</li>
            <li> The tube is way too short and is even a little too short for a 25 oz.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty pump and should last a long time...</li>
            <li> Just not fit for a standard 1 Liter.</li>
            <li> They were a little bit hard to &amp;#34;undo&amp;#34; in order to pump them.</li>
            <li> The pumps dispense approximately one quarter sized amount of product with each pump.</li>

            <li> fits my kereatese 1litre bottles once I cut a bit off the tube, but this was no drama and it ensures that the tube goes right to the bottom</li>
            <li> I bought a huge bottle of tresemme shampoo and dropped it on my toe the first time I tried to pour some in my hand in the shower... Hoping to avoid another purple toe - and even moreso to avoid dropping the giant bottle again on the already purple toe - I ordered these. Like other reviewers, they were a bit long for the height of this giant bottle so I snipped off the end of the tube to make it fit just right. The pump works perfectly. No more need to pick up the giant bottle - and no more drops - and all happy toes.</li>
            <li> They fit all my big bottles from various brands and work great!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. Work perfectly.</li>
            <li> works well with the larger shampoo/conditioner bottles</li>
            <li> Really like these pumps.  So much nicer than lifting the liter bottles every time I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty pump and should last a long time...</li>
            <li> I have no idea how they think this fits a 1 Liter bottle.  Maybe a real fat short 1 liter bottle.  They are about 2 inches too short considering most 1 liter bottles I&#x27;ve seen are the same size.  I wish they made them longer, then you could just cut them.  Other than that they are a great pump.  Just not fit for a standard 1 Liter.</li>
            <li> Was hard to get started at first but has worked every time.  Arrived in a timely matter.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Simply a solidly made, quality product that performs just as described, won&#x27;t break, delivers generous quantity easily. It ain&#x27;t rocket science -- why can&#x27;t the others do the same?</li>
            <li> Perfect for Matrix liters.</li>
            <li> They were a little bit hard to &amp;#34;undo&amp;#34; in order to pump them. But, seem like they are decent quality.</li>
            <li> Love these. They fit perfect on my 32 oz shampoo and conditioner bottles.</li>
            <li> works great with my Nioxin liter bottles :)</li>
            <li> These are precisely what I was searching for! I use them in both my Nioxin 1 L (33.8 FL OZ) cleanser and conditioner bottles. They are a perfect fit for length and neck size. The pumps dispense approximately one quarter sized amount of product with each pump. So glad to have them!</li>
            <li> Even though the description and packaging state these pumps will fit most liter shampoo/conditioner bottles...they won&#x27;t.  The tube is way too short and is even a little too short for a 25 oz. bottle.  Returned.</li>
            <li> love these pumps for my matrix biolage products</li>
            <li> This works perfect with my liter Nioxin bottles</li>
            <li> Fits into my Biolage bottles too! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Fits very well.  Well made.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my Enjoy liter bottles and then put them in my AG bottles.  They fit perfect and work well.</li>
            <li> Great pumps that fit the tresemme bottle I needed it for. Good price and was able to cut length and use on shorter bottle, too.</li>
