            <li>I&#x27;ve used them once on my eyebrows, and it was way better than the pair I own now.</li>

            <li>In fact, I like the Bombay tweezers much more than the Tweezerman.  </li>
            <li>Never was able to pluck my eyebrows with these tweezers.</li>
            <li>Of course, you have to love that they are pink first, then throw in that they are great quality and work perfectly and you pretty much have an amazing pair of Tweezers! :)</li>
            <li>no problem gripping fine hairs</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m surprised, as I&#x27;ve been using Tweezit products for years, and I am still happy with each purchase I ever made!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These tweezers are so superbly effective, they&#x27;re easily worth three times the price!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>As good as a professional costing more (I&#x27;m an Esthetician).</li>
            <li>For the price, these are fine.</li>
            <li>They are super cute in pink!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really do think these are cute tweezers!</li>
            <li>Our beat up, years-old Tweezerman tweezers are still much more effective than these are brand new.  </li>
            <li>They grip the hair securely, they are comfortable to hold &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have two pair of tweezers from this company now, and both are precisely crafted.</li>
            <li>Hlgh quality, fast delivery,excellent price, nice people.</li>
            <li>Great quality,  built to last, I can handle to color any day because the built is Excell</li>
            <li>They have a great color, finish, and the angel of the actual tweezing part!</li>
            <li>I even love the bright pink color which makes them so easy to find in my makeup bag.  </li>
            <li>Love this so much, I bought my sister one.</li>
            <li>I was ready to toss them because they were no longer gripping hairs.</li>
            <li>I was glad to be able to do a review on the Stainless Steel High Performance Eye Brows Slant from Majestic Bombay.</li>
            <li>Sharp, sturdy, and great grip strength.</li>
            <li>I have wasted a great deal of money on tweezers that are either cheaply made or just not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>When I saw the Majestic Bombay stainless steel high performance tweezers I thought, sure it&#x27;s super cute, but does it really work?</li>
            <li>- overall I love them!</li>
            <li>I therefore; found this and read reviews and thought it worth the shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That is saying a lot because I lose tweezers frequently and have purchased many in my 23 years.</li>
            <li>Good design...easier to grip than most &amp; really snags small hairs</li>
            <li>Very tight tolerance, great for splinters.</li>
            <li>The bright pink color is pretty.</li>
            <li>Does a pretty nice job and moderately  priced.</li>
            <li>They are very precise and it is easy to grasp small, fine hairs.</li>
            <li>SUPER FAST SHIPPING.</li>
            <li>The tips align perfectly so the number of failed attempts at one hair is minimized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are MUCH more affordable than some of the similar tweezers advertised.</li>
            <li>I really like the idea of a lifetime guarantee!</li>
            <li>This came up as an add-on item, and I have to say I&#x27;m pretty pleased with it, and I would definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a higher quality tweezer</li>
            <li>over the years i&#x27;ve tried so many different ones.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s difficult to find tweezers I actually am willing to use, but these ones are great!</li>
            <li>part you hold is soft and comfortable</li>
            <li>so you get a nice grip without getting that dent in your other fingers or any soreness.</li>
            <li>The price was a bargain too, these are easily comparable to brand name tweezers such as Tweezerman.</li>
            <li>I also love how the bright pink color makes them so easy to find and difficult to misplace.</li>
            <li>There tweezers work really well.</li>
            <li>works very well.  </li>
            <li>Should have spent more because these are comparable to what you can get at a dollar type store.</li>
            <li>so I was really</li>
            <li>They are constructed to precision,  &amp; I&#x27;m able to remove those stubborn partially ingrown hairs painlessly &amp; with ease.  </li>
            <li>I really like these tweezer.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the few bucks more</li>
            <li>these work extremely well and are very precise .</li>
            <li>suggest Tweezerman and for a tweezer that&#x27;s decent and doesn&#x27;t cost much but still does the job,..</li>
            <li>They are extremely high quality stainless</li>
            <li>Needed the hot pink to see them quickly.</li>
            <li>They are high quality, extremely durable, and super adorable in pink.</li>
            <li>Here are a few things I love about these tweezers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only are they fun looking; it makes them easier to spot in my drawer.</li>
            <li>stainless steel high performance expert tweezers really are a step above the rest.</li>
            <li>Based on the reviews here, I ordered not one but two pairs of these tweezers, only to discover that both are totally ineffective at grasping fine hairs.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re sharp and precise.</li>
            <li>I can have them replaced for a new pair.</li>
            <li>then I definitely recommend buying Majestic Bombay&#x27;s Stainless Steel High Performance Eye Brows Slant!</li>
            <li>it actually works pretty well though.  </li>
            <li>Guess it accomplishes much the same thing, the hair is not visible.</li>
            <li>I needed a reliable tweezer to replace my old Tweezerman.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping for a hot pink tweezer</li>
            <li>That hot pink jumps out at you in a second!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually would buy a Tweezerman brand but they&#x27;re priced high and I just can&#x27;t handle the cost, right now.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product &amp; I will definitely be purchasing a back-up pair in the near future.</li>
            <li>Edges are not well defined so they are not effective for tweezing fine hairs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back to using my 18 year old Tweezerman&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>These tweezers are sharp and study and I really need to use them.</li>
            <li>The ends are nice and thin to make them grip tightly.  </li>
            <li>The edges are sharp (in fact, watch yourself while handling them!), and filed to precision, and set at a decent angle.</li>

            <li> That hot pink jumps out at you in a second!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually would buy a Tweezerman brand but they&#x27;re priced high and I just can&#x27;t handle the cost, right now.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product &amp; I will definitely be purchasing a back-up pair in the near future.</li>
            <li> Edges are not well defined so they are not effective for tweezing fine hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to using my 18 year old Tweezerman&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are sharp and study and I really need to use them.</li>
            <li> The ends are nice and thin to make them grip tightly.  </li>
            <li> The edges are sharp (in fact, watch yourself while handling them!), and filed to precision, and set at a decent angle.</li>
            <li> All my previous ones were stainless or black but why not pink?</li>
            <li> Nice quality, pinches tight enough to grasp well without cutting off splinter, hair or whatever.</li>
            <li> someone had suggested, if you have issues plucking your eyebrows with this, tighten up the skin slightly by pulling down just ever so little near the area in which you are working, and this will help get at the tiny hairs.</li>
            <li> The end of these tweezers are not sharp enough nor thin enough along the edges to grab hair.</li>
            <li> They are so sharp that I could definitely nick myself if I reached into my purse and they were not in a case or if I attempted to use them while half asleep.</li>
            <li> They work really well and didn&#x27;t cost much tired of waiting in a line to get my brows done</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t buy any other brand.</li>
            <li> I notice them when all my other tweezers needed to wait for the hair</li>
            <li> Above is just a small portion of my thoughts.</li>
            <li> I am careful not to squeeze too hard because these are sharp enough to cut the hair before it  can be pulled out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little sharp on the edges, but it works at the times my other tweezers don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had tweezers that pinch my skin and others that can&#x27;t seem to grip the hair hard enough to pull it out.</li>
            <li> I will give this an average rating.</li>
            <li> About half the time, it cuts the hair at the skin line rather than nip it out.</li>
            <li> Do not catch as well as the previous ones.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because the Tweezermans, my preferred brand, either was difficult to find or was priced too high.</li>
            <li> I really like that the cover at the end is thick enough plastic to keep on them, and keep them from getting dirty.</li>
            <li> I have no tolerance for pinching or cutting and the first time they do, I throw them away.</li>
            <li> And I know over time if they become loose or dull</li>
            <li> They do dull overtime</li>
            <li> on a scale of 1-10, ten being impossible to find, i&#x27;d rate this one an 8 1/2.</li>
            <li> I have an expensive tweezerman pair and these are comparable for half the price.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I have gone through quite a few tweezers!</li>
            <li> I also stand behind there product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this seems to be one of those things that&#x27;s difficult to make well, but it is.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands and was very disappointed by them.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed with these.</li>
            <li> I was expecting something like Tweezerman, but I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> As an licensed Esthetician, I must say these tweezers are horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Here are a few things I love about these tweezers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. They are extremely high quality stainless steel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. They are slanted which gives them dual purpose (regular tweezing and precision tweezing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The tips align perfectly so the number of failed attempts at one hair is minimized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. They are super cute in pink!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. They are MUCH more affordable than some of the similar tweezers advertised. This is obviously the greatest attraction for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY concern I had with these tweezers was the sharpness. They are so sharp that I could definitely nick myself if I reached into my purse and they were not in a case or if I attempted to use them while half asleep. I have never been a morning person. The sharpness has also caused the tweezers to trim some hair instead of pulling it out. Although that is probably user error. Oops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.bringinmamahome.com</li>
            <li> Does a pretty nice job and moderately  priced. Happy over all</li>
            <li> the Tweezer is very versatile and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I will give this an average rating. I have had better. Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I usually would buy a Tweezerman brand but they&#x27;re priced high and I just can&#x27;t handle the cost, right now.  I therefore; found this and read reviews and thought it worth the shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out this is a very good tweezers and I feel it is made as well, and works just as great as a Tweezerman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Best pair of tweezers that I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Very good tweezers love them</li>
            <li> There tweezers work really well. They&#x27;re sharp and precise.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman tweezers are always great. I don&#x27;t buy any other brand. I have tried other brands and was very disappointed by them.</li>
            <li> works very well.  Bought for my daughter.  As good as a professional costing more (I&#x27;m an Esthetician).</li>
            <li> It was on time and it works great!</li>
            <li> These tweezers are my favorite tweezers I&#x27;ve ever had. That is saying a lot because I lose tweezers frequently and have purchased many in my 23 years. I never pinch my skin with these and the hairs come out easily. The bright pink color is pretty.</li>
            <li> These are good tweezers. I have encountered no problems with them. I like the color. So I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> Perfect tweezers for my wife&#x27;s needs.</li>
            <li> great product  easy to use and handle&lt;br /&gt;fast delivery</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a hot pink tweezer but over all I&#x27;m pleased with it, I never had a tweezer that works get!</li>
            <li> Love this so much, I bought my sister one.</li>
            <li> For the price, these are fine. I am careful not to squeeze too hard because these are sharp enough to cut the hair before it  can be pulled out.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly and works a advertised. It&#x27;s a little sharp on the edges, but it works at the times my other tweezers don&#x27;t. Glad to have it.</li>
            <li> I really like the idea of a lifetime guarantee! These tweezers are sharp and study and I really need to use them. They help get those pesky stubble hairs the second I notice them when all my other tweezers needed to wait for the hair the grow longer. And I know over time if they become loose or dull I can have them replaced for a new pair. Definitely worth the few bucks more the purchase these instead of those Revlon  or whatever metal ones for $3!</li>
            <li> The end of these tweezers are not sharp enough nor thin enough along the edges to grab hair. My fingers get irritated after trying to remove the same hair.</li>
            <li> Good design...easier to grip than most &amp; really snags small hairs well.  Great tool for this price, will buy again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because the Tweezermans, my preferred brand, either was difficult to find or was priced too high. This came up as an add-on item, and I have to say I&#x27;m pretty pleased with it, and I would definitely purchase it again. The edges are sharp (in fact, watch yourself while handling them!), and filed to precision, and set at a decent angle. I&#x27;ve had no issues getting at the tiniest of eyebrow hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone had suggested, if you have issues plucking your eyebrows with this, tighten up the skin slightly by pulling down just ever so little near the area in which you are working, and this will help get at the tiny hairs.</li>
            <li> About half the time, it cuts the hair at the skin line rather than nip it out. Guess it accomplishes much the same thing, the hair is not visible.</li>
            <li> Best Investment Ever!</li>
            <li> These tweezers are so superbly effective, they&#x27;re easily worth three times the price!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m surprised, as I&#x27;ve been using Tweezit products for years, and I am still happy with each purchase I ever made!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t possibly overstate this: Tweezit Rocks!</li>
            <li> I was glad to be able to do a review on the Stainless Steel High Performance Eye Brows Slant from Majestic Bombay. They are high quality, extremely durable, and super adorable in pink. If you are looking for a higher quality tweezer then I definitely recommend buying Majestic Bombay&#x27;s Stainless Steel High Performance Eye Brows Slant! They get a two thumbs up!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received a sample product to review in exchange for my honest opinion. To read the rest of my review, please visit the blog (Krazy Coupon Club)! Above is just a small portion of my thoughts.</li>
            <li> They pinched my skin,  more than my eyebrow hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how these are so well reviewed.  Based on the reviews here, I ordered not one but two pairs of these tweezers, only to discover that both are totally ineffective at grasping fine hairs.  Our beat up, years-old Tweezerman tweezers are still much more effective than these are brand new.  Avoid.</li>
            <li> the best I have ever had! does its job!</li>
            <li> Something has happened to the quality of these products.  Do not catch as well as the previous ones.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with the customer service that this company provides. I also stand behind there product. I have wasted a great deal of money on tweezers that are either cheaply made or just not what I was expecting. I have two pair of tweezers from this company now, and both are precisely crafted. I believe they are  ideal for eyebrows, splinter, and in grown hairs. The price is fair and I plan to recommend to others that are looking for a great pair of tweezers!</li>
            <li> Nice quality, pinches tight enough to grasp well without cutting off splinter, hair or whatever. Like the bright color, makes it easy to find in cosmetic kit.</li>
            <li> appears i may have received another brand in place of this one.  mine says Tweezit.  it actually works pretty well though.  over the years i&#x27;ve tried so many different ones.  on a scale of 1-10, ten being impossible to find, i&#x27;d rate this one an 8 1/2.</li>
            <li> As an licensed Esthetician, I must say these tweezers are horrible. They worked great for the 1st 2 weeks, after 2 weeks I was ready to toss them because they were no longer gripping hairs. I do not recommend this brand of tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest Tweezerman and for a tweezer that&#x27;s decent and doesn&#x27;t cost much but still does the job,.. look into Revlon tweezers</li>
            <li> Hlgh quality, fast delivery,excellent price, nice people.</li>
            <li> Great quality,  built to last, I can handle to color any day because the built is Excell</li>
            <li> They work really well and didn&#x27;t cost much tired of waiting in a line to get my brows done</li>
            <li> They do dull overtime but they sharpen well - overall I love them!</li>
            <li> I love these tweezers! They have a great color, finish, and the angel of the actual tweezing part! I&#x27;ve used them once on my eyebrows, and it was way better than the pair I own now. I really like that the cover at the end is thick enough plastic to keep on them, and keep them from getting dirty. It&#x27;s difficult to find tweezers I actually am willing to use, but these ones are great! Even though I got them for free to review, I would surly buy them again if I had to!</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT. SUPER FAST SHIPPING. I RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> Okay pair of tweezers. Should have spent more because these are comparable to what you can get at a dollar type store.</li>
            <li> Majestic Bombay sent me these Tweezers to review for my blog, GlamRiver and they are awesome!  Of course, you have to love that they are pink first, then throw in that they are great quality and work perfectly and you pretty much have an amazing pair of Tweezers! :)</li>
            <li> I was expecting something like Tweezerman, but I was very disappointed.  Edges are not well defined so they are not effective for tweezing fine hairs.</li>
            <li> Sharp, sturdy, and great grip strength. Will buy more to stash away for when I lose others and also as gifts. Great buy - actually like them better than tweeter man</li>
            <li> These tweezers work amazing for plucking eyebrows. They grip the hair securely, they are comfortable to hold &amp; easy to use. The price was a bargain too, these are easily comparable to brand name tweezers such as Tweezerman. I highly recommend this product &amp; I will definitely be purchasing a back-up pair in the near future.</li>
            <li> I am kind of picky about my tweezers. I have no tolerance for pinching or cutting and the first time they do, I throw them away. Needless to say, I have gone through quite a few tweezers! I don&#x27;t know why this seems to be one of those things that&#x27;s difficult to make well, but it is. When I saw the Majestic Bombay stainless steel high performance tweezers I thought, sure it&#x27;s super cute, but does it really work? I decided to try and see!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do think these are cute tweezers! All my previous ones were stainless or black but why not pink? Not only are they fun looking; it makes them easier to spot in my drawer. I don&#x27;t know about you but I am forever losing my tweezers along with my nail clippers and baby&#x27;s pacifiers! They just seem to be one of those things I can never find but not these! That hot pink jumps out at you in a second!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The part you hold is soft and comfortable so you get a nice grip without getting that dent in your other fingers or any soreness. But most importantly, they are effective! I easily removed my stray eyebrows without hurting myself. I&#x27;ve had tweezers that pinch my skin and others that can&#x27;t seem to grip the hair hard enough to pull it out. These worked great at both so I was really happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stainless steel high performance expert tweezers really are a step above the rest. You won&#x27;t be disappointed with these.</li>
            <li> These are great tweezers.  The ends are nice and thin to make them grip tightly.  I also love how the bright pink color makes them so easy to find and difficult to misplace.</li>
            <li> These are very nice. I have an expensive tweezerman pair and these are comparable for half the price.</li>
            <li> I needed a reliable tweezer to replace my old Tweezerman.  I decided to take a chance on the Majestic Bombay Eye Brows Slant Expert Tweezer--and am I glad I did!  They are constructed to precision,  &amp; I&#x27;m able to remove those stubborn partially ingrown hairs painlessly &amp; with ease.  I even love the bright pink color which makes them so easy to find in my makeup bag.  In fact, I like the Bombay tweezers much more than the Tweezerman.  I plan on making future purchases from this site--the price is right, the product was exactly as described (except even better!) &amp; delivered promptly in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> Just as good as my tweezermans- can&#x27;t even tell the difference. Save your money and get this one instead! Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> very happy with purchase!</li>
            <li> no problem gripping fine hairs</li>
            <li> Very precise, you can even get to the smallest hairs.</li>
            <li> these work extremely well and are very precise .</li>
            <li> Great tweezers. Very tight tolerance, great for splinters.</li>
            <li> Very nice tweezers. Needed the hot pink to see them quickly. Very precise.</li>
            <li> I really like these tweezer.  They are very precise and it is easy to grasp small, fine hairs.</li>
            <li> Never was able to pluck my eyebrows with these tweezers. Just wouldn&#x27;t grip the hairs. I&#x27;m back to using my 18 year old Tweezerman&#x27;s.</li>
