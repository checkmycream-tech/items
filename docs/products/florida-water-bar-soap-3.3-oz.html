            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved the scent of Florida Water and I&#x27;ve been trying to find the Florida Water soap ever since I found out that they made it</li>
            <li>The product is good and meets expectations.</li>

            <li>When I&#x27;m out of this soap I&#x27;ll happily order MORE.  </li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s also excellent on the days when something important is going to happen, like a job interview or an important presentation.)  </li>
            <li>When I use it, I always seem to spend a minute or two just smelling the bar and loving the scent.  </li>
            <li>He also put some in his clothing drawer like a sachet and it made his clothes smell nice as well.</li>
            <li>Good smelling and Refreshing to use,you will not be disapointed with this.</li>
            <li>I like the cologne, and this is a nice complement.</li>
            <li>It is very strong smelling, with kind of a manly floral cologne scent to it.</li>
            <li>This soap lathers very well and has a wonderful clean scent.</li>
            <li>It is very very light.  </li>
            <li>Having said that, I will say that this soap has an amazing light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of this soap.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>If you do you would love it.</li>
            <li>The soap is ok but was expecting a bit more scent.  </li>
            <li>Will be buying more</li>
            <li>I really like this florida soap, it cleans great,</li>
            <li>AND WILL ORDER MORE THIS WEEK</li>
            <li>and I love the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>He washes his face with this soap and feels more relaxed as well.  </li>
            <li>I am glad that the professed \\&quot;witch\\&quot; wrote a recommendation on this product as it surely helped me.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent of the cologne</li>
            <li>, I guess I should have read the description more closely.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>Lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li>The smell is okay</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this product.</li>
            <li>OK then - it lathers up great, washes off very cleanly with no residue, and my skin always feels soft and amazing after using it.    </li>
            <li>I feel very clean and refreshed after using it.</li>
            <li>It makes his whole body smell good, just like the cologne did for his face.  </li>
            <li>really good soap not to over powering in scent, good cleansing in more ways than one, just a little pricey</li>
            <li>This is fine soap, which surpassed my expectations.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, not an overpowering smell, I leave it in my soap dish in the bath, and upon entering you get that nice clean fragrance, love it.</li>
            <li>Quite honestly I didn&#x27;t expect to like it this much</li>
            <li>same as the witches water great</li>
            <li>The scent is lovely and last for a good while.</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced as well as herbal shops charge more for this.  </li>
            <li>It has a great scent that I don&#x27;t find overpowering and doesn&#x27;t linger all day long like it&#x27;s a cologne/soap.</li>
            <li>but I like the way it smells, but I use it for special occasions after I pray.</li>
            <li>I read a review about how Florida Water Soap is good for cleansing out your body spiritually.  </li>
            <li>It has a light scent that&#x27;s just right for men and women.</li>
            <li>Pretty strong stuff, not everyone will like it.</li>
            <li>This soap has a mild scent to it.</li>
            <li>Pretty mild, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and leaves a clean citrusy scent.</li>
            <li>Only 4 stars because it is pricey, but gotta love Prime shipping!</li>
            <li>scent is a little more mild than the cologne is, but that&#x27;s probably a good thing, as you probably don&#x27;t want to smell like you used a whole bottle of cologne.</li>
            <li>Otherwise the scent is fabulous and very calming.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s well worth it, though,</li>
            <li>It has the fresh aroma of Florida Water which stays with me throughout the day.</li>
            <li>We each now own our individual bar of Florida water soap.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is very nice and mild the bar is small</li>
            <li>Really, nothing special about this soap.</li>
            <li>and I like it very much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this soap for a while, and afterwards always feel like I&#x27;ve shed more spiritual \\&quot;dirt\\&quot;</li>
            <li>When I need a pick me up or feel that I need spiritually cleansed I take a bath with my soap and feel much better.  </li>
            <li>Washes clean, mild scent but leaves a white residue on my skin</li>
            <li>It smells divine, it lasts a long time, and makes me feel squeaky clean!  </li>
            <li>Well, I really needed this done to myself and to my son.  </li>
            <li>It smells very faint--inoffensive, like motel courtesy soap.  </li>
            <li>I really like this soap.</li>
            <li>I have been using Florida Water soap for several years now thanks to my husband&#x27;s recommendation, and it&#x27;s by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Very drying to skin.</li>
            <li>I could just have these sitting around my house, and not worry about any other scents :)</li>
            <li>I really enjoy it, but I feel it&#x27;s too strong and masculine for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended this.  </li>
            <li>A couple of things right up front - I am both an experienced witch, as well as being extremely sensitive to artificial fragrances.      </li>
            <li>I tend to stick with other soaps for most washing, and use this only once in a while.  </li>
            <li>Wow this soap has quite a wallop to it!</li>
            <li>Wash away that psychic and physical dirt and be CLEAN in several ways!!</li>
            <li>This soap smells fine but the scent does not stick around and it left skin dry.</li>
            <li>It is also a good soap for my face as it does not dry out my delicate facial skin.  </li>
            <li>Even essential oils can be a bit much sometimes.  </li>
            <li>I use it as a hand soap; it cleans well with no residue on my hands, yet still makes them feel soft, pliable and fragrant.  </li>
            <li>It calms down the spirit to put it mildly.  </li>
            <li>I may use it eventually not sure right now.</li>
            <li>And, as somebody who is so very sensitive to chemical fragrances, I must be careful about what I use in baths or showers.  </li>

            <li> The seller was prompt in shipping, and the soap was carefully packaged.</li>
            <li> Not very scented at all</li>

            <li> It hasn&#x27;t dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> Just an ordinary soap.</li>
            <li> For bathing or shaving, it is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> least it still works as soap, though.  </li>
            <li> Way too subtle.</li>
            <li> No problems on my skin, just a mild, boring soap..</li>
            <li> This does not make it a bad soap per se, just not for me again.</li>
            <li> I use it when I am going out of the house to keep the evil and bad things away from me and prevent bad energies from coming into the house too.</li>

            <li> A couple of things right up front - I am both an experienced witch, as well as being extremely sensitive to artificial fragrances.      So, as a witch, I need some sort of spiritual cleanser I can use in the bath and shower.  I don&#x27;t always have time to take a long drawn-out ritual bath.  So - Florida Water in a soap is a perfect alternative.  (It&#x27;s also excellent on the days when something important is going to happen, like a job interview or an important presentation.)  I&#x27;ve used this soap for a while, and afterwards always feel like I&#x27;ve shed more spiritual \\&quot;dirt\\&quot; than I thought I was carrying.    And, as somebody who is so very sensitive to chemical fragrances, I must be careful about what I use in baths or showers.  I can&#x27;t use anything too heavily perfumed.  Even essential oils can be a bit much sometimes.  Having said that, I will say that this soap has an amazing light fragrance.  When I use it, I always seem to spend a minute or two just smelling the bar and loving the scent.  I have no reactions to this soap, and that by itself is enough to make me keep using it.    How about somebody who doesn&#x27;t react to chemicals, or doesn&#x27;t care about the spiritual cleansing properties?  OK then - it lathers up great, washes off very cleanly with no residue, and my skin always feels soft and amazing after using it.    It *is* a bit pricey, and the bars don&#x27;t last *that* long.  I tend to stick with other soaps for most washing, and use this only once in a while.  I think it&#x27;s well worth it, though, and I will always keep some on hand.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this soap. I will buy this again!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. This soap lathers very well and has a wonderful clean scent. For bathing or shaving, it is hard to beat. It also lasts a surprisingly long time.</li>
            <li> really good soap not to over powering in scent, good cleansing in more ways than one, just a little pricey thats the only draw back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the scent of Florida Water and I&#x27;ve been trying to find the Florida Water soap ever since I found out that they made it (it&#x27;s a great idea, the smell of Florida Water in a soap).

            <li> My boyfriend uses Florida Water cologne and when I saw this soap I had to buy it for him.  It makes his whole body smell good, just like the cologne did for his face.  He also put some in his clothing drawer like a sachet and it made his clothes smell nice as well.</li>
            <li> Love this product.The scent is lovely and last for a good while. Everyone who like to try different things should try this product. If you do you would love it.</li>
            <li> Good smelling and Refreshing to use,you will not be disapointed with this.</li>
            <li> The soap is ok but was expecting a bit more scent.  It is very very light.  This does not make it a bad soap per se, just not for me again.</li>
            <li> This is fine soap, which surpassed my expectations. It has the fresh aroma of Florida Water which stays with me throughout the day.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very nice and mild the bar is small but it last and I like it very much. Will be buying more</li>
            <li> Pretty strong stuff, not everyone will like it.</li>
            <li> I really like this florida soap, it cleans great, leaves my skin feeling nice and smells awesome ! Good stuff !!</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL THANK YOU AND WILL ORDER MORE THIS WEEK GUYS YOU GOTTA TRY THIS</li>
            <li> This soap is great, feels nice putting on the lather, and it cleans and leaves my face, feeling great and I love the fragrance.  Highly recommend, not an overpowering smell, I leave it in my soap dish in the bath, and upon entering you get that nice clean fragrance, love it.</li>
            <li> This soap is really nice!  I use it as a hand soap; it cleans well with no residue on my hands, yet still makes them feel soft, pliable and fragrant.  Quite honestly I didn&#x27;t expect to like it this much and I&#x27;m so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed taking my showers, very refreshing scent! My only regret is buying only one bar so I will be back!!</li>
            <li> I read a review about how Florida Water Soap is good for cleansing out your body spiritually.  Well, I really needed this done to myself and to my son.  We each now own our individual bar of Florida water soap.  When I need a pick me up or feel that I need spiritually cleansed I take a bath with my soap and feel much better.  It is also a good soap for my face as it does not dry out my delicate facial skin.  My son uses Florida Water cologne as aftershave!!!  He washes his face with this soap and feels more relaxed as well.  When he needs his body cleansed he takes a shower with the soap.  I am glad that the professed \\&quot;witch\\&quot; wrote a recommendation on this product as it surely helped me.  It calms down the spirit to put it mildly.  Highly recommended this.  When I&#x27;m out of this soap I&#x27;ll happily order MORE.  Very reasonably priced as well as herbal shops charge more for this.  Thank you again Amazon!!  Wish I could give it 20 stars it&#x27;s that GOOD!!</li>
            <li> I love the scent of the cologne and I can&#x27;t detect it at all in any of the three bars I received.  It smells very faint--inoffensive, like motel courtesy soap.  Nothing at all like Florida water.  Looking at all the positive reviews, I can only hope I got a bad batch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least it still works as soap, though.  No problems on my skin, just a mild, boring soap..</li>
            <li> The soap can be a bit drying, so follow up with a moisturizer after a shower.  Otherwise the scent is fabulous and very calming.</li>
            <li> I mistakenly ordered this, thinking I was getting the liquid. But obviously it was the bar, I guess I should have read the description more closely. I may use it eventually not sure right now.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap. It has a great scent that I don&#x27;t find overpowering and doesn&#x27;t linger all day long like it&#x27;s a cologne/soap. I feel very clean and refreshed after using it. It hasn&#x27;t dried out my skin. I used to use Dove but I wanted to give this a try. I would recommend it. Only 4 stars because it is pricey, but gotta love Prime shipping!</li>
            <li> I am not a soap person but I like the way it smells, but I use it for special occasions after I pray.</li>
            <li> I like the cologne, and this is a nice complement. Pretty mild, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and leaves a clean citrusy scent.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this soap!!!! I smell is great! It makes you feel great after you use it.. The best part is my kids love it too! I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Not fragrant enough. Way too subtle.</li>
            <li> Wonderful soap!  It smells divine, it lasts a long time, and makes me feel squeaky clean!  Am giving a bar to all my friends for Christmas!</li>
            <li> I have used home made that costs the same and i think i will go back to it. This soap smells fine but the scent does not stick around and it left skin dry. Its like a bar of lye soap to me with fragrance. Well back to the home made florida water soap for me.</li>
            <li> Washes clean, mild scent but leaves a white residue on my skin so it appears white after a bath.</li>
            <li> I have been using Florida Water soap for several years now thanks to my husband&#x27;s recommendation, and it&#x27;s by far my favorite.  It has a light scent that&#x27;s just right for men and women.</li>
            <li> Wonderful soap. Lovely fragrance. I could just have these sitting around my house, and not worry about any other scents :)</li>
            <li> Really, nothing special about this soap. The smell is okay but it doesn&#x27;t stick around too long. Just an ordinary soap.</li>
            <li> same as the witches water great</li>
            <li> This is GREAT Florida water scent and it is a very good cleaner, too. Wash away that psychic and physical dirt and be CLEAN in several ways!!</li>
            <li> This soap has a mild scent to it. I use it when I am going out of the house to keep the evil and bad things away from me and prevent bad energies from coming into the house too. I do this washing myself with it in the shower and praying the Lord&#x27;s Prayer a couple of times. I feel refreshed every time I do this. I keep it in a soap box.</li>
            <li> The product is good and meets expectations. I&#x27;m glad I bought this product. As a suggestion, try to lower prices.  Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;Regards fron Colombia.</li>
            <li> Very drying to skin. Did not like.</li>
            <li> Not very scented at all</li>
