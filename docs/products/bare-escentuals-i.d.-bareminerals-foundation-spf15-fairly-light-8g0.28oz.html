            <li>It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>

            <li>My face looks perfect everyday, I always get compliments</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Fairly Light for 2 years now and</li>
            <li>Love love love bare escentuals!</li>
            <li>Its good to know that a simple flawless powder can gently glide on to your skin in the morning and erase not only your imperfections, but also your day to day problems.</li>
            <li>It is indeed the actual bare minerals, and works perfectly for my skin.</li>
            <li>Be sure and get the Bare Minerals Primer--it is super!</li>
            <li>This magical powder completely transformed me.</li>
            <li>I love Bare Minerals mineral make up and do not see myself using anything else.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love bare minerals foundations.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even had students comment on how young I look and how nice my skin is, and I&#x27;m a grandmother of a 7 year old!</li>
            <li>This is the exact product you buy from any store</li>
            <li>Bare Minerals didn&#x27;t really cover any discolorations or give me a \\&quot;healthy glow\\&quot; like I get from my liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Im a huge fan of bare minerals!</li>
            <li>Bare Minerals Foundation is SO easy to use and covers my redness from Rosacea very well.  </li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and have been using BareMinerals for 3 years.</li>
            <li>The effects of which got me a new job and a better life overall.</li>
            <li>When I use the concealer brush, it even hides a couple of very dark freckles and dark circles under the eyes better than mac, amazing cosmetics, smashbox, and clarins liquid concealers that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>BE is great and gentle enough to sleep in, which I&#x27;m so lazy, I do often.  </li>
            <li>I am very pale, but the fairly light was too light for even me.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased to find out I could order this product online and save a little money.  </li>
            <li>With the mineral foundation, though, it feels light like powder, but it covers so much better than powder and doesn&#x27;t make your skin look flat or dull.</li>
            <li>product arrived on time, the package was new and sealed.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for the new sifter.  </li>
            <li>Can it be purchased without the new sifter?</li>
            <li>As a woman of a certain age, but one who does not like make-up, Bare Escentuals fits my beauty routine.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Bare Minerals!</li>
            <li>It calms my rosacea redness and just pulls my face together into an even-toned, small-pored, very natural effect.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Bare Minerals</li>
            <li>Always good coverage - especially with the little flat cover brush dabbed on whatever you&#x27;re covering.  </li>
            <li>Great product, can&#x27;t go wrong with bare minerals.</li>
            <li>My 19 year old daughter likes to put regular foundation on first then</li>
            <li>This larger size container is much easier to use the face brushes with.</li>
            <li>This product is a must have for a natural but soft look.  </li>
            <li>No messy liquids or powder compacts that crumble.</li>
            <li>it just goes on seamlessly and stays that way.</li>
            <li>I now feel completely fulfilled as a person.</li>
            <li>It even came early.</li>
            <li>Buy from a trusted company or directly from the Bare Minerals website.</li>
            <li>I use it more in the summer than winter, however, because I like a cream base in the winter for more moisture.  </li>
            <li>Go Bare Minerals!</li>
            <li>this is the first time I&#x27;ve bought the foundation from a retailer other than BareMinerals.</li>
            <li>I have been using Bare Minerals for several years but have always bought from them directly.</li>
            <li>whatever it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back to buying directly from the Bare Minerals website and lo and behold</li>
            <li>She LOVES Bare Minerals/ Bare Escentuals Products.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing bare minerals make-up for over two years now and I have never been happier.</li>
            <li>do the Bare Minerals, she feels it makes it last longer.</li>
            <li>I also have some sensitive spots on my chin that look really dry during the winter.  </li>

            <li> Very carefully copied, down to the instructions inside, but the writing on the pot was different and there was no batch number!</li>
            <li> Arrived before expected, even at Christmas time.</li>
            <li> It is not orange or pink and seemed to adjust to my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I use the bisque OVER my bare minerals foundation then the mineral veil and a little of the warmth poweder for a little natural-looking color.</li>
            <li> This product made my previously clear-ish skin break out with a fury.</li>
            <li> It also dried my skin, made me peel a little, and did not mix well with my other makeup (blush and eyeshadow</li>
            <li> Liquid foundation flares it up badly, and usin bare minerals it is completely gone.  </li>
            <li> and I had it confirmed at my retailer that it was fake!!</li>
            <li> I have been a \\&quot;powder person\\&quot; and have stayed away from liquid foundation because of how it settles in the creases of the skin and just gives the appearance of \\&quot;being made up\\&quot;, and I don&#x27;t like the heavy feel.</li>

            <li> I think it&#x27;s really ridiculous that they advertise this makeup as being &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; for your skin.</li>

            <li> It was the wrong color, the wrong texture and very poor quality,</li>

            <li> What can be said. Bare minerals products are just great! It is easy to use.  You do not have to use very much to get great results. This larger size container is much easier to use the face brushes with.</li>
            <li> I have been a \\&quot;powder person\\&quot; and have stayed away from liquid foundation because of how it settles in the creases of the skin and just gives the appearance of \\&quot;being made up\\&quot;, and I don&#x27;t like the heavy feel.

When I use the concealer brush, it even hides a couple of very dark freckles and dark circles under the eyes better than mac, amazing cosmetics, smashbox, and clarins liquid concealers that I&#x27;ve used. One product that I use as a foundation, powder, and concealer....I love that!</li>
            <li> More, more, more...lol</li>
            <li> Cheaper buying online for the same great product.  Powder provides great coverage safely.  This product is a must have for a natural but soft look.  I love it and wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else..</li>
            <li> Mineral make up is healthier for your skin because it doesn&#x27;t clog your pores like the oil based make up.  I love Bare Minerals mineral make up and do not see myself using anything else.</li>
            <li> excellent product. I have been using it for years.  really good coverage no fuss/ no muss I have used all of their products and have not been disappointed in any of them</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my mother-in-law&#x27;s birthday. She LOVES Bare Minerals/ Bare Escentuals Products. It matched her skin tone perfectly.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing bare minerals make-up for over two years now and I have never been happier. My face looks perfect everyday, I always get compliments and it&#x27;s so easy to use. No messy liquids or powder compacts that crumble. My husband loves it, ever since I started using this he says I look like a porcelain doll. I believe this is the last make-up I will ever use. Thanks Bare Minerals</li>
            <li> Great product, can&#x27;t go wrong with bare minerals. It is indeed the actual bare minerals, and works perfectly for my skin. Arrived before expected, even at Christmas time. I will use this supplier again, once I run out.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s really ridiculous that they advertise this makeup as being &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; for your skin. Performs like most powder foundations.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and have been using BareMinerals for 3 years. It is the ONLY makeup I can use without getting cystic acne on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I was leary of purchasing online, but I finally decided to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;My product arrived on time, the package was new and sealed. It had the BareMinerals label and batch code on it.&lt;br /&gt;It looks, smells and goes on just like my foundation from Sephora did. Only it was WAY cheaper. I will use this company again when I need more foundation.</li>
            <li> This product was amazing. It gives sheer coverage and a &#x27;glow&#x27;. It is not orange or pink and seemed to adjust to my skin tone. I wish it covered up pimples though! It did wear off before my day of work was done so I also wish it would have lasted longer. I give this a 4 because it is a really great product that makes your skin look healthy and &#x27;finished&#x27;</li>
            <li> I discovered this stuff several years ago and have been hooked on it ever since. I never use it without the primer however. No more foundation that is too dark or too light it just goes on seamlessly and stays that way. My 19 year old daughter likes to put regular foundation on first then do the Bare Minerals, she feels it makes it last longer. Her skin always looks gorgeous. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is sick and tired of liquid foundation or foundation that doesn&#x27;t match. Hint: You can always get two different colors and mix them together to make your perfect shade!</li>
            <li> Love love love bare escentuals! This is the exact product you buy from any store</li>
            <li> Very carefully copied, down to the instructions inside, but the writing on the pot was different and there was no batch number! Also a weird shade and I had it confirmed at my retailer that it was fake!! She sent me a link and i suggest you also research knock off make-up products because studies found that Bare Minerals purchased online for less contained traces of lead, cadmium, copper, arsenic and mercury!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m completely broken out right now in cystic acne! Please beware!!</li>
            <li> FRAUD! COUNTERFEIT PRODUCT! DO NOT BUY! This is not Bare Minerals. I have been using Bare Minerals for several years but have always bought from them directly. Foolish me, I thought I&#x27;d try saving a couple of buck and bought it here. Big mistake. It was the wrong color, the wrong texture and very poor quality, whatever it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back to buying directly from the Bare Minerals website and lo and behold, I got the real stuff - excellent quality, right color and texture. Save yourself from being ripped off by scam artists. Buy from a trusted company or directly from the Bare Minerals website. This counterfeit stuff is garbage.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! My skin is a bit oily in spots so I do have to retouch about halfway through my day.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love bare minerals foundations. I never imagined a powder foundation could work so well...It goes on nicely and lasts all day without caking up.  I use the bisque OVER my bare minerals foundation then the mineral veil and a little of the warmth poweder for a little natural-looking color. Im a huge fan of bare minerals! I am very pale, but the fairly light was too light for even me.  I moved up 2 shaded for the perfect color.  I buy two different colors in the summer and mix depending on my color at the time.  I also have some sensitive spots on my chin that look really dry during the winter.  Liquid foundation flares it up badly, and usin bare minerals it is completely gone.  When I ran out of bare minerals and used my old liquid for a few days, the red flaky patches cam back!!  No more liquid for me.  Go Bare Minerals!</li>
            <li> This magical powder completely transformed me. The effects of which got me a new job and a better life overall. Its good to know that a simple flawless powder can gently glide on to your skin in the morning and erase not only your imperfections, but also your day to day problems. I now feel completely fulfilled as a person. Thanks Bare Minerals! It even came early.</li>
            <li> What is there to say?  BE is great and gentle enough to sleep in, which I&#x27;m so lazy, I do often.  Always good coverage - especially with the little flat cover brush dabbed on whatever you&#x27;re covering.  Always recommend.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the new sifter.  I find it cumbersome.  How do you remove it?  Can it be purchased without the new sifter?</li>
            <li> Best makeup ever. Easy to put on, stays on, good coverage if you use a good brush, you can even sleep in it and it won&#x27;t make you break out. I&#x27;ve used it for years. Superior product. Try it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to find out I could order this product online and save a little money.  Will purchase this way again.</li>
            <li> This product made my previously clear-ish skin break out with a fury. It also dried my skin, made me peel a little, and did not mix well with my other makeup (blush and eyeshadow either fluffed off too easily or creased). Bare Minerals didn&#x27;t really cover any discolorations or give me a \\&quot;healthy glow\\&quot; like I get from my liquid foundation. I would not recommend this product as it didn&#x27;t do anything more than a Cover Girl compact except for the heinous breakouts.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I was looking for.  I like that I can order it and have at my door in just a few days</li>
            <li> Bare Minerals Foundation is SO easy to use and covers my redness from Rosacea very well.  I use it more in the summer than winter, however, because I like a cream base in the winter for more moisture.  Be sure and get the Bare Minerals Primer--it is super!</li>
            <li> Great price, no doubt about that, but I am disappointed in the color once applied. I&#x27;ve been using Fairly Light for 2 years now and this is the first time I&#x27;ve bought the foundation from a retailer other than BareMinerals. It&#x27;s the correct color when comparing it side by side in the containers, but once applied, the shade is darker. Will not be using this retailer again.</li>
            <li> how can i complain? i can&#x27;t! no complains at all . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> As a woman of a certain age, but one who does not like make-up, Bare Escentuals fits my beauty routine.  I put on tinted sunscreen, let it sink in a couple of minutes, then buff on this lovely powder, add blush, and my skin looks really good.  It calms my rosacea redness and just pulls my face together into an even-toned, small-pored, very natural effect.  I&#x27;ve even had students comment on how young I look and how nice my skin is, and I&#x27;m a grandmother of a 7 year old!</li>
            <li> This seriously brightens my dark circles without making my skin feel heavy. AMAZING! I will never ever go back to regular foundations or concealers.</li>
