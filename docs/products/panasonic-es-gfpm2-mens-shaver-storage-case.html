    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>, it&#x27;s an excellent case for the price.  </li>
            <li>No issues whatsoever, and it fits my panasonic razors perfectly.</li>
            <li>It was a good idea on my part.  </li>
            <li>This case is made to fit my shaver perfectly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely better than the cloth bag that came with my razor.</li>
            <li>its ok.</li>
            <li>I got it for an excellent price, the shaver comes only with a leather case, so this is a must have.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It will do the job just fine.</li>
            <li>For those looking for protection, it would be fine.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made with a foam lined interior.</li>
            <li>cheap lookin</li>
            <li>One word of caution... before ordering VERIFY that it will fit your Panasonic electric shaver.</li>
            <li>This one is surely secure, and well padded.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping for something more soft shell type and more compact for suitcase travel.  </li>
            <li>it would most certainly protect it.</li>
            <li>I tossed it right in the can!</li>
            <li>Seems worth the price to insure</li>
            <li>worth the postage and hassle to send it back.&lt;br</li>
            <li>good investment to protect the shaver and inexpensive insurance against damaging the heads (or any other part of it as well).  </li>
            <li>This case is inexpensive and not really elaborate by any means, but it will be very handy for someone who travels a lot.</li>
            <li>Absolute piece of junk!</li>
            <li>I am certainly recommending it to anyone and everyone.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon really should amend the ratings software so you can omit stars for a ZERO rating.</li>
            <li>This is one disadvantage of buying &amp;#34;on line&amp;#34;, you can&#x27;t really know until you buy.</li>
            <li>Cheap plastic, doesn&#x27;t stay closed.</li>
            <li>Often, the case won&#x27;t latch closed because of the cheap plastic material.  </li>
            <li>Not even worth my time to send back!</li>
            <li>And the 3 Arc model I have came with a clear protective head cover and a velvet carry pouch, so I will use that instead.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic ES-GFPM2 Men&#x27;s Shaver Storage Case Works fine with my Panasonic ES8103 Wet Dry Razor.</li>
            <li>Not super sturdy but quite adequate.</li>
            <li>It is a little flimsy for what I expected, but I guess they needed to keep it light weight.  </li>
            <li>Some of the reviews seem pretty harsh.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, unless you don&#x27;t mind using tape, it’s pretty much a waste of money as it doesn’t even function</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not super hard plastic, but it should work well for most people.  </li>
            <li>You need to make sure it is not upside down as it wont close properly but it is hard to tell which is the correct way.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Cheaply made with a foam lined interior. Will not stay shut.</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews seem pretty harsh.  I paid $5.00 for it, so I think with that perspective, it&#x27;s an excellent case for the price.  Based on the price and photos, I got what I expected.  This is a plastic case with foam inside.  It&#x27;s not super hard plastic, but it should work well for most people.  It&#x27;s definitely better than the cloth bag that came with my razor.</li>
            <li> This case is inexpensive and not really elaborate by any means, but it will be very handy for someone who travels a lot.</li>
            <li> Covers the shaver well but I notice it doesn&#x27;t always close correctly the 1st time. You need to make sure it is not upside down as it wont close properly but it is hard to tell which is the correct way.</li>
            <li> its ok. cheap lookin but it fits my 5 blade shaver.</li>
            <li> The case I got was for saving space and preventing damage when carrying a small bag or no luggage, but, but it doesn’t close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either the shaver is a little too big, or the case is designed a little too small ( I had to tape it closed----sigh). And the 3 Arc model I have came with a clear protective head cover and a velvet carry pouch, so I will use that instead. And when traveling with luggage, it should also work well packed in any travel caddy or shave kit pouch in your overnight bag or suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, unless you don&#x27;t mind using tape, it’s pretty much a waste of money as it doesn’t even function properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grade F : Zero Stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon really should amend the ratings software so you can omit stars for a ZERO rating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it zero stars!!! It is very poorly made. The one I received was actually broken on arrival! I tossed it right in the can! Not even worth my time to send back! Very disappointing !!</li>
            <li> No issues whatsoever, and it fits my panasonic razors perfectly. It feels sturdy as well, I&#x27;m not sure what the issues the others were having but I have none</li>
            <li> Absolutely useless.  Cheap plastic, doesn&#x27;t stay closed. Don&#x27;t buy!!</li>
            <li> Made from the cheapest plastic imaginable, this &amp;#34;case&amp;#34; won&#x27;t even stay closed--its one and only job.  Completely unnecessary, especially if your Panasonic shaver comes with a &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34; to prevent the shaver from turning on during transport.</li>
            <li> I got it for an excellent price, the shaver comes only with a leather case, so this is a must have.&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic will change you and arm and a leg for one.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s padded inside and serves it&#x27;s purpose well. nothing fancy but functional for it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic ES-GFPM2 Men&#x27;s Shaver Storage Case Works fine with my Panasonic ES8103 Wet Dry Razor. It was just what I needed for travel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read the reviews on this, and I cannot believe they actually expect people to spend $160+ on a cheapo case for a electric razor. INSANE.</li>
            <li> Absolute piece of junk!</li>
            <li> Seems to do the job of protecting my Panasonic ES-LT41-K razor without taking up a lot of space in my luggage. Not super sturdy but quite adequate. Has some foam padding in side to cushion the razor. Hinge is the flexing plastic type. Latch works well enough. Sides are tong and groove to help with alignment and strength. Seems worth the price to insure my expensive razor isn&#x27;t damaged in transit.</li>
            <li> It is a little flimsy for what I expected, but I guess they needed to keep it light weight.  It will do the job just fine.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a Panasonic electric shaver and purchased this storage case as well.  It was a good idea on my part.  This case is made to fit my shaver perfectly.  Should I travel it would most certainly protect it. I use it for storing my shaver at home as well.  I good investment to protect the shaver and inexpensive insurance against damaging the heads (or any other part of it as well).  I am certainly recommending it to anyone and everyone.  One word of caution... before ordering VERIFY that it will fit your Panasonic electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Does what it advertises, encloses your Panasonic shaver so it doesn&#x27;t get damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the latching button leaves a lot to be desired.  Often, the case won&#x27;t latch closed because of the cheap plastic material.  You&#x27;ll have to routinely slam it shut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you inspect the case&#x27;s release button itself, it&#x27;s hinged plastic.  I will put my money on the fact that the piece will break off from wear after 100 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, I&#x27;d still recommend getting this if you&#x27;re traveling with your shaver.  Last thing you want to have to explain to TSA is why your bag is vibrating if your shaver accidentally turns on in your bag.</li>
            <li> The case won&#x27;t latch into the closed position even when empty.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the postage and hassle to send it back.&lt;br /&gt;Ordering this case is the same things as lighting a five dollar bill on fire.</li>
            <li> It is rather hard cover, and larger than I think it needs to be, but is well padded inside.  I was hoping for something more soft shell type and more compact for suitcase travel.  This one is surely secure, and well padded.  For those looking for protection, it would be fine.  I was looking for a slimmer, softer, product.  This is one disadvantage of buying &amp;#34;on line&amp;#34;, you can&#x27;t really know until you buy.</li>
