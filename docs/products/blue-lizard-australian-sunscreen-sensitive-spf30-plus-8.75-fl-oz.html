            <li>Excellent for the body, holds up to salt water !!!</li>

            <li>i didnt want any chemically sunscreen for my daughter and this stuff is great. will be buying more for sure</li>
            <li>I dont like the spray kind, so harmful to your lungs and environment.</li>
            <li>Love it~</li>
            <li>Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>Perhaps that could have been alleviated by giving more than 20 minutes to let it soak in, but I would have thought that would ample time.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why it makes me feel hotter, but in the end it is better than being burned.</li>
            <li>May need to be applied more of then your every day sun screen.</li>
            <li>I do like the regular the best since it does have water resistant properties, but the sensitive product is also great.</li>
            <li>My family and I are very allergic to most sunscreens - to the point that I sunburn was the better alternative!</li>

            <li>My 3yr old son is extremely fair.  </li>
            <li>Now granted I don&#x27;t recommend you do this experiment yourself - but having been the reluctant guinea pig, I can truly attest that it is ok for &#x27;sensitive skin&#x27;!!! :)</li>
            <li>It arrived sooner than expected, and it works great.</li>
            <li>and she recommended getting whichever one was cheaper at the time because they are both equally good and equally sensitive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it wasn&#x27;t very effective, however my &amp;#60;5 year old nieces did great with it, possibly because they sweat a lot less.</li>

            <li>I love Blue Lizard sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>It never fails to protect my families&#x27; skin.  </li>
            <li>Provides really good protection....a bit heavy.</li>
            <li>I had no problems with burning, and I am very light-skinned.  </li>
            <li>Got it fast, my sons doc recommended for acne skin - can&#x27;t wait to try it</li>

            <li>It is a white bottle with a blue lid and blue writing (sound familiar!).</li>
            <li>We live in Florida and our family uses this sunscreen every day!</li>
            <li>While thicker than most other lotions, it was expected as it is actually meant to protect your skin, unlike most others.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting the skin on that very sensitive part of my body to start to sting or burn....</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for anyone who wants solid sun protection.</li>
            <li>And I would like to attest to the fact that it is really &#x27;sensitive&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>My kids are now almost 5 years old and we are still using this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Given that I sweat pretty readily, I am frequently having to carefully wipe it away from my eyes.</li>
            <li>Its thick but goes on just fine, blends into the skin without overworking yourself.</li>

            <li> My 3yr old son is extremely fair.  With this, he has never burned (keeping my fingers crossed for this summer).  Love it~</li>
            <li> It screens well.  I had no problems with burning, and I am very light-skinned.  However, it stings my eyes when I sweat.  Given that I sweat pretty readily, I am frequently having to carefully wipe it away from my eyes.</li>
            <li> Excellent for the body, holds up to salt water !!! It&#x27;s perfect for med to fair skin.&lt;br /&gt;I buy a couple bottles every spring.</li>
            <li> As you have read from other reviews, this sunscreen is recommended by dermatologists and people swear by this sunscreen. I wanted to add some information regarding the difference between the &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Baby&amp;#34; sunscreens. And I would like to attest to the fact that it is really &#x27;sensitive&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what happened:&lt;br /&gt;I use a product called Balneol (to prevent hemorrhoids - awesome stuff by the way).

That may be why I was so tired and accidentally used the wrong product!!!) The person I spoke to said that the two products are really very similar and she recommended getting whichever one was cheaper at the time because they are both equally good and equally sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that you may benefit from my mistake!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS/Update from May 2017: My kids are now almost 5 years old and we are still using this sunscreen.  However Blue Lizard has another version called &amp;#34;Sport&amp;#34;.  It is meant to last longer on the skin, even when swimming or sweating heavily (their website says 240 minutes in whirlpool water).  The sport version does have chemicals (e.g., parabens) whereas the sensitive/baby does not.  And the sport version is much &amp;#34;runnier&amp;#34; (the sensitive/baby versions are very thick and takes a moment to rub in) whereas the sport version rubs in very quickly and easily.  I end up using both.  I use the sensitive/baby on days when we are out in the sun, but not direct sun all day long (e.g., going to a park).  And I use the sport version when we are going to the beach or hanging out all day at a pool.  So if you are anti-chemical and want only natural ingredients, stick with the baby/sensitive versions.  But if you prefer no chemicals, but are willing to use them on occasion (e.g., all day at the beach) then you may want to try the sport version as well.irlpool water).

            <li> We spent ten days in the virgin islands in January.  I used blue lizard for the first few days and then switched to another sunscreen with similar SPF.  I could definitely see a difference.  Though not burned, my skin visibly received more sun with the other brand. The blue lizard is thick but easy to apply.

            <li> i didnt want any chemically sunscreen for my daughter and this stuff is great. will be buying more for sure</li>
            <li> EWG lists this lotion as one of the safest to use, so it has that going for it.  While thicker than most other lotions, it was expected as it is actually meant to protect your skin, unlike most others.  My issue was that within minutes of beginning to sweat, the lotion ran like crazy and it looked pretty terrible, also greatly reducing its effectiveness.  Perhaps that could have been alleviated by giving more than 20 minutes to let it soak in, but I would have thought that would ample time.  So for me (late 20s male, fairly light skin), it wasn&#x27;t very effective, however my &amp;#60;5 year old nieces did great with it, possibly because they sweat a lot less.</li>
            <li> im very happy with this sunscreen. Its not full of harmful chemicals and rates well on the EWG , a rating of 1, which is the best. Its thick but goes on just fine, blends into the skin without overworking yourself. Its not greasy at all. I dont like the spray kind, so harmful to your lungs and environment. plus you waste so much in the air! this works awesome in the Georgia and Florida sun! My kids arent burnt and im a happy mom. side note: my kids are not fair skin, i cant comment on how this works on a fair skin child/adult. For my medium skinned kids, its awesome.</li>
            <li> My daughter broke out in hives less than 5 minutes after putting this &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; sunscreen on. If your child has skin allergies like my daughter get a sunscreen prescribed by their allergist.</li>
            <li> Best product for my family.  My kids never get burnt when we use this.  Take the time to rub it in and it doesn&#x27;t look ghosty.  Worth the price tag for the protection.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good sunscreen, use it</li>
            <li> not greasy, no odor, not full of chemicals</li>
            <li> It arrived sooner than expected, and it works great.</li>
            <li> My family and I are very allergic to most sunscreens - to the point that I sunburn was the better alternative! I am on my bike 2 hours a day in the middle of the day, all summer long. I have not burned once this summer while using this screen and no one has had any skin reaction to it either. In fact, last week I wore different, smaller, sunglasses but I put the sunscreen where I usually do on my face.  Surprise, I had slight sunburn just around my eyes and nowhere else.  it  It lasts along time on the skin too - overnight even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My only complaint is that it does seem to interfere with sweating and therefore cooling the body.  I don&#x27;t know why it makes me feel hotter, but in the end it is better than being burned. It is pretty greasy too.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  I put it on my kids faces at the pool, and not only does it protect, but I don&#x27;t have to re-apply (which is an issue with other sunscreens once kids are in the chlorine and their pores open up).  This is our go-to sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Label on the bottle is different, but the product is still the same.</li>
            <li> I get red bumpy rashes from all sun screens but not this! It&#x27;s worth the extra money.  Before I found this, I had tested out many other kinds but this works!  The only draw back is that it takes awhile to soak in bad May need to be applied more of then your every day sun screen.</li>
            <li> He best sunscreen! We live in Florida and our family uses this sunscreen every day!</li>
            <li> Best product for sunburn prevention&amp; UV protection, in my estimation</li>
            <li> I love Blue Lizard sunscreen.  It never fails to protect my families&#x27; skin.  We haven&#x27;t gotten any sunburns since starting to use this sunscreen.  I do like the regular the best since it does have water resistant properties, but the sensitive product is also great.</li>
