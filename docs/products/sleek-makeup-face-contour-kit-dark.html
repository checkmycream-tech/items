            <li>I received it fast , and its the best.</li>
            <li>I liked the gold highlight</li>
            <li>The highlight is really the best part of the package.</li>
            <li>Comes with a mirror, so that&#x27;s nice, and instructions which is convenient if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing, like me.</li>
            <li>So the search for an effective highlighting and contouring kit for my complexion continues.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li>This is the darkest option from sleek, what I found is on its own for me</li>
            <li>The highlight is perfect and doesnt give too much of a highlight.</li>
            <li>The highlight looks pink, but is actually a BEAUTIFUL gold color, perfect for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>The highlighter is also a nice golden color that looks beautiful on.</li>

            <li>When I viewed this item, I loved the colors and I was excited to receive this blush set.</li>
            <li>It looks great when you first apply it, but it fades out within hours.</li>
            <li>The seller I bought from (Lucky Girl) was so great -- very quick shipping + delivery.</li>
            <li>and it was fine!)</li>
            <li>It was hard finding a contour kit at a great price with Excellent results! !!</li>

            <li>This is cute.</li>
            <li>However, I was hoping to do the thing where you shadow your nose to make it look more pronounced or whatever.</li>
            <li>I really love it</li>
            <li>This was recommended on someone&#x27;s blog I found as one of the top bronzer&#x27;s/contours for African-American skin.</li>
            <li>I am no makeup artist (no matter how many YouTube videos I watch, and I have watched a lot).</li>
            <li>It could be so much Better...</li>
            <li>I love this kit.</li>
            <li>but I still like it better than the one I bought from Sephora.</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>Does not look appealing</li>

            <li>If my review has helped, and I sincerely hope it has</li>

            <li>I am so excited to use this face contour kit!</li>
            <li>Love it this product came so quickly!</li>
            <li>The colors stay on and  are very true.  </li>
            <li>Most days I just spot conceal (LA Girl HD Concealer), dusting lightly with HD powder (</li>
            <li>The quality of this product is great and I am glad I was able to find a contour see for my deep complexion.</li>
            <li>It arrived safe and sound in 8 days</li>

            <li>The instructions are easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to apply and hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin yet</li>

            <li>Even though shipping from the UK, I received mine very quickly.</li>
            <li>Luv it....not as dark as picture but perfect still</li>
            <li>The contour is a matte neutral dark brown and the highlighter is a peachy gold which is perfect for my medium brown skin.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect contour for my dark skin.</li>
            <li>Perfect for us dark skinned girls.</li>
            <li>Like even if the medium kit would have been the best choice for your depth and tone, you can still pull off the dark kit when applying with a light hand.</li>
            <li>The highlight was the best part of the purchase it has a little shimmer but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>So worth the wait. :-)</li>
            <li>The blush is too light for my complexion</li>
            <li>The package is sleek , the whole compact is amazing .</li>
            <li>Cheap Bronze shimmer.  </li>
            <li>Overall a great product .</li>
            <li>On darker skin tones the bronzer appears kind of ashy, but is very blendable.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this contour kit because I can also use it as a highlighter for my eyes and also a darker color for my outer v.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to finally see this on Amazon!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m NW50 at MAC, and this is too light for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>The price was amazing and the shopping was fast.</li>
            <li>Great product that will last me a while</li>
            <li>But as far as color pay off and texture it is good for the price.</li>
            <li>but overall its good and cheap!</li>
            <li>The actual product is very pigmented, and applies very beautifully on the skin.</li>
            <li>The contour shade is the perfect dark yet cool shade for contouring.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great small but substantial size and the pigment is amazing...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure if I play with it, it&#x27;ll eventually be useable..</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Just got this product, and loving it so far!</li>
            <li>The powder blends well, color vivid, nicely packaged with some helpful hints on ways to use the product.</li>
            <li>I love love LOVE this item and can see it being in my collection for a very long time.</li>
            <li>and it gives my skin an amazing natural glow.</li>
            <li>I love this kit so much.</li>
            <li>Overall good</li>
            <li>The highlight is beautiful, but the contour is not as dark as the picture.</li>
            <li>i only use the contour side, but the highlight side makes a good eye shadow.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t understand how the whole thing works, but I&#x27;m so satisfied.</li>
            <li>Good product especially if a beginner at contouring</li>
            <li>I love this contour kit and it came fast.</li>
            <li>The highlight is really beautiful on dark skin.</li>
            <li>I also like a matte finish to my makeup and since this is a powder, it does not feel nor look dry and blends nicely with my Clinique Even Better Skin foundation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m beautiful bronze in black opal</li>
            <li>I love that it comes with a picture guide for those who are new to contouring and highlighting!</li>
            <li>/&gt;But the contour powder is too close to my skintone to use on my face but it is perfect for a subtle contour of my nose for events and photos.</li>
            <li>I am shade NW55 in Mac&#x27;s Studio Fix Fluid and the highlighter gives the perfect amount of glow that can be used in your daily routine without looking overdone.</li>
            <li>so it gives a wonder bold look.  </li>
            <li>Very nicely pigmented, applies smoothly and with little effort.  </li>
            <li>As for the highlighter, it&#x27;s very pretty</li>
            <li>Arrived in a timely manner and is exactly as described!</li>
            <li>Product never came but after contacting seller they quickly shipped another one right out.</li>
            <li>and then I use my new  Real Techniques Multi Task Powder Brush ( in Love with these brushes by the way) to lightly pick up the contour color from sleek and go over the Blunt color</li>
            <li>The contour shade is nice and dark, so it actually shows up on caramel skin, and the highlight shade is the perfect golden color for a natural dewy look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty shimmery gold, and that looks so freaking beautiful on medium to dark skin!</li>
            <li>Contouring is so much fun with this.</li>
            <li>It was wrapped in this nice box and even came with a mini guide on different ways you can contour .</li>
            <li>I am a fan of Sleek Makeup and own several of their blush palettes.</li>
            <li>it gives a bit of a dirt color and is not as complimentary to my skin-tone as I like.</li>
            <li>This is worth my money</li>
            <li>It is nice overall.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this product and was so excited to try it after seeing so many positive reviews on YouTube by dark skinned divas like myself.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li>It looks very natural on the skin and blends out easily.</li>
            <li>so far so good.so pigmented I love it,I was looking for a contour with more brown undertone than red and this one works weel</li>
            <li>I have not had enough time to really try the product, but I am happy with product so far.</li>
            <li>I have a naturally tan complexion, so a lot of the contouring kits I see truly aren&#x27;t dark enough to create appropriate shadows unless you are more fair.</li>
            <li>Special thanks to the provider for shipping so fast!</li>
            <li>This is the best contour kit around, in my humble opinion, especially for darker-skinned girls.</li>
            <li>The counter part of the duo looks really natural and is easy to blend in.</li>
            <li>It has a very soft and smooth texture to it.</li>
            <li>Though this would be far too dark for any fair to medium complexioned girl, this is great if you&#x27;re a deeper olive to dark complexioned girl.</li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable and my package arrived in a timely manner.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;***I think it&#x27;s important to mention that this contour kit is significantly lighter in person than it appears in the display above.</li>
            <li>This contour duo is very pigmented!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lighter than the picture, but I&#x27;m pretty chocolate and</li>
            <li>and I make sure I blend it out properly.</li>
            <li>just never knew WHAT things exactly to buy or</li>
            <li>I will be back to buy more when I hit the pan.</li>
            <li>this is the 2nd time buying this product and I love using it to contour my face.</li>
            <li>In my opinion the Black Radiance pressed powder in Rich Mahogany is a much better alternative and it is cheaper.</li>
            <li>Amazing matte brown color, thought it would be too dark for my skin</li>
            <li>I suspect that would be the same vice versa; if you buy a kit that&#x27;s a touch too light, you might be able to build it up enough to where it does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely easy to apply and lost lasting.</li>
            <li>knew contouring could help you achieve a desired look, slimming certain features by shadowing them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering an extra for myself and a couple more for family and friends!</li>
            <li>Amazing I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li>I like the consistency of the product however this doesn&#x27;t give me much of a contour because of my complexion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really liking it.</li>
            <li>The highlight was more glittery than i expected.</li>
            <li>but it really wasn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Very flexible product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, you don&#x27;t need that much.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!</li>
            <li>The packaging is very sleek and sturdy.</li>
            <li>Much lighter than picture.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>Im a beginner with this whole contouring thing but</li>
            <li>You have be very light-handed with the highlighter.</li>
            <li>really well will buy again indeed thank you</li>
            <li>i use it all the time very pigmented.</li>
            <li>The color is deep deep brown and the highlight is a nice shimmery gold bronzy color.</li>
            <li>but  now i use a fluffy kind of tapered blush brush ( from E.L.F)</li>
            <li>The dark pressed powder is very smooth and light; it&#x27;s a mattified deep mocha color.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I love the highlight though..</li>
            <li>I had been waiting to get my hand on this contour kits for months and when it arrived i instantly knew that it was worth the wait!</li>
            <li>Smaller than I had anticipated but well worth it!</li>
            <li>and this is a great contour for when I want a dramatic look.</li>
            <li>I got this kit in dark and so far am loving it.  </li>
            <li>Actually the contour kit in Dark is surprisingly lighter than the picture shown.</li>
            <li>The highlight in the kit is also very nice but a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li>When the highlight is applied on the cheek bone, the dark shade shows up better.  </li>
            <li>and I have pretty sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am dark skinned but my lighter skinned friends use it too and they also love it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve come across better contour kits and being dark skinned Ebony Bronze by Cover Girl Queen</li>
            <li>It looks very natural and I have bought contour kits for much more money on other sights.  </li>
            <li>Item was not dark, was going to return it, shipment was higher than item was.</li>
            <li>Love this on my dark skin tone!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and a lot cheaper than those other contour kits that work just as well as this one.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a LONG way, so I know I&#x27;ll be holding on to this for a good while.</li>
            <li>It is a little on the red side for my shin tone but so far so good.</li>
            <li>This is a great contour kit, I just got the wrong color.</li>
            <li>and this is the perfect shade (was confused on whether to get dark or medium</li>
            <li>I bought it because I&#x27;m new to contouring.</li>
            <li>Definitely a new staple of mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sleek is now my new brand.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have this in dark and I have a light to medium complexion.</li>
            <li>Have tried same product type, different company and cost more money and found both to be equal in quality.  </li>
            <li>so far!</li>
            <li>but as the dark option wasn&#x27;t available then i went with medium</li>
            <li>The color is vivid and pigmented just like it should be.</li>
            <li>Not too light, not too dark.</li>
            <li>This gives a very natural professional look.</li>
            <li>I am a dark-skinned woman of color so the &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; was a little light for me</li>
            <li>its like the power wears off, also it nearly shows up on my face...</li>
            <li>The lighting doesn&#x27;t really show how deep the brown is .</li>
            <li>At first I was worried that this was going to be entirely too dark or that it would leave me looking dirty, but it&#x27;s actually perfect.</li>
            <li>price of this is very affordable and it last!</li>
            <li>Like another reviewer said this appears much darker on the screen than the actual product is.  </li>
            <li>I got mine in the mail today and it is completely unusable.</li>
            <li>The workaround to counteract this is: I 1st apply Mac&#x27;s Blunt using my old Mac contour brush</li>
            <li>It came very quickly from the UK and I will be using this everyday!</li>
            <li>You have to be a little careful with it because it&#x27;s so easy to put on too much.</li>
            <li>Apparently, I have natural contours and shadows on my face so my make-up always looks professional.</li>
            <li>The contour color just wasn&#x27;t dark enough to make a noticeable impact on my skin, the gold didn&#x27;t go as smooth as I thought ur would</li>
            <li>High quality European product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was not dark like the picture</li>
            <li>I am a caramel colored African American woman and usually the colors are much too light.  </li>
            <li>I personally brush it on top of my other highlighting product for an additional pink glow.</li>
            <li>A little too shimmery but adds a really nice effect when applied down the middle of the nose.</li>
            <li>and it barely has a dent in it..</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a completely matte brown without the red tones that Mac Blunt has.</li>
            <li>I found the quality of the product poor and staying power just ok.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes in a cute little black compact  case with instructions on how to contour your nose and cheeks....</li>
            <li>The brown shadow color is just the right brown for my deep dark skin.</li>
            <li>I want to warn you; the product is EXTREMELY pigmented, all you need is a gentle dip and tap off the excess.</li>
            <li>It works very well, and doesn&#x27;t look cakey or glittery like other bronzers can.</li>
            <li>So it was not dark enough for contouring for my skin color</li>
            <li>, I use this one when I go out for a more dramatic contour</li>
            <li>just make sure to blend, and i only gave 4 because sometimes it was necessary to use a darker powder along with the contour side because it was a little less pigmented than id hoped</li>
            <li>I thought the color was not going to be dark enough or too dark to fit me</li>
            <li>Blends seamlessly and is long lasting.</li>
            <li>Also If you feel like the contour isn&#x27;t dark enough, you can combine the dark color concealer stick by black radiance on your cheekbones and it&#x27;ll show even more.</li>
            <li>I really wish it was a little darker than my complexion..</li>

            <li> So the search for an effective highlighting and contouring kit for my complexion continues.</li>

            <li> This is the darkest option from sleek, what I found is on its own for me</li>
            <li> The highlight is perfect and doesnt give too much of a highlight.</li>

            <li> When I viewed this item, I loved the colors and I was excited to receive this blush set.</li>
            <li> It looks great when you first apply it, but it fades out within hours.</li>

            <li> and it was fine!)</li>
            <li> It was hard finding a contour kit at a great price with Excellent results! !!</li>

            <li> But I love the kit.</li>
            <li> I love the shimmering effect I get when I put it on.</li>
            <li> This is cute.</li>
            <li> However, I was hoping to do the thing where you shadow your nose to make it look more pronounced or whatever.</li>
            <li> I really love it</li>
            <li> This was recommended on someone&#x27;s blog I found as one of the top bronzer&#x27;s/contours for African-American skin.</li>
            <li> I am no makeup artist (no matter how many YouTube videos I watch, and I have watched a lot).</li>
            <li> It could be so much Better...</li>
            <li> I love this kit.</li>
            <li> but I still like it better than the one I bought from Sephora.</li>
            <li> I love it...</li>
            <li> Does not look appealing</li>

            <li> If my review has helped, and I sincerely hope it has</li>
            <li> The bronzer is a lot lighter, and the highlight is more gold instead of the coppery color in the photo.</li>

            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Great for beginners like myself who are new to the contouring and highlighting arena!</li>
            <li> I am so excited to use this face contour kit!</li>
            <li> Love it this product came so quickly!</li>
            <li> The colors stay on and  are very true.  </li>
            <li> Most days I just spot conceal (LA Girl HD Concealer), dusting lightly with HD powder (</li>
            <li> The quality of this product is great and I am glad I was able to find a contour see for my deep complexion.</li>
            <li> It arrived safe and sound in 8 days</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use the contour but the highlight is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and good color payoff without using too much product</li>
            <li> The instructions are easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to apply and hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin yet</li>
            <li> /&gt;you&#x27;ve got the hang of using it, it&#x27;s easy and</li>
            <li> Even though shipping from the UK, I received mine very quickly.</li>
            <li> Luv it....not as dark as picture but perfect still</li>
            <li> The contour is a matte neutral dark brown and the highlighter is a peachy gold which is perfect for my medium brown skin.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect contour for my dark skin.</li>
            <li> Perfect for us dark skinned girls.</li>
            <li> Like even if the medium kit would have been the best choice for your depth and tone, you can still pull off the dark kit when applying with a light hand.</li>
            <li> The highlight was the best part of the purchase it has a little shimmer but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> So worth the wait. :-)</li>
            <li> The blush is too light for my complexion</li>
            <li> The package is sleek , the whole compact is amazing .</li>
            <li> Cheap Bronze shimmer.  </li>
            <li> Overall a great product .</li>
            <li> On darker skin tones the bronzer appears kind of ashy, but is very blendable.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this contour kit because I can also use it as a highlighter for my eyes and also a darker color for my outer v.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to finally see this on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m NW50 at MAC, and this is too light for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> The price was amazing and the shopping was fast.</li>
            <li> Great product that will last me a while</li>
            <li> But as far as color pay off and texture it is good for the price.</li>
            <li> but overall its good and cheap!</li>
            <li> The actual product is very pigmented, and applies very beautifully on the skin.</li>
            <li> The contour shade is the perfect dark yet cool shade for contouring.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great small but substantial size and the pigment is amazing...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure if I play with it, it&#x27;ll eventually be useable..</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Just got this product, and loving it so far!</li>
            <li> The powder blends well, color vivid, nicely packaged with some helpful hints on ways to use the product.</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE this item and can see it being in my collection for a very long time.</li>
            <li> and it gives my skin an amazing natural glow.</li>
            <li> I love this kit so much.</li>
            <li> Overall good</li>
            <li> The highlight is beautiful, but the contour is not as dark as the picture.</li>
            <li> i only use the contour side, but the highlight side makes a good eye shadow.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t understand how the whole thing works, but I&#x27;m so satisfied.</li>
            <li> Good product especially if a beginner at contouring</li>
            <li> I love this contour kit and it came fast.</li>
            <li> The highlight is really beautiful on dark skin.</li>
            <li> I also like a matte finish to my makeup and since this is a powder, it does not feel nor look dry and blends nicely with my Clinique Even Better Skin foundation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m beautiful bronze in black opal</li>
            <li> I love that it comes with a picture guide for those who are new to contouring and highlighting!</li>
            <li> /&gt;But the contour powder is too close to my skintone to use on my face but it is perfect for a subtle contour of my nose for events and photos.</li>
            <li> I am shade NW55 in Mac&#x27;s Studio Fix Fluid and the highlighter gives the perfect amount of glow that can be used in your daily routine without looking overdone.</li>
            <li> so it gives a wonder bold look.  </li>
            <li> Very nicely pigmented, applies smoothly and with little effort.  </li>
            <li> As for the highlighter, it&#x27;s very pretty</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner and is exactly as described!</li>
            <li> Product never came but after contacting seller they quickly shipped another one right out.</li>
            <li> and then I use my new  Real Techniques Multi Task Powder Brush ( in Love with these brushes by the way) to lightly pick up the contour color from sleek and go over the Blunt color</li>
            <li> The contour shade is nice and dark, so it actually shows up on caramel skin, and the highlight shade is the perfect golden color for a natural dewy look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty shimmery gold, and that looks so freaking beautiful on medium to dark skin!</li>
            <li> Contouring is so much fun with this.</li>
            <li> It was wrapped in this nice box and even came with a mini guide on different ways you can contour .</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Sleek Makeup and own several of their blush palettes.</li>
            <li> it gives a bit of a dirt color and is not as complimentary to my skin-tone as I like.</li>
            <li> This is worth my money</li>
            <li> It is nice overall.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product and was so excited to try it after seeing so many positive reviews on YouTube by dark skinned divas like myself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li> It looks very natural on the skin and blends out easily.</li>
            <li> so far so good.so pigmented I love it,I was looking for a contour with more brown undertone than red and this one works weel</li>
            <li> I have not had enough time to really try the product, but I am happy with product so far.</li>
            <li> I have a naturally tan complexion, so a lot of the contouring kits I see truly aren&#x27;t dark enough to create appropriate shadows unless you are more fair.</li>
            <li> Special thanks to the provider for shipping so fast!</li>
            <li> This is the best contour kit around, in my humble opinion, especially for darker-skinned girls.</li>
            <li> The counter part of the duo looks really natural and is easy to blend in.</li>
            <li> It has a very soft and smooth texture to it.</li>
            <li> Though this would be far too dark for any fair to medium complexioned girl, this is great if you&#x27;re a deeper olive to dark complexioned girl.</li>
            <li> The price was very reasonable and my package arrived in a timely manner.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;***I think it&#x27;s important to mention that this contour kit is significantly lighter in person than it appears in the display above.</li>
            <li> This contour duo is very pigmented!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lighter than the picture, but I&#x27;m pretty chocolate and</li>
            <li> and I make sure I blend it out properly.</li>
            <li> just never knew WHAT things exactly to buy or</li>
            <li> I will be back to buy more when I hit the pan.</li>
            <li> this is the 2nd time buying this product and I love using it to contour my face.</li>
            <li> In my opinion the Black Radiance pressed powder in Rich Mahogany is a much better alternative and it is cheaper.</li>
            <li> Amazing matte brown color, thought it would be too dark for my skin</li>
            <li> I suspect that would be the same vice versa; if you buy a kit that&#x27;s a touch too light, you might be able to build it up enough to where it does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely easy to apply and lost lasting.</li>
            <li> knew contouring could help you achieve a desired look, slimming certain features by shadowing them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering an extra for myself and a couple more for family and friends!</li>
            <li> Amazing I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I like the consistency of the product however this doesn&#x27;t give me much of a contour because of my complexion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking it.</li>
            <li> The highlight was more glittery than i expected.</li>
            <li> but it really wasn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Very flexible product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , you don&#x27;t need that much.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!</li>
            <li> The packaging is very sleek and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Much lighter than picture.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Im a beginner with this whole contouring thing but</li>
            <li> You have be very light-handed with the highlighter.</li>
            <li> really well will buy again indeed thank you</li>
            <li> i use it all the time very pigmented.</li>
            <li> The color is deep deep brown and the highlight is a nice shimmery gold bronzy color.</li>
            <li> but  now i use a fluffy kind of tapered blush brush ( from E.L.F)</li>
            <li> The dark pressed powder is very smooth and light; it&#x27;s a mattified deep mocha color.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I love the highlight though..</li>
            <li> I had been waiting to get my hand on this contour kits for months and when it arrived i instantly knew that it was worth the wait!</li>
            <li> Smaller than I had anticipated but well worth it!</li>
            <li> and this is a great contour for when I want a dramatic look.</li>
            <li> I got this kit in dark and so far am loving it.  </li>
            <li> Actually the contour kit in Dark is surprisingly lighter than the picture shown.</li>
            <li> The highlight in the kit is also very nice but a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> When the highlight is applied on the cheek bone, the dark shade shows up better.  </li>
            <li> and I have pretty sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am dark skinned but my lighter skinned friends use it too and they also love it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve come across better contour kits and being dark skinned Ebony Bronze by Cover Girl Queen</li>
            <li> It looks very natural and I have bought contour kits for much more money on other sights.  </li>
            <li> Item was not dark, was going to return it, shipment was higher than item was.</li>
            <li> Love this on my dark skin tone!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and a lot cheaper than those other contour kits that work just as well as this one.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a LONG way, so I know I&#x27;ll be holding on to this for a good while.</li>
            <li> It is a little on the red side for my shin tone but so far so good.</li>
            <li> This is a great contour kit, I just got the wrong color.</li>
            <li> and this is the perfect shade (was confused on whether to get dark or medium</li>
            <li> I bought it because I&#x27;m new to contouring.</li>
            <li> Definitely a new staple of mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sleek is now my new brand.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have this in dark and I have a light to medium complexion.</li>
            <li> Have tried same product type, different company and cost more money and found both to be equal in quality.  </li>
            <li> so far!</li>
            <li> but as the dark option wasn&#x27;t available then i went with medium</li>
            <li> The color is vivid and pigmented just like it should be.</li>
            <li> Not too light, not too dark.</li>
            <li> This gives a very natural professional look.</li>
            <li> I am a dark-skinned woman of color so the &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; was a little light for me</li>
            <li> its like the power wears off, also it nearly shows up on my face...</li>
            <li> The lighting doesn&#x27;t really show how deep the brown is .</li>
            <li> At first I was worried that this was going to be entirely too dark or that it would leave me looking dirty, but it&#x27;s actually perfect.</li>
            <li> price of this is very affordable and it last!</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer said this appears much darker on the screen than the actual product is.  </li>
            <li> I got mine in the mail today and it is completely unusable.</li>
            <li> The workaround to counteract this is: I 1st apply Mac&#x27;s Blunt using my old Mac contour brush</li>
            <li> It came very quickly from the UK and I will be using this everyday!</li>
            <li> You have to be a little careful with it because it&#x27;s so easy to put on too much.</li>
            <li> Apparently, I have natural contours and shadows on my face so my make-up always looks professional.</li>
            <li> The contour color just wasn&#x27;t dark enough to make a noticeable impact on my skin, the gold didn&#x27;t go as smooth as I thought ur would</li>
            <li> High quality European product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was not dark like the picture</li>
            <li> I am a caramel colored African American woman and usually the colors are much too light.  </li>
            <li> I personally brush it on top of my other highlighting product for an additional pink glow.</li>
            <li> A little too shimmery but adds a really nice effect when applied down the middle of the nose.</li>
            <li> and it barely has a dent in it..</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a completely matte brown without the red tones that Mac Blunt has.</li>
            <li> I found the quality of the product poor and staying power just ok.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes in a cute little black compact  case with instructions on how to contour your nose and cheeks....</li>
            <li> The brown shadow color is just the right brown for my deep dark skin.</li>
            <li> I want to warn you; the product is EXTREMELY pigmented, all you need is a gentle dip and tap off the excess.</li>
            <li> It works very well, and doesn&#x27;t look cakey or glittery like other bronzers can.</li>
            <li> So it was not dark enough for contouring for my skin color</li>
            <li> , I use this one when I go out for a more dramatic contour</li>
            <li> just make sure to blend, and i only gave 4 because sometimes it was necessary to use a darker powder along with the contour side because it was a little less pigmented than id hoped</li>
            <li> I thought the color was not going to be dark enough or too dark to fit me</li>
            <li> Blends seamlessly and is long lasting.</li>
            <li> Also If you feel like the contour isn&#x27;t dark enough, you can combine the dark color concealer stick by black radiance on your cheekbones and it&#x27;ll show even more.</li>
            <li> I really wish it was a little darker than my complexion..</li>
            <li> Ruby Kiss Set n&#x27; Forget), apply a little mascara (MAYBELLINE Volum&#x27; Express The Falsies), a nude lipgloss (NYC Liquid Lipshine in Midtown Mocha) and use this on the high points of my cheeks, the bridge of my nose and eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> clean.no breaks and cracks.plus came with a little manual.i&#x27;ll highly recommend.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a dark skin chick like me, be careful not to use too much of the under-eye glimmer, as it can be over powering and</li>
            <li> and i love to highlight and contour my face to give it that dramatic look when I go out!</li>
            <li> As usual, for women of color, &amp;#34;Dark&amp;#34; really isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> not dark enough for dark skin girls</li>
            <li> It looks like its going to last me a very long time too</li>
            <li> It comes with a lot of product so it should last a very long time.</li>
            <li> At least, this is true for the &#x27;Dark&#x27; kit; I can&#x27;t speak for the others because I did not purchase them.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a while for a product that is dark enough to do contouring on African American skin.  </li>
            <li> Sleeks contour powder in dark takes the red out of the blunt application and leaves me with a softer brown color  with enough depth to reflect contouring.</li>
            <li> It also lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a looking for a contouring powder for a long time.</li>
            <li> The highlight color is dead on and not too sparkley looks natural.</li>
            <li> Lastly it shipped faster than I expected; it said some time after Christmas since it was shipped from the UK, but it was here the week after I ordered it.</li>
            <li> It is very subtle and pretty!</li>
            <li> Will reorder as long as I can get it!</li>
            <li> Im like a medium brown skin African American girl, So after reading some of the reviews, i was afraid the contour kit in Dark might be too dark -- and it was going on pretty dark with the brush i was using when i first got the kit--</li>
            <li> My complexion is deep dark brown.  </li>
            <li> Thought it wouldn&#x27;t be dark enough</li>
            <li> The powder looks lighter in the pan but actually shows up quite dark on the skin</li>
            <li> loose powder won&#x27;t fix it.</li>
            <li> I just recently started using the highlight too and it gives me a little glow</li>
            <li> When I want a more dramatic nighttime look I usually contour/highlight with cream foundations, which is too heavy and time consuming for daytime wear.</li>
            <li> This product came to me just as I expected it.all</li>
            <li> Was delivered faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> it was lighter than I expected</li>
            <li> the highlighter is a peachy pink shimmer, not</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dark, so I use only a little</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a contour powder for a while... wanted something that was dark enough to work but not to harsh.</li>
            <li> The highlighter is georgeous and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Did&#x27;nt try any other product and I don&#x27;t think I want to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gives a little extra something to my everyday makeup, A Holy Grail product for me</li>
            <li> It is just the right color to contour my face without have too much of a dramatic effect or harsh lines and color!</li>
            <li> The dark shade is buildable, so even if you think it&#x27;s too dark, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find contouring kits for dark skin especially at an affordable rate.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding a dark enough powder to contour with.</li>
            <li> the dark is very dark and the highlighter looks pink.</li>
            <li> I thought it might not show up on my dark brown skin</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not too dark or ashy looking.</li>
            <li> I use the dark side as a contour.</li>
            <li> The picture doesn&#x27;t do the dark shade justice.</li>
            <li> I did not want to use a dark eyeshadow or a dark matted blush, I wanted a product intended to be use for cotouring.  </li>
            <li> Just not as dark as on the screen.</li>
            <li> I wear Smashbox Studio Skin in 3.4 and this was much to dark for my skin,</li>
            <li> The shipping looked like it would take 3 weeks, but got here in one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great contour kit for dark skinned women.</li>
            <li> Please keep in mind that the colors on Amazon are NOT NOT NOT true to color for the Dark Kit (probably not for any of the other options either).</li>
            <li> The contour color looks purple-ish in the Amazon picture, but it&#x27;s actually a dark brown in person.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as dark as the picture shown.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using grey-toned contouring powders and this kit in dark</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully on dark skin.</li>
            <li> Not as dark as pictured</li>
            <li> However, I received the face contour kit in dark.</li>
            <li> Nothing broken or old ..</li>
            <li> yet it&#x27;s not very light, so</li>
            <li> I sometimes run it down the bridge of my nose as well.</li>
            <li> Took less than a week for me to receive it compared to the 3-4 week trajectory that Amazon estimated for delivery.</li>
            <li> I have finally found a contour shade that gives me that subtle contour look, with out my face looking to chisled.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too dark for my skin tone...</li>
            <li> So if you accidentally buy a kit that&#x27;s too dark, your money won&#x27;t be wasted because you can make it work.</li>
            <li> I am an NW40/45 and this product works for me, but could be a little darker.</li>
            <li> but rather in little blotches of gold.</li>
            <li> it gives a little sparkle.</li>
            <li> So if you are very dark I do not suggest it</li>
            <li> I have a round face, the darker one defines, the lighter is my blush.</li>
            <li> Not sure how dark of a complexion you can have for this product to work</li>
            <li> and then I use medium for my everyday face.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying a contour kit for brown skin online, but after taking this risk, I am very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This is my go to kit for my everyday look.</li>
            <li> , they give you a little booklet to help you out a little, just take your time and start off slow until you feel</li>
            <li> I dropped mine and the contour side is in a million little pieces! :/</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got cocoa colored skin or approaching a blackish brown tone this is not the kit for you, unfortunately, so please save your money.</li>
            <li> I learned that the hard way.</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t be that hard for a make-up company to make a product with options in a range of colors to cover the needs of all of the varying hues of skin color.</li>
            <li> It was an unnecessary purchase on my part.</li>
            <li> Very disappointment in product, wish it was dark as it read.</li>
            <li> I thought I would be in for a treat when I ordered this contour kit, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to see how small this contour kit was.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very shocked to have gotten it so soon, considering that it was shipped from the UK to the US.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love everything about this contour kit! Contour powder goes on smooth and evenly....and the highlight powder is to die for! So worth the wait. :-) #aMUSTbuy</li>
            <li> i love this kit.  It looks very natural and I have bought contour kits for much more money on other sights.  The colors stay on and  are very true.  Both colors are great.  The color is exactly as pictured, which usually isn&#x27;t the case.  I am a caramel colored African American woman and usually the colors are much too light.  I will look for this brand in the future.</li>
            <li> Have been wanting this contour set for a while...I&#x27;m glad that I purchased it.....LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT.....</li>
            <li> Great color. I thought it might not show up on my dark brown skin but it did and it&#x27;s not too dark or ashy looking. It&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li> This contour kit is great I can cary in my purse take it when I travel and don&#x27;t have to worry colors are gorgeous</li>
            <li> Luv it....not as dark as picture but perfect still</li>
            <li> Love this. I have been using this product for years. Easy to apply and good color payoff without using too much product so the kit should last you awhile. That goes for the bronzer also.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too dark for my skin tone... But I love the kit. Very great quality.</li>
            <li> It took some time to receive to the point where I forgot that I even order it. But they product wasn&#x27;t for me it just doesn&#x27;t work well with my skin complexion</li>
            <li> Took a while to arrive. But when it arrived it was awesome... I&#x27;m am a darker complexion and the brown showed up on my skin and looked amazing.</li>
            <li> I thought the color was not going to be dark enough or too dark to fit me but it was actually perfect. The blush is too light for my complexion but I guess it&#x27;s supposed to be used as a highlighter anyway. I would purchase another one for my makeup artist kit.</li>
            <li> I really wish it was a little darker than my complexion.. It blends into my skin and it&#x27;s not suppose to.. Contour color suppose to be 2 shades darker than your complexion. I just wish the company can provide darker colors.. Other than that, I love the highlight though.. I love the shimmering effect I get when I put it on.</li>
            <li> This is cute. The instructions are easy. I bought it because I&#x27;m new to contouring. Apparently, I have natural contours and shadows on my face so my make-up always looks professional. However, I was hoping to do the thing where you shadow your nose to make it look more pronounced or whatever. This worked well enough. If you&#x27;re a dark skin chick like me, be careful not to use too much of the under-eye glimmer, as it can be over powering and loose powder won&#x27;t fix it. I learned that the hard way.</li>
            <li> I like the consistency of the product however this doesn&#x27;t give me much of a contour because of my complexion. I&#x27;m beautiful bronze in black opal</li>
            <li> Great. I really love it</li>
            <li> This contour duo is very pigmented!</li>
            <li> I am shade NW55 in Mac&#x27;s Studio Fix Fluid and the highlighter gives the perfect amount of glow that can be used in your daily routine without looking overdone. Most days I just spot conceal (LA Girl HD Concealer), dusting lightly with HD powder (Ruby Kiss Set n&#x27; Forget), apply a little mascara (MAYBELLINE Volum&#x27; Express The Falsies), a nude lipgloss (NYC Liquid Lipshine in Midtown Mocha) and use this on the high points of my cheeks, the bridge of my nose and eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the contour powder is too close to my skintone to use on my face but it is perfect for a subtle contour of my nose for events and photos.</li>
            <li> Very nice product for a beginner</li>
            <li> Nice product but the item looks darker in the picture than in person. So it was not dark enough for contouring for my skin color</li>
            <li> Do not order if darker than NW45. I am an NW40/45 and this product works for me, but could be a little darker.</li>
            <li> I love this kit so much. It&#x27;s lighter than the picture, but I&#x27;m pretty chocolate and the contour part still showed. I pair the kit with some bronzer from bath and body works and extra highlighting from benefit then use a kabuki brush from elf and it gives my skin an amazing natural glow. I recommend it especially for the price. Also If you feel like the contour isn&#x27;t dark enough, you can combine the dark color concealer stick by black radiance on your cheekbones and it&#x27;ll show even more.</li>
            <li> The color was not what I thought it was&lt;br /&gt;It was not dark like the picture</li>
            <li> great product.  I use it daily.</li>
            <li> Came in great time. Haven&#x27;t used it yet but I swatched the color and it looks good.</li>
            <li> This was recommended on someone&#x27;s blog I found as one of the top bronzer&#x27;s/contours for African-American skin. My skin color is maybe a toffee/caramel and it works perfect for me!! Definitely a new staple of mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin color is maybe a toffee caram</li>
            <li> I am no makeup artist (no matter how many YouTube videos I watch, and I have watched a lot). I find myself using this daily to define my cheekbones. I have a round face, the darker one defines, the lighter is my blush. I also like a matte finish to my makeup and since this is a powder, it does not feel nor look dry and blends nicely with my Clinique Even Better Skin foundation. I&#x27;m still playing with to define my nose, but I think this works great to define my cheeks. It looks like its going to last me a very long time too, you get a lot in the pan.</li>
            <li> Amazing contour for medium skin tones.. Not sure how dark of a complexion you can have for this product to work</li>
            <li> The color I purchased it not the color I received. Can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent for contour beginners. I&#x27;m a brown skinned woman and it worked perfectly! It&#x27;s easy to use and a lot cheaper than those other contour kits that work just as well as this one. The highlighter is beautiful as well. Good job Sleek!</li>
            <li> It could be so much Better... its like the power wears off, also it nearly shows up on my face...</li>
            <li> Contouring is so much fun with this. I received it fast , and its the best. The package is sleek , the whole compact is amazing .</li>
            <li> I love this kit. I literally use it each time I have makeup on. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it! I use the dark side as a contour. It&#x27;s dark, so I use only a little and I make sure I blend it out properly. I use the highlight side as a chin highlight, and a brow highlight. I sometimes run it down the bridge of my nose as well. It&#x27;s a pretty shimmery gold, and that looks so freaking beautiful on medium to dark skin! It also lasts a long time. I&#x27;ve been using it for months and it barely has a dent in it.. Just be sure not to drop it! I dropped mine and the contour side is in a million little pieces! :/</li>
            <li> I am a dark-skinned woman of color so the &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; was a little light for me but I still like it better than the one I bought from Sephora. When the highlight is applied on the cheek bone, the dark shade shows up better.  It&#x27;s really easy to apply and hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin yet and I have pretty sensitive skin. I&#x27;m really liking it.</li>
            <li> I have coacoa African-American skin... Been looking for a pallet to contour... This is so awesome!  It&#x27;s a great small but substantial size and the pigment is amazing... I love it... The price is wonderful too...</li>
            <li> The picture doesn&#x27;t do the dark shade justice. The color is deep deep brown and the highlight is a nice shimmery gold bronzy color. Very nice. The quality of this product is great and I am glad I was able to find a contour see for my deep complexion.</li>
            <li> The highlight was more glittery than i expected. Overall good</li>
            <li> I have been trying different techniques and materials for  contouring.  I found the quality of the product poor and staying power just ok.</li>
            <li> Cheap Bronze shimmer.  Does not look appealing n the skin. I was very disappointed, however relieved that I dint spend a lot of money on the three compacts.</li>
            <li> Amazing matte brown color, thought it would be too dark for my skin but it really wasn&#x27;t, I use this one when I go out for a more dramatic contour and then I use medium for my everyday face. Love Love Love It! Amazing color payoff.</li>
            <li> It came o  time n it was the shade I wanted everything is good , Nothing broken or old .. its great I ll order another one as soon as I feel like I am  running out.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, love the highlighter! Use c7 by MAC</li>
            <li> Received it today :) came very beautifully . It was wrapped in this nice box and even came with a mini guide on different ways you can contour . I tried it on my skin and the pigment was great! The lighting doesn&#x27;t really show how deep the brown is . Overall a great product . Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this contour kit. It has a very soft and smooth texture to it. It applies very easily and I love it . It provides a beautiful shimmer (not glittery) and a nice glow.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s so hard to find contouring kits for dark skin especially at an affordable rate. This gives a beautiful contour effect because it&#x27;s a neutral-cool darker shade of brown, you can also build up the intensity. Blends seamlessly and is long lasting. The highlighter which is a shimmery peachy gold is beautiful on brown skin tones and makes the skin looks glowy without that glittery effect.</li>
            <li> What can I say? I just LOVE this contouring kit. I&#x27;ve already tried so many different bronzers and contour palettes just trying to find the perfect match for me. Finally, I have found one that provides the look I was desiring. I have a naturally tan complexion, so a lot of the contouring kits I see truly aren&#x27;t dark enough to create appropriate shadows unless you are more fair. At first I was worried that this was going to be entirely too dark or that it would leave me looking dirty, but it&#x27;s actually perfect. A little bit goes a LONG way, so I know I&#x27;ll be holding on to this for a good while. If you want that chiseled look, this is the kit you&#x27;re going to want. As for the highlighter, it&#x27;s very pretty yet it&#x27;s not very light, so I personally brush it on top of my other highlighting product for an additional pink glow. It&#x27;s more of a blush. Though this would be far too dark for any fair to medium complexioned girl, this is great if you&#x27;re a deeper olive to dark complexioned girl.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a looking for a contouring powder for a long time. After I hit the pan in Bahama Mama , I wanted to give this I try. I have this in dark and I have a light to medium complexion. I want to warn you; the product is EXTREMELY pigmented, all you need is a gentle dip and tap off the excess. After I contour my cheeks and my temples, I use the highlighter shade as a blush to finish it all. Gives the perfect result every time.</li>
            <li> I love this powder, The contour powder doesn&#x27;t have shimmer in it so it gives a wonder bold look.  The highlight goes perfect with the contour, no need to go lighter. This gives a very natural professional look.</li>
            <li> This product came to me just as I expected it.all clean.no breaks and cracks.plus came with a little manual.i&#x27;ll highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The highlight is beautiful, but the contour is not as dark as the picture. Great product for a great price though.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SET. I ALSO HAVE THE MEDIUM COLOUR AS WELL.  LOVE IT...</li>
            <li> I have chocolately skin tone and i love to highlight and contour my face to give it that dramatic look when I go out! This product works perfectly! It is just the right color to contour my face without have too much of a dramatic effect or harsh lines and color! It is very subtle and pretty! I would recommend this product to anyone who likes to hightlight and contour.</li>
            <li> I love this set! The contour shade is nice and dark, so it actually shows up on caramel skin, and the highlight shade is the perfect golden color for a natural dewy look.</li>
            <li> Very nicely pigmented, applies smoothly and with little effort.  The highlight color is dead on and not too sparkley looks natural. The brown shadow color is just the right brown for my deep dark skin. It shows up beautifully.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying a contour kit for brown skin online, but after taking this risk, I am very pleasantly surprised. It works very well, and doesn&#x27;t look cakey or glittery like other bronzers can. I like this product a lot, and plan on buying more frm the sleek brand. I recommed to try this out for sure!</li>
            <li> I had been waiting to get my hand on this contour kits for months and when it arrived i instantly knew that it was worth the wait! If you&#x27;re thinking about purchasing this, don&#x27;t hesitate!</li>
            <li> i only use the contour side, but the highlight side makes a good eye shadow. i would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> This is my first Sleek purchase and I must say, I am very impressed. I am cappucino color and the &amp;#34;Dark&amp;#34; looks wonderful on my complexion. It came very quickly from the UK and I will be using this everyday!</li>
            <li> This product did everything it promised to do.  I have been looking for a while for a product that is dark enough to do contouring on African American skin.  I did not want to use a dark eyeshadow or a dark matted blush, I wanted a product intended to be use for cotouring.  This product is the best.</li>
            <li> This is the best contour kit around, in my humble opinion, especially for darker-skinned girls. Instantly added to my holy grail products! The dark pressed powder is very smooth and light; it&#x27;s a mattified deep mocha color. It&#x27;s also quite forgiving, meaning that it&#x27;s buildable and probably works for a wider set of skin shades than you&#x27;d expect. Like even if the medium kit would have been the best choice for your depth and tone, you can still pull off the dark kit when applying with a light hand. So if you accidentally buy a kit that&#x27;s too dark, your money won&#x27;t be wasted because you can make it work. I suspect that would be the same vice versa; if you buy a kit that&#x27;s a touch too light, you might be able to build it up enough to where it does what it&#x27;s supposed to. Very flexible product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The highlight is a gorgeous golden-coppery shimmer which, again, looks so beautiful on brown skin. You have to be a little careful with it because it&#x27;s so easy to put on too much. I love love LOVE this item and can see it being in my collection for a very long time. The seller I bought from (Lucky Girl) was so great -- very quick shipping + delivery. Took less than a week for me to receive it compared to the 3-4 week trajectory that Amazon estimated for delivery. I&#x27;m very shocked to have gotten it so soon, considering that it was shipped from the UK to the US. Don&#x27;t understand how the whole thing works, but I&#x27;m so satisfied. Would definitely recommend to friends &amp; family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I think it&#x27;s important to mention that this contour kit is significantly lighter in person than it appears in the display above. At least, this is true for the &#x27;Dark&#x27; kit; I can&#x27;t speak for the others because I did not purchase them. If you&#x27;ve got cocoa colored skin or approaching a blackish brown tone this is not the kit for you, unfortunately, so please save your money.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product, I bought sleek contour kit and I&#x27;m completely satisfied with the result and the sleek experience</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use the contour but the highlight is gorgeous. A little too shimmery but adds a really nice effect when applied down the middle of the nose.</li>
            <li> I was having issues with getting this product but I finally got my hands on it and I am IN LOVE! Great product at a reasonable price and it ships timely. Would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I loved this product. I am learning how to contour my face . the dark is very dark and the highlighter looks pink. from the picture I thought it was  bronze...&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a cute little black compact  case with instructions on how to contour your nose and cheeks....</li>
            <li> I am so excited to use this face contour kit! Please arrive before the end of this week!</li>
            <li> Good! Just not as dark as on the screen. So if you are very dark I do not suggest it</li>
            <li> Very easy to use. If you are unfamiliar with contouring, there of YouTube videos explaining how to properly use. High quality European product.</li>
            <li> I love this and the nice gold color.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I had anticipated but well worth it! Let me just say that it wasn&#x27;t supposed to arrive until mid next month and I received mine in a week! The colors are great really smooth blend-able and pigmented and the packaging was darling this is a must buy for all  MUA&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I use regularly and it&#x27;s great! I have recommended to friends and family. Have tried same product type, different company and cost more money and found both to be equal in quality.  So I am happy. Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the contour color...made my skin look ashy.  I liked the gold highlight</li>
            <li> Love it this product came so quickly!</li>
            <li> This is my go to kit for my everyday look. It&#x27;s extremely easy to apply and lost lasting. When I want a more dramatic nighttime look I usually contour/highlight with cream foundations, which is too heavy and time consuming for daytime wear. I love that it comes with a picture guide for those who are new to contouring and highlighting!</li>
            <li> I more than love this product I tried it on a whim but its EVERYTHINGGG. I am dark skinned but my lighter skinned friends use it too and they also love it. Its my miracle for contouring and adding expert depth!</li>
            <li> This is a great contour kit, I just got the wrong color. But as far as color pay off and texture it is good for the price. I wear Smashbox Studio Skin in 3.4 and this was much to dark for my skin, when I tried to contour it looked like mud. I&#x27;m going to try for the Medium kit, beacuse it really is a good product, totally worth the price and the packaging is great.</li>
            <li> Was delivered faster than I expected. I can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
            <li> Very good for Contouring</li>
            <li> GREAT CONTOURING KIT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Words really can&#x27;t  express how happy or overjoyed I am for having found this product.&lt;br /&gt;I knew contouring could help you achieve a desired look, slimming certain features by shadowing them.&lt;br /&gt;I just never knew WHAT things exactly to buy or WHERE, this is WHAT to BUY AND Amazon for me is WHERE.&lt;br /&gt;The price of this is very affordable and it last!, you don&#x27;t need that much. Go on youtube if you need more guidelines&lt;br /&gt;or demonstration, they give you a little booklet to help you out a little, just take your time and start off slow until you feel&lt;br /&gt;you&#x27;ve got the hang of using it, it&#x27;s easy and it WORKS YOU&#x27;LL SEE . If my review has helped, and I sincerely hope it has&lt;br /&gt;click yes below. Thank you. All reviewers appreciate feedback.</li>
            <li> Just got this product, and loving it so far! The shipping looked like it would take 3 weeks, but got here in one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great contour kit for dark skinned women. I&#x27;m NW 48 in MAC Studio Fix Fluid. Please keep in mind that the colors on Amazon are NOT NOT NOT true to color for the Dark Kit (probably not for any of the other options either). I knew this simply because I went to the actual website to compare the pictures. Additionally, I watched YouTube videos for this product to get an idea of the color as well. The contour color looks purple-ish in the Amazon picture, but it&#x27;s actually a dark brown in person. The highlight looks pink, but is actually a BEAUTIFUL gold color, perfect for my skin tone. The dark shade is buildable, so even if you think it&#x27;s too dark, a little goes a long way. I may try the medium just to see if it gives a different contour tone, but this will definitely be my staple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love so far! Special thanks to the provider for shipping so fast!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!!!!!!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!</li>
            <li> Good product especially if a beginner at contouring</li>
            <li> The contour is good but the highlight makes me look ashy , I&#x27;m gonna stick to my Gold Deposit mac for the highlight .. but overall its good and cheap!</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Sleek Makeup and own several of their blush palettes. They are amazing quality. I thought I would be in for a treat when I ordered this contour kit, I was wrong. I was disappointed to see how small this contour kit was. When I brushed it to the hollows of my cheeks it was lighter than I expected (I am a NW45 in Mac for reference). The highlighter is a beautiful color, that I would give 5 stars alone. The overall contour kit is not all that and I would not purchase it again. In my opinion the Black Radiance pressed powder in Rich Mahogany is a much better alternative and it is cheaper.</li>
            <li> the contour shade looks a lot darker in the picture. I ordered it b/c it looked darker than my actual skin tone. upon receipt its about the same shade as my skin tone which defeats the purpose of me using it as a contour shade. I will just have to use it on my lighter skinned clients</li>
            <li> Not bad, but it not the best.</li>
            <li> This product does not come as it appears in the picture. The bronzer is a lot lighter, and the highlight is more gold instead of the coppery color in the photo. The actual product is very pigmented, and applies very beautifully on the skin. On darker skin tones the bronzer appears kind of ashy, but is very blendable. The highlight is really the best part of the package. It gives the perfect glow to where ever you want it to go.  The packaging is very sleek and sturdy. It is perfect for travel. Just know that if you are wanting to a deep contour for dark/deep skin I don&#x27;t feel that this product provides that.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this contour kit because I can also use it as a highlighter for my eyes and also a darker color for my outer v.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this kit! Great for beginners like myself who are new to the contouring and highlighting arena! Arrived in a timely manner and is exactly as described!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to finally see this on Amazon! What a great purchase! It&#x27;s just what I wanted, it&#x27;s a completely matte brown without the red tones that Mac Blunt has. I&#x27;m an NC45 and this is the perfect shade (was confused on whether to get dark or medium but as the dark option wasn&#x27;t available then i went with medium and it was fine!) the highlighter is a peachy pink shimmer, not chunky glitter works nicely on my skin tone! Great purchase it&#x27;s also quite compact so great to travel with! This seller was awesome too! Even though shipping from the UK, I received mine very quickly.</li>
            <li> Actually the contour kit in Dark is surprisingly lighter than the picture shown. Comes with a mirror, so that&#x27;s nice, and instructions which is convenient if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing, like me. The contour is a matte neutral dark brown and the highlighter is a peachy gold which is perfect for my medium brown skin. Lastly it shipped faster than I expected; it said some time after Christmas since it was shipped from the UK, but it was here the week after I ordered it. Awesome!</li>
            <li> This is a great contour kit for darker skinned women.  I love the formulation and how it blends.  Will reorder as long as I can get it!</li>
            <li> Much lighter than picture. I&#x27;m NW50 at MAC, and this is too light for my skin tone. I&#x27;m pretty sure if I play with it, it&#x27;ll eventually be useable.. Hence the two stars.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product and was so excited to try it after seeing so many positive reviews on YouTube by dark skinned divas like myself. The contour color just wasn&#x27;t dark enough to make a noticeable impact on my skin, the gold didn&#x27;t go as smooth as I thought ur would but rather in little blotches of gold. Sighhh! So the search for an effective highlighting and contouring kit for my complexion continues.</li>
            <li> ahh mazing! I LOVE THIS its the perfect touch to your entire glam look &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Love it! I&#x27;m a brown skinned girl and this contour kit is amazing. I love the highlighter too, it looks great on my skin tone</li>
            <li> so far so good.so pigmented I love it,I was looking for a contour with more brown undertone than red and this one works weel</li>
            <li> Great for contouring &amp; also arrived perfectly packaged!</li>
            <li> Love this on my dark skin tone! It&#x27;s gives a little extra something to my everyday makeup, A Holy Grail product for me</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this sleek contouring kit!!!!! Product never came but after contacting seller they quickly shipped another one right out. Definitely a great buy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as dark as the picture shown.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American female &amp; I was so nervous to purchase because I thought it wouldn&#x27;t show up on my skin &amp; work... BUT IT DID! Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been meaning to try some Sleek products for a while and decided to start with this Contour Kit.  The price was very reasonable and my package arrived in a timely manner.  I got this kit in dark and so far am loving it.  I don&#x27;t like using grey-toned contouring powders and this kit in dark is the perfect shade for my skintone.  The highlight in the kit is also very nice but a little goes a long way!  No complaints whatsoever.</li>
            <li> just make sure to blend, and i only gave 4 because sometimes it was necessary to use a darker powder along with the contour side because it was a little less pigmented than id hoped</li>
            <li> I have not had enough time to really try the product, but I am happy with product so far. Will reorder again.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It just came in the mail today. I put it on my face and pow, it goes on so well. The color is vivid and pigmented just like it should be. I am a carmel/ honey brown complexion. Sleek is now my new brand. Thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product. Perfect shade for my skin tone! Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully on dark skin. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> It took a while for me to get it but its perfect! Not too light, not too dark. Will reorder when I run out.</li>
            <li> Im a beginner with this whole contouring thing but the more I use this kit, the more i like it. Im like a medium brown skin African American girl, So after reading some of the reviews, i was afraid the contour kit in Dark might be too dark -- and it was going on pretty dark with the brush i was using when i first got the kit-- but  now i use a fluffy kind of tapered blush brush ( from E.L.F) and now it goes on perfectly. I just recently started using the highlight too and it gives me a little glow lol  i love this kit --just buy it. For brown skin girls like myself its the best I&#x27;ve found so far! ( I was using a brown eye shadow before!) The container is SO CUTE too. Sleek. &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a contour powder for a while... wanted something that was dark enough to work but not to harsh. This works. It is a little on the red side for my shin tone but so far so good. The highlight was the best part of the purchase it has a little shimmer but not overpowering. it gives a little sparkle.</li>
            <li> The best contouring kit I have ever used.  The powder blends well, color vivid, nicely packaged with some helpful hints on ways to use the product. Arrived undamaged and ahead of schedule which was an added bonus.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice but I&#x27;ve come across better contour kits and being dark skinned Ebony Bronze by Cover Girl Queen works for me much better. This is at the bottom of my makeup bag and has been for some time. It was an unnecessary purchase on my part.</li>
            <li> I have finally found a contour shade that gives me that subtle contour look, with out my face looking to chisled.  My complexion is deep dark brown.  If your complexion is darker i&#x27;m thinking like alek weck this may not work for you.  Like another reviewer said this appears much darker on the screen than the actual product is.  The highlighter is georgeous and a little goes a long way.  I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I use it almost daily.</li>
            <li> Excellent price and product!</li>
            <li> Not as dark as pictured</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t wait to receive this :)</li>
            <li> I heard about this product on Youtube and I had to try it! I have deep brown skin  and this is a great contour for when I want a dramatic look. You have be very light-handed with the highlighter. It comes with a lot of product so it should last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I got mine in the mail today and it is completely unusable. It is shattered beyond repair. I am so disappointed. Hoping to replace it.</li>
            <li> I saw someone using this kit in an instructional make up video and decided to search for it online. It arrived swiftly and it has become a part of my daily makeup routine. Great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used Sleek before. I had been NEEDING something to contour with and found a Youtuber that raved about this product for African American women. It was perfect!!!</li>
            <li> Thought it wouldn&#x27;t be dark enough but surprisingly it was good on my skin. I&#x27;m an NC45.</li>
            <li> I just got mine in the mail and just in time to! I was on my way to a photo shoot and didn&#x27;t have anything to contour with. I&#x27;ve heard so may good things about Sleek and their pigmentation and I see why! My makeup came out flawless! The price was amazing and the shopping was fast. I will definitely be ordering an extra for myself and a couple more for family and friends!</li>
            <li> Great  blend really well best contour kit  love the goldish color blends really well will buy again indeed thank you</li>
            <li> When I viewed this item, I loved the colors and I was excited to receive this blush set. However, I received the face contour kit in dark. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Great for a beginner&#x27;s contour kit.</li>
            <li> The powder looks lighter in the pan but actually shows up quite dark on the skin (For reference I&#x27;m about an NC50 in MAC). It looks very natural on the skin and blends out easily. The highlighter is also a nice golden color that looks beautiful on.</li>
            <li> Item was not dark, was going to return it, shipment was higher than item was. Very disappointment in product, wish it was dark as it read.</li>
            <li> Being Brown skinned I had a hard time finding a dark enough powder to contour with. Love this palette and recommend it.</li>
            <li> As usual, for women of color, &amp;#34;Dark&amp;#34; really isn&#x27;t.  Would like to find a contour shading product that women of all colors can use and that includes a color that can truly be advertised as &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34;.  It can&#x27;t be that hard for a make-up company to make a product with options in a range of colors to cover the needs of all of the varying hues of skin color.</li>
            <li> I am a NW-45 in Mac Cosmetics (so you have an idea of my skin tone). I have been wearing Macs Blunt for years as a contour color although it always turns reddish on me this was my only preferred option, I have tried Iman&#x27;s Blush I forgot the name but its darker than blunt and turns reddish on me too. I bought this based on the fact that this has no red in it! This is the darkest option from sleek, what I found is on its own for me it gives a bit of a dirt color and is not as complimentary to my skin-tone as I like. The workaround to counteract this is: I 1st apply Mac&#x27;s Blunt using my old Mac contour brush and then I use my new  Real Techniques Multi Task Powder Brush ( in Love with these brushes by the way) to lightly pick up the contour color from sleek and go over the Blunt color and I love the look. Sleeks contour powder in dark takes the red out of the blunt application and leaves me with a softer brown color  with enough depth to reflect contouring. And I love It. The highlighter that comes with this set is Awesome too and I use as is. I will repurchase once I run out! :)</li>
            <li> This is worth my money i use it all the time very pigmented. However i found a cheaper product Which is Covergirl Queen Collection in Q120 $8 bucks and its is great for contouring.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve been eyeing for a couple years and finally decided to give in. The counter part of the duo looks really natural and is easy to blend in. The highlight is perfect and doesnt give too much of a highlight. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> not dark enough for dark skin girls</li>
            <li> This is a perfect contour kit for my yellow undertone brown skin! Love it!!</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS COMPACT! It is the perfect contour for my dark skin. I look gorgeous wearing it. I will be back to buy more when I hit the pan.</li>
            <li> I love this contour kit and it came fast.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting this product. It looks great when you first apply it, but it fades out within hours. It is nice overall.</li>
            <li> I love it. Easy touse and beautiful after use. I love it. Did&#x27;nt try any other product and I don&#x27;t think I want to.</li>
            <li> Good product. The highlight is really beautiful on dark skin. I am NC50 in MAC and this duo works well.</li>
            <li> Amazing I use it everyday.  I have very sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate me at all. Great product that will last me a while</li>
            <li> Beautiful product for my NW43 skin.  It arrived safe and sound in 8 days</li>
            <li> Perfect for us dark skinned girls. The contour shade is the perfect dark yet cool shade for contouring. And the highlight is great too. Sheen without the glitter.  Definite must buy. And it comes faster than the estimated shipping date.</li>
            <li> this is the 2nd time buying this product and I love using it to contour my face. and it last all day.</li>
            <li> Awesome they youtube Vids def sent me in the right direction!! It was hard finding a contour kit at a great price with Excellent results! !! I recommend</li>
