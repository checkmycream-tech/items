            <li>The projection and the sillage are also excellent, considering that it is just a \\&quot;cologne\\&quot;; not a \\&quot;perfume\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s just ok scent</li>

            <li>and it is so feminine and earthy and sexy smelling...</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I tried it</li>
            <li>JBM smells alot like Hillary Duff with Love, JLo Miami Glow, VS Amber Romance, Halle Halle &amp; Halle Orchid to me, just without any coconut or suntan references.</li>
            <li>JPM seems like a tropical version of SJP Lovely.</li>

            <li>I love the smell of the Jovan Musk.</li>
            <li>I love musk scents and was very excited about trying this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>one of my old time favorites great price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just stick with my original Jovan Musk which I love.  </li>
            <li>the smell still love the smell , it last an alwayssmell great..</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was just a nice scent.</li>
            <li>Nice, light and very much like Viktor and Rolf&#x27;s Flowerbomb.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this one away pronto to whomever I can find that will enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Smells like cheap dollar store spray.</li>
            <li>Full-sized bottle at Amazon is under $13 &amp; ships free with prime.</li>
            <li>It smells nice but is a very light fragrance that is barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying this scent it smells so elegant</li>
            <li>The packaging is cute but that&#x27;s all I have to say that&#x27;s positive.</li>
            <li>This perfume is way too strong, it gave me a headache right away.</li>
            <li>It has a sweet fruity smell, but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>This stuff doesn&#x27;t smell sweet or musky at all.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume I really wish I could find it in the stores but</li>
            <li>Not bad at all.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know what it would smell like until I received it - I&#x27;ve never seen it in stores like its more famous sister scents Jovan Musk &amp; Jovan White Musk.    </li>
            <li>It is going to be my new favorite scent.</li>
            <li>Not overly sweet, just right.</li>
            <li>The scent is sensual, dark, rich and exotic with many layers.</li>
            <li>But note that the berries aren&#x27;t exactly fresh as they would be in a fruity/floral perfume.</li>
            <li>Not a heavy or sexy fragrance.</li>
            <li>overall a nice perfume . .</li>
            <li>It isnt as gentle a scent as the White Musk or Original Musk, but it is a nice scent nonetheless.</li>
            <li>and i was right.  </li>
            <li>I think Black Musk is pleasant.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite perfumes the last couple years.</li>
            <li>I detected no berry scent just your run of the mill overly pungent masculine scented cheap perfume.</li>
            <li>Jovan White Musk is much better.</li>
            <li>Jovan white musk is way better and recommended.</li>
            <li>Original musk and the other ones smell much better.  </li>
            <li>Also, very similar to LC Bora Bora Exotic if BBE was heavier on the musk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;JBM is a cologne but wears more like an EDT to me, although the alcohol in this EDC is noticeable, especially at the opening.</li>
            <li>Very rich, deep &amp; heady, this is a sultry nighttime scent.</li>
            <li>If you like Jovan Musk in the regular scent, you&#x27;ll most likely enjoy this fragrance too.</li>
            <li>Love this scent... lasts a long time...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Initially, there was too much alcohol to detect any of the notes here.</li>
            <li>Maybe with someone else&#x27;s chemistry, it could work much</li>
            <li>Very fruity and nauseating no noticeable musk.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Also it shipped really fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a little bit more florally musky.</li>
            <li>Jovan scents are normally on point.  </li>
            <li>works with musk really well, given the low price this large bottle</li>
            <li>A new fragrance for me.</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>wish that they turned down the musk a tad bit and added some more of the sharper leather note that was present in the beginning.</li>
            <li>I bought the Black musk without trying it , and i thought that it&#x27;ll be nice like the White musk, but i found a big difference between them.</li>
            <li>I mean it smells nice right from the bottle..but give it a few minutes</li>
            <li>It is not dark and sensual it smells like rotting fruit.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too strong to be a skin scent (at least for me).</li>
            <li>i bought jovan black orcade for weman  when they first came out with</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It certainly could use a \\&quot;pick me up\\&quot; after about a couple of hours because it gets really heavy and masculine due to the musk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , Black Musk could be your everyday scent or even special occasion</li>
            <li> (I wish Jovan White Musk would wear as long!</li>
            <li> The aroma lasted throughout the day without smelling stale like so many other perfumes.</li>
            <li> It wears a long time</li>
            <li> Jovan Black Musk is a cane-sugar tropical musk that wears more expensive than it is.</li>
            <li> it was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> But about after 10 mins or so, my nose picked up pink berries with leather and musk.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected.  </li>
            <li> other words please try it before you buy it.</li>
            <li> I usually wear a White Musk</li>
            <li> From the initial spray until I finally scrubbed it off an hour later, all I smelled was a weird, rotten fruit scent.</li>
            <li> nothing bad .Normal light perfume without steering any attraction to you.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately the smell is very &#x27;off&#x27; -</li>
            <li> The berry note in this gives it a heavy (but not cloying) sort of sweetness due to the generous amount of musk they put into it.</li>
            <li> Just had a chance to try Black Musk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Never saw Jovan Black Musk thought I&#x27;d give it</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying a black musk perfume, I was skeptical at first thinking it would be the opposite of white musk and smell terrible</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bland.</li>
            <li> The fragrance could be a little stronger.  </li>
            <li> I have a [ little to none ] perfume policy at work</li>
            <li> But after a few minutes it was like....</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> JBM is very natural &amp; creamy, whereas the others are artificial &amp; plasticy on</li>
            <li> Poor quality; not worth purchasing</li>
            <li> I wish it had gone well with my chemistry, but sadly, it couldn&#x27;t have gone worse.</li>
            <li> Fail</li>
            <li> but I was wrong</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Oh my goodness, does this smell BAD on me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it just didn&#x27;t work well with my body chemistry, but this smells awful.  </li>
            <li> Horrible, just smells, like alcohol!  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> it was not what I expected. it&#x27;s just ok scent</li>
            <li> one of my old time favorites great price</li>
            <li> Just had a chance to try Black Musk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, there was too much alcohol to detect any of the notes here. But about after 10 mins or so, my nose picked up pink berries with leather and musk. The berries and the musk are equally present here. But note that the berries aren&#x27;t exactly fresh as they would be in a fruity/floral perfume. The berry note in this gives it a heavy (but not cloying) sort of sweetness due to the generous amount of musk they put into it. After about an hour, the berries and the musk settled on my skin equally strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could this be a skin scent? I think not. It&#x27;s too strong to be a skin scent (at least for me). Maybe with someone else&#x27;s chemistry, it could work much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish that they turned down the musk a tad bit and added some more of the sharper leather note that was present in the beginning. It certainly could use a \\&quot;pick me up\\&quot; after about a couple of hours because it gets really heavy and masculine due to the musk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, that being said, for the price, you&#x27;d be getting a cologne with the staying power of any good perfume in the market. The projection and the sillage are also excellent, considering that it is just a \\&quot;cologne\\&quot;; not a \\&quot;perfume\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like berries and your skin works with musk really well, given the low price this large bottle, Black Musk could be your everyday scent or even special occasion companion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sexy, berry-laced musk... Not bad at all.</li>
            <li> It smells nice but is a very light fragrance that is barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I love musk scents and was very excited about trying this fragrance.  Maybe it just didn&#x27;t work well with my body chemistry, but this smells awful.  It is not dark and sensual it smells like rotting fruit.  What a disappointment.  I realize this is an inexpensive scent but if you are considering it you might want to try a spray from a sample bottle at the store before purchasing.  My $12.00 bottle is now in the bottom of the garbage can.  I&#x27;ll just stick with my original Jovan Musk which I love.  In my opinion Jovan should have just skipped this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words please try it before you buy it.</li>
            <li> Never tried this perfume before.I love the warm smell of musk .The sent stays with me all day.</li>
            <li> Nice, light and very much like Viktor and Rolf&#x27;s Flowerbomb. I think Black Musk is pleasant. Not a heavy or sexy fragrance.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this.  It has a sweet fruity smell, but not overpowering.  The aroma lasted throughout the day without smelling stale like so many other perfumes.</li>
            <li> Very rich, deep &amp; heady, this is a sultry nighttime scent. I didn&#x27;t know what it would smell like until I received it - I&#x27;ve never seen it in stores like its more famous sister scents Jovan Musk &amp; Jovan White Musk.    It wears a long time (I wish Jovan White Musk would wear as long! that stuff doesn&#x27;t last at all) but unfortunately the smell is very &#x27;off&#x27; - like someone else said, it smells of rotting berries.     Gave this spray away.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance!  I usually wear a White Musk and well i thought that I&#x27;d give this one a try.  I figured that it would be a bit more on the Seductive side and i was right.  Love It!</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness, does this smell BAD on me! From reading the reviews of others, this must be a very nice scent for some people. I thought musk + floral &#x3D; heaven. I wish it had gone well with my chemistry, but sadly, it couldn&#x27;t have gone worse. From the initial spray until I finally scrubbed it off an hour later, all I smelled was a weird, rotten fruit scent. Sadness. I&#x27;m giving this one away pronto to whomever I can find that will enjoy it.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes the last couple years. The scent is sensual, dark, rich and exotic with many layers. Not overly sweet, just right.</li>
            <li> Intoxicating scent changes with your body chemisty.I could not find this perfume in any local store. It is going to be my new favorite scent.</li>
            <li> I purchased a 2 0z bottle recently. This stuff doesn&#x27;t smell sweet or musky at all. The packaging is cute but that&#x27;s all I have to say that&#x27;s positive. This perfume is way too strong, it gave me a headache right away. I detected no berry scent just your run of the mill overly pungent masculine scented cheap perfume. Jovan White Musk is much better.</li>
            <li> It is Jovan Musk..If you like the smell .. nothing bad .Normal light perfume without steering any attraction to you.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was just a nice scent.But after a few minutes it was like....wow! this smells awesome! I love how this new  musk combination works together with my own skin and changes its scent!! I mean it smells nice right from the bottle..but give it a few minutes and it is so feminine and earthy and sexy smelling...I  really love this!!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful fragrance it has a clean and fresh smell and is not over-powering or strong in nature.</li>
            <li> Never saw Jovan Black Musk thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is similar to the regular Jovan musk but has&lt;br /&gt;a slightly different scent. Got a good price.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected.  I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product.  Jovan scents are normally on point.  This one missed the mark! Poor quality; not worth purchasing</li>
            <li> A new fragrance for me. Smells nice..need to try longer to make decision.  Item was shipped very quickly and very good price.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying this scent it smells so elegant and I am so glad I tried it, I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Jovan white musk is way better and recommended. I bought the Black musk without trying it , and i thought that it&#x27;ll be nice like the White musk, but i found a big difference between them.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume I really wish I could find it in the stores but thank God Amazon is out there Or I would never be able to get my perfume!</li>
            <li> Smells like cheap dollar store spray. Very fruity and nauseating no noticeable musk. Waste of money. Original musk and the other ones smell much better.  Fail</li>
            <li> Jovan Black Musk is a cane-sugar tropical musk that wears more expensive than it is. JBM smells alot like Hillary Duff with Love, JLo Miami Glow, VS Amber Romance, Halle Halle &amp; Halle Orchid to me, just without any coconut or suntan references. If you like any of those, you&#x27;ll probably like this. Ironically, I prefer JBM over any of those! JBM is very natural &amp; creamy, whereas the others are artificial &amp; plasticy on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are not any listed notes, but I&#x27;m getting orchid, hibiscus, mango, berries, vanilla, amber, sandalwood, and musk. JPM seems like a tropical version of SJP Lovely. Also, very similar to LC Bora Bora Exotic if BBE was heavier on the musk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JBM is a cologne but wears more like an EDT to me, although the alcohol in this EDC is noticeable, especially at the opening. Still, at $10-$15 it&#x27;s a steal. Full-sized bottle at Amazon is under $13 &amp; ships free with prime.</li>
            <li> a gift for mother. She loves it.</li>
            <li> The fragrance could be a little stronger.  It&#x27;s a little bland.</li>
            <li> i bought jovan black orcade for weman  when they first came out with it loved the smell still love the smell , it last an alwayssmell great..please dont stop making it it is wonderful,thanks im so happy i found it on here.i recondemend it to all, try it you will love it to.</li>
            <li> Very good product fragrance is outstanding wife like this also</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying a black musk perfume, I was skeptical at first thinking it would be the opposite of white musk and smell terrible but I was wrong it smells great. I have a [ little to none ] perfume policy at work but this works and the smell doesn&#x27;t make you choke. Also it shipped really fast.</li>
            <li> Horrible, just smells, like alcohol!  What a rip off!  Must get it from China,  All of the musk products, smell like Alcohol! Rip OFF</li>
            <li> There was delay in shipping . .but overall a nice perfume . .</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my mom as a Christmas gift. She loves the fragrance. It isnt as gentle a scent as the White Musk or Original Musk, but it is a nice scent nonetheless.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the Jovan Musk. If you like Jovan Musk in the regular scent, you&#x27;ll most likely enjoy this fragrance too. It&#x27;s just a little bit more florally musky.</li>
            <li> Love this scent... lasts a long time...</li>
