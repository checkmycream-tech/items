            <li>This wand is so easy to use, that I know feel like a pro!</li>
            <li>(it was so easy!)</li>
            <li>I despise curling my hair but this wand makes it so easy!  </li>
            <li>Most curling irons won&#x27;t hold a curl in my hair, this gives me flawless curls that are fast and easy.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what I wanted and I am very pleased!</li>
            <li>When I first started using it, the heat worked great</li>
            <li>it gets very hot!!</li>
            <li>but I have to say I am very satisfied, and the shipping came right when I was expecting it!</li>
            <li>Perfect for smaller tighter curls.</li>
            <li>No need to spend more.</li>
            <li>It does have a plastic piece at the top of rod which is not featured in photo.</li>
            <li>It gives the perfect waves &amp; they last in my hair all day.</li>
            <li>Glad I took the dive, there were cheaper alternatives</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t hold curls for more than a couple hours.</li>
            <li>I love my curly look, my dude likes it too, he says my curls are sexy, ooh-la-la.</li>
            <li>I love this curler.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more.</li>
            <li>Love the size of this</li>
            <li>and I love that it came with the glove.</li>
            <li>they give more like a beachy waves look</li>
            <li>so I ended up with too many &amp;#34;springs&amp;#34; bouncing around ala Shirley Temple.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for a better one elsewhere.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on the market for a better one-</li>
            <li>but I am so satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>and you can make many different kind of curls!!!</li>
            <li>I like some what of it, I LOVE how it came on time and FAST!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I also have the matching blow dryer which I love.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li>I like it but could b better</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>This was a perfect gift for my teenage niece.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I just need more practice with it.</li>
            <li>I did love it until it stopped working.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do what it is suppose to but it works for the most part.</li>
            <li>Love this iron</li>
            <li>It works great and curls really well.</li>
            <li>Perfect curls pretty much every time!</li>
            <li>Love it :)</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>So I ended up buying a different curling iron with a clip and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I call it my magic wand.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this curling iron.</li>
            <li>Needs a better glove though and watch out for the counter top burns and burning hair.</li>
            <li>So I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li>Love the glove because without it I would&#x27;ve burned the heck out of my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>I like the plastic thing in the top cause</li>
            <li>It really works great</li>
            <li>I am so glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li>I immediately fell in in love with it and decided to purchase one for myself.  </li>
            <li>I love this wand.</li>
            <li>It works great and shipping was fast</li>
            <li>Product is just OK.  </li>
            <li>I have never been able to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier:)</li>
            <li>love worked well.  </li>
            <li>I had a smaller one before, and I feel like this one is the perfect size.</li>
            <li>Very nice quality and works very well.  </li>
            <li>It is way hot!!!</li>
            <li>Was very excited to receive this iron</li>
            <li>I believe it only has one heat setting, though (if it has more than one, the dial must not be easy to find), but it is perfect!</li>
            <li>It creates the perfect curl for my long hair.</li>
            <li>It warms up quick and works amazing.</li>
            <li>Pretty cool, works great...</li>
            <li>This makes great curls that literally last for days, and the glove comes in really handy.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a good curling wand for a good price</li>
            <li>Easy to use, makes me look great in minutes, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The wand heats up super fast and gives beautiful bouncy curls.</li>
            <li>but it does come in handy because this hair wand gets extremely hot!,</li>
            <li>Amazing worth every penny</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have to practice with this to find the way to hold it that feels most comfortable to you.</li>
            <li>so I really burnt my self and the glove isn&#x27;t to good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing hair for 10 years and it took me a good week to really get the hang of it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing hair for 10 years and it took me a good week to really get the hang of it</li>

            <li>Very fun for girls looking to be creative with their hair.</li>
            <li>This product is so easy to use and makes my hair look great and natural.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>My first ever curling wand and glad I choose this one!</li>
            <li>Super easy to use!  </li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>So easy to use</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy for me.</li>
            <li>How can people say it&#x27;s easy to use?  </li>
            <li>It would be too easy to burn yourself or your clothes without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments on my curls since its purchase.</li>
            <li>so the chord wraps up easily.</li>
            <li>The glove works fine.</li>
            <li>Light weight and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>For tight curls, this curling iron is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I love that they are lose at the top and tight at the bottom or gives me great curls</li>
            <li>This is the first time in my life I&#x27;ve been able to get natural looking curls successfully</li>
            <li>Overall a great curler</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and curls look nice and bouncy.</li>
            <li>Makes great curls, takes a time or 2 to get used to using it and DEFINITELY use the glove.</li>
            <li>Great curls that last!</li>
            <li>its ok you have to waitblike 10 seconds or so for the curl to come out right</li>
            <li>Hot as heck!!</li>
            <li>I found the glove very useful and protective.  </li>
            <li>With a little practice can create so really cool styles - shoulder length or longer hair is best with this iron.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so quick and easy.</li>
            <li>If anyone has a recommendation for a curling wand they can&#x27;t live without I&#x27;d love to hear it!</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t get overly excited about the glove.</li>
            <li>This curling wand stays hot and gets the job much more efficiently.</li>
            <li>The curls come out beautiful and stay in longer than expected.</li>
            <li>Works great with long hair and</li>
            <li>Lets just say I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>This curling wand works amazingly, the only reason I didn&#x27;t give five stars is because the heat protective glove feels very cheap and scratchy.</li>
            <li>I love this wand because all the curls are the same and they look really nice.</li>
            <li>But with this wand, it heats up fast and is very easy and quick.</li>
            <li>It heats up pretty quick so watch yourself and make sure you don&#x27;t get burned.</li>
            <li>but it works just as good with short hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for short hair</li>
            <li>Loved the results especially for it being my 1st time using it in her.</li>
            <li>The glove it comes with is cool too</li>
            <li>This was so easy to use, made amazing curls in just a short amount of time and the design is so convenient.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s good, the less time you have to hold your hair there the better.</li>

            <li>It works very well - heats up very quickly and reaches VERY hot temperatures for quick curling.</li>
            <li>Just beware because it does get super hot!</li>
            <li>good result to my hair even too hot for the heat to my left wrist skin..</li>
            <li>I have super straight, short chin length hair and it holds the curl fairly well with product.</li>
            <li>I do wish the glove was a little bit thicker though because you can still end up burning your hand, but it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use, heats up fast (EXTREMELY HOT</li>
            <li>It creates nice curls that last without sing hairspray.</li>
            <li>It is durable and heat is powerful</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice look, actually, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re expecting.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth my money.</li>
            <li>The burns are worth it</li>
            <li>it is nice that it is tapered for those of us with short hair.</li>
            <li>this had my curls lasting all day and when I woke up I still had nice waves in my hair like I had slept in braids...</li>
            <li>Kind of wish I got a smaller rod.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It gets super hot</li>
            <li>It gets super hot and theres no temperature control.</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised with how easy and quick it is.</li>
            <li>Glove on the right hand if you&#x27;re curling the right side of your hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m right handed</li>
            <li>I curl large chunks and let it cool 10</li>
            <li>I decided to invest a little more in one and came across the Bed Head Curli Pops and so far so good.  </li>
            <li>Super affordable for such cute curls.</li>
            <li>I love the little kick stand that you can use to place the machine down when its hot and the glove it great for easy handling.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and curls quickly.  </li>
            <li>Great price too, would definitely order the larger size if they have it!</li>
            <li>It heats up super fast and is lightweight.</li>
            <li>This curling iron works as great as more expensive models.</li>
            <li>It curls my hair so fast and the curls look amazing and last all day!</li>
            <li>This is a lot better than her other curlers and especially with her long hair, this works perfectly!</li>
            <li>My hair does not slide off the wand and my curls stay in tact all day long, very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s super easy to use and the curl lasts all day and into the next day.</li>
            <li>The loose curls look fantastic and are surprisingly easy to do</li>
            <li>The only thing that would make it better is if it had an automatic shut off after 60 minutes or so.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length straight hair that rarely holds a curl.</li>
            <li>This is the first curling wand I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend purchasing this item.:)</li>
            <li>My only word of advice would be to use caution and not to rush in order to avoid accidentally burning yourself :)</li>
            <li>Does not get hot at all</li>
            <li>Though when you first use this product, you should wear the glove.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly how it was described.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>exactly how well I&#x27;d do with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took</li>
            <li>about 40 minutes the first time I tried it, then 30 then 25.  </li>
            <li>Within the first 5 minutes of using, I burnt my finger and it is continuing to blister...</li>
            <li>when I purchased it, I had no idea it could be used to make so many different looks.</li>
            <li>when I travel, I only need to pack 1 item: this curling wand. :)</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend! :)</li>
            <li>This gives great curls and volume when placed correctly, and what&#x27;s better is they only fall a little looser throughout the day instead of completely disappearing.</li>
            <li>i can make curls on other people just not on my own.</li>
            <li>The wand itself heats up pretty quickly and the glove definitely comes in handy; especially for</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this wand to anyone who wants fast easy curls!</li>
            <li>Thanks very much for your help with this product.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very straight and never holds a curl but using this wand my curls hold very well.</li>
            <li>Gets really hot really fast.</li>
            <li>However I don&#x27;t really car for this hot glove.</li>
            <li>Makes really cute curls that hold for a long time!</li>
            <li>This thing heats up very quickly (id say about 2-3 minutes to get to maybe 250-300 degrees) and there is no personal heat setting for this.</li>
            <li>LOVE the hot pink.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has long thick hair and this was perfect for curling it.good product would buy again.</li>
            <li>I strongly encourage watching the video on how to use it to make all the different hairstyles.</li>
            <li>(even hairstylists have trouble getting curls to stay) but this thing is like magical!</li>
            <li>When I get to the front top section (of the right side), I hold my arm over my head so the narrower part of the iron is facing down.</li>
            <li>Love it, gets hot so be careful!</li>
            <li>I have short, fine, straight hair</li>
            <li>I use my other hot glove from a different curling wand I bought that broke since it&#x27;s a lot softer and more comfortable.</li>
            <li>This works amazingly, the curls last me the entire day.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care much for this hair wand.</li>
            <li>I Really like this item.</li>
            <li>hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl very well</li>
            <li>My hair is silky straight</li>
            <li>I actually spent more time creating curls than sporting them.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know what I did before I owned this.</li>
            <li>But this tool is reasonably priced and it works wonders</li>
            <li>After learning how much hair to swivel around the iron, I really like this.</li>
            <li>shipping was fast and on time.</li>
            <li>I like the pink better than the others but</li>
            <li>Havent used much but will once my hair gets longer.</li>
            <li>Works really when the two times Ive used it.</li>
            <li>It works fast and it works</li>
            <li>Curl fast.</li>
            <li>Although the glove is somewhat scratchy and cheap, the outcome of my hair totally makes up for it</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>So if you let it set too much in a curl, it will be very curly when you brush it out.</li>
            <li>I hope everyone likes it as much as I do.</li>

            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>but otherwise it works really well.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>but no prob it was myfoult,need to be more careful..</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Really like this for the price.</li>
            <li>Better than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>I dont really have any cons about the product.</li>
            <li>I really like how the chord has velcro on it</li>
            <li>it is a good product but not for everyone, at least not for me.</li>
            <li>, the curls are more natural, I feel like it is easier to use then a regular curling iron</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the glove with this wand even though it is super hot, I have tiny petite hands</li>
            <li>So sad so good very soft on your hair makes curls easy to do</li>
            <li>This is my second iron I&#x27;ve purchased from the Bed Head line (the first being the blue Wave Artist) and they both bust out just what is promised without much effort, and it helps they don&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg on top of that.</li>
            <li>heats up fast, continuous high heat.  </li>
            <li>It heats up really fast and is never hard to use.</li>
            <li>I have gone through so many curling irons in my lifetime and my biggest problem is that my curls won&#x27;t hold (I have long, healthy, thick straight hair).</li>
            <li>think i can get a better curling wand for less money.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly like the glove</li>
            <li>It definitely has a better rsults than a standard curling iron with clamp.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because it is a decent curling wand.</li>
            <li>It took me a little bit to get the hang of it, but pretty easy once you do.</li>
            <li>I had a wand that makes your curls looser at the top and tighter at the bottom, but my curls looked too tight.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It just felt very cheap and was too much trouble.  </li>
            <li>Takes a little practice to be able to not use the glove</li>
            <li>Gets hot and holds as curl on my fine, long blonde hair.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not positive how it would work for lefties, but I think it will be fine.</li>
            <li>Really appreciate your time effort and energy for a seamless transaction.</li>
            <li>but you cant change the heat settings so that kind of sucks</li>
            <li>Definitely something you have to learn to do but all in all worth the time of doing it.</li>
            <li>I have wavy long thick hair and it curls perfectly and lasts long.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to take as small of a subsection when curling because it gets very hot and that helps curl it better, faster, and last longer.</li>
            <li>I mean its a nice curling iron</li>
            <li>Since the barrel heats up very hot, I only have to hold it for a few seconds in my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It did take me a few tries to figure out the best way to use it on myself but it has cut my styling time in half.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast I was able to curl my entire head in less than 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about how effective it would be since it was so cheap and since my hair is very fine and thin</li>
            <li>The glove is basically useless, but the iron is amazing!</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to even curl my hair.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li>It may be that the wand just isn&#x27;t getting hot enough?</li>
            <li>I have tried a million times to curl my hair and I have come to the conclusion that I am just not good at doing my own hair.  </li>
            <li>I mostly enjoy that it goes from thick to thin, it works great for my thin/fine hair</li>
            <li>I do not usually curl my hair often</li>
            <li>It seems to get quite hot (but definitely doesn&#x27;t burn my hair).&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the first one I tried and the last!</li>
            <li>Gets really hot, I wish there were actually HEAT settings</li>
            <li>My first one was the remington pearl but the only problem with that</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The fact that there&#x27;s no bar to hold down the hair, just a smooth front, means my hair isn&#x27;t getting tangled and stuck in the machine, hence no breakage.</li>
            <li>This item gets very HOT be careful when using it.</li>
            <li>I would not mind getting my money back and get a better one for less money.</li>
            <li>, I am excited for this purchase to last just as long.</li>
            <li>The glove is not very thick, so if you hold the wand directly, you will still get burnt.</li>
            <li>feel like it&#x27;s a pretty average product overall and probably pretty decent for the price.</li>
            <li>It lasts days and is a great way to perk up dirty hair.</li>
            <li>and I get compliments frequently</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It takes me what I consider a pretty long time to accomplish (about 40 mins).</li>
            <li>just got it 2 days ago and my 9yr old daughter wanted some curls.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 14 year old niece.  </li>
            <li>It ships extremely fast for standard shipping.</li>
            <li>and then straight for the last inch.  </li>
            <li>But it was only $18, so I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li>Gets the whole head done in a short period of time.</li>
            <li>My daughter has a really expensive iron and this is every bit as good as hers at a fraction of the price</li>
            <li>gripe that I have is that my hair looked pretty dry and brittle after using this - solved the problem by purchasing a shine spray.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no heat setting, so I&#x27;m not sure exactly how hot it&#x27;s getting (and it&#x27;s not listed on the product, in terms of degrees)</li>
            <li>I have long silky straight hair</li>
            <li>Just be careful not to burn yourself because the wand does get really hot.</li>
            <li>It is seriously user friendly!</li>
            <li>It actually takes half as long to curl my hair with this than a traditional spring iron, and it gives me way more volume than a spring iron.</li>
            <li>wrapped too long anyhow as you will damage your hair from the high heat).</li>
            <li>I have to hold each lock on the wand for a long while, and I&#x27;m definitely not doing too much at once.</li>
            <li>Barely touch and you get a blister.</li>
            <li>The glove is necessary if you want to curl anywhere near the ends of your hair - and who doesn&#x27;t? -</li>
            <li>I have really thick, really long hair, and if I ever hot roll it, it falls out right away.  </li>
            <li>On the high setting the waves were too tight for my taste and on the low setting it didn&#x27;t take very well.</li>
            <li>It does take a few strands of hair before you master the right technique of holding the barrel.</li>
            <li>I would much prefer the other ones that have a bar over the cylinder.  </li>
            <li>but it was worth paying a few dollars extra.</li>
            <li>My only gribe would be that I wish it came in a wider version since I want larger curls not tight ones.</li>
            <li>a little warm, not nearly warm enough to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>At first the sections were too narrow</li>
            <li>Previous equipment would not give me curls that lasted no matter what i did or how much hairspray i used.</li>
            <li>The video showed me that I was supposed to be holding the very tip of my hair slightly out from the wand, so I no longer burn myself when using this.</li>
            <li>Mine are pretty limp by five o&#x27; clock and definitely don&#x27;t make it through the night.</li>
            <li>The first few times I used it, I burnt my hand multiple times.</li>
            <li>I am considering upgrading to a wand with a heat setting in the future because this one gets a little too hot for my hair and only has an on/off switch.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The curls do last much longer than my previous, metal curling iron.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Split your hair into 4 quadrants: straight down the middle, then the one section on each side above the ears.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and thin.</li>
            <li>It curled my hair fine, but I am giving it 4 stars because the heat is extremely unnecessary.</li>
            <li>Next time I would opt for temp control since my hair is fine &amp; thin.</li>

            <li> Very easy to use and the glove prevents burns</li>
            <li> This is by far the best curling wand I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> By far the best Curling Rod i have ever used!</li>
            <li> This wand is so easy to use, that I know feel like a pro!</li>
            <li> (it was so easy!)</li>
            <li> I despise curling my hair but this wand makes it so easy!  </li>
            <li> Most curling irons won&#x27;t hold a curl in my hair, this gives me flawless curls that are fast and easy.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I wanted and I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> When I first started using it, the heat worked great</li>
            <li> it gets very hot!!</li>
            <li> but I have to say I am very satisfied, and the shipping came right when I was expecting it!</li>
            <li> Perfect for smaller tighter curls.</li>
            <li> No need to spend more.</li>
            <li> It does have a plastic piece at the top of rod which is not featured in photo.</li>
            <li> It gives the perfect waves &amp; they last in my hair all day.</li>
            <li> Glad I took the dive, there were cheaper alternatives</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t hold curls for more than a couple hours.</li>
            <li> I love my curly look, my dude likes it too, he says my curls are sexy, ooh-la-la.</li>
            <li> I love this curler.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more.</li>
            <li> Love the size of this</li>
            <li> and I love that it came with the glove.</li>
            <li> they give more like a beachy waves look</li>
            <li> so I ended up with too many &amp;#34;springs&amp;#34; bouncing around ala Shirley Temple.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for a better one elsewhere.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the market for a better one-</li>
            <li> but I am so satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> and you can make many different kind of curls!!!</li>
            <li> I like some what of it, I LOVE how it came on time and FAST!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also have the matching blow dryer which I love.</li>
            <li> I love Bed Head products I have a blow dryer thats lasted 6 years</li>
            <li> LOVE it.</li>

            <li> I have gotten so many compliments on my hair since I started using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li> I like it but could b better</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> This was a perfect gift for my teenage niece.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I just need more practice with it.</li>
            <li> I did love it until it stopped working.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do what it is suppose to but it works for the most part.</li>
            <li> Love this iron</li>
            <li> It works great and curls really well.</li>
            <li> Perfect curls pretty much every time!</li>
            <li> Love it :)</li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> So I ended up buying a different curling iron with a clip and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I call it my magic wand.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this curling iron.</li>
            <li> Needs a better glove though and watch out for the counter top burns and burning hair.</li>
            <li> So I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li> Love the glove because without it I would&#x27;ve burned the heck out of my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> I like the plastic thing in the top cause</li>
            <li> It really works great</li>
            <li> I am so glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> I immediately fell in in love with it and decided to purchase one for myself.  </li>
            <li> I love this wand.</li>
            <li> It works great and shipping was fast</li>
            <li> Product is just OK.  </li>
            <li> I have never been able to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier:)</li>
            <li> love worked well.  </li>

            <li> Very nice quality and works very well.  </li>
            <li> It is way hot!!!</li>
            <li> Was very excited to receive this iron</li>
            <li> I believe it only has one heat setting, though (if it has more than one, the dial must not be easy to find), but it is perfect!</li>
            <li> It creates the perfect curl for my long hair.</li>
            <li> It warms up quick and works amazing.</li>
            <li> Pretty cool, works great...</li>
            <li> This makes great curls that literally last for days, and the glove comes in really handy.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a good curling wand for a good price</li>
            <li> Easy to use, makes me look great in minutes, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The wand heats up super fast and gives beautiful bouncy curls.</li>
            <li> but it does come in handy because this hair wand gets extremely hot!,</li>
            <li> Amazing worth every penny</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have to practice with this to find the way to hold it that feels most comfortable to you.</li>
            <li> so I really burnt my self and the glove isn&#x27;t to good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing hair for 10 years and it took me a good week to really get the hang of it</li>

            <li> So easy to use</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy for me.</li>
            <li> How can people say it&#x27;s easy to use?  </li>
            <li> It would be too easy to burn yourself or your clothes without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments on my curls since its purchase.</li>

            <li> I found the glove very useful and protective.  </li>

            <li> it&#x27;s so quick and easy.</li>
            <li> If anyone has a recommendation for a curling wand they can&#x27;t live without I&#x27;d love to hear it!</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t get overly excited about the glove.</li>

            <li> Works great with long hair and</li>
            <li> Lets just say I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> This curling wand works amazingly, the only reason I didn&#x27;t give five stars is because the heat protective glove feels very cheap and scratchy.</li>
            <li> I love this wand because all the curls are the same and they look really nice.</li>
            <li> But with this wand, it heats up fast and is very easy and quick.</li>
            <li> It heats up pretty quick so watch yourself and make sure you don&#x27;t get burned.</li>
            <li> but it works just as good with short hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for short hair</li>
            <li> Loved the results especially for it being my 1st time using it in her.</li>
            <li> The glove it comes with is cool too</li>
            <li> This was so easy to use, made amazing curls in just a short amount of time and the design is so convenient.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s good, the less time you have to hold your hair there the better.</li>

            <li> It works very well - heats up very quickly and reaches VERY hot temperatures for quick curling.</li>
            <li> Just beware because it does get super hot!</li>
            <li> good result to my hair even too hot for the heat to my left wrist skin..</li>
            <li> I have super straight, short chin length hair and it holds the curl fairly well with product.</li>
            <li> I do wish the glove was a little bit thicker though because you can still end up burning your hand, but it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use, heats up fast (EXTREMELY HOT</li>
            <li> It creates nice curls that last without sing hairspray.</li>
            <li> It is durable and heat is powerful</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice look, actually, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re expecting.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth my money.</li>
            <li> The burns are worth it</li>
            <li> it is nice that it is tapered for those of us with short hair.</li>
            <li> this had my curls lasting all day and when I woke up I still had nice waves in my hair like I had slept in braids...</li>
            <li> Kind of wish I got a smaller rod.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It gets super hot</li>
            <li> It gets super hot and theres no temperature control.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised with how easy and quick it is.</li>
            <li> Glove on the right hand if you&#x27;re curling the right side of your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m right handed</li>
            <li> I curl large chunks and let it cool 10</li>
            <li> I decided to invest a little more in one and came across the Bed Head Curli Pops and so far so good.  </li>
            <li> Super affordable for such cute curls.</li>
            <li> I love the little kick stand that you can use to place the machine down when its hot and the glove it great for easy handling.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and curls quickly.  </li>
            <li> Great price too, would definitely order the larger size if they have it!</li>
            <li> It heats up super fast and is lightweight.</li>
            <li> This curling iron works as great as more expensive models.</li>
            <li> It curls my hair so fast and the curls look amazing and last all day!</li>
            <li> This is a lot better than her other curlers and especially with her long hair, this works perfectly!</li>
            <li> My hair does not slide off the wand and my curls stay in tact all day long, very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s super easy to use and the curl lasts all day and into the next day.</li>
            <li> The loose curls look fantastic and are surprisingly easy to do</li>
            <li> The only thing that would make it better is if it had an automatic shut off after 60 minutes or so.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length straight hair that rarely holds a curl.</li>
            <li> This is the first curling wand I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend purchasing this item.:)</li>
            <li> My only word of advice would be to use caution and not to rush in order to avoid accidentally burning yourself :)</li>
            <li> Does not get hot at all</li>
            <li> Though when you first use this product, you should wear the glove.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly how it was described.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> exactly how well I&#x27;d do with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took</li>
            <li> about 40 minutes the first time I tried it, then 30 then 25.  </li>
            <li> Within the first 5 minutes of using, I burnt my finger and it is continuing to blister...</li>
            <li> when I purchased it, I had no idea it could be used to make so many different looks.</li>
            <li> when I travel, I only need to pack 1 item: this curling wand. :)</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend! :)</li>
            <li> This gives great curls and volume when placed correctly, and what&#x27;s better is they only fall a little looser throughout the day instead of completely disappearing.</li>
            <li> i can make curls on other people just not on my own.</li>
            <li> The wand itself heats up pretty quickly and the glove definitely comes in handy; especially for</li>

            <li> My hair is very straight and never holds a curl but using this wand my curls hold very well.</li>
            <li> Gets really hot really fast.</li>
            <li> However I don&#x27;t really car for this hot glove.</li>
            <li> Makes really cute curls that hold for a long time!</li>
            <li> This thing heats up very quickly (id say about 2-3 minutes to get to maybe 250-300 degrees) and there is no personal heat setting for this.</li>
            <li> LOVE the hot pink.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has long thick hair and this was perfect for curling it.good product would buy again.</li>
            <li> I strongly encourage watching the video on how to use it to make all the different hairstyles.</li>
            <li> (even hairstylists have trouble getting curls to stay) but this thing is like magical!</li>
            <li> When I get to the front top section (of the right side), I hold my arm over my head so the narrower part of the iron is facing down.</li>
            <li> Love it, gets hot so be careful!</li>
            <li> I have short, fine, straight hair</li>
            <li> I use my other hot glove from a different curling wand I bought that broke since it&#x27;s a lot softer and more comfortable.</li>
            <li> This works amazingly, the curls last me the entire day.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care much for this hair wand.</li>
            <li> I Really like this item.</li>
            <li> hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl very well</li>
            <li> My hair is silky straight</li>
            <li> I actually spent more time creating curls than sporting them.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what I did before I owned this.</li>
            <li> But this tool is reasonably priced and it works wonders</li>
            <li> After learning how much hair to swivel around the iron, I really like this.</li>
            <li> shipping was fast and on time.</li>
            <li> I like the pink better than the others but</li>
            <li> Havent used much but will once my hair gets longer.</li>
            <li> Works really when the two times Ive used it.</li>
            <li> It works fast and it works</li>
            <li> Curl fast.</li>
            <li> Although the glove is somewhat scratchy and cheap, the outcome of my hair totally makes up for it</li>
            <li> highly recommend!</li>
            <li> So if you let it set too much in a curl, it will be very curly when you brush it out.</li>
            <li> I hope everyone likes it as much as I do.</li>

            <li> Works really well.  </li>
            <li> but otherwise it works really well.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> but no prob it was myfoult,need to be more careful..</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> Really like this for the price.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I dont really have any cons about the product.</li>
            <li> I really like how the chord has velcro on it</li>
            <li> it is a good product but not for everyone, at least not for me.</li>
            <li> , the curls are more natural, I feel like it is easier to use then a regular curling iron</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the glove with this wand even though it is super hot, I have tiny petite hands</li>
            <li> So sad so good very soft on your hair makes curls easy to do</li>
            <li> This is my second iron I&#x27;ve purchased from the Bed Head line (the first being the blue Wave Artist) and they both bust out just what is promised without much effort, and it helps they don&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg on top of that.</li>
            <li> heats up fast, continuous high heat.  </li>
            <li> It heats up really fast and is never hard to use.</li>
            <li> I have gone through so many curling irons in my lifetime and my biggest problem is that my curls won&#x27;t hold (I have long, healthy, thick straight hair).</li>
            <li> think i can get a better curling wand for less money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly like the glove</li>
            <li> It definitely has a better rsults than a standard curling iron with clamp.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because it is a decent curling wand.</li>
            <li> It took me a little bit to get the hang of it, but pretty easy once you do.</li>
            <li> I had a wand that makes your curls looser at the top and tighter at the bottom, but my curls looked too tight.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It just felt very cheap and was too much trouble.  </li>
            <li> Takes a little practice to be able to not use the glove</li>
            <li> Gets hot and holds as curl on my fine, long blonde hair.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not positive how it would work for lefties, but I think it will be fine.</li>
            <li> Really appreciate your time effort and energy for a seamless transaction.</li>
            <li> but you cant change the heat settings so that kind of sucks</li>
            <li> Definitely something you have to learn to do but all in all worth the time of doing it.</li>
            <li> I have wavy long thick hair and it curls perfectly and lasts long.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to take as small of a subsection when curling because it gets very hot and that helps curl it better, faster, and last longer.</li>
            <li> I mean its a nice curling iron</li>
            <li> Since the barrel heats up very hot, I only have to hold it for a few seconds in my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> It did take me a few tries to figure out the best way to use it on myself but it has cut my styling time in half.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast I was able to curl my entire head in less than 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about how effective it would be since it was so cheap and since my hair is very fine and thin</li>
            <li> The glove is basically useless, but the iron is amazing!</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to even curl my hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li> It may be that the wand just isn&#x27;t getting hot enough?</li>
            <li> I have tried a million times to curl my hair and I have come to the conclusion that I am just not good at doing my own hair.  </li>
            <li> I mostly enjoy that it goes from thick to thin, it works great for my thin/fine hair</li>
            <li> I do not usually curl my hair often</li>
            <li> It seems to get quite hot (but definitely doesn&#x27;t burn my hair).&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the first one I tried and the last!</li>
            <li> Gets really hot, I wish there were actually HEAT settings</li>
            <li> My first one was the remington pearl but the only problem with that</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> The fact that there&#x27;s no bar to hold down the hair, just a smooth front, means my hair isn&#x27;t getting tangled and stuck in the machine, hence no breakage.</li>
            <li> This item gets very HOT be careful when using it.</li>
            <li> I would not mind getting my money back and get a better one for less money.</li>
            <li> , I am excited for this purchase to last just as long.</li>
            <li> The glove is not very thick, so if you hold the wand directly, you will still get burnt.</li>
            <li> feel like it&#x27;s a pretty average product overall and probably pretty decent for the price.</li>
            <li> It lasts days and is a great way to perk up dirty hair.</li>
            <li> and I get compliments frequently</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It takes me what I consider a pretty long time to accomplish (about 40 mins).</li>
            <li> just got it 2 days ago and my 9yr old daughter wanted some curls.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 14 year old niece.  </li>
            <li> It ships extremely fast for standard shipping.</li>
            <li> and then straight for the last inch.  </li>
            <li> But it was only $18, so I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> Gets the whole head done in a short period of time.</li>
            <li> My daughter has a really expensive iron and this is every bit as good as hers at a fraction of the price</li>
            <li> gripe that I have is that my hair looked pretty dry and brittle after using this - solved the problem by purchasing a shine spray.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no heat setting, so I&#x27;m not sure exactly how hot it&#x27;s getting (and it&#x27;s not listed on the product, in terms of degrees)</li>
            <li> I have long silky straight hair</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to burn yourself because the wand does get really hot.</li>
            <li> It is seriously user friendly!</li>
            <li> It actually takes half as long to curl my hair with this than a traditional spring iron, and it gives me way more volume than a spring iron.</li>
            <li> wrapped too long anyhow as you will damage your hair from the high heat).</li>
            <li> I have to hold each lock on the wand for a long while, and I&#x27;m definitely not doing too much at once.</li>
            <li> Barely touch and you get a blister.</li>
            <li> The glove is necessary if you want to curl anywhere near the ends of your hair - and who doesn&#x27;t? -</li>
            <li> I have really thick, really long hair, and if I ever hot roll it, it falls out right away.  </li>
            <li> On the high setting the waves were too tight for my taste and on the low setting it didn&#x27;t take very well.</li>
            <li> It does take a few strands of hair before you master the right technique of holding the barrel.</li>
            <li> I would much prefer the other ones that have a bar over the cylinder.  </li>
            <li> but it was worth paying a few dollars extra.</li>
            <li> My only gribe would be that I wish it came in a wider version since I want larger curls not tight ones.</li>
            <li> a little warm, not nearly warm enough to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> At first the sections were too narrow</li>
            <li> Previous equipment would not give me curls that lasted no matter what i did or how much hairspray i used.</li>
            <li> The video showed me that I was supposed to be holding the very tip of my hair slightly out from the wand, so I no longer burn myself when using this.</li>
            <li> Mine are pretty limp by five o&#x27; clock and definitely don&#x27;t make it through the night.</li>
            <li> The first few times I used it, I burnt my hand multiple times.</li>
            <li> I am considering upgrading to a wand with a heat setting in the future because this one gets a little too hot for my hair and only has an on/off switch.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The curls do last much longer than my previous, metal curling iron.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Split your hair into 4 quadrants: straight down the middle, then the one section on each side above the ears.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and thin.</li>
            <li> It curled my hair fine, but I am giving it 4 stars because the heat is extremely unnecessary.</li>
            <li> Next time I would opt for temp control since my hair is fine &amp; thin.</li>
            <li> It gets plenty hot (for those of us that have to burn our hair into submission) and can make loose waves or tight curls.</li>
            <li> If you want that loose wavy curl look for every day wear like the girls from Pretty Little Liars (what I wanted....)</li>
            <li> I have fine straight thin hair, but doesn&#x27;t usually hold curls with a standard curling iron.</li>
            <li> I have found it incredibly simple to make beach waves, large curls, small curls, etc in my hair.</li>
            <li> It would have saved me a little burn on my thumb, other than that small thing I really enjoy this product and how soft my hair feels afterwards.</li>
            <li> I currently use a 1.5&amp;#34; regular curling iron to get the waves that I like, I purchased this curling iron hoping I could get some nice waves but the fact that there is only a &amp;#34; high/low&amp;#34; setting makes it impossible for me.</li>
            <li> They do warn you that the wand gets really hot hence the glove but the glove makes it really hard to hold your hair.</li>
            <li> I learned not to use hair spray before you curl your hair the hard way because this wand gets so hot</li>
            <li> Perhaps if it was flat across the bottom it would not do that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Curls really don&#x27;t last that long for me...</li>
            <li> I honestly haven&#x27;t use the glove at all, it&#x27;s not very useful at least for me cause it just makes my hands clumsy.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and impossible to hold curls with a curling iron - but with this one, I can curl my hair without any products and I can go to bed and wake up the next day with beautiful curls still.</li>
            <li> and it seemed impossible for me to curl my hair until I came across this amazing curler.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want a curly look and like the looser wavy style, I usually curl a section, let it cool for a few seconds, then run my hands through it to loosen it up.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want a curly look and like the looser wavy style, I usually curl a section, let it cool for a few seconds, then run my hands through it to loosen it up.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how quickly the wand became hot- please use the glove that comes with it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t need to be wrapped long at all to achieve it either</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to hold it on my hair for long.</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d have used this when I had long hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting a curling wand for so long</li>
            <li> My hair is about 12 inches long</li>
            <li> (she has a couple of minor boo boos on her neck)</li>
            <li> and it takes a long time to curl for me and</li>
            <li> Ive been looking a long for something like this.</li>
            <li> Even with the glove and long sleeves.</li>
            <li> My hair would never stay curled with any other curling iron and with this product it left my curls in place all day long</li>
            <li> the other curlers work just as well but give you different curls.</li>
            <li> My main problem with it is that it&#x27;s hard to use a clipless curling iron.  </li>
            <li> My curls last for at least 2 days and when I need to touch them up I will make 2 or 3 big curls and separate them after they have cooled (this is key), do not bother curls until they have cooled/set.</li>
            <li> Only down fall is</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because divet in the little &amp;#34;stand&amp;#34; that keeps it from burning the counter</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to (if you are a curling iron person) but by my third time I was a pro!  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s long but only just past my shoulders</li>
            <li> and I have tried at least 10 different types of curling irons and wands over the last 10 years</li>
            <li> so one and only lasted a few hours</li>
            <li> so I take my chances without it and just try to be careful.  </li>
            <li> A lot of style for not much money.</li>
            <li> Prevents hot-poking your neck and helps me control my hair/keep it from slipping off the end of the wand.</li>
            <li> They product even can a few days earlier than it said it would!</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s harder to separate and manipulate your hair with the glove on.  </li>
            <li> and you only have to hold hair wrapped around the barrel for a few seconds and the curls hold.</li>
            <li> Holds curls quite well, compared to the other junk.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to figure out at first.  </li>
            <li> and when I got this one it was everything I expected!</li>
            <li> - I am NOT a hair stylist, and in fact am probably the worst person to ever attempt to blowdry my own hair (brush got so tangled it had to be cut out of my hair!).  </li>
            <li> Need to be very careful of face and neck to avoid burns.  </li>
            <li> Prior to purchasing this wand, I was not very good at using curling irons or styling my hair.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wished I would&#x27;ve got a bigger size wand instead of the 1 inch because the curls are too small for my liking.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that there is no adjustable heat, just one temperature.</li>
            <li> I then wrap away from my face from the wider part of the iron, down.</li>
            <li> luck!ron is facing down.</li>
            <li> I then wrap away from my face from the wider part of the iron, down.</li>
            <li> .. Makes my hair a little frizzy, but other than that, no complaints.</li>
            <li> With the gloves, people saying it is not good - it&#x27;s actually meant for protection from heat by accidental contact with the rod, not for prolonged contact, so that was not an issue with me either.</li>
            <li> , I have long thick hair and my curls</li>
            <li> I have really long, thick hair</li>
            <li> I have to let the iron heat up for a long time, but other than that, it works on my thick hair!</li>
            <li> It takes a little bit of practice</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to but it works.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little easier to use it on someone else than on yourself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give a little breakdown of my routine with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Takes a little practice</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to</li>
            <li> so I would try it out a few times before using it for a night out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will take a few tried to get the hang of it if you have never used this type of curler.</li>
            <li> i think my hair is too heavy and curls won&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li> I bought it about a month ago and have used it a few times.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m just going to start off by saying that I really love this product, I did a lot of research on hair wands, but some were way to expensive and others just were a fail!</li>
            <li> Although I do use the glove provided to protect my hand, I have already burned myself pretty bad on the forearm a few times.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll make this short and sweet, I have some of the worst hair imaginable.</li>
            <li> It works on my hair and the curls stay tight for days!</li>
            <li> Which it has, even though I&#x27;ve been careful not to make extended contact, the fingertips on the glove have completely (and painfully) melted away after about a month of using.</li>
            <li> The black glove sucks so</li>
            <li> This little curling wand packs some heat!</li>
            <li> so... I&#x27;m not sure what else to compare it</li>
            <li> And it may be a bit small in size for the length of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have not gotten any use out of it :/</li>
            <li> she said the glove is scratchy and feels weird but necessary!</li>
            <li> Ive used curling irons in the past, but I wanted to try a wand.</li>
            <li> my hair usually doesn&#x27;t curl but.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard to curling my hair for years, either the curls looked bad or they did not last long.</li>
            <li> Cuts your styling time in half !!</li>
            <li> My hair usually has a hard time holding a curl, but with this wand it holds all day with very little product.  </li>
            <li> and I know that may intimidate some people, especially with thin hair, but I have thin hair and have not had any issues with breakage or damage.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick &amp; difficult, not to mention very long and heavy</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t hardly wear the glove while using the wand</li>
            <li> so sometimes it&#x27;s hard to do things with my hair, but with this curling wand</li>
            <li> its kinda hard and scratchy.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, medium textured, just about shoulder length.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s thick, but I don&#x27;t have a lot (if that makes sense).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even waste your money on the other junk and don&#x27;t even spend tons of money on an expensive one, this does the job just as well!</li>
            <li> I hate high maintenance.</li>
            <li> Seriously, it&#x27;s thinning and straw</li>
            <li> It is thin (doesn&#x27;t protect your fingers), and its hard to get a grip on your hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it was a waste of  money for me.</li>
            <li> This is not a good iron for people who are inexperience doing their hair, or working in the mirror.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with extremely thick hair!</li>
            <li> I have very hard to curl hair</li>
            <li> Also, I am terrible at styling- really.</li>
            <li> I would recommend for teens/lil girls or someone with thin hair.</li>
            <li> Got to dock it a star because how poorly the glove works.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product since I barely got to use it.</li>
            <li> I found the glove to be uncomfortable</li>
            <li> she says its difficult to use.</li>
            <li> : There&#x27;s no clamp to fool with, to catch hairs on, or leave weird crimps in your curls.</li>
            <li> Only problem is that it burns Ur skin real bad</li>
            <li> I kept it because it works, but I think it&#x27;s weird how you have to use a thermal glove with it.</li>
            <li> I used this curling wand for a couple of weeks and was disappointed in the difficulty of use (at least for me), and the fact that I couldn&#x27;t curl close to the end of my hair.  </li>
            <li> so I was skeptical about buying one, but when I found this for $32 I couldn&#x27;t help but snag it!</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone comparing curling wands, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is idiot proof!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> LOVE this product! Perfect for smaller tighter curls. Going to buy the bigger size next.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care much for this hair wand. My curls are frizzy in the end...and it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to even curl my hair.Unfortunately it was a waste of  money for me.</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my hair curl. I still need some practice tho</li>
            <li> its ok you have to waitblike 10 seconds or so for the curl to come out right the glove did not burn my hand when i had it on.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it, worried about burning even with the glove</li>
            <li> This curling wand gives my hair beachy curls, brush them off to give it a glamorous look... it&#x27;s awesome !</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly, and does what it should. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because divet in the little &amp;#34;stand&amp;#34; that keeps it from burning the counter has a tendency make that stand get caught one&#x27;s hair. Perhaps if it was flat across the bottom it would not do that.</li>
            <li> This wand is the perfect size for curls and a vintage wavy hairstyle.  It heats up fast and curls quickly.  It comes with a glove that I would reccomend using to protect the hand holding the curl.</li>
            <li> It heats up pretty quick so watch yourself and make sure you don&#x27;t get burned. It creates nice curls that last without sing hairspray.</li>
            <li> Xmas gift for granddaughter!</li>
            <li> This little curling wand packs some heat! Holds curls quite well, compared to the other junk. Most curling irons won&#x27;t hold a curl in my hair, this gives me flawless curls that are fast and easy. Doesn&#x27;t need to be wrapped long at all to achieve it either (def don&#x27;t want to leave it wrapped too long anyhow as you will damage your hair from the high heat). Don&#x27;t even waste your money on the other junk and don&#x27;t even spend tons of money on an expensive one, this does the job just as well!</li>
            <li> Works perfect. Bouncy and volumized curls.</li>
            <li> I Really like this item. The only thing that would make it better is if it had an automatic shut off after 60 minutes or so. Besides that, it&#x27;s a great wand!</li>
            <li> I love this tool! I have shoulder length straight hair that rarely holds a curl. Curling irons always make me look like Shirley Temple and burn my hair, and took forever. Also, I am terrible at styling- really. I hate high maintenance. But with this wand, it heats up fast and is very easy and quick. I curl large chunks and let it cool 10+ min before brushing it out, depending on whether I want waves or spiral curls. It lasts days and is a great way to perk up dirty hair. Highly recommended. No need to spend more.</li>
            <li> gets very hot, works well</li>
            <li> Works well for a good price! I have super straight, short chin length hair and it holds the curl fairly well with product. It does have a plastic piece at the top of rod which is not featured in photo. Its nice as you can hold on to it if needed.</li>
            <li> I use this almost daily. It gives me perfect curls. It takes a little bit of practice so I would try it out a few times before using it for a night out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl very well but it stays curly for multiple days without product when using this curling wand. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Absolutely awesome! holds curls all day! Only down fall is it gets very hot!!</li>
            <li> Heats nicely, I just wish there were heat settings instead of just one temp.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this wand! It gives the perfect waves &amp; they last in my hair all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll make this short and sweet, I have some of the worst hair imaginable. Seriously, it&#x27;s thinning and straw like and I had no idea what to do with it. This was so easy to use, made amazing curls in just a short amount of time and the design is so convenient. I love the little kick stand that you can use to place the machine down when its hot and the glove it great for easy handling. Glad I took the dive, there were cheaper alternatives but it was worth paying a few dollars extra. The fact that there&#x27;s no bar to hold down the hair, just a smooth front, means my hair isn&#x27;t getting tangled and stuck in the machine, hence no breakage. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Curling iron is great! The black glove sucks so I recommend buying a different one. It&#x27;s has a foam finger texture..</li>
            <li> The best curling tool I have ever used. My hair is silky straight and it didn&#x27;t hold curls for more than a couple hours. I actually spent more time creating curls than sporting them. Based on customer reviews I decided to try this wand, it is the best hair tool I have ever owned. My curls last for at least 2 days and when I need to touch them up I will make 2 or 3 big curls and separate them after they have cooled (this is key), do not bother curls until they have cooled/set. This product saves me a lot of time, I don&#x27;t think I could ever go back to clamp curling irons. I love my curly look, my dude likes it too, he says my curls are sexy, ooh-la-la.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality and works very well.  It took me a little bit to get the hang of it, but pretty easy once you do.</li>
            <li> The best curling iron ever.</li>
            <li> Pretty cool, works great...</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift she used it today  and her heirlooms awesome</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what I did before I owned this. I recommend it to everyone who loves my curls.</li>
            <li> Works really great. Gets really hot really fast. I dont use the glove but it works!</li>
            <li> Very fun for girls looking to be creative with their hair.</li>
            <li> I love this curler. It creates the perfect curl for my long hair.</li>
            <li> this is AMAZING! It gets super hot so I don&#x27;t have to hold it on my hair for long. My only gribe would be that I wish it came in a wider version since I want larger curls not tight ones. Great price too, would definitely order the larger size if they have it!</li>
            <li> I was expecting more. There&#x27;s no temperature control or setting, just on/off bottom. Does not curl hair so one and only lasted a few hours 😔</li>
            <li> Favorite curling iron I own!  Very easy to get beachy waves with this curling iron. I found the glove to be uncomfortable so I take my chances without it and just try to be careful.  Love the size of this and it does create a perfect curl!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and I love that it came with the glove. (which works well by the way)</li>
            <li> It wonderful do invest in !!!!</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness! Where do I start? This is the best thing ever! I have very hard to curl hair (even hairstylists have trouble getting curls to stay) but this thing is like magical! I curl my hair and they stay and I can sleep on them and the next morning style my hair with the curls again. But don&#x27;t get overly excited about the glove. I can&#x27;t hardly wear the glove while using the wand but it doesn&#x27;t effect it any. Just be careful not to burn yourself because the wand does get really hot. But that&#x27;s good, the less time you have to hold your hair there the better. But I definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Works excellently! We use it weekly!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter because she specifically asked for it.  However, she doesnt know how to use it, so i cant give a 5* review. she says its difficult to use.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to figure out at first.  Not like a regular curling iron.  After a couple of burns..... then caught on.</li>
            <li> Very cute curles! they give more like a beachy waves look</li>
            <li> Creates beautiful curls. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love it, gets hot so be careful!</li>
            <li> Just learning how to use for a variety of different hair styles</li>
            <li> Super affordable for such cute curls. Having no clamp is a learning experience but I definitely prefer without</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m just going to start off by saying that I really love this product, I did a lot of research on hair wands, but some were way to expensive and others just were a fail! But this tool is reasonably priced and it works wonders, I have long thick hair and my curls always look amazing! I don&#x27;t particularly like the glove but it does come in handy because this hair wand gets extremely hot!, but I have to say I am very satisfied, and the shipping came right when I was expecting it!</li>
            <li> After learning how much hair to swivel around the iron, I really like this. At first the sections were too narrow so I ended up with too many &amp;#34;springs&amp;#34; bouncing around ala Shirley Temple. When I sectioned off thicker sections of hair, it looked like the pix in the magazines. The curls stay for days. A lot of style for not much money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this iron for about a month now. This is the first curling wand I&#x27;ve ever used and I absolutely won&#x27;t go back to traditional curling irons. But, there are some drawbacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: There&#x27;s no clamp to fool with, to catch hairs on, or leave weird crimps in your curls. Awesome. One thing I don&#x27;t see pictured on here is that it comes with a removable rubber tip which is really great. Prevents hot-poking your neck and helps me control my hair/keep it from slipping off the end of the wand. This is the first time in my life I&#x27;ve been able to get natural looking curls successfully and I get compliments frequently now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-It takes me what I consider a pretty long time to accomplish (about 40 mins). I have thick hair, medium textured, just about shoulder length. It may be that the wand just isn&#x27;t getting hot enough? I have to hold each lock on the wand for a long while, and I&#x27;m definitely not doing too much at once. There&#x27;s no heat setting, so I&#x27;m not sure exactly how hot it&#x27;s getting (and it&#x27;s not listed on the product, in terms of degrees) so... I&#x27;m not sure what else to compare it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Curls really don&#x27;t last that long for me...although a lot of people on here say otherwise. Mine are pretty limp by five o&#x27; clock and definitely don&#x27;t make it through the night. No \\&quot;I woke up like this!\\&quot; moment for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The \\&quot;heat-resistant glove\\&quot; is bull s***! It actually says on the packaging not to hold the glove to the wand, or it will melt. Which it has, even though I&#x27;ve been careful not to make extended contact, the fingertips on the glove have completely (and painfully) melted away after about a month of using. I&#x27;m looking for a better one elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like it&#x27;s a pretty average product overall and probably pretty decent for the price. I&#x27;m on the market for a better one- If anyone has a recommendation for a curling wand they can&#x27;t live without I&#x27;d love to hear it!</li>
            <li> I have never used a curling wand so I was skeptical about buying one, but when I found this for $32 I couldn&#x27;t help but snag it! It heats up within a minute. I believe it only has one heat setting, though (if it has more than one, the dial must not be easy to find), but it is perfect! It gives great curls and they lasted all day without hair spray!</li>
            <li> It is super great! It works on my hair and the curls stay tight for days! They product even can a few days earlier than it said it would!</li>
            <li> Great product, just not something I can learn to do.  I have tried a million times to curl my hair and I have come to the conclusion that I am just not good at doing my own hair.  If you are than this product is great and heats up very quick! shipping was fast and on time.</li>
            <li> I gave this wand-like curling iron a two star rating because it just did not meet my expectations. I have hair to the middle of my back and it&#x27;s thick, but I don&#x27;t have a lot (if that makes sense). I currently use a 1.5&amp;#34; regular curling iron to get the waves that I like, I purchased this curling iron hoping I could get some nice waves but the fact that there is only a &amp;#34; high/low&amp;#34; setting makes it impossible for me. And it may be a bit small in size for the length of my hair. On the high setting the waves were too tight for my taste and on the low setting it didn&#x27;t take very well. I would recommend for teens/lil girls or someone with thin hair. It&#x27;s in my drawer I have not gotten any use out of it :/</li>
            <li> This is the best curling iron ever! Never had one before but I am so satisfied with it. So easy to use and you can make many different kind of curls!!! It is durable and heat is powerful (burn my fingers couple of times lol) it comes with a protective glove. Use it if you are not an expert lol</li>
            <li> Love this wand! I mostly enjoy that it goes from thick to thin, it works great for my thin/fine hair</li>
            <li> Wonderful! This curling wand stays hot and gets the job much more efficiently. Creates beautiful waves- the longer you hold them on the tighter they will be.</li>
            <li> Very very happy with this. Used it in Argentina, were electricity is 220v and no problem at all. In fact, my 17-year-old niece kept it there for herself. Will buy another for me. Totally recommend this for travelling women!</li>
            <li> This iron works great. Only thing is you cannot lower the temperature. It gets very hot, hotter than my others. Barely touch and you get a blister.</li>
            <li> Hot as heck!! I have more burns than I know what to do with! So I suggest learning to use the glove! Overall a great curler.. Makes my hair a little frizzy, but other than that, no complaints.</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand! I have fine straight thin hair, but doesn&#x27;t usually hold curls with a standard curling iron. This gives great curls and volume when placed correctly, and what&#x27;s better is they only fall a little looser throughout the day instead of completely disappearing. This is my second iron I&#x27;ve purchased from the Bed Head line (the first being the blue Wave Artist) and they both bust out just what is promised without much effort, and it helps they don&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg on top of that. I don&#x27;t use the glove with this wand even though it is super hot, I have tiny petite hands and I still don&#x27;t like the tightness of the glove, especially around the wrist where its the scratchiest. I would recommend to anyone comparing curling wands, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like some what of it, I LOVE how it came on time and FAST!&lt;br /&gt;I dislike how it took me like 2 hours to curl my hair and I don&#x27;t even have think and a lot of hair, and it did not last long!&lt;br /&gt;I think i can get a better curling wand for less money. I would not mind getting my money back and get a better one for less money.</li>
            <li> As expected. They do warn you that the wand gets really hot hence the glove but the glove makes it really hard to hold your hair. With practice it got easier without the glove</li>
            <li> I love these curling wands! I love that they are lose at the top and tight at the bottom or gives me great curls and I would buy it again in a heart beat. I like the pink better than the others but the other curlers work just as well but give you different curls.</li>
            <li> gloves melt... I&#x27;d suggest getting one that doesn&#x27;t taper off at the end. that way, your curls are even and don&#x27;t get smaller.</li>
            <li> My daughter LOVES this wand. She does not used the enclosed glove but thinks some folks will like it.  Heats up fast and curls look nice and bouncy.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is very nice, it works just fine. It will take a few tried to get the hang of it if you have never used this type of curler. The packaging is cute, makes great  gift.</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d have used this when I had long hair but it works just as good with short hair</li>
            <li> Bed head has the best products! My iron was delivered in 2 days. It curls wonderfully and the glove is awesome and fits any hand. This is by far the best curling wand I&#x27;ve owned. I also have the matching blow dryer which I love. BED HEAD items rock</li>
            <li> Thanks very much for your help with this product.  Really appreciate your time effort and energy for a seamless transaction.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for short hair</li>
            <li> This is a great product for anyone with medium-long hair. I was nervous the barrel was to slim, but others looks to fat. This is perfect. I am still learning to use it, but the results from just winging it are awesome. It definitely has a better rsults than a standard curling iron with clamp. Use the glove until you get the hang of it. I love Bed Head products I have a blow dryer thats lasted 6 years, I am excited for this purchase to last just as long.</li>
            <li> I had a wand that makes your curls looser at the top and tighter at the bottom, but my curls looked too tight. I love this wand because all the curls are the same and they look really nice. Quick heat up also.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because it is a decent curling wand. I do not usually curl my hair often but when I do with this curling wand, I do not have any issues. My only complaint is that I wished I would&#x27;ve got a bigger size wand instead of the 1 inch because the curls are too small for my liking. Overall I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> For tight curls, this curling iron is wonderful.  Since the barrel heats up very hot, I only have to hold it for a few seconds in my fine hair.  Although I do use the glove provided to protect my hand, I have already burned myself pretty bad on the forearm a few times.  I would recommend getting a friend to help you curl your hair to avoid getting burns like I have while using this product alone.</li>
            <li> It heats up super fast and is lightweight. I learned not to use hair spray before you curl your hair the hard way because this wand gets so hot I don&#x27;t need to. LOVE it.</li>
            <li> One of the best styling tools I&#x27;ve ever purchased. The loose curls look fantastic and are surprisingly easy to do once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Havent used much but will once my hair gets longer. Works really when the two times Ive used it.</li>
            <li> So sad so good very soft on your hair makes curls easy to do</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this wand. I have gotten so many compliments on my hair since I started using it. A total of 3 people have bought one after asking me which wand I use. I love that I didn&#x27;t have to spend $100+ for a good wand. The only things I would change are the glove and the fact that there isn&#x27;t a temperature dial. Other than that, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> This curling iron works as great as more expensive models. I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using it. It has worked well and worked often. I never cease to get complaints when I take a couple extra minutes in the morning to curl my hair. It works fast and it works good!&lt;br /&gt;Plus for the price, it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Makes great curls, takes a time or 2 to get used to using it and DEFINITELY use the glove.</li>
            <li> heats up fast, continuous high heat.  Need to be very careful of face and neck to avoid burns.  This is not a good iron for people who are inexperience doing their hair, or working in the mirror.  With a little practice can create so really cool styles - shoulder length or longer hair is best with this iron.</li>
            <li> It is way hot!!! Curl fast. No need for hairspray!!</li>
            <li> Works awesome. Makes perfect wringlets. Would definitely recommend purchasing this item.:)</li>
            <li> wonderful product gets really hot very fast and the curls look wonderful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the $200 dollar clipless irons and this one works just as well. My hair is thick and impossible to hold curls with a curling iron - but with this one, I can curl my hair without any products and I can go to bed and wake up the next day with beautiful curls still. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great &#x27;beginner&#x27; barrel curing iron. Gets hot and holds as curl on my fine, long blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I like it but could b better all it has is on and off so I really burnt my self and the glove isn&#x27;t to good but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> Love it! Takes a little practice to be able to not use the glove but it does a great job!</li>
            <li> This was a perfect gift for my teenage niece.  She loved it &amp; her hair looks beautiful after using it!</li>
            <li> My daughter has long thick hair and this was perfect for curling it.good product would buy again. Quality product  great</li>
            <li> This is a must have!!!. .. just got it 2 days ago and my 9yr old daughter wanted some curls.  Loved the results especially for it being my 1st time using it in her. .nice curls in literally seconds!</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this wand to anyone who wants fast easy curls! The wand itself heats up pretty quickly and the glove definitely comes in handy; especially for beginners!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not the best with my hair and even I am satisfied! It is idiot proof!</li>
            <li> Was very excited to receive this iron but when I got it and tried to use it my hair got frizzy. Maybe I just need more practice with it. This item gets very HOT be careful when using it.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this from Amazon but I got the same product from another store for $20. I was skeptical about how effective it would be since it was so cheap and since my hair is very fine and thin therefore it doesn&#x27;t hold curls well. I am pleasantly surprised with how easy and quick it is. I was shocked at how quickly the wand became hot- please use the glove that comes with it. It would have saved me a little burn on my thumb, other than that small thing I really enjoy this product and how soft my hair feels afterwards. I also have red color treated hair and it doesn&#x27;t feel damaged or scratchy despite the heat. My only word of advice would be to use caution and not to rush in order to avoid accidentally burning yourself :)</li>
            <li> This is a very good wand i love it it works great but you cant change the heat settings so that kind of sucks but it works great</li>
            <li> Just as described with good pics. I am very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great. It gets plenty hot (for those of us that have to burn our hair into submission) and can make loose waves or tight curls. Personally I would have preferred a larger barrel for the types of curls I want, but it works well nonetheless.</li>
            <li> I did love it until it stopped working. Does not get hot at all and I&#x27;ve only had it for 8 months.</li>
            <li> Works great on my hair. (:</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do what it is suppose to but it works for the most part.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works great!</li>
            <li> I really love this product!!! I&#x27;ve been wanting a curling wand for so long and when I got this one it was everything I expected! Great Product!</li>
            <li> I really loved this.  I have really thick, really long hair, and if I ever hot roll it, it falls out right away.  This makes great curls that literally last for days, and the glove comes in really handy.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! I have really long, thick hair so sometimes it&#x27;s hard to do things with my hair, but with this curling wand it&#x27;s so quick and easy. It heats up really fast and is never hard to use. Although the glove is somewhat scratchy and cheap, the outcome of my hair totally makes up for it</li>
            <li> Great spiral wand. Takes a minute to heat up, but heat recovery is instant. Easy to use, makes me look great in minutes, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this wand! It curls my hair so fast and the curls look amazing and last all day!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter.  It takes a little getting used to but it works.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the glove. I ended up using my glove from another wand. But the wand itself is great. Heats quickly, and styles the hair quickly.</li>
            <li> Best curls ever for my mermaid hair!  Love this iron</li>
            <li> By far the best Curling Rod i have ever used! highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I got this hair curler for my daughter and she loves it! The curls come out beautiful and stay in longer than expected. This is a lot better than her other curlers and especially with her long hair, this works perfectly! Though when you first use this product, you should wear the glove. This thing heats up very quickly (id say about 2-3 minutes to get to maybe 250-300 degrees) and there is no personal heat setting for this. Absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 14 year old niece.  She loves it, and has already used it with great results on the curls is made.  Could not have been happier with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly how it was described. It works great and curls really well. It ships extremely fast for standard shipping. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a good curling wand for a good price</li>
            <li> Wife loves it. The glove is basically useless, but the iron is amazing! Perfect curls pretty much every time!</li>
            <li> great product! would recommend this easy to use and a great price!</li>
            <li> Only problem is that it burns Ur skin real bad</li>
            <li> Great curls that last!</li>
            <li> Got mine today and its awesome! It warms up quick and works amazing. The glove it comes with is cool too it&#x27;s not too big so I actually got to use it.</li>
            <li> Takes some practice getting used to it.  Takes a lot of time to curl your hair.  With practice it does give the look I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This curling wand works amazingly, the only reason I didn&#x27;t give five stars is because the heat protective glove feels very cheap and scratchy. The wand heats up super fast and gives beautiful bouncy curls. Love it :)</li>
            <li> Super easy to use, heats up fast (EXTREMELY HOT) curls stay all day. Definitely a steal!</li>
            <li> Love. This. Iron. I can&#x27;t even tell you. I use it on myself, I use it on my clients, everyone loves it. If you want that loose wavy curl look for every day wear like the girls from Pretty Little Liars (what I wanted....) then it&#x27;s perfect, and lasts ALL day. If you want a tighter curl for a special occasion like prom, then it&#x27;s perfect for that too! It did take me a few tries to figure out the best way to use it on myself but it has cut my styling time in half. It actually takes half as long to curl my hair with this than a traditional spring iron, and it gives me way more volume than a spring iron. I don&#x27;t think I would recommend this for people with anything shorter than shoulder length. I used it on clients with shorter hair but it&#x27;s a little easier to use it on someone else than on yourself. My hair is about 12 inches long so it&#x27;s long but only just past my shoulders and it&#x27;s easy for me. I also like that you don&#x27;t have to worry about setting the heat, there&#x27;s only one temperature and I know that may intimidate some people, especially with thin hair, but I have thin hair and have not had any issues with breakage or damage. I&#x27;ll give a little breakdown of my routine with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Split your hair into 4 quadrants: straight down the middle, then the one section on each side above the ears. Put the glove on the hand on the side you&#x27;re working on. Does that make sense? Glove on the right hand if you&#x27;re curling the right side of your hair. I&#x27;m right handed so I&#x27;m not positive how it would work for lefties, but I think it will be fine. Then I start wrapping. You don&#x27;t need to take as small of a subsection when curling because it gets very hot and that helps curl it better, faster, and last longer. I curl the bottom and back of my hair away from the face. You&#x27;ll have to practice with this to find the way to hold it that feels most comfortable to you. When I get to the front top section (of the right side), I hold my arm over my head so the narrower part of the iron is facing down. I then wrap away from my face from the wider part of the iron, down. If you don&#x27;t want a curly look and like the looser wavy style, I usually curl a section, let it cool for a few seconds, then run my hands through it to loosen it up. With this iron, once it&#x27;s set, it is set. So if you let it set too much in a curl, it will be very curly when you brush it out. Which is my next tip. After you&#x27;ve curled your entire head, brush brush brush. Don&#x27;t be scared. Again, this is for the looser waves. It helps meld it all together so it looks like you just wake up that beautiful. Then use a light to medium hairspray to set the style and you are good to go! It does take practice. I&#x27;ve been doing hair for 10 years and it took me a good week to really get the hang of it so don&#x27;t get discouraged. I hope everyone likes it as much as I do. Good luck!ron is facing down.

            <li> I have to let the iron heat up for a long time, but other than that, it works on my thick hair! Makes really cute curls that hold for a long time! I would recommend this to anyone with extremely thick hair!</li>
            <li> it is a good product but not for everyone, at least not for me. i can make curls on other people just not on my own. i think my hair is too heavy and curls won&#x27;t stay. 3 out of 4 girls in my house agree it is not what we thought it would be</li>
            <li> Love it! Use it daily.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good product.  My main problem with it is that it&#x27;s hard to use a clipless curling iron.  How can people say it&#x27;s easy to use?  The glove is necessary if you want to curl anywhere near the ends of your hair - and who doesn&#x27;t? - but it&#x27;s harder to separate and manipulate your hair with the glove on.  Even with the glove on, you can&#x27;t get all the way to the ends of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These curling wands, for those who haven&#x27;t used one before (like me), give a different type of curl than a traditional curling iron.  Because you aren&#x27;t twisting the barrel of the iron, it makes your hair into spirals rather than the curl I&#x27;m used to.  It&#x27;s a nice look, actually, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re expecting.  It also takes me quite a bit longer to use this iron than a traditional clip iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, there is no heat adjustment setting on this wand which would probably be helpful.  It seems to get quite hot (but definitely doesn&#x27;t burn my hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer mentioned, unlike the picture there IS a plastic tip on the end of the wand.  Thank goodness!  It would be too easy to burn yourself or your clothes without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curls do last much longer than my previous, metal curling iron.  I used this curling wand for a couple of weeks and was disappointed in the difficulty of use (at least for me), and the fact that I couldn&#x27;t curl close to the end of my hair.  I didn&#x27;t like the look I was getting from it - spirals in the middle and then straight for the last inch.  So I ended up buying a different curling iron with a clip and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I love this wand! I call it my magic wand. It works very well - heats up very quickly and reaches VERY hot temperatures for quick curling. I have had this for several months and it&#x27;s still working like ai bougt it yesterday.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter and it works great! it is VERY hot (she has a couple of minor boo boos on her neck) she learned quickly...she said the glove is scratchy and feels weird but necessary!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard to curling my hair for years, either the curls looked bad or they did not last long. Ive used curling irons in the past, but I wanted to try a wand. This is the first one I tried and the last! I love this curling wand! My curls last all day and even into the next day! It&#x27;s affordable and works great! Definitely worth my money.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described and shipped very quickly. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Works really well.  My daughter has a really expensive iron and this is every bit as good as hers at a fraction of the price (she was jealous).  Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Love it. Takes a little practice so you don&#x27;t burn yourself. I wish it had an auto-shut off but otherwise it works really well. My hair is very straight and never holds a curl but using this wand my curls hold very well. The glove sticks to your hair. I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I like the look I get when I use this, the curls are more natural, I feel like it is easier to use then a regular curling iron</li>
            <li> I LOVE this curling iron. Best I&#x27;ve ever used. The burns are worth it but that&#x27;s my fault for not using the glove. Great deal for a great product</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and thin. It provided me with great curls! The glove works fine. The one thing I did not like is that there is no temperature control. But it was only $18, so I can&#x27;t complain too much. Next time I would opt for temp control since my hair is fine &amp; thin.</li>
            <li> I mean its a nice curling iron but I have had it for a while now and it takes a long time to curl for me and the curs don&#x27;t even last that long...not even through the day.</li>
            <li> I bought it about a month ago and have used it a few times. I have wavy long thick hair and it curls perfectly and lasts long. The only downfall is that the glove. It is thin (doesn&#x27;t protect your fingers), and its hard to get a grip on your hair. If you don&#x27;t plan on using the glove then this is perfect!</li>
            <li> Love this! Wasn&#x27;t too expensive and I use it most days to touch up my curls. Gets really hot, I wish there were actually HEAT settings but it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much. Also, I never use the glove but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> Works well, and makes amazing curls, at a good price. Got to dock it a star because how poorly the glove works.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to but I managed to get beautiful sleek curls with this wonderful curling wand ! I&#x27;ve used it on my hair &amp; also on my weave &amp; it worked perfectly. I do wish the glove was a little bit thicker though because you can still end up burning your hand, but it&#x27;s a great product. I definitely recommend it !</li>
            <li> daughter loves it. Needs a better glove though and watch out for the counter top burns and burning hair. These get very hot.</li>
            <li> Pretty easy to master - I am NOT a hair stylist, and in fact am probably the worst person to ever attempt to blowdry my own hair (brush got so tangled it had to be cut out of my hair!).  So I wasn&#x27;t sure exactly how well I&#x27;d do with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took me about 40 minutes the first time I tried it, then 30 then 25.  I have a lot of curly hair, but wanted my hair to look like Veronica Lake&#x27;s.  This sure did the trick!  So gorgeous and my hair really held the curl well.  Love the glove because without it I would&#x27;ve burned the heck out of my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One gripe that I have is that my hair looked pretty dry and brittle after using this - solved the problem by purchasing a shine spray.</li>
            <li> Great wand option! Once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s super easy to use and the curl lasts all day and into the next day. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Within the first 5 minutes of using, I burnt my finger and it is continuing to blister... Use the glove. It curled my hair fine, but I am giving it 4 stars because the heat is extremely unnecessary.</li>
            <li> Previous equipment would not give me curls that lasted no matter what i did or how much hairspray i used. This works amazingly, the curls last me the entire day. Light weight and easy to handle. Gets the whole head done in a short period of time. It does take a few strands of hair before you master the right technique of holding the barrel. With the gloves, people saying it is not good - it&#x27;s actually meant for protection from heat by accidental contact with the rod, not for prolonged contact, so that was not an issue with me either. Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product is so easy to use and makes my hair look great and natural. I like the plastic thing in the top cause prevents me from burning my hands. I honestly haven&#x27;t use the glove at all, it&#x27;s not very useful at least for me cause it just makes my hands clumsy.</li>
            <li> It really works great and I would definitely recommend it for short hair! Very easy to use and the glove prevents burns</li>
            <li> Makes great curls and the glove is super handy!</li>
            <li> Very nice. My girl loves it</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter and she loves it. Her hair was so cute.&lt;br /&gt;Works great. Great for teens and adults</li>
            <li> Good packaging, good tools and good work too..good result to my hair even too hot for the heat to my left wrist skin..but no prob it was myfoult,need to be more careful..thanks</li>
            <li> This curling wand works SO AMAZINGLY WELL!! Gets to the perfect hot temperature and you only have to hold hair wrapped around the barrel for a few seconds and the curls hold. I never use any hair spray. perfect bouncy curly (or wavy, depends on how you want to style it) hair every time. I get so many compliments! However I don&#x27;t really car for this hot glove. its kinda hard and scratchy. reminds me of a brillo pad haha. I use my other hot glove from a different curling wand I bought that broke since it&#x27;s a lot softer and more comfortable.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I made this purchase. Prior to purchasing this wand, I was not very good at using curling irons or styling my hair. This wand is so easy to use, that I know feel like a pro! I watched a video on YouTube of all the different ways to use the wand to get different styles of hair.... when I purchased it, I had no idea it could be used to make so many different looks. I have found it incredibly simple to make beach waves, large curls, small curls, etc in my hair. I strongly encourage watching the video on how to use it to make all the different hairstyles. The first few times I used it, I burnt my hand multiple times. The glove is not very thick, so if you hold the wand directly, you will still get burnt. The video showed me that I was supposed to be holding the very tip of my hair slightly out from the wand, so I no longer burn myself when using this. This wand does everything. Now, instead of taking several different sized curling irons, a straightener, a waver, &amp; multiple hair products w/me when I travel, I only need to pack 1 item: this curling wand. :)</li>
            <li> Sturdy wand at a great price.  Easy to use and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have gone through so many curling irons in my lifetime and my biggest problem is that my curls won&#x27;t hold (I have long, healthy, thick straight hair). I discovered curling wands about a year ago when my friend styled my hair with one and my curls stayed through an entire night of partying in Cancun.  I immediately fell in in love with it and decided to purchase one for myself.  My first one was the remington pearl but the only problem with that was my hair kept sliding off when I wrapped it around the wand.  It just felt very cheap and was too much trouble.  I decided to invest a little more in one and came across the Bed Head Curli Pops and so far so good.  My hair does not slide off the wand and my curls stay in tact all day long, very easy to use.  The only negative is that there is no adjustable heat, just one temperature.</li>
            <li> Wife says it works great!</li>
            <li> Really like this for the price. I am considering upgrading to a wand with a heat setting in the future because this one gets a little too hot for my hair and only has an on/off switch.</li>
            <li> I love this wand. It works great and shipping was fast</li>
            <li> This item arrived quickly I was very satisfied with the iron my hair usually doesn&#x27;t curl but. with this iron it curled an stayed curled</li>
            <li> Better than I expected it to be. Works great with long hair and the curls are beautiful. It&#x27;s easy to use and I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments on my curls since its purchase. I dont really have any cons about the product. Lets just say I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Product is just OK.  I kept it because it works, but I think it&#x27;s weird how you have to use a thermal glove with it. I would much prefer the other ones that have a bar over the cylinder.  Next time I&#x27;ll buy one of those.</li>
            <li> Great product and curls the hair in a perfect spiral.</li>
            <li> Great item-- quick service-- thanks!</li>
            <li> I have short, fine, straight hair and I have tried at least 10 different types of curling irons and wands over the last 10 years and this one is the absolute best!  Holds the curl great (with product) and it is nice that it is tapered for those of us with short hair.</li>
            <li> Wow! I have never been able to curl my hair. With this, I got amazing curls (it was so easy!) That lasted all day! (That never happens!) The glove doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;d keep you from burning yourself, but a newbie (me) can curl their hair without burning themselves with no problems. Definitely love this curling rod!</li>
            <li> I have long silky straight hair and it seemed impossible for me to curl my hair until I came across this amazing curler. I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast I was able to curl my entire head in less than 20 minutes. I did not use any products to hold the curls. The curls stayed on all night!! Definitely recommend! :)</li>
            <li> By daughter wanted this for Christmas...it arrived on time.  She loves it and uses it all the time.  Heat is great and her hair looks beautiful!</li>
            <li> Cuts your styling time in half !!</li>
            <li> I used this for about a week when the heat stopped working. When I first started using it, the heat worked great and I had no problems curling my hair. Then one day I turned it on, waited 10-15 minutes and the barrel only got a little warm, not nearly warm enough to curl my hair. It&#x27;s done that ever since. Very disappointed in this product since I barely got to use it.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!! So simple to use! My first ever curling wand and glad I choose this one!</li>
            <li> Amazing worth every penny I love this curling wand!!!!! My hair is very thick &amp; difficult, not to mention very long and heavy this had my curls lasting all day and when I woke up I still had nice waves in my hair like I had slept in braids...I don&#x27;t think I will find anything better!!♡</li>
            <li> Ive been looking a long for something like this. Its perfect and works like a beauty.</li>
            <li> I honesty love love it!!! My hair would never stay curled with any other curling iron and with this product it left my curls in place all day long I couldn&#x27;t be happier:)</li>
            <li> Kind of wish I got a smaller rod.</li>
            <li> love worked well.  curls stayed over night.</li>
            <li> The best curling wand on the market!  I despise curling my hair but this wand makes it so easy!  My hair usually has a hard time holding a curl, but with this wand it holds all day with very little product.  It takes a little getting used to (if you are a curling iron person) but by my third time I was a pro!  It is seriously user friendly!</li>
            <li> Worked great on my sisters&#x27; hair i got for her for Christmas. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this wand! I had a smaller one before, and I feel like this one is the perfect size.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use!  Heats up quickly.  LOVE the hot pink.  I found the glove very useful and protective.  I really like how the chord has velcro on it so the chord wraps up easily.</li>
            <li> The curls hold but i burn myself on it everytime. Even with the glove and long sleeves. It gets super hot and theres no temperature control.</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase! Does exactly what I wanted and I am very pleased! Definitely something you have to learn to do but all in all worth the time of doing it. Curls come out perfectly! Just beware because it does get super hot!</li>
