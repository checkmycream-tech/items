            <li>Dear beautiful, sweet, amazing smelling &amp;#34;bar&amp;#34; of eyeshadow....</li>
            <li>the palette itself is wonderful and for those who are wondering i did indeed receive the real palette it is not a knockoff.</li>
            <li>Best beauty purchase so far!</li>
            <li>I was so thrilled with how quick shipping was!!</li>
            <li>The colors are all so beautiful and very pigmented !</li>
            <li>I love these kind of shades,</li>
            <li>Also, the eye shadow goes onto eyelids very smoothly.</li>
            <li>Love everything about it.</li>
            <li>This palette is one of my favorite.</li>
            <li>That being said, I love the casing and the magnetic clasp.</li>
            <li>I love the way it applys.</li>
            <li>and I would gladly have that option instead.  </li>
            <li>In fact, after using the shadows yesterday, my favorite shadow brush still smells of chocolate powder</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s adorable.  </li>
            <li>And to top it off, it was the slim version of the palette.</li>
            <li>matte warm brown, no orange tones, texture is smooth and color applies</li>
            <li>My favorite eyeshadow palette ever.</li>
            <li>Authentic product.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to purchase this as the price tag gave me a bit of a cringe, but I am really glad that I did.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Most practical pallette.</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I love the mix of mattes, shimmers and sparkles, and how easily this palette moves from day to night.</li>
            <li>They are super pigmented and they apply so smooth!</li>
            <li>A nice magnetic closure with very sturdy shadow pans.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s perfect for everyday makeup.</li>
            <li>Smooth and evenly</li>
            <li>This one applies patchy as a shadow color, but is fantastic as a liner, just like triple fudge.</li>
            <li>The color goes on smoothly, and stays all day.</li>
            <li>Smells like cocoa, colors are spectacularly beautiful, and if you put on your eyeshadow with your mouth open, you even get a bit of a sweet taste.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!  </li>
            <li>Im excited to use it</li>
            <li>I have really been enjoying my too faced chocolate bar eyeshadow  palette.  </li>
            <li>I would have settled for the wider palette since I love these shadows and brand so much.</li>
            <li>I love these colors, they are true and highly pigmented.</li>
            <li>There is a bit of sparkle fallout with this one, too, so it&#x27;s more of a nighttime color.&lt;br /&gt;Triple Fudge- dark blackened warm brown.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a quick delivery!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s fun and practical .  </li>
            <li>Nice addition to the daily make up routine .</li>
            <li>It makes for a really fun and playful palette.  </li>
            <li>this is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>HIghly pigmented and smells so sweet!</li>
            <li>but the corners of the palette is kinda scratched but its ok as long as the inside were fine</li>
            <li>If you enjoy the color purple you will really enjoy the various tints.  </li>
            <li>the only reason i did not give this a five star review is that compared to the naked 2 palette by urban decay it is not as nice color wise.</li>
            <li>one big gripe, which everyone else seems to love, is the smell.  </li>
            <li>Too faced really hit it out of the park with this one!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>At first I was so skeptical about buying this product but its really awesome</li>
            <li>Perfect condition, was heavily and carefully wrapped with bubble wrap.</li>
            <li>i used the urban decay primer and the shadow easily adhered to it and lasted all day.</li>
            <li>Amazing for green or hazel</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend this product to any one beginner or intermediate!</li>
            <li>shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>100 percent authentic as we&#x27;re all the other products I have bought from Beach Camera.</li>
            <li>and my eyes usually still look amazing.</li>
            <li>Other shadows, being buttery and still very high end, can be powdery and break apart easily, which means you&#x27;ll use them faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But the slimmer one is much more practical IMO and takes less room on my vanity.</li>
            <li>Also, a lot of the brown colors are super similar.</li>
            <li>Which I was pleasantly surprised!!</li>
            <li>I love the payoff and they also have little to no fallout!</li>
            <li>A lot of them are very natural against my skin tone</li>
            <li>I feel this opens up another level of neutrals, as there are some colors not usually included in neutral palettes.  </li>
            <li>The basic colors and added extra tones have made this pretty much the only palate I use anymore, its very versatile and matches just about everything in my closet.</li>
            <li>The palette is versatile enough that you really don&#x27;t need anything else.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a few months, so I feel comfortable reviewing it.</li>
            <li>shadows in this palette ARE chocolate scented, so if you are sensitive to scented products, avoid this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If amazon allowed half stars, 4.5 would be the true review here.  </li>
            <li>It has a range of tones that make day to night VERY easy to switch up, and I love that it goes on exactly as thick or thin as you load your brush.</li>
            <li>Pigmented and smooth, little fallout.&lt;br /&gt;White Chocolate- matte neutral cream, great base color or brow bone highlight.</li>
            <li>The colors are all pigmented and they aren&#x27;t too soft which means this palette will last you!  </li>
            <li>I like most of the colors, its hard to really like them especially when i&#x27;m still an amateur at makeup looks.</li>
            <li>Bon Bon- matte pale cool pink.</li>

            <li> I like most of the colors, its hard to really like them especially when i&#x27;m still an amateur at makeup looks.</li>
            <li> Bon Bon- matte pale cool pink.</li>
            <li> It is long lasting an only has to be touched up after a long day.</li>
            <li> when applying i did notice a small amount of fallout which is natural nothing major though.</li>
            <li> For reference, a MAC or Urban Decay single shadow is 0.05oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> super pale pink with a pale gold shimmer.</li>
            <li> pigment.&lt;br /&gt;Candied Violet- blue toned violet with pink sparkle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost full proof, with this palette, you can&#x27;t go wrong when selecting colors.  </li>
            <li> I cant believe it came in a week earlier than expected !!</li>
            <li> Medium pigmentation, this color is a bit more chalky than others in the palette, but application is not too bad.</li>
            <li> All the colors go together, so you have a wide variety of looks which can be achieved.  </li>
            <li> Because I took a whim and expected the heftier one.</li>
            <li> pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;Creme Brulee- aged gold with a golf metallic finish.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like chocolate and the pigment does not last but a few hours of wear.  </li>
            <li> ( But other then that it was alright.</li>
            <li> Other people were saying they smell nothing</li>
            <li> As with the other sparkle shades, there is a tendency for fallout.</li>
            <li> I apply around 8am and usually don&#x27;t come back in until around 8pm</li>
            <li> dark olive brown with gold sparkles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cherry Cordial- dark opaque brown/wine matte with a hint of sparkle</li>
            <li> candied violet, gilded ganache (which is an olive green), cherry cordial (dark burgundy).  </li>

            <li> Great color pay off, not to mention how delicious it smells. I love this pallete it has great color selections, for those that like a neutral eyes like me with tons brown shades to choose from. I&#x27;m very pleased with mine.</li>
            <li> I love these colors, they are true and highly pigmented. The palette is versatile enough that you really don&#x27;t need anything else. I am so happy with this eye shadow pallete that I have been giving them as gifts.  Everyone has been very pleased with this palette as am I.  Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I like most of the colors, its hard to really like them especially when i&#x27;m still an amateur at makeup looks.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this product. The palette is amazing and it did not disappoint. 100 percent authentic as we&#x27;re all the other products I have bought from Beach Camera.</li>
            <li> Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love everything about it. It smells so good an all the colors are great. It is long lasting an only has to be touched up after a long day.</li>
            <li> I have really been enjoying my too faced chocolate bar eyeshadow  palette.  I think it&#x27;s a little overpriced  but I would still purchase it again.  If you enjoy the color purple you will really enjoy the various tints.  As well it has some great  neutral colors.  I use mine almost every day so it&#x27;s fun and practical .  Nice addition to the daily make up routine .</li>
            <li> This product is beautiful and smells great.</li>
            <li> SO glad I bought this!  HIghly pigmented and smells so sweet!</li>
            <li> This palette is one of my favorite. The colors are all so beautiful and very pigmented ! I love these kind of shades, nude but with a hint of colors so you can do a lot of different looks. I am a great fan of Too Faced, I really love their products and their lovely packaging ! The quality is perfect and this is a very good investment ! Perfect for every makeup addict !</li>
            <li> Some of the BEST eyeshadows I have ever used! They are super pigmented and they apply so smooth! I love the payoff and they also have little to no fallout! I would HIGHLY recommend this product to any one beginner or intermediate!</li>
            <li> Love my palate! Thanks for a quick delivery!</li>
            <li> To get a good pigmentation from the eyeshadow you need an eye shadow primer. Also, a lot of the brown colors are super similar. That being said, I love the casing and the magnetic clasp. Also, the eye shadow goes onto eyelids very smoothly.</li>
            <li> I love the way it applys. I don&#x27;t get how its suppose to smell maybe its just me but I don&#x27;t smell anything and I had my mom and my sister smell it and they didn&#x27;t smell anything either... disappointed me kinda:( But other then that it was alright.</li>
            <li> If amazon allowed half stars, 4.5 would be the true review here.  It&#x27;s almost perfect.  The colors are all beautiful and go together really nicely.  It&#x27;s almost full proof, with this palette, you can&#x27;t go wrong when selecting colors.  I feel this opens up another level of neutrals, as there are some colors not usually included in neutral palettes.  Examples: candied violet, gilded ganache (which is an olive green), cherry cordial (dark burgundy).  It makes for a really fun and playful palette.  The colors are all pigmented and they aren&#x27;t too soft which means this palette will last you!  Other shadows, being buttery and still very high end, can be powdery and break apart easily, which means you&#x27;ll use them faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one big gripe, which everyone else seems to love, is the smell.  I wish mine didn&#x27;t have that overly chocolately smell!!  Other people were saying they smell nothing and I would gladly have that option instead.  The smell in my palette is very overpowering and almost artificial.  In fact, after using the shadows yesterday, my favorite shadow brush still smells of chocolate powder and I just can&#x27;t handle it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, solid packaging, and it&#x27;s adorable.  A nice magnetic closure with very sturdy shadow pans.  Definitely worth the money!  Not to mention I got this for a steal at $30.00!!</li>
            <li> I have quite a few high-end eye shadow palettes, and didn&#x27;t really need another one.  However, watching UTube videos convinced me.  Seeing the swatches, and watching tutorials made me realize what an ideal palette this is.  I believe it would suit all skin tones.  All the colors go together, so you have a wide variety of looks which can be achieved.  Too faced really hit it out of the park with this one!</li>
            <li> I love the colors! A lot of them are very natural against my skin tone and it&#x27;s perfect for everyday makeup. And the best part about this palette is that it really does smell like chocolate!</li>
            <li> Ordered this palette Thursday, Thanksgiving Day and received it today, Cyber Monday. I was so thrilled with how quick shipping was!! Perfect condition, was heavily and carefully wrapped with bubble wrap. And to top it off, it was the slim version of the palette. Which I was pleasantly surprised!! I would have settled for the wider palette since I love these shadows and brand so much. But the slimmer one is much more practical IMO and takes less room on my vanity. The only thing I would suggest for the seller is to clarify that the palette is in fact the slimmer palette. Because I took a whim and expected the heftier one. But again LoVED that I got the skinny one. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> It is fake motha fuckas</li>
            <li> My favorite palette, and I am a makeup junkie! I bought this from HSN during a a sale. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months, so I feel comfortable reviewing it. I&#x27;m going to review each color individually, by row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Row 1&lt;br /&gt;Gilded Ganache- dark olive brown with gold sparkles. Pigmented and smooth, little fallout.&lt;br /&gt;White Chocolate- matte neutral cream, great base color or brow bone highlight. Medium pigmentation, silky texture.&lt;br /&gt;Milk Chocolate- matte warm brown, no orange tones, texture is smooth and color applies evenly.&lt;br /&gt;Black Forest Truffle- deep, plummy chocolate with copper sparkle. Medium pigmentation, this color is a bit more chalky than others in the palette, but application is not too bad. There is a bit of sparkle fallout with this one, too, so it&#x27;s more of a nighttime color.&lt;br /&gt;Triple Fudge- dark blackened warm brown. A bit powdery, makes a good liner color.&lt;br /&gt;Salted Caramel- matte medium warm clay brown. Smooth and evenly pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;Marzipan- champagne with a satin sheen. Smooth texture, good pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;Semisweet- medium/dark neutral brown, a bit powdery, good pigmentation and blendability, though.&lt;br /&gt;Strawberry Bon Bon- matte pale cool pink. Chalky if overapplied, medium pigment.&lt;br /&gt;Candied Violet- blue toned violet with pink sparkle. As with the other sparkle shades, there is a tendency for fallout. Medium pigment and quite blendable.&lt;br /&gt;Amaretto- browned raisin color with copper shimmer. Great pigment, blends easily.&lt;br /&gt;Hazelnut- medium bronze shimmer with a bit of gold sparkle. Applies well and has medium pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;Creme Brulee- aged gold with a golf metallic finish. Great pigment, buttery application.&lt;br /&gt;Haute Chocolate- medium metallic chocolate brown with a bronze sheen. Great pigmentation and smooth application.&lt;br /&gt;Cherry Cordial- dark opaque brown/wine matte with a hint of sparkle, the sparkle do not translate on the skin. This one applies patchy as a shadow color, but is fantastic as a liner, just like triple fudge. Amazing for green or hazel eyes!&lt;br /&gt;Champagne Truffle- super pale pink with a pale gold shimmer. Sheer shimmer shade for highlighting brow bone or inner corners, or just an all over shimmer wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the shades are 0.03oz except White Chocolate and Champagne truffle, which are 0.10oz. For reference, a MAC or Urban Decay single shadow is 0.05oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shadows in this palette ARE chocolate scented, so if you are sensitive to scented products, avoid this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I love the mix of mattes, shimmers and sparkles, and how easily this palette moves from day to night.</li>
            <li> Smells like cocoa, colors are spectacularly beautiful, and if you put on your eyeshadow with your mouth open, you even get a bit of a sweet taste. My favorite eyeshadow palette ever.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful but look at that insert. I&#x27;ve looked up how to spot a fake and it seems legit minus this insert. What the heck? Does anyone have an answer for this?</li>
            <li> Authentic product. Would buy again from seller. Thank you</li>
            <li> I cant believe it came in a week earlier than expected !! Im excited to use it but the corners of the palette is kinda scratched but its ok as long as the inside were fine</li>
            <li> Dear beautiful, sweet, amazing smelling &amp;#34;bar&amp;#34; of eyeshadow....where have you been all my life??? I was hesitant to purchase this as the price tag gave me a bit of a cringe, but I am really glad that I did. It has a range of tones that make day to night VERY easy to switch up, and I love that it goes on exactly as thick or thin as you load your brush. You wont find this one bleeding all over your face like with cheaper brands. The color goes on smoothly, and stays all day. I apply around 8am and usually don&#x27;t come back in until around 8pm and my eyes usually still look amazing. The basic colors and added extra tones have made this pretty much the only palate I use anymore, its very versatile and matches just about everything in my closet. Perfect for work or night. And can we please talk about how amazing this smells??? Literally, like a chocolate bar. Best beauty purchase so far!</li>
            <li> shipping was fast. I love it!</li>
            <li> Took a month to get to me. One of the eyeshadows was cracked and there was eyeshadow dust everywhere. Product is made of cocoa and should smell like chocolate. This did not. Im questioning its authenticity.</li>
            <li> At first I was so skeptical about buying this product but its really awesome and I love it. I ise it all the time. Most practical pallette.</li>
            <li> the only reason i did not give this a five star review is that compared to the naked 2 palette by urban decay it is not as nice color wise. the palette itself is wonderful and for those who are wondering i did indeed receive the real palette it is not a knockoff. when applying i did notice a small amount of fallout which is natural nothing major though. i used the urban decay primer and the shadow easily adhered to it and lasted all day. i actually had to scrub vigorously to get if off.the cocoa powder in it dose smell quite a bit and i actually had someone tell me i smelled like brownies. this is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love. Perfect colors. Smells amazing!!! You can find lots of different looks and tutorials on YouTube.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd one I have ever purchased. It doesn&#x27;t smell like chocolate and the pigment does not last but a few hours of wear.  I compared it to the remnants of the one I bought at Ulta 3 years ago and its just not the same quality.  If I ever purchase this product again,  I will purchase from the store so I can check its authenticity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, order fulfillment and shipping times were excellent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the slimmer version I received it smells like chocolate... Great colours...</li>
