            <li>I love this product and could wear it every day.</li>
            <li>This is her best perfume yet but definitely not a summer scent.</li>
            <li>its ok.  </li>
            <li>i love the package though.  </li>
            <li>I love it, one of my favs.</li>
            <li>floral yet fruity and seductively sexy.</li>
            <li>So, I was in love with this perfume.</li>
            <li>i love it...</li>
            <li>I have purchased this perfume at the department store and it was a better value at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and the packaging, but the bottle seemed like some of the fragrance had been used.</li>
            <li>The bottle is lovely, packaging excellent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>scent lasts all day and is lovely way to smell .</li>
            <li>Love this .</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still a very good product especially at the price it was offered for.</li>
            <li>and its huge :)</li>
            <li>Not to strong or over powering.</li>
            <li>This product has a wonderful scent that last all day thus it stays in your clothes this is a hot item</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly!</li>
            <li>Smells fabulous</li>
            <li>It smelt cheap at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Like headache causing cheap.</li>
            <li>love it,smell good,i recomend the product to any one it good and smell good,you will enjoy it and buy next time</li>
            <li>delivery was fast!!!</li>
            <li>this by far is the best one simply because the smell lasts for a longggg time and stays on your clothes also.</li>
            <li>, I love Beyonce, so I had to have it, but it&#x27;s a sweet smell if you don&#x27;t use to much  #Beyonce</li>
            <li>but it smells good and last all day</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a little sweet but really nice!</li>
            <li>price and scent is great but 2 day shipping not available since it has chemicals.</li>
            <li>no where near as many as Heat Rush or Pulse...</li>
            <li>If I was to recommend a perfume that is tasteful, sexy, and classy go with Heat Rush or Pulse...</li>
            <li>I love the seductive sexy smell but it does not last long and could be alittle more announced.</li>
            <li>I thought I loved the previous Beyonce Heat</li>
            <li>Beyonce should keep that fragrance dont change any thing about it but make it aliitle more announced and longer lasting then</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely looking forward to buying more from you in the future</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t explain the smell of it, but it smells really goood.</li>
            <li>thanks for the samples</li>
            <li>Smelling it straight out of the bottle gave me a headache.</li>
            <li>Smells nice but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>the bottle is only about 1/2 full.</li>
            <li>I reminds me of a older woman&#x27;s fragrance scent.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this fragrance since it is not one I normally wear.  </li>
            <li>It is more flower type fragrance, but not elegant or fruity...</li>
            <li>This was a Christmas gift for my 17 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>The scent of the perfume was good, but the bottle seemed like the fragrance had been used, it had two fingers of space, so I think that&#x27;s unfair.</li>
            <li>It smells ok, I hate that I couldn&#x27;t smell it before I bought it, you don&#x27;t have to spray a lot , or I think I will be to strong</li>
            <li>A little goes along way , so you don&#x27;t have to use much .</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Smells nice but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> A very beautiful fragrance once you put it on!  I thought I loved the previous Beyonce Heat but this is becoming my favorite!  Everyone has been asking me what perfume I am wearing, so I know it&#x27;s not just my imagination that it smells nice!</li>
            <li> its ok.  the perfume could be stronger.  i love the package though.  delivery was fast!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent but the bottle is only about 1/2 full.</li>
            <li> Perfect scent for an intimate date night. I love it, one of my favs. It smells so good... floral yet fruity and seductively sexy. I was only disappointed that the bottle was not filled to the tippy top, instead it appeared just as it looks in the picture above.</li>
            <li> I bought this over Marc Jacobs! So, I was in love with this perfume. However, at the end of the day is when I regretted not getting the Marc Jacobs as planned :( It smelt cheap at the end of the day. Like headache causing cheap. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get home and take my clothes off. I wanted to rid myself of this smell</li>
            <li> It smells ok, I hate that I couldn&#x27;t smell it before I bought it, you don&#x27;t have to spray a lot , or I think I will be to strong, I love Beyonce, so I had to have it, but it&#x27;s a sweet smell if you don&#x27;t use to much  #Beyonce</li>
            <li> I was hesitant in buying this perfume but am happy with the purchase. This has the best fragrance ever.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little skeptical that it would not\\&quot;smell the same as my sanples so I kept some of it just to check. When it got here n DID smell just like it I was extatic! I was also skeptical to order from nywhere other than amazin but now not so much!thank u amazon and purfume world I even got 10% off next purchace from purfume world ill definatlly b returning</li>
            <li> Beautiful sent for cooler weather during the night, however it doesn&#x27;t last long, it&#x27;s like a body mist not a perfume.</li>
            <li> i love it... thanks for the samples</li>
            <li> i like it, i recommend any man to buy it for his wife</li>
            <li> I have purchased this perfume at the department store and it was a better value at Amazon. I bought two of them for the same price as one was at other stores</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because I have mixed feelings about this product. I love the scent and the packaging, but the bottle seemed like some of the fragrance had been used. I would only suggest this product to someone on a budget.</li>
            <li> The bottle is lovely, packaging excellent.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is exceptional, sweet but not cloying.&lt;br /&gt;The scent lasts all day and is lovely way to smell .</li>
            <li> Love this . A little goes along way , so you don&#x27;t have to use much . Very nice tones to it ...</li>
            <li> love it,smell good,i recomend the product to any one it good and smell good,you will enjoy it and buy next time</li>
            <li> Smelling it straight out of the bottle gave me a headache. When I sprayed it on me and allowed it to mix with my body chemistry...I still didn&#x27;t like it. I reminds me of a older woman&#x27;s fragrance scent. I will not be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Product as described! Shipped quickly! Great price!</li>
            <li> This is the best of her fragrances to date.  It lasts longer than the other two and my fiance loves the smell.  I will be definitely buying this again.</li>
            <li> The scent of the perfume was good, but the bottle seemed like the fragrance had been used, it had two fingers of space, so I think that&#x27;s unfair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this fragrance and I&#x27;m one happy customer. I will order from this site again.</li>
            <li> I love the seductive sexy smell but it does not last long and could be alittle more announced. Beyonce should keep that fragrance dont change any thing about it but make it aliitle more announced and longer lasting then it will be a five</li>
            <li> This product has a wonderful scent that last all day thus it stays in your clothes this is a hot item</li>
            <li> I have had Heat, Heat Rush, and Pulse...This perfume wasn&#x27;t the best...I have some complements, but no where near as many as Heat Rush or Pulse...The perfume isn&#x27;t long lasting and the smell itself is somewhat not fresh fragrance...It is more flower type fragrance, but not elegant or fruity...If I was to recommend a perfume that is tasteful, sexy, and classy go with Heat Rush or Pulse...I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy this one again...</li>
            <li> The bottle was not full</li>
