            <li>THE OILS BURNS VERY QUICKLY AND DO NOT HAVE A FULL AROMATIC EFFECT....</li>
            <li>The picture is as I received a different brand than Edens Garden (which I love), yet the product is still a nice scent</li>
            <li>i love them all and are very high quality.  </li>

            <li>An easy transaction, my order arrived on time, and I got exactly what the description said I was getting.</li>
            <li>The oil quickly became sticky and clogged up opening.</li>

            <li>Myrrh is exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>I really like Myrrh, and as far as I can tell, this is nice product with the effects I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>so I am not dissatisfied just confused, LOL!</li>
            <li>and this is a nice traditional (biblical) oil.</li>
            <li>this myrrh is a great deal and is rather hard to find.  </li>
            <li>I use 5 drops of each in hot water and soak for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>It was ontime and the image displayed in the advertisement was exactly what i received.  </li>

            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so gullible it isn&#x27;t even funny.  </li>
            <li>And the product itself looked to be exactly what it said.  </li>
            <li>Delivered on time bottles are nice and dark to protect the oils inside.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really used it much so</li>
            <li>Bought this and many other oils for the wife.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Myrrh has had countless uses throughout history, and this is a must-have for me.  I like that Edens Garden has thereapeutic grade essential oils.  An easy transaction, my order arrived on time, and I got exactly what the description said I was getting.</li>
            <li> I really like Myrrh, and as far as I can tell, this is nice product with the effects I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> i purchased this oil with a ultimate essential oil set by the same company.  i love them all and are very high quality.  this myrrh is a great deal and is rather hard to find.  only thing i would warn about is that the oil is really thick.  i knew that when i purchased it, but have had friends that didnt know what to expect.  very nice.</li>
            <li> we use this all the time in a diffuser. blissful.</li>
            <li> The best myrrh I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Used with my oil pulling</li>
            <li> Fabulous oil!  Put it in my skin care products.</li>
            <li> Myrrh is exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> Love it! I&#x27;m using this oil for skin care. I can&#x27;t wait to see how it does in the long run.</li>
            <li> I have ordered several different essential oils from Eden Gardens  and the quality seems to be really good in all of them.</li>
            <li> The picture is as I received a different brand than Edens Garden (which I love), yet the product is still a nice scent so I am not dissatisfied just confused, LOL! None the less a great product.</li>
            <li> I use this with Eden&#x27;s Garden frankincense essential oil whenever I have time to relax in the bath. I use 5 drops of each in hot water and soak for 15 minutes. I come out feeling and smelling heavenly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried using just one drop for perfume on my wrists and neck. This might not be a good idea for those with sensitive skin, but I love it! The scent will stay with me for several hours, which is more than I can say for the store-bought, expensive, chemical-laden perfumes.</li>
            <li> Got them for home made scented candles for Christmas, but love it so much, may buy more just for wearing and having for myself.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t consider my review, I just don&#x27;t want to be unfair with the manufacturer, but Amazon sent me Mirtle oil instead of Myrrh. Mirtle is OK but not what I ordered.</li>
            <li> The five star rating reflects the quality of the product and the timeliness in which it was shipped.  It was ontime and the image displayed in the advertisement was exactly what i received.  The item  I wanted is what I got.  I would reccomend the product to anyone interested in this product line.  I was not dissapointed.</li>
            <li> True fragrance and a holy oil.  Brings the  blessings of God and the Angels to those who use it.  I could not be without it.</li>
            <li> Love Edens Garden oils!</li>
            <li> Have been using for a while now and love this company, never a problem, always great quality. Delivered on time bottles are nice and dark to protect the oils inside. You will not go wrong.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality oil, I use it on my face and it help my skin, very nourishing, will buy again, thanks</li>
            <li> I have arthritis in my hands, saw on TV that it helps arthritis not so not your fault for seling.</li>
            <li> What can you say about oil, it arrived in great condition, none of it leaked, and it was great for what I needed it for.</li>
            <li> This oil is very thin.</li>
            <li> I use myrrh for an antiseptic on my skin and sores. The myrrh works great.</li>
            <li> Edens Garden never disappoints! I bought this as an anointing oil but it can be used for many different things. Just another great oil to add to my collection! :)</li>
            <li> Great oil to use on temples--or palms to help you relax.</li>
            <li> Just as I thought it would be. I like to try new things and make soap and spays and message oils and this is a nice traditional (biblical) oil.</li>
            <li> Buen aroma. Facil de utilizar</li>
            <li> The myrrh oil helped the children in my Children&#x27;s Church class understand the gifts that the wise men brought to Jesus.</li>
            <li> THIS LINE OF THERAPEUTIC OIL BURNING IS NOT TO MY LIKING ... THE OILS BURNS VERY QUICKLY AND DO NOT HAVE A FULL AROMATIC EFFECT....</li>
            <li> Works brilliantly on my gums. I use it daily and now that I&#x27;ve started, I won&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> The oil quickly became sticky and clogged up opening. Haven&#x27;t really used it much so don&#x27;t know what effects it has at this point.  I&#x27;m still learning how to use oils.</li>
            <li> Bought this and many other oils for the wife.  I am thoroughly impressed with the quality of Edens Gardens Essential Oils.  They seem to utilize excellent extraction procedures as well as quality control in the manufacture of their products.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend to anyone interested in essential oils.</li>
            <li> hope it works to get rid of toe nail fungus that nothing has worked</li>
            <li> Just used it twice mixed with frankincense on my feet and ears. seems to be effective as the MLM type brands</li>
            <li> A healing oil good for easing stress. I add a few drops to my bath to help me sleep. Loving this! Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so gullible it isn&#x27;t even funny.  On the Dr. Oz Show myrrh oil was recommended for canker sores, of which I am susceptible - much more so since I got Invisalign.  So I willy-nilly buy this myrrh oil hoping it will help my canker sores.  Well, the stuff tastes horrendous and smells worse.  The odor sticks to the glass it was in and won&#x27;t come out.  And I can only imagine what one&#x27;s breathe would smell like after having used this substance once or twice.  Just one whiff and I wanted to toss my breakfast.  Whether this works or not, I have no idea.  And the product itself looked to be exactly what it said.  If you&#x27;re thinking about purchasing this - give a thought to the rank smell.  Ick. I would give it one star but I don&#x27;t wish to reflect badly on the vendor, so I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars.  But never again would I purchase myrrh oil from anyone.</li>
