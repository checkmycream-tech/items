            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>I say all this to say how great this particular product is.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s nice and clean smelling).</li>
            <li>Luckily I found the deodorant here :)</li>
            <li>Goes on clear, smells good and not too strong.  </li>
            <li>i smells great and last me about a year.</li>
            <li>I needed something to qualify for free shipping.</li>
            <li>Always loved the Old Spice Products.</li>
            <li>Smells great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Goes on practically clear, has a nice fresh scent and doesn&#x27;t stain what more could you want.</li>
            <li>Old Spice seems to be holding up better than those of us who have used it for many decades.  </li>
            <li>Good scent, Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I like the new shape better anyways.</li>
            <li>My favorite old spice scent and deodorant.</li>
            <li>This one works great for sweaty people who usually smell - like me.</li>
            <li>It provides pretty good protection from sweat except for on exceptionally hot and muggy days (think Florida) and even then still smells good.</li>
            <li>Has a fresh, clean masculine scent that lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this exact deodorant for probably a decade now.</li>
            <li>I keep using this because I have actually gotten many compliments on my cologne when in actuality its just this deodorant.</li>
            <li>Bottom line, I would absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Great stuff and lasts at least 6 months +</li>
            <li>I will always use this for hot days and sports because it lasts longer than any deoderant I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 31 and been using this deodorant for about ten years now and love it.</li>
            <li>Came quick, Brand new.</li>
            <li>So, I also tried some natural deodorants, and quite frankly my armpits smell better sans-deodorant than they did with every natural brand I tried.</li>
            <li>Girls always tell me I smell good, hug me extra long.</li>
            <li>but I really didn&#x27;t feel comfortable wearing just a white shirt.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works ALL day.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly, sweating actually enhances the scent makes it more masculine, at least in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly and does not feel chalky like regular antiperspirants.</li>
            <li>These guys really like this scent</li>
            <li>Definitely one of the better Old Spice products.</li>
            <li>The smell is terrific, by far my favorite from deodorant to date and the lady lovese it too.</li>
            <li>It lasts extremely long, smells manly, and is fairly cheap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lasts a decent amount of time too</li>
            <li>Naturally they still charge the same which I think is taking advantage of loyal customers that probably won&#x27;t even notice it.</li>
            <li>but the smell does die down pretty quick.</li>
            <li>it MUST be old spice!</li>
            <li>It is different feeling wetness when I sweat intensely (for instance during a workout), but that is the difference in an antiperspirant and a deodorant.</li>
            <li>If it looks like old spice and smells like old spice...</li>
            <li>All day long, even after sweating, I can only smell the deodorant scent  when doing a quick sniff under the arm.</li>
            <li>I was a little self conscious at first, and did frequent sniff tests.</li>
            <li>The Old Spice antiperspirant that I was using was starting to become ineffective at odor control (I&#x27;ve read you can become immune to deodorant, perhaps that was the case) and was causing me to itch.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Old Spice recently changed the shape of the stick and went down to 3oz from 3.5oz while keeping the price the same, but hey that&#x27;s inflation.</li>
            <li> (looks the same except has a grey cap).  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really no need to wear the other old spice scents or competing value brands.  </li>
            <li> I tried a couple of (well actually every) other brands and had problems ranging from itching to clumped and matted armpit hair to BO in the middle of the day.</li>
            <li> As some other deodorant only brands I have tried only masked/mixed with the BO</li>
            <li> If I wouldn&#x27;t look strange, I&#x27;d probably voluntarily do a pit-check every 10 minutes</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 5 years and will continue to do so as long as this scent is being produced.</li>
            <li> Other than the fact it keeps my pits dry; I like the smell</li>
            <li> NOT happy that OLD SPICE is screwing the customer now by lowering the amount of deodorant to only 3.0 oz.</li>
            <li> Definitely not as strong as traditional deodorant</li>
            <li> Larger size thank I usually get at Target or Wal-Matt</li>
            <li> for performance, I&#x27;ve found it has outlasted any other brand of deodorant I&#x27;ve tried and is less noticeable on my armpits.</li>
            <li> I would wholly recommend this for everyday usage and even heavy activity related.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the last few times I tried to buy in the store, I accidentally bought the anti-persperant</li>
            <li> was lazy and thought i would just order it online..</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand for the past five years and plan to keep using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to stop using antiperspirant for a while as the idea of clogging pores seems unhealthy.</li>
            <li> Spice is a leader in this game.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with deodorant.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> BOOM! this suff works!</li>
            <li> This is the best scent I have ever smelled. It&#x27;s like cinnamon sugar wrapped in love and awesomeness with a dusting of powdered sugar and delicious sexyness &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> This is literally the best deodorant in the world. Girls always tell me I smell good, hug me extra long. Even my sisters compliment me on it. I&#x27;ve been using this exact deodorant for probably a decade now.</li>
            <li> Absolute best value deodorant.  There&#x27;s really no need to wear the other old spice scents or competing value brands.  People have asked me what brand of cologne I wear but I tell them it&#x27;s just Aqua Reef deodorant.</li>
            <li> Good protection, pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Came quick, Brand new. 5/5 would order again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s deodorant. What can I say.  Good scent, Lasts a long time. it&#x27;s good stuff. And the scent isnt over powering.</li>
            <li> Goes on clear, smells good and not too strong.  One thing I didn&#x27;t like about it is that it would leave blue marks on the arm pits of my white shirts. It always washes out but I really didn&#x27;t feel comfortable wearing just a white shirt. Definitely not as strong as traditional deodorant but it also doesn&#x27;t leave white chuncks in your arms. I ended up switching to a non-irratating deodorant because my arms started getting irritated.</li>
            <li> Definitely one of the better Old Spice products. If I wouldn&#x27;t look strange, I&#x27;d probably voluntarily do a pit-check every 10 minutes just so I can get a whiff of this majestic scent.</li>
            <li> I keep using this because I have actually gotten many compliments on my cologne when in actuality its just this deodorant. Couldn&#x27;t find it at the store the last time so Amazon took care of me.</li>
            <li> Always loved the Old Spice Products.</li>
            <li> Larger size thank I usually get at Target or Wal-Matt</li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried this product. The Old Spice antiperspirant that I was using was starting to become ineffective at odor control (I&#x27;ve read you can become immune to deodorant, perhaps that was the case) and was causing me to itch. I tried a couple of (well actually every) other brands and had problems ranging from itching to clumped and matted armpit hair to BO in the middle of the day. I&#x27;ve wanted to stop using antiperspirant for a while as the idea of clogging pores seems unhealthy. So, I also tried some natural deodorants, and quite frankly my armpits smell better sans-deodorant than they did with every natural brand I tried. I say all this to say how great this particular product is. I&#x27;ve not had any itching problems, it doesn&#x27;t make my pit hair clump, and the scent is awesome (it&#x27;s nice and clean smelling). It is different feeling wetness when I sweat intensely (for instance during a workout), but that is the difference in an antiperspirant and a deodorant. It also controls odor well. As some other deodorant only brands I have tried only masked/mixed with the BO I was a little self conscious at first, and did frequent sniff tests. All day long, even after sweating, I can only smell the deodorant scent  when doing a quick sniff under the arm. I have woken up a couple of times and detected a hint of BO that wasn&#x27;t there when I went to bed, but it wasn&#x27;t noticeable unless you did a &amp;#34;sniff-check,&amp;#34; and I take a shower in the morning anyway, so I don&#x27;t deem that a problem or weakness of the product. Bottom line, I would absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Cheap and smells good.</li>
            <li> Husband loves the product and the seller is efficient.</li>
            <li> Gel Deodorants are the best. They don&#x27;t get all clumpy under your pit if your sweating or moving around. This stuff really works ALL day.  Great stuff and lasts at least 6 months +&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old Spice is a leader in this game. I would recommend any out of the red zone collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a guy  28 and love it!</li>
            <li> Has a fresh, clean masculine scent that lasts throughout the day. Surprisingly, sweating actually enhances the scent makes it more masculine, at least in my opinion. It glides on smoothly and does not feel chalky like regular antiperspirants. I have been using this for 5 years and will continue to do so as long as this scent is being produced.</li>
            <li> Smells great and lasts a long time. I will always use this for hot days and sports because it lasts longer than any deoderant I&#x27;ve ever had. I like Arm and Hammer for every day things but sometimes that deoderant doesn&#x27;t do it for my sweaty pits. This one works great for sweaty people who usually smell - like me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31 and been using this deodorant for about ten years now and love it. It smells great and really works! It lasts all day and prevents sweat odors or stains. Old Spice recently changed the shape of the stick and went down to 3oz from 3.5oz while keeping the price the same, but hey that&#x27;s inflation. I like the new shape better anyways. Goes on practically clear, has a nice fresh scent and doesn&#x27;t stain what more could you want. Recommended!</li>
            <li> The best deodorant i wear every day #1</li>
            <li> These guys really like this scent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this deodorant. It has been my go to choice for the last several months and it has been great. The smell is terrific, by far my favorite from deodorant to date and the lady lovese it too. It provides pretty good protection from sweat except for on exceptionally hot and muggy days (think Florida) and even then still smells good. The deodorant is made of a gel type consistency and three ounces makes it able to go on a plane. If you&#x27;re still on the fence just go ahead and buy it.</li>
            <li> I met my wife while wearing this ... it&#x27;s her favorite smell on me and one she always asks me to wear.  Unfortunately the last few times I tried to buy in the store, I accidentally bought the anti-persperant (looks the same except has a grey cap).  I don&#x27;t like white anti-persperant and the smell isn&#x27;t the same.  Luckily I found the deodorant here :)</li>
            <li> was lazy and thought i would just order it online.. i smells great and last me about a year. same as the ones you would buy at Walmart.</li>
            <li> I needed something to qualify for free shipping. Can&#x27;t go wrong with deodorant.</li>
            <li> Very nice smell. I love it.</li>
            <li> My favorite old spice scent and deodorant. The smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> Awesome smell, very tropical but not overbearing. I would wholly recommend this for everyday usage and even heavy activity related.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a decent amount of time too but the smell does die down pretty quick. It&#x27;s a deodorant not a cologne so it&#x27;s sufficient.</li>
            <li> This does what it needs to do and my wife loves the smell. I have been using this brand for the past five years and plan to keep using it.</li>
            <li> The king of Deodorants.  Forget the awesome commercials they have, I have been using this stuff since I was a teenager and have been complimented on the smell all of my life.  It lasts extremely long, smells manly, and is fairly cheap.</li>
            <li> Other than the fact it keeps my pits dry; I like the smell</li>
            <li> Smells great and best part is its only Deodorant. Not anti-precipitant.</li>
            <li> If it looks like old spice and smells like old spice... it MUST be old spice! Except... it&#x27;s at a great price here on Amazon! Great product!</li>
            <li> Old Spice seems to be holding up better than those of us who have used it for many decades.  This one is a winner.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent and I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores.  Thankfully amazon had it for a good price and free shipping :D.&lt;br /&gt;As for performance, I&#x27;ve found it has outlasted any other brand of deodorant I&#x27;ve tried and is less noticeable on my armpits.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. NOT happy that OLD SPICE is screwing the customer now by lowering the amount of deodorant to only 3.0 oz. Naturally they still charge the same which I think is taking advantage of loyal customers that probably won&#x27;t even notice it.</li>
