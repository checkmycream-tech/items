            <li>I love the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I love this powder and will be getting more and more and more....</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a better container, this was cardboard, I don&#x27;t now how this will stand up in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>it smells like jasmine, which i love, but isn&#x27;t overpowering</li>
            <li>so this was a safe buy.</li>
            <li>I would have preferred a more intense jasmine scent myself, but she&#x27;s happy with it and that&#x27;s what counts.</li>
            <li>Absolutely wonderful powder and scent!I especially love how soft this powder feels on my skin and creates such a lovely aroma and soothing feel after my bath!I will be ordering more in the future!</li>

            <li>I little fruity but very fine and nice</li>
            <li>Dusting powder I think is useful to anyone.</li>
            <li>Drying on hot days.</li>
            <li>I found Red Door worked better.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light and soft</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading my review!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last long on its own (I probably should have the lotion too), but I enjoy the indulgence of puffing it on from time to time.</li>
            <li>The smell was a little strong and the packaging is only good for putting it in one place and leaving it there.</li>
            <li>Very vintage&amp;chic.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brand and of course, highly recommend Jasmine whose flowers are as much of a fragrant delight as is this dusting powder.</li>
            <li>Not too strong with a Jasmine or (like the Pikake in Hawaii) and slightly woodsy scent.</li>
            <li>This is exactly the fragrance that I was looking for in white jasmine.</li>
            <li>Soft, silky, intensely fragrant, there is no way you can find anything critical to say about this dusting powder.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It helped keep me kool but didn&#x27;t like the smell too old for me.</li>
            <li>not as soft scented as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Surprising how difficult it is to find something as simple as a powder puff in pharmacies or department stores.</li>
            <li>The jasmine scent is pretty muted (at least relative to real jasmine flowers)</li>

            <li> Woods of Windsor make Jasmine smell better.  Soft, silky, intensely fragrant, there is no way you can find anything critical to say about this dusting powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way.  Fragrance last for hours.  Drying on hot days. (currently 103 where I live)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never knew there was a quality difference in dusting powders.  buying and using this from Woods of Windsor taught me the difference.  I highly recommend this brand and of course, highly recommend Jasmine whose flowers are as much of a fragrant delight as is this dusting powder.</li>
            <li> This is exactly the fragrance that I was looking for in white jasmine. It doesn&#x27;t last long on its own (I probably should have the lotion too), but I enjoy the indulgence of puffing it on from time to time. It&#x27;s really nice for these hot Texas days.</li>
            <li> my friend like this very much nice thank you</li>
            <li> It helped keep me kool but didn&#x27;t like the smell too old for me. I found Red Door worked better.</li>
            <li> This was for my niece, I have not talked to her yet.  This was a little something extra with her gift.  Dusting powder I think is useful to anyone.</li>
            <li> I little fruity but very fine and nice</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful powder and scent!I especially love how soft this powder feels on my skin and creates such a lovely aroma and soothing feel after my bath!I will be ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance.  It&#x27;s not overwhelming like some powders.  I am really enjoying it very much!  I use it every day.</li>
            <li> The powder smell is not that nice.  I thought it would last longer.  The price is in line, if you like the smell.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping! Awesome smelling product!!! I love this powder and will be getting more and more and more....This powder has a light scent that is addicting!!</li>
            <li> Hate the packaging. Smells good but I&#x27;m afraid the top is going to break before I finish the powder.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a better container, this was cardboard, I don&#x27;t now how this will stand up in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  Fragrance was not potent at all.  Very expensive.</li>
            <li> I wear this all the time.  it smells like jasmine, which i love, but isn&#x27;t overpowering (my husband would let me know in a heartbeat)... it&#x27;s light and soft</li>
            <li> The smell was a little strong and the packaging is only good for putting it in one place and leaving it there. Mine kind of fell apart so I transferred it to a bottle. I&#x27;ll keep looking, this one isn&#x27;t for me, but it still beats gold bond or baby powder smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my mother. She has a jasmine plant and loves the scent of jasmine so this was a safe buy. The jasmine scent is pretty muted (at least relative to real jasmine flowers) but it&#x27;s there. I would have preferred a more intense jasmine scent myself, but she&#x27;s happy with it and that&#x27;s what counts.</li>
            <li> the fragrance was not me, but I did give it to my mother in law</li>
            <li> made me sneeze while wearing it. not as soft scented as I thought it would be. No, not my scent maybe others would wear this and like it.</li>
            <li> Surprising how difficult it is to find something as simple as a powder puff in pharmacies or department stores. So I bought one from Amazon - puff is a little on the thin side, but being Woods of Windsor, this product exudes quality. Delivered spot on to the anticipated date too. Many thanks...</li>
            <li> I like using body powder with a powder puff rather than just dumping it out of a bottle so this fits the bill.  My only disappointment is that I was hoping that the scent would have been just a bit stronger.  That is only a personal comment though, no fault of the seller or product!  Product came on time, no damage and as stated int he description on-line.</li>
            <li> This powder smells a mazing, it reminds me of the way my mom smelled like when I was little. Very vintage&amp;chic.</li>
            <li> as for the Woods of Windsor  White Jasmine Dusting powder with Puff I was not very impressed because&lt;br /&gt;you could hardly smell a scent.  I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> smells a little stale</li>
            <li> I really liked putting on this powder. It makes you feel special.&lt;br /&gt;You ladies out there know what I mean! You know that you smell good.&lt;br /&gt;All you have to do is see for your self. But do not forget the name of it.&lt;br /&gt;And buy it on Amazon.  Thanks for reading my review!</li>
            <li> This is perfect. Not too strong with a Jasmine or (like the Pikake in Hawaii) and slightly woodsy scent. Perfect after a shower.</li>
            <li> She loved it. zzzzz eeertr tyhgt errty wweer thyju erfdsc edrfgh ertgbh hnjmk  hkjly&lt;br /&gt;trfgd&lt;br /&gt;fbghnj&lt;br /&gt;ghbgh&lt;br /&gt;ghjkl&lt;br /&gt;hhnng&lt;br /&gt;gnhjmk</li>
