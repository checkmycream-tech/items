            <li>Three light settings are great.</li>
            <li>Love this mirror good magnification.</li>
            <li>It looks nice in my bathroom with my nickel fixtures.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to just tap and make the thing brighter.</li>
            <li>the light is nice and bright on the highest level.</li>
            <li>Love the touching control!  </li>
            <li>It sounded like a good idea, but mirror light turns off at the lightest touch.</li>
            <li>Its a nice size and love the magnification</li>
            <li>Nice, but too easy to turn off.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I bought iy</li>
            <li>-  sooo glad I purchased it -  </li>
            <li>I love this mirror.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a lighted mirror for my vanity for a couple years and just hesitated buying one because I wasn&#x27;t sure if when I received it that it would meet my needs and expectations.</li>
            <li>My favorite option is the touch feature.</li>
            <li>I love the satin nickel finish.  </li>
            <li>I really love my mirror.</li>
            <li>It is okay</li>
            <li>this thing looks nice with a really clean finish.</li>
            <li>I wanted another Conair because the prices were more reasonable and the size of the mirror and magnification were good.</li>
            <li>I can put my make up on and clean my face very easy now with this mirror.</li>
            <li>I love the &#x27;touch&#x27; light to make it brighter or duller.</li>
            <li>very well constructed and of good value.</li>
            <li>Makes it so easy to turn on and off.</li>
            <li>Easily adjustable to see every angle of face  </li>
            <li>This mirror has a 30x magnification with a touch control for the light.</li>
            <li>, I think this is a fine product and would recommend it for a room with already adequate lighting.</li>
            <li>The first Zadro mirror I used had what I thought was a defective light switch.  </li>
            <li>I like the &amp;#34;Day Light&amp;#34; color much better than this one which is kind a dim and yellow .</li>
            <li>This was a great price, although it seems high for just a mirror with greater magnification but all the close competitors I found on Amazon were more expensive.</li>
            <li>The size of the entire mirror itself and height are also good, not too obtrusively huge on your vanity but not so tiny you have to keep moving your face around just to see anything.</li>
            <li>Very high tech!  </li>
            <li>I saw this mirror at a local store and was able to try it out before buying.  </li>
            <li>I can use the mirror without the use of my reading glasses which makes applying eye makeup so much easier for my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; eyes!</li>
            <li>so I decided to try this Conair model after reading positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy, fits well in a modern bathroom.</li>
            <li>My last Conair beauty mirror lasted about 8 years and had a knob to adjust the brightness of the light which broke about 3 years ago</li>
            <li>I wanted it for the vanity table in my bathroom, but it takes up the whole counter.  </li>
            <li>I really like the mirror</li>
            <li>The touch control is very convenient.  </li>
            <li>For the first week, I thought all was fine, but then the second mirror started behaving just like the first one: It mysteriously turns itself on.</li>
            <li>Plus when the light actually came on, the lighting was dim, and required external lighting to be able to see, especially at an 8x level.</li>
            <li>The mirror itself could be a bit bigger but is an adequate size.</li>
            <li>but it is not enough light by which to see very well (especially for those individuals who are at the beginning stages of cataracts).  </li>
            <li>Other than that, this mirror is just fine.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how I could jury rig it; just have to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>(I live alone, so I know that no one is playing tricks on me.)</li>
            <li>Also, the cord is black and very long which for me does not work because I have a white vanity top and my outlet it right there.  </li>
            <li>however, the light stopped working after a few weeks of owning it.</li>
            <li>She uses it daily and really likes it.  </li>
            <li>But to return to Conair would cost me shipping (not cheap, since this thing is big), so Amazon was nice enough to send me a brand-new replacement.</li>
            <li>I have two different models from Conair that are nearly the same but the other one has a &amp;#34;Day Light Bulb&amp;#34; in it .  </li>
            <li>Love that you just touch the base to change the light setting.  </li>
            <li>I replaced it with a second that had the same issue as the first one after less than a year.  </li>
            <li>I got the mirror to turn on and off twice by touching the base, and then that was the end of that, no matter how many times or how hard or soft the touch.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> touch sensor is sensitive and gets a little hot.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Works exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom who is in her mid-50&#x27;s and is starting to have trouble seeing.</li>
            <li> I see several complaints about this mirror, although the touch sensitivity can be annoying I really love this mirror.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t hard to turn on or anything, just irritating when I am right in the middle of putting on my makeup.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the light is not bright enough for me.  </li>
            <li> other than that</li>
            <li> I went into ultra the other day</li>
            <li> The mirror bends, but you have to hold it with one hand while putting make up on the other.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that the highest setting is not very bright.  </li>
            <li> It makes me a little nervous, if/when that touch control breaks</li>
            <li> and the light turns off because of the stupid touch switch .</li>
            <li> This was one of the few mirrors that had ample magnification.</li>
            <li> Trouble is, the switch (capacitive touch) has problems:</li>
            <li> Plus, considering how long my last one limped along, I can&#x27;t say anything bad about the company.</li>
            <li> No more looking for the switch to turn it on.  </li>
            <li> also - adds  a little class to a very usual bathroom decor</li>
            <li> Only the bottom part of the base does that, not the vertical handle or anything above.</li>
            <li> I could hardly see</li>
            <li> It always seems to happen in the afternoon, and it doesn&#x27;t consume much power, so I&#x27;ll probably keep the darn thing -- but it is annoying.</li>
            <li> I barely touch the base and off</li>
            <li> I need to use this in a poorly lit room</li>
            <li> it may be the bulb, it may be the touch switch, either way, i&#x27;m not happy with it at all.</li>
            <li> If I had to do over, I would buy the one with an actual on off switch at the base...</li>
            <li> I also hope there are no issues down the road with the base that prevent the mirror from lighting.  </li>
            <li> Different settings of lighting just by tapping your fingers on the base!</li>
            <li> I called Conair tech support about this, and they said there&#x27;s something wrong with it -- i.e., it shouldn&#x27;t be doing that.</li>
            <li> I was done with this brand and did not want to order yet another expensive mirror</li>
            <li> The touch base is a little annoying.</li>
            <li> Three taps of the base reach the highest setting.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been looking for a brushed nickel magnifying mirror for the makeup counter in my master bathroom.  I saw this mirror at a local store and was able to try it out before buying.  I can use the mirror without the use of my reading glasses which makes applying eye makeup so much easier for my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; eyes!</li>
            <li> Love the touching control!  Makes it so easy to turn on and off. Three light settings are great. Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The magnifying side  is perfect for my aging eyes.  Love that you just touch the base to change the light setting.  Works exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> this is a well made quality mirror.  Unfortunately the light is not bright enough for me.  I need to use this in a poorly lit room and it just does not have enough oomph.  other than that, I think this is a fine product and would recommend it for a room with already adequate lighting.</li>
            <li> This was one of the few mirrors that had ample magnification. Well done. This mirror has a 30x magnification with a touch control for the light.</li>
            <li> I got the mirror to turn on and off twice by touching the base, and then that was the end of that, no matter how many times or how hard or soft the touch.  Plus when the light actually came on, the lighting was dim, and required external lighting to be able to see, especially at an 8x level.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this mirror!  Very good lighting and the magnification is great!  Very happy with it!...good price for the quality.  Attractive design.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom who is in her mid-50&#x27;s and is starting to have trouble seeing. She loves this mirror and no longer has to strain with make up application!</li>
            <li> Works great. Well made. It is very sturdy, fits well in a modern bathroom. I am glad I bought iy</li>
            <li> This mirror is quality, and for a great price. I went into ultra the other day and they were $80.</li>
            <li> It sounded like a good idea, but mirror light turns off at the lightest touch. Have to turn it on several times while in use.</li>
            <li> Very high tech!  Magnifies wonderfully!  You see everything!  Different settings of lighting just by tapping your fingers on the base!</li>
            <li> Love this mirror good magnification. the light is nice and bright on the highest level. It looks good on a vanity table too.</li>
            <li> My last Conair beauty mirror lasted about 8 years and had a knob to adjust the brightness of the light which broke about 3 years ago so I plugged it in to turn it on. Finally the magnification side got so cloudy I could hardly see and I knew I had to bite the bullet. I wanted another Conair because the prices were more reasonable and the size of the mirror and magnification were good. Plus, considering how long my last one limped along, I can&#x27;t say anything bad about the company. This was a great price, although it seems high for just a mirror with greater magnification but all the close competitors I found on Amazon were more expensive. The magnification is very good, both sides are useful and the adjustable brightness is plenty bright although I use it in a room with additional lighting. The size of the entire mirror itself and height are also good, not too obtrusively huge on your vanity but not so tiny you have to keep moving your face around just to see anything. The touch base is a little annoying. Sometimes I accidentally bump it and turn it off but it&#x27;s not a big deal, you just touch it again to turn it back on. It will take some getting used to. Only the bottom part of the base does that, not the vertical handle or anything above. It makes me a little nervous, if/when that touch control breaks I don&#x27;t know how I could jury rig it; just have to buy a new one. Overall, anyone who puts on makeup in the morning will appreciate this beauty mirror and it&#x27;s a value.</li>
            <li> I have two different models from Conair that are nearly the same but the other one has a &amp;#34;Day Light Bulb&amp;#34; in it .  I like the &amp;#34;Day Light&amp;#34; color much better than this one which is kind a dim and yellow . My girl friend also does not like it because she puts it in her lap to do her make up and every time it moves she stops it and the light turns off because of the stupid touch switch .</li>
            <li> this thing looks nice with a really clean finish. however, the light stopped working after a few weeks of owning it. it may be the bulb, it may be the touch switch, either way, i&#x27;m not happy with it at all.</li>
            <li> Easily adjustable to see every angle of face  -  sooo glad I purchased it -  This is a very good looking mirror also - adds  a little class to a very usual bathroom decor</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for my wife.  She uses it daily and really likes it.  I wish it had a battery option to make it easier, but I didn&#x27;t see one like it with that option.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror. I had a similar touch control mirror once before and then switched to another type. I decided to go back to the touch control mirror and found this one. It&#x27;s the best mirror I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> I see several complaints about this mirror, although the touch sensitivity can be annoying I really love this mirror.</li>
            <li> I like the style, size, magnification, and lighting of this mirror a lot. Trouble is, the switch (capacitive touch) has problems: It sometimes turns on by itself, with no one in the house. (I live alone, so I know that no one is playing tricks on me.) I called Conair tech support about this, and they said there&#x27;s something wrong with it -- i.e., it shouldn&#x27;t be doing that. But to return to Conair would cost me shipping (not cheap, since this thing is big), so Amazon was nice enough to send me a brand-new replacement. For the first week, I thought all was fine, but then the second mirror started behaving just like the first one: It mysteriously turns itself on. It always seems to happen in the afternoon, and it doesn&#x27;t consume much power, so I&#x27;ll probably keep the darn thing -- but it is annoying. I&#x27;ve got to believe Conair has a design or construction problem with this mirror.</li>
            <li> This is a great mirror if you have the room for it.  It is very deep (the mirror part itself is about 4 inches).  I wanted it for the vanity table in my bathroom, but it takes up the whole counter.  Also, the cord is black and very long which for me does not work because I have a white vanity top and my outlet it right there.  I really like the mirror it is very nice but I might end up exchanging it for a smaller battery operated mirror.</li>
            <li> Wish the cord was detachable. Other than that, this mirror is just fine.</li>
            <li> Its a nice size and love the magnification but I still need an extra lamp as don&#x27;t feel it lights up enough.</li>
            <li> Great lighting. Works like a charm!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and in good condition&lt;br /&gt;The touch sensor is sensitive and gets a little hot.&lt;br /&gt;I like how it&#x27;s double sided</li>
            <li> Good product, delivered on time!</li>
            <li> Nice, but too easy to turn off.  I barely touch the base and off it goes.  It isn&#x27;t hard to turn on or anything, just irritating when I am right in the middle of putting on my makeup.  If I had to do over, I would buy the one with an actual on off switch at the base...still a great mirror with great lighting :)</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a lighted mirror for my vanity for a couple years and just hesitated buying one because I wasn&#x27;t sure if when I received it that it would meet my needs and expectations. This one is perfect! The 3 light settings are perfect for any lighting situation and the magnification options are great! My favorite option is the touch feature. I don&#x27;t have to have the cord laying out and be searching for the on/off switch. So much better!</li>
            <li> very well constructed and of good value. A must for her vanity used as a makeup tool.....and I approve the results.</li>
            <li> This mirror is perfect.  I love the satin nickel finish.  It looks nice in my bathroom with my nickel fixtures.  The touch control is very convenient.  No more looking for the switch to turn it on.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I really love my mirror. I can put my make up on and clean my face very easy now with this mirror.</li>
            <li> The first Zadro mirror I used had what I thought was a defective light switch.  I replaced it with a second that had the same issue as the first one after less than a year.  I was done with this brand and did not want to order yet another expensive mirror so I decided to try this Conair model after reading positive reviews.  The mechanism by which one turns it on is great.  Three taps of the base reach the highest setting.  The only problem is that the highest setting is not very bright.  It is okay but it is not enough light by which to see very well (especially for those individuals who are at the beginning stages of cataracts).  I also hope there are no issues down the road with the base that prevent the mirror from lighting.  The mirror itself could be a bit bigger but is an adequate size.</li>
            <li> The mirror bends, but you have to hold it with one hand while putting make up on the other. Smaller mirror than I had hoped for</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to just tap and make the thing brighter. The quality is great and is a good size mirror! She is a make-up addict and she just loves this mirror! Great buy!</li>
            <li> Great mirror! See the future of your face. I love the &#x27;touch&#x27; light to make it brighter or duller. Well made, as well.</li>
