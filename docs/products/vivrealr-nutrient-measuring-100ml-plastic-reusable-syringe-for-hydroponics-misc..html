            <li> this was larger than I expected and won&#x27;t work for what I wanted it for</li>
            <li> altho it says it is for single use I expect it is reusable with water soluble liquids</li>
            <li> I have since found that West Marine sells 10 oz empty caulking tubes that are specifically meant to be used for dispensing epoxy&#x27;s and caulk&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> The included vinyl tubing is rather stiff and low quality</li>
            <li> Other than that...</li>
            <li> but nonetheless I can use it for other projects.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the wait.</li>
            <li> ...........mine came broken......</li>
            <li> The tip of this syringe is difficult to attach to the end of a catheter.</li>

            <li> Exactly what I needed.  Good movement.</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews. I end up getting a syringe from my veterinarian. Not worth the wait. Coming from overseas.</li>
            <li> It may be a fine product but be prepared to wait...and wait..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed this syringe to dispense a tinted caulk around my kitchen sink. The estimated arrival date is almost a full month after my order date.. I have since found that West Marine sells 10 oz empty caulking tubes that are specifically meant to be used for dispensing epoxy&#x27;s and caulk&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> After a while,  the round handle piece breaks and the numbers completely rub off easily.</li>
            <li> love it, done their jobs. and cheap.</li>
            <li> We have a vegetable patch in our backyard courtesy of my mother and she&#x27;s going to love this!</li>
            <li> Good size just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I use this to remove kerosene from oil lamps which are used during electrical blackouts.  Works as expected.</li>

            <li> Good product,fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I use this for medical purposes. The tip of this syringe is difficult to attach to the end of a catheter. Other than that...I love that it holds a larger volume!</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPING GOOD PRICE GOOD QUALITY</li>
            <li> Product came in a timely manner and was well packaged. I am using this product to administer correct dosage of wormer to my dogs and am pleased with the product for this purpose.</li>
            <li> JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR, GREAT FOR GETTING THE EPOXY RESIN MIXTURE INTO PLACES THAT ARE HARD TO REACH</li>
            <li> this was larger than I expected and won&#x27;t work for what I wanted it for but nonetheless I can use it for other projects.  it is very sturdy and the rubber washer on the plunger makes a good seal.  two sized tips and cap. mine is exactly as pictured. it was shipped from China and arrived earlier than predicted. altho it says it is for single use I expect it is reusable with water soluble liquids</li>
            <li> Great product. Timely shipping.</li>
            <li> Good. Easy to use, of good quality, and it was sealed.</li>
            <li> use it for my fish tank water chemicals</li>
            <li> ...........mine came broken......top edge that you hold onto to pull out the plunger........plunger works but the top edge is VERY sharp. i don&#x27;t want to pay the postage - otherwise i&#x27;d send it back.</li>
            <li> The syringe itself is fine but not as pictured with a closed loop on the plunger. The plunger just has a flat end like most syringes. The included vinyl tubing is rather stiff and low quality but I did not need to use it for what I needed anyway.</li>
            <li> Worked great for my Halloween prop.</li>
            <li> Works just fine, took forever came from china.</li>
            <li> Just the medium I needed for a proper  indoor watering. Very useful for small plants. Love it.</li>
            <li> Great product... handy for measuring nutrients for hydroponics solution.  Shipping is very slow compared to most other purchases made on Amazon, but don&#x27;t give up...it will get there in about 10 days.</li>
            <li> I hope to use soon, to see if this will work with what I had intended to use it for.</li>
            <li> good quality has tip adapter- long ship time but its worth it</li>
            <li> Great Tool for stuff and things like that</li>
