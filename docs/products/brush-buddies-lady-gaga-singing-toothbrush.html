            <li>Runs around the apt dancing while she brushes her teeth.</li>
            <li>I love my toothbrush, it feels good while brushing</li>
            <li>The songs are just spectacular.</li>
            <li>They are the best part of both songs and the brush is very loud.</li>
            <li>it offers a great guide to keep at it!</li>

            <li>Good quality and very fun to use.</li>
            <li>She has enjoyed using it at friends and the sound is pretty good for a toothbrush!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a hilarious gift.</li>
            <li>Also, I could see it encouraging better hygiene.</li>
            <li>just an ok buy.</li>
            <li>Overall, very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I think she brushes more with the singing brush.</li>
            <li>Sure, you may need to replace the battery (or just buy another) at some point, but what do you expect.</li>
            <li>If I could give this more stars I would.</li>
            <li>Cute.</li>
            <li>Hilarious gift idea for any Lady Gaga lover.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for.</li>
            <li>The Lady Gaga Singing Toothbrush is a gift for my daughter, but I know she will love it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than a toothbrush you would</li>
            <li>, what more can I ask for,lol....</li>
            <li>its also a WWAAAYYY better value then toothtunes (which u cannot replace the heads or batteries).</li>
            <li>So glad I purchased this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels better</li>
            <li>Plays two songs in full very loud so awesome!</li>
            <li>He reported that he loved it and found it to be funny yet practical,</li>
            <li>Definitely a unique gift!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this!  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is very cool.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect wonderful sound quality as it&#x27;s just a tiny, cheap speaker.</li>
            <li>My sister loved it so much she showed it to all her friends.</li>
            <li>Well worth it! :-)</li>
            <li>Gaga can make anything more fun - including brushing your teeth!</li>
            <li>I like that the replacement heads and batteries are easy to find on here</li>
            <li>the brush worked fine for about a month, but the speaker messed up.</li>
            <li>I also have braces and the brush works just fine.</li>
            <li>However the item worked fine.</li>
            <li>and it seems to work fine.  </li>
            <li>I really like it and hope I find more!</li>
            <li>im a little monster, so i had to get this toothbrush and its awesome.</li>
            <li>I got it and it was flawless, the songs are loud and the brush is soo soft.</li>
            <li>so I know how it should fit.</li>
            <li>It was shipped in an lightly padded envelope from China and while not overtly damaged, seems insufficient to ship half-way across the world.  </li>
            <li>and I enjoy brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li>but even after changing that, the sound is all distorted.  </li>
            <li>She wants more as she gifted all of them.</li>
            <li>In that regard it succeeds wildly.</li>
            <li>Super cute gift and a fun have for all you little monsters, but the sound quality is not the greatest.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super cute to see them having fun as they take care of their baby teeth.</li>
            <li>Fun though!</li>
            <li>He loves her and thought I was a cute funny idea.</li>
            <li>This brush is really fun!</li>
            <li>The most amazing part about this toothbrush is that it plays the entire songs - not just clips.</li>
            <li>Each song was 2 minutes as it said, and the sound quality was nice and loud.  </li>
            <li>The brush itself is very soft and curved nicely.</li>
            <li>I needed an awesome bday present for a totally cool 6 year old.</li>
            <li>It makes brushing my teeth more fun and more obnoxious to the people I live with.</li>
            <li>That doesnt seem like a good move for the company, to basically only make some of the product available.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super cool</li>
            <li>It certainly makes brushing your teeth more fun.</li>
            <li>Overall my daughter likes it, just wish better quality and better packaging.</li>
            <li>The company was no help when I called, although Amazon replaced it quickly.  </li>
            <li>Works really well, the songs are plenty loud enough, and what a great price!</li>
            <li>Product is ok, but it needs new batteries.  </li>
            <li>I know now that I will need them for sure), and are not expensive and that this was the same price pretty much as any good toothbrush.</li>
            <li>the head of the brush is made very well, like a higher end toothbrush, which is even better.</li>
            <li>so if you&#x27;re into having modern looking toothbrushes, this will fit your requirements.</li>
            <li>A fun way to start the day.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s well worth the money IMHO.</li>
            <li>Loads of fun.</li>
            <li>For kids of all ages who like Lady Gaga, this is a fun stocking stuffer.&lt;br /&gt;Puts</li>
            <li>a smile on people&#x27;s faces.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is fun-</li>
            <li>the shipping was pretty quick as well.</li>
            <li>the As Seen on TV section in the drug store and put it on my wish list right away.</li>
            <li>I bought one from a store last year that fit fine</li>
            <li>very good brush lady gaga as usual novelty, highly recommend are very modern, containing songs</li>
            <li>This is great for him because he insists on brushing during the entire song so instead of the 10 seconds that you can normally get a 6 year old to brush, he is brushing for minutes!</li>
            <li>Brushing her teeth is now a fun thing to do not so much a chore anymore.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work from the first day...</li>
            <li>pretty to look at</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>really funny novelty gift idea</li>
            <li>Solid construction replaceable brush head, free when u register ur brush!</li>
            <li>besides the speaker/music part of the brush, the brush itself is pretty durable.</li>
            <li>The first one I received did not work, but I was able to get it replaced, and the replacement came the next day.</li>
            <li>, she brushes her teeth about 7/8 times a day now,i have to tell her its too much!</li>
            <li>this brush buddies was 1/3 the price of a tooth tunes and brush buddies offers you a FREE set of 2 replacement heads and a pack of batteries but just putting ur address in on their website.</li>
            <li>Got this for a friend who is leaving town soon, First one arrived in non-working condition, ordered a replacement</li>
            <li>I got myself one of these as well (not Justin bieber though lol), and really like it a lot, I like the brush head better than my old more expensive tooth brush head!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected and I love it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really get it for the toothbrush quality, but to mimic a microphone.  </li>
            <li>Stopped working very soon after it was opened.</li>
            <li>Do I really need to review?</li>
            <li>Cannot get over how much a song while u brush ur teeth</li>
            <li>Was a very neat idea, but the songs both do not play well.</li>
            <li>she has never fussed about brushing her teeth, always has for some reason even done it without even being asked, so that&#x27;s not been a problem, but now she just loves the toothbrush she wants to brush too much.</li>
            <li>highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know if I really wanted to put something with the name &#x60;Gaga&#x27; into my mouth</li>
            <li>And really wanted to get myself one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Should have bought two since now her sister wants one.</li>
            <li>Also, the toothbrush is very sleek looking</li>
            <li>The cheek cleaner works really well.</li>
            <li>However, after only about a week or 2, the sound got messed up.  </li>
            <li>The volume isn&#x27;t too loud, just right.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun, different, and it works.</li>
            <li>I was told getting a new battery would help.</li>
            <li>I thought it would have more recent music and the sound seems weak.</li>
            <li>Very loud and gets my daughter in the mood to brush.... / dance.</li>
            <li>bristles are VERY soft</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 7 year old nephew and he loves it!  </li>
            <li>it does play 2 full songs, (the 2 listed), and is easy to turn on and off, just push one button for one song, and push it again to turn it off, push the other button for the other song, and again to turn off, or just switch the song by pushing the other button, very easy, even for a little kid.</li>
            <li>i dont think it is completely waterproof</li>
            <li>so if you have sensitive gums like me-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still sitting in my bathroom because I&#x27;ll still keep it as a loyal Little Monster...</li>
            <li>But none the less, a fun item to have.</li>
            <li>(: was much nicer quality than I expected for the price</li>
            <li>The song is long so it kinda helps you know how long you should be brushing for ;)&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It makes brushing my teeth more fun and more obnoxious to the people I live with.</li>
            <li> That doesnt seem like a good move for the company, to basically only make some of the product available.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Super cool</li>
            <li> It certainly makes brushing your teeth more fun.</li>
            <li> Overall my daughter likes it, just wish better quality and better packaging.</li>
            <li> The company was no help when I called, although Amazon replaced it quickly.  </li>
            <li> Works really well, the songs are plenty loud enough, and what a great price!</li>
            <li> Product is ok, but it needs new batteries.  </li>
            <li> I know now that I will need them for sure), and are not expensive and that this was the same price pretty much as any good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> the head of the brush is made very well, like a higher end toothbrush, which is even better.</li>
            <li> so if you&#x27;re into having modern looking toothbrushes, this will fit your requirements.</li>
            <li> A fun way to start the day.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s well worth the money IMHO.</li>
            <li> Loads of fun.</li>
            <li> For kids of all ages who like Lady Gaga, this is a fun stocking stuffer.&lt;br /&gt;Puts</li>
            <li> a smile on people&#x27;s faces.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is fun-</li>
            <li> the shipping was pretty quick as well.</li>
            <li> the As Seen on TV section in the drug store and put it on my wish list right away.</li>
            <li> I bought one from a store last year that fit fine</li>
            <li> very good brush lady gaga as usual novelty, highly recommend are very modern, containing songs</li>
            <li> This is great for him because he insists on brushing during the entire song so instead of the 10 seconds that you can normally get a 6 year old to brush, he is brushing for minutes!</li>
            <li> Brushing her teeth is now a fun thing to do not so much a chore anymore.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work from the first day...</li>
            <li> pretty to look at</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> really funny novelty gift idea</li>
            <li> Solid construction replaceable brush head, free when u register ur brush!</li>
            <li> besides the speaker/music part of the brush, the brush itself is pretty durable.</li>
            <li> The first one I received did not work, but I was able to get it replaced, and the replacement came the next day.</li>
            <li> , she brushes her teeth about 7/8 times a day now,i have to tell her its too much!</li>
            <li> this brush buddies was 1/3 the price of a tooth tunes and brush buddies offers you a FREE set of 2 replacement heads and a pack of batteries but just putting ur address in on their website.</li>
            <li> Got this for a friend who is leaving town soon, First one arrived in non-working condition, ordered a replacement</li>
            <li> I got myself one of these as well (not Justin bieber though lol), and really like it a lot, I like the brush head better than my old more expensive tooth brush head!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected and I love it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really get it for the toothbrush quality, but to mimic a microphone.  </li>
            <li> Stopped working very soon after it was opened.</li>
            <li> Do I really need to review?</li>
            <li> Cannot get over how much a song while u brush ur teeth</li>
            <li> Was a very neat idea, but the songs both do not play well.</li>
            <li> she has never fussed about brushing her teeth, always has for some reason even done it without even being asked, so that&#x27;s not been a problem, but now she just loves the toothbrush she wants to brush too much.</li>
            <li> highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know if I really wanted to put something with the name &#x60;Gaga&#x27; into my mouth</li>
            <li> And really wanted to get myself one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Should have bought two since now her sister wants one.</li>
            <li> Also, the toothbrush is very sleek looking</li>
            <li> The cheek cleaner works really well.</li>
            <li> However, after only about a week or 2, the sound got messed up.  </li>
            <li> The volume isn&#x27;t too loud, just right.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun, different, and it works.</li>
            <li> I was told getting a new battery would help.</li>
            <li> I thought it would have more recent music and the sound seems weak.</li>
            <li> Very loud and gets my daughter in the mood to brush.... / dance.</li>
            <li> bristles are VERY soft</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 7 year old nephew and he loves it!  </li>
            <li> it does play 2 full songs, (the 2 listed), and is easy to turn on and off, just push one button for one song, and push it again to turn it off, push the other button for the other song, and again to turn off, or just switch the song by pushing the other button, very easy, even for a little kid.</li>
            <li> i dont think it is completely waterproof</li>
            <li> so if you have sensitive gums like me-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still sitting in my bathroom because I&#x27;ll still keep it as a loyal Little Monster...</li>
            <li> But none the less, a fun item to have.</li>
            <li> (: was much nicer quality than I expected for the price</li>
            <li> The song is long so it kinda helps you know how long you should be brushing for ;)&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> she brushes her teeth much longer than she had been in the past.</li>
            <li> but it didnt mess up when it came into contact with water the first few times.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re about two minutes long</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anybody that has a kid that doesn&#x27;t want to brush their teeth, cus now they will, also to any Justin fan, and there are other brush buddies that are of different singers,so if not Justin you can get someone else.</li>
            <li> Also, I misheard Gaga&#x27;s song bad romance as bathroom dance on more than one occasion.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, gave it away.</li>
            <li> Now another one of the brushes has stopped working after minimal use.  </li>
            <li> the batteries for this item were dead when it arrived, BUT amazon paid for me to return it and mailed me another one before i even sent the 1st one back.</li>
            <li> It is extremely helpful at getting her to brush her teeth for the correct amount of time.</li>
            <li> Not very good, music stopped working within the first month, just all around poor toothbrush.</li>
            <li> especially when toddler hands are hard at work.</li>
            <li> and the batteries are not fresh.  </li>
            <li> This was a lot of fun to give because my daughter looked at me like I was crazy.</li>
            <li> Thumbs down.  </li>
            <li> and it was just a mess.</li>
            <li> The songs are each 2 minutes and it made me realize how little I&#x27;ve been brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> The box was a little beat up.</li>
            <li> Works well, kids like it, though one of the two toothbrushes I ordered came with a dead battery.</li>
            <li> I had trouble attaching the toothbrush to the part that plays music but figured it out.</li>
            <li> so they were dead when the package arrived.</li>
            <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is gold and black!</li>
            <li> Disappointed that I spent so much money on these.</li>
            <li> The tooth brush was obviously not made to be near water. :(</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t get much use out of it :(</li>
            <li> But it is hard to find batteries.</li>
            <li> Brush did not fit into base properly</li>
            <li> after removing the batteries it got worse, the speed increased and lady gaga sounded like a chipmunk.</li>
            <li> Batteries not working, bad quality, horrible sound.</li>
            <li> It smells very bad  in only 2 days, themusic is very bad quality and the battery life only lasted 1 week.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> so if you&#x27;re cutting corners on the brushing like I must&#x27;ve been-</li>
            <li> The box was worn and tattered which was disappointing because ordered this as a gift for a friend.  </li>
            <li> Bad material, don&#x27;t let the brush pictures fool you</li>
            <li> it is really bad.</li>
            <li> The brush comes loaded with two songs: Bad Romance and Born This Way.</li>
            <li> Bad Romance and BTw j</li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bought this for my 7 year old nephew and he loves it!  I didn&#x27;t really get it for the toothbrush quality, but to mimic a microphone.  The volume isn&#x27;t too loud, just right.  Don&#x27;t expect wonderful sound quality as it&#x27;s just a tiny, cheap speaker. Fun though!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister, who loves Lady Gaga.  Put it in as a gag gift with tickets to her show!  She loved it!  Def recommend.</li>
            <li> These are a buck at the dollar store!</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is gold and black! It sings Gaga! You can&#x27;t go wrong. It&#x27;s a hilarious gift. Also, I could see it encouraging better hygiene.</li>
            <li> The song is long so it kinda helps you know how long you should be brushing for ;)&lt;br /&gt;Great present for any Lady Gaga fan. It&#x27;s fun, different, and it works.</li>
            <li> Works well, kids like it, though one of the two toothbrushes I ordered came with a dead battery.</li>
            <li> I thought it would have more recent music and the sound seems weak. just an ok buy. Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> My niece LOVED this - she is a huge fan!</li>
            <li> My niece loves this! It is extremely helpful at getting her to brush her teeth for the correct amount of time. Brushing her teeth is now a fun thing to do not so much a chore anymore.</li>
            <li> This gift was accepted with much happiness.  My daughter gave this to her best friend, who is a Huge Lady GaGa fan.  They was so happy!  Very pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> Gave to my grand niece, she loved it!</li>
            <li> Brush did not fit into base properly I bought one from a store last year that fit fine so I know how it should fit.</li>
            <li> Well it&#x27;s a toothbrush that plays Lady Gaga songs. Exactly what I expected and I love it. It makes brushing my teeth more fun and more obnoxious to the people I live with. I had trouble attaching the toothbrush to the part that plays music but figured it out. Overall, very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Did not like this toothbrush at all. Got it as a gift for a LG fan in the house and it was a flop. Stopped working very soon after it was opened.</li>
            <li> Batteries not working, bad quality, horrible sound. Bad material, don&#x27;t let the brush pictures fool you it is really bad. I hate it. It doesn&#x27;t even sing... Didn&#x27;t work from the first day...</li>
            <li> A fun way to start the day. Also, I misheard Gaga&#x27;s song bad romance as bathroom dance on more than one occasion.</li>
            <li> My teenager loves it.  I think she brushes more with the singing brush.</li>
            <li> Bought two.  One worked and one did not.  Shipping is from China and takes awhile.  It was shipped in an lightly padded envelope from China and while not overtly damaged, seems insufficient to ship half-way across the world.  Overall my daughter likes it, just wish better quality and better packaging.</li>
            <li> My toddlers sing to Lady Gaga every time they brush their teeth. It&#x27;s super cute to see them having fun as they take care of their baby teeth. Sure, you may need to replace the battery (or just buy another) at some point, but what do you expect. Nothing lasts forever. ...especially when toddler hands are hard at work. I&#x27;ve bought two sets of these and it&#x27;s well worth the money IMHO.</li>
            <li> This is the second toothbrush we have ordered and both stopped working in 2 weeks. Shame on me for being fooled twice. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Oh my great love this toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;was delievered earlier than expected&lt;br /&gt;has a great sound to it&lt;br /&gt;and pretty to look at</li>
            <li> My sister loved it so much she showed it to all her friends. Works really well, the songs are plenty loud enough, and what a great price!</li>
            <li> The batteries used in this are watch batteries. There was no film placed between the batteries so they were dead when the package arrived. It also takes THREE batteries. The company did give me $3 back but that wasn&#x27;t enough to cover the cost.</li>
            <li> Do I really need to review? This is amazing. DO NOT hesitate.</li>
            <li> Didnt work when i got it.</li>
            <li> Loads of fun. Drives my husband bonkers. Well worth it! :-)</li>
            <li> This is so unique and so great! If I could give this more stars I would. If you are a GaGa fan put this on your list.</li>
            <li> im a little monster, so i had to get this toothbrush and its awesome. its a great price and im happy i got it. the shipping was pretty quick as well. thanks!</li>
            <li> Loved giving my sister this gift - we are huge Gaga fans! The brush comes loaded with two songs: Bad Romance and Born This Way. Gaga can make anything more fun - including brushing your teeth!</li>
            <li> I got this for a Christmas gift and he loved it. really funny novelty gift idea (: was much nicer quality than I expected for the price</li>
            <li> very good brush lady gaga as usual novelty, highly recommend are very modern, containing songs Bad Romance and BTw j</li>
            <li> This is working to well. Keeps on singing to us even after a month, lol. Very loud and gets my daughter in the mood to brush.... / dance. Cute.</li>
            <li> Bought the lady gaga brush for my boyfriend. He loves her and thought I was a cute funny idea. He takes it in the shower. The brush has great sound nothing to complain about for two weeks. One day I was home alone and the brush went off in the bathroom. I go and turn it off and 20 min later it goes off again. It scared me of course but this time I took it apart and it was just a mess. The batteries were swimming in water and toothpaste inside. The tooth brush was obviously not made to be near water. :(</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, gave it away.</li>
            <li> Found this and justin bieber toothbrush at 99 cent only store for 99 cents!!! Score</li>
            <li> was shipped to me fast and was perfect!</li>
            <li> Brush is great works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Was bought as a gift for friend they loved it.&lt;br /&gt;Had no problems since buying it.</li>
            <li> Great idea for any gaga fan! Plays two songs in full very loud so awesome! Solid construction replaceable brush head, free when u register ur brush! Cannot get over how much a song while u brush ur teeth can start ur day off  so great!</li>
            <li> Super cute gift and a fun have for all you little monsters, but the sound quality is not the greatest. But none the less, a fun item to have.</li>
            <li> Product is ok, but it needs new batteries.  I purchased this as a gift and the package does not say what type of batteries it takes nor does their website offer any info on the matter either.  Guess I&#x27;ll wait till after Christmas.</li>
            <li> For kids of all ages who like Lady Gaga, this is a fun stocking stuffer.&lt;br /&gt;Puts a smile on people&#x27;s faces.</li>
            <li> Gift for my girlfriend, she loves it!  Runs around the apt dancing while she brushes her teeth. Hilarious gift idea for any Lady Gaga lover.</li>
            <li> the brush worked fine for about a month, but the speaker messed up. i dont think it is completely waterproof but it didnt mess up when it came into contact with water the first few times. after removing the batteries it got worse, the speed increased and lady gaga sounded like a chipmunk. besides the speaker/music part of the brush, the brush itself is pretty durable.</li>
            <li> Mother in law in Japan keeps asking me to buy this.  Bought her several already.  She wants more as she gifted all of them.</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom and it was an amazing stocking stuffer! Love the song and she loves using it!</li>
            <li> This was sent as a gift to a friend. He reported that he loved it and found it to be funny yet practical,</li>
            <li> I love this! It is so cute and is perfect for a Lady Gaga fan! The first one I received did not work, but I was able to get it replaced, and the replacement came the next day.</li>
            <li> I got what I asked for and it came when they said I would get it.  What more could you ask for.</li>
            <li> The Lady Gaga Singing Toothbrush is a gift for my daughter, but I know she will love it.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I bought several of these for our family (Lady Gaga and LMFAO).  One of the brushes stopped working after 2 uses.  The company was no help when I called, although Amazon replaced it quickly.  Now another one of the brushes has stopped working after minimal use.  I have a feeling these brushes have been sitting around in Amazon&#x27;s stock for awhile and the batteries are not fresh.  Disappointed that I spent so much money on these.</li>
            <li> My sister loves this tooth brush. She scares herself sometimes forgetting that it sings. Good quality and very fun to use.</li>
            <li> Bought the Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber toothbrush. Was a very neat idea, but the songs both do not play well. They songs played very quietly and they were kinda off. I was told getting a new battery would help. But it is hard to find batteries. I gave it 3 stars because the idea was awesome.</li>
            <li> Saw this at best buy and decided to find it for cheaper online. Super cool and it made a great gift.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 5 year old who loves to dance to lady gaga and after getting it wet one time she stopped singing.  The Battery cover is not designed properly for something that is supposed to used in and around water!</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter, yes she is a Justin bieber fan, and she just loves it, she brushes her teeth about 7/8 times a day now,i have to tell her its too much! she has never fussed about brushing her teeth, always has for some reason even done it without even being asked, so that&#x27;s not been a problem, but now she just loves the toothbrush she wants to brush too much. I recommend this to anybody that has a kid that doesn&#x27;t want to brush their teeth, cus now they will, also to any Justin fan, and there are other brush buddies that are of different singers,so if not Justin you can get someone else. I like that the replacement heads and batteries are easy to find on here (im going to go ahead and get some cus I know now that I will need them for sure), and are not expensive and that this was the same price pretty much as any good toothbrush. the head of the brush is made very well, like a higher end toothbrush, which is even better. it does play 2 full songs, (the 2 listed), and is easy to turn on and off, just push one button for one song, and push it again to turn it off, push the other button for the other song, and again to turn off, or just switch the song by pushing the other button, very easy, even for a little kid. I got myself one of these as well (not Justin bieber though lol), and really like it a lot, I like the brush head better than my old more expensive tooth brush head! highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a sort of gag to keep at my girlfriend&#x27;s apartment so that I can occasionally annoy her. In that regard it succeeds wildly. Also it&#x27;s lasted longer than I initially anticipated.</li>
            <li> Good product. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know if I really wanted to put something with the name &#x60;Gaga&#x27; into my mouth a couple of times a day, but I gave it a try. Besides waking me up in the morning and raising my blood pressure, Gaga&#x27;s voice kills all the bacteria in my mouth when I brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks goodness it&#x27;s not the Justin Bieber toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I searched for  &amp;#34;lady gaga toothbrush&amp;#34; as a joke. And there it was. I needed an awesome bday present for a totally cool 6 year old. I got her this. And really wanted to get myself one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it 4 stars because I could NOT find out how/where to order the replacement heads. That doesnt seem like a good move for the company, to basically only make some of the product available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then when it arrived, I was SO impressed at the sound quality, I almost kept it!</li>
            <li> I got it and it was flawless, the songs are loud and the brush is soo soft. It&#x27;s better than a toothbrush you would but at walmart or something. You get a second head when you register your brush so it&#x27;s awesome! I recommend this.</li>
            <li> This brush is really fun! I saw it in the As Seen on TV section in the drug store and put it on my wish list right away. Santa HOOKED IT UP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are VERY soft so if you have sensitive gums like me- it&#x27;s great. There are two songs, one for morning and one for night- and they&#x27;re about two minutes long so if you&#x27;re cutting corners on the brushing like I must&#x27;ve been- it offers a great guide to keep at it! You can turn the songs off if you&#x27;re in a rush ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is fun- I really like it and hope I find more!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a stocking stuffer for my daughter and she loves it,  she brushes her teeth much longer than she had been in the past.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush stopped singing almost immediately after my daughter started using it.  Thumbs down.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I love my toothbrush, it feels good while brushing and i can listen to a tune while getting my teeth cleaned, what more can I ask for,lol....maybe a vibrating one......it rocks!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Not very good, music stopped working within the first month, just all around poor toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The box was worn and tattered which was disappointing because ordered this as a gift for a friend.  The toothbrush itself was great and my friend liked it.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my girlfriend, and she loved it. Should have bought two since now her sister wants one.</li>
            <li> the batteries for this item were dead when it arrived, BUT amazon paid for me to return it and mailed me another one before i even sent the 1st one back. its also a WWAAAYYY better value then toothtunes (which u cannot replace the heads or batteries). this brush buddies was 1/3 the price of a tooth tunes and brush buddies offers you a FREE set of 2 replacement heads and a pack of batteries but just putting ur address in on their website.</li>
            <li> This was a lot of fun to give because my daughter looked at me like I was crazy. She has enjoyed using it at friends and the sound is pretty good for a toothbrush!</li>
            <li> We got this as a Christmas present for my future nephew and he LOVES it. The most amazing part about this toothbrush is that it plays the entire songs - not just clips. This is great for him because he insists on brushing during the entire song so instead of the 10 seconds that you can normally get a 6 year old to brush, he is brushing for minutes! His teeth are going to be amazing. Also, the toothbrush is very sleek looking so if you&#x27;re into having modern looking toothbrushes, this will fit your requirements.</li>
            <li> I got it as a gift for a family member, worked when it was tested, the receiver loved the gift.</li>
            <li> So glad I purchased this toothbrush. Not only does it look/sound awesome, it also feels awesome. The brush itself is very soft and curved nicely. The cheek cleaner works really well. The songs are just spectacular. They are the best part of both songs and the brush is very loud. The songs are each 2 minutes and it made me realize how little I&#x27;ve been brushing my teeth. My mouth feels better and I enjoy brushing my teeth. I also have braces and the brush works just fine.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is very cool. It plays two of Lady Gaga&#x27;s most popular songs. It certainly makes brushing your teeth more fun.</li>
            <li> It smells very bad  in only 2 days, themusic is very bad quality and the battery life only lasted 1 week.</li>
            <li> its a good product, still working.</li>
            <li> This item arrived on time. The box was a little beat up. However the item worked fine. Definitely a unique gift!</li>
            <li> Got this for a friend who is leaving town soon, First one arrived in non-working condition, ordered a replacement and it seems to work fine.  I just hope it lasts.  For what it is I think it&#x27;s a great gift idea for anyone who likes Lady Gaga.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this!  Each song was 2 minutes as it said, and the sound quality was nice and loud.  However, after only about a week or 2, the sound got messed up.  I thought maybe it was the battery but even after changing that, the sound is all distorted.  It&#x27;s still sitting in my bathroom because I&#x27;ll still keep it as a loyal Little Monster...but I didn&#x27;t get much use out of it :(</li>
            <li> this toothbrush is perfect except it feels kinda cheap</li>
            <li> Hit of the holiday party.</li>
