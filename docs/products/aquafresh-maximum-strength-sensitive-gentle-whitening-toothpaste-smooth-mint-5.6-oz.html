            <li>Best Tasting Toothpaste for Sensitive Teeth</li>
            <li>this toothpaste is great and the price was right.</li>
            <li>No other brand is as best as Aquafresh.............</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I purchased this style of toothpaste many years ago at the suggestion of my dentist.  </li>
            <li>Amazon says I need more words so here</li>
            <li>Now my teeth are much better.</li>
            <li>I also like the flavor better.  </li>
            <li>Glad I can still get this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why they took Aquafresh off the shelves, but glad that Amazon carries it.  </li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>Works OK.</li>
            <li>And Aquafresh produces my favorite flavor toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Glad to find it online.</li>
            <li>while others are available, there&#x27;s nothing more accessible and more effective.</li>
            <li>Great toothpaste for sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>Great toothpaste for sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>I have found it is no longer available in all stores, when I most need it.</li>
            <li>Great if your teeth are sensitive.  </li>
            <li>the best toothpaste for sensitive teeth at a reasonable cost.  </li>
            <li>we love the great minty flavor from aqua fresh sensitive.</li>
            <li>Tastes fine.</li>
            <li>My son encouraged me to join &#x27;Prime&#x27; and it is working out just fine.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste leaves my mouth clean and breath fresh, and the price is low for the awesome quality you get.</li>
            <li>What makes Aquafresh superior is that it has the same great taste of regular Aquafresh and doesn&#x27;t taste like licorice (unlike many of the competitors).</li>
            <li>Worked wonders for my mouth at such a great price.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find it in a store near me, so glad I was able to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>They both taste good and have the sensitive variety as well.</li>
            <li>Aquafresh was that fast!!!  </li>
            <li>But if you want your teeth to FEEL CLEAN use Arm &amp; Hammer toothpastes.</li>
            <li>I have NO dental work of any kind, not even a filling (50 yrs old and still have all my wisdom teeth).</li>
            <li>I liked the toothpaste but had problems with sensitive areas of my teeth again.  </li>
            <li>Your teeth feel so clean and your breath fresh with this product.</li>
            <li>But, remember this is a pretty cheap</li>
            <li>It not only works just as well, but the flavor is better and bolder, leaving your mouth feeling truly clean!</li>
            <li>my wife will not use another toothpaste, this is it, can&#x27;t find it in stores most of the time where I live for some reason (not even at our Wal-Mart).</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>The toothpaste works fine, but I have found that it is much cheaper to walk over to Walmart for this item.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried most of the sensitive teeth toothpastes on the market.</li>
            <li>Aquafresh is my favorite sensitive toothpaste because of the taste.</li>
            <li>my wife&#x27;s favorite toothpaste for her sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly, fresh and well packaged.</li>
            <li>Aquafresh works great for me and is a long term solution to my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>It is far better than Sensodyne and much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I never expected to find so many of the items I have been interested in and looking for on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the taste of other brands&#x27; sensitive toothpastes, so I am happy to find this source.</li>
            <li>Hard to get in stores, making me happy that Amazon can provide.</li>
            <li>everything now seems to have whiteners and that just really increases the sensitivity of my teeth!  </li>
            <li>will definitely order more when needed.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite toothpastes and couldn&#x27;t find it in local stores but there it was on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Now I look first there before shopping elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>I used to be able to buy it at my local Ralphs market</li>
            <li>Be aware.</li>
            <li>I tried many products including Crest but finally found this.  </li>
            <li>It started to work after the first use.  </li>
            <li>Favorite toothpaste &amp; hard to fine in stores!</li>
            <li>Also, the price is generally cheaper than the others, however, it is not often readily available and that is why I bought a bunch of them.</li>
            <li>It has a relatively strong peppermint taste, stronger than Crest regular and much stronger than Colgate.</li>
            <li>Hard to find in the stores, this is by far the best I have used to prevent sensitivity when brushing and the only brand that does not cause issues with the skin tissue in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Very blah and pasty.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really beat that.</li>
            <li>fast shipment.</li>
            <li>Very please with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Its a very beneficial............</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I am very thankful to Amazon to provide me Aquafresh.</li>
            <li>Aquafresh works very well for me.</li>
            <li>very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My own thinking is to purchase multiple products from multiple supplier for toothpaste to get maxmium and balanced effects.</li>
            <li>The price is decent for 4 large tubes, but I would not buy this product again.  </li>
            <li>I notice better results than using any other toothpaste brand alone.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t long before they cancelled it on us and said it would no longer be available.</li>
            <li>For some odd reason the flavor &amp;#34;smooth mint&amp;#34; reminds me more of horseradish in cocktail sauce than it does minty toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like how it feels \\&quot;light\\&quot; when brushing, but that&#x27;s only because I&#x27;m used to super foamy toothpaste like everyone else,</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>There are other sensitive toothpastes that work better, but the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>and he suggested this sensitive toothpaste as a way not only to clean my teeth, but to build up the resistance of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>The flavor is not that great; it tastes like stale mint.  </li>
            <li>I have to be careful what kind of toothpaste I get and many of the sensitive ones have &#x27;whitening&#x27; in them which cancels out the sensitive part, at least for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Aquafresh is both better tasting and cheaper than Sensodyne, and yet it seems to have the same good effect at taming the cold sensitivity of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find good old toothpaste...</li>
            <li>The best toothpaste, not sure why not available in local stores</li>
            <li>Although the active ingredient for sensitivity is the same as listed on the ingredients for both toothpastes, the Aquafresh seems to work great for me but the other one didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth and gums</li>
            <li>In other words, I do not notice any significant reduction in sensitivity, or any increase in whitening.  </li>
            <li>Why pay more for other products that are similar??  </li>
            <li>My husband, who normally prefers crest complete, has also switched to this, and mentioned his teeth are not as sensitive either.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it isn&#x27;t so strong and harsh a taste, so I like that.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this on to anyone looking for a sensitive toothpaste with a pleasant taste that doesn&#x27;t make your mouth feel weird either.</li>
            <li>Has worked well for years on sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>Aquafresh works as well as any of them, when it comes to cleaning teeth and protecting sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I like the smell and its effects on my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I had problems finding this in the store and had run out, so I decided to buy the Crest &amp;#34;equivalent&amp;#34; for sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive teeth, but since I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste, I don&#x27;t have this problem anymore.  </li>
            <li>Takes away the pain from my sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>Helps sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>If we really want to take care of our teeth &amp; find solution to our mouth problems just go for only this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I have used both Aquafresh and Sensodyne toothpaste made for sensitive teeth and prefer the Aquafresh.</li>
            <li>I have used Aquafresh Sensitive toothpaste for years.</li>
            <li>good but too expensive</li>
            <li>Much less expensive than most sensitive toothpastes, and better tasting too.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toothpaste, especially for those of you with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Service of Amazon is very fast, it delivers the product before expected delivery time &amp; its a trustworthy site..........</li>
            <li>I love the taste of this toothpaste and they make my teeth less sensitive to food - they contain the same ingredients to more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li>this totally worked for our sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li>Aquafresh is the most reasonably priced brand of sensitive toothpast Ive found, and it works the same as any other - has the same amount of the active ingredient as the most expensive brand.</li>
            <li>My dentist said that some formulations work better for some people (due to my body chemistry) since it&#x27;s not just about the strength of the active ingredient, but HOW MY MOUTH allows the product to STICK to the sensitive teeth and keep working long after I spit it out and rinsed.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth and found that most sensitive toothpaste were distasteful to me.</li>
            <li>I have long had sensitive teeth and discovered decades ago that sensitive teeth toothpaste used (2-4x)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find the Aquafresh Sensitive anywhere locally.  </li>
            <li>I have used this toothpaste for several years since I have sensitive teeth.</li>

            <li> There are other sensitive toothpastes that work better, but the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> and he suggested this sensitive toothpaste as a way not only to clean my teeth, but to build up the resistance of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> The flavor is not that great; it tastes like stale mint.  </li>
            <li> I have to be careful what kind of toothpaste I get and many of the sensitive ones have &#x27;whitening&#x27; in them which cancels out the sensitive part, at least for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Aquafresh is both better tasting and cheaper than Sensodyne, and yet it seems to have the same good effect at taming the cold sensitivity of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find good old toothpaste...</li>
            <li> The best toothpaste, not sure why not available in local stores</li>
            <li> Although the active ingredient for sensitivity is the same as listed on the ingredients for both toothpastes, the Aquafresh seems to work great for me but the other one didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth and gums</li>
            <li> In other words, I do not notice any significant reduction in sensitivity, or any increase in whitening.  </li>
            <li> Why pay more for other products that are similar??  </li>
            <li> My husband, who normally prefers crest complete, has also switched to this, and mentioned his teeth are not as sensitive either.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it isn&#x27;t so strong and harsh a taste, so I like that.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this on to anyone looking for a sensitive toothpaste with a pleasant taste that doesn&#x27;t make your mouth feel weird either.</li>
            <li> Has worked well for years on sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> Aquafresh works as well as any of them, when it comes to cleaning teeth and protecting sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and its effects on my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I had problems finding this in the store and had run out, so I decided to buy the Crest &amp;#34;equivalent&amp;#34; for sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive teeth, but since I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste, I don&#x27;t have this problem anymore.  </li>
            <li> Takes away the pain from my sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> Helps sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> If we really want to take care of our teeth &amp; find solution to our mouth problems just go for only this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I have used both Aquafresh and Sensodyne toothpaste made for sensitive teeth and prefer the Aquafresh.</li>
            <li> I have used Aquafresh Sensitive toothpaste for years.</li>
            <li> good but too expensive</li>
            <li> Much less expensive than most sensitive toothpastes, and better tasting too.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothpaste, especially for those of you with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Service of Amazon is very fast, it delivers the product before expected delivery time &amp; its a trustworthy site..........</li>
            <li> I love the taste of this toothpaste and they make my teeth less sensitive to food - they contain the same ingredients to more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li> this totally worked for our sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li> Aquafresh is the most reasonably priced brand of sensitive toothpast Ive found, and it works the same as any other - has the same amount of the active ingredient as the most expensive brand.</li>
            <li> My dentist said that some formulations work better for some people (due to my body chemistry) since it&#x27;s not just about the strength of the active ingredient, but HOW MY MOUTH allows the product to STICK to the sensitive teeth and keep working long after I spit it out and rinsed.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth and found that most sensitive toothpaste were distasteful to me.</li>
            <li> I have long had sensitive teeth and discovered decades ago that sensitive teeth toothpaste used (2-4x)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find the Aquafresh Sensitive anywhere locally.  </li>
            <li> I have used this toothpaste for several years since I have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Although all &#x27;sensitive teeth&#x27; toothpastes supposedly contain the same active ingredient, this one works.</li>
            <li> The other sensitive toothpastes that I&#x27;ve tried never did the job thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> When I looked at the label I was surprised to learn that Crest&#x27;s active ingredient for sensitivity was fluoride.  </li>
            <li> , it has cured my swollen gums &amp; last but not the least it is best for sensitivity, whenever i use to eat or drink cold items i use to have lot of pain but after using this product i can enjoy ice creams &amp; cold beverages without any pain.</li>
            <li> effective less expensive</li>
            <li> I never experience sensitivity was long as I use it regularly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I live on a barrier island, you can&#x27;t beat the four pack for saving me from making 15 mile round trips to the store just to get some toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I gave this toothpaste an average rating because it&#x27;s a basic product that barely meets my expectations.  </li>
            <li> It uses the exact same 5% of the hypersensitivity active ingredient (Potassium Nitrate) as Sensodyne along with the usual fluoride to prevent cavities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I asked my dentist about this since they appear to be the same active ingredient and the same concentration.</li>
            <li> The Aquafresh has the same ingredient as all the other sensitive toothpastes but for a lot less, and I do like the minty taste.  </li>
            <li> I think the reason it took me so long to try this is because it is so inexpensive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other toothpaste before that actually improved my sensitivity, but not these ones.</li>
            <li> daily completely eliminates my sensitivity to hot and cold.</li>
            <li> Only Aquafresh&#x27;s Sensitive Teeth Toothpaste has become increasingly difficult to find in all the local drugstores.</li>
            <li> Have previously used sensodyne and the aquafresh has the same stuff in it for $2 less.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting pretty difficult to find in a store</li>
            <li> Been using this toothpaste for a while, works just as well as sensodyne but for much less money.</li>
            <li> After a couple weeks, sensitivity to cold, then hot, then it hurt to chew.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not uncomfortable to drink cold water anymore, but ice cream is still a problem.</li>
            <li> Aquafresh _Sensitive_ toothpaste is almost impossible to find in the stores; at least, where I live.</li>
            <li> I used to purchase it at Long&#x27;s Drugs, but they were gobbled up by CVS who, unfortunately, doesn&#x27;t carry it in their stores and then lied to me and told me it wasn&#x27;t made anymore instead of just stating that they carry less options in their stores than Long&#x27;s did.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t bad, but it doesn&#x27;t give you this minty fresh breath feeling like with Crest or Colgate.</li>
            <li> (If you can&#x27;t tell, I&#x27;m really not happy about the takeover of my local pharmacy.)</li>
            <li> I ordered the Aquafresh on-line and waited impatiently for it to come.  </li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> If I switch to another brand toothpaste for a week, my sensitive teeth seem to &#x27;scream&#x27; about cold drinks and the bristles on a toothbrush hurt too.  </li>
            <li> I used Aquafresh sensitive toothpaste for years and then it became very difficult to find in stores, so I switched brands.  </li>
            <li> Hardly get a minty sensation at all.  </li>
            <li> It is so hard to find this toothpaste anywhere.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit hard to rinse it all</li>
            <li> Got these due a sensitivity in my teeth whenever I eat cold foods.</li>
            <li> This brand is very hard to find in the pump form.  </li>
            <li> I am still careful with very cold things.</li>
            <li> I had paid an outrageous price for essentially a fluoride toothpaste with nothing for sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> A tad bit stale though.</li>
            <li> Sadly I can&#x27;t find this toothpaste in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> But I suppose that period of my life is past.  :(</li>
            <li> or so I can eat cold fruit again, so it&#x27;s working.  </li>
            <li> This foams an awful lot.</li>

            <li> Very blah and pasty.  Hardly get a minty sensation at all.  But after four weeks or so I can eat cold fruit again, so it&#x27;s working.  My husband, who normally prefers crest complete, has also switched to this, and mentioned his teeth are not as sensitive either.  Just buy a mouthwash to go with it if you like the &amp;#34;just brushed&amp;#34; sensation.</li>
            <li> effective less expensive</li>
            <li> Has worked well for years on sensitive gums. Tastes fine. Hard to get in stores, making me happy that Amazon can provide.</li>
            <li> my wife will not use another toothpaste, this is it, can&#x27;t find it in stores most of the time where I live for some reason (not even at our Wal-Mart).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried most of the sensitive teeth toothpastes on the market. Aquafresh works as well as any of them, when it comes to cleaning teeth and protecting sensitive teeth. What makes Aquafresh superior is that it has the same great taste of regular Aquafresh and doesn&#x27;t taste like licorice (unlike many of the competitors). It has a relatively strong peppermint taste, stronger than Crest regular and much stronger than Colgate.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste. And I always loved the price too. Much less expensive than most sensitive toothpastes, and better tasting too. I used to purchase it at Long&#x27;s Drugs, but they were gobbled up by CVS who, unfortunately, doesn&#x27;t carry it in their stores and then lied to me and told me it wasn&#x27;t made anymore instead of just stating that they carry less options in their stores than Long&#x27;s did. (If you can&#x27;t tell, I&#x27;m really not happy about the takeover of my local pharmacy.) Anyway, I then started purchasing it at Target, but then they stopped carrying it in their stores. So now I&#x27;m reduced to purchasing my toothpaste online. Thank God for Amazon!</li>
            <li> I purchased this style of toothpaste many years ago at the suggestion of my dentist.  I have very sensitive teeth and gums and he suggested this sensitive toothpaste as a way not only to clean my teeth, but to build up the resistance of my teeth.  I have used Aquafresh exclusively and now have very pleasant dental visits.  I highly recommend this toothpaste, especially for those of you with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> we love the great minty flavor from aqua fresh sensitive.</li>
            <li> Ordered a product from this vendor which they claimed to have in stock.  I waited over two weeks for the merchandise, only to find out that they were \\&quot;out of stock\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Got these due a sensitivity in my teeth whenever I eat cold foods. These aren&#x27;t bad, but it doesn&#x27;t give you this minty fresh breath feeling like with Crest or Colgate. I&#x27;m still not 100% relieved of my sensitivity. I&#x27;ve tried other toothpaste before that actually improved my sensitivity, but not these ones.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste for sensitive gums. Nice flavor. Amazon says I need more words so here goes: Great toothpaste for sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> Aquafresh is my favorite sensitive toothpaste because of the taste. Also, the price is generally cheaper than the others, however, it is not often readily available and that is why I bought a bunch of them.</li>
            <li> I gave this toothpaste an average rating because it&#x27;s a basic product that barely meets my expectations.  It&#x27;s a fluoride toothpaste with some whitening and sensitivity characteristics, but it does not excel in performance.  In other words, I do not notice any significant reduction in sensitivity, or any increase in whitening.  The flavor is not that great; it tastes like stale mint.  The price is decent for 4 large tubes, but I would not buy this product again.  I will stick to Crest or Sensodyne going forward.</li>
            <li> Although all &#x27;sensitive teeth&#x27; toothpastes supposedly contain the same active ingredient, this one works. Another national brand version does not work for me.</li>
            <li> Been using this toothpaste for a while, works just as well as sensodyne but for much less money. You can&#x27;t really beat that.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and its effects on my sensitive teeth. My own thinking is to purchase multiple products from multiple supplier for toothpaste to get maxmium and balanced effects. i like the smell of this and its effects. Now my teeth are much better.</li>
            <li> Aquafresh _Sensitive_ toothpaste is almost impossible to find in the stores; at least, where I live. I don&#x27;t like the taste of other brands&#x27; sensitive toothpastes, so I am happy to find this source.</li>
            <li> I wish all toothpastes came with flip top! I like the flavor and tatse of the paste , It is NOT to spicy which I love! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I like Auafresh and Colgate. They both taste good and have the sensitive variety as well. Good price too. Yes.</li>
            <li> fast shipment. great product. this totally worked for our sensitive teeth! while others are available, there&#x27;s nothing more accessible and more effective.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe Amazon has this great toothpaste.  It is far better than Sensodyne and much cheaper.  I also like the flavor better.  I don&#x27;t like peppermint toothpaste.  I prefer spearmint.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste works fine, but I have found that it is much cheaper to walk over to Walmart for this item.</li>
            <li> Aquafresh is both better tasting and cheaper than Sensodyne, and yet it seems to have the same good effect at taming the cold sensitivity of my teeth.  It uses the exact same 5% of the hypersensitivity active ingredient (Potassium Nitrate) as Sensodyne along with the usual fluoride to prevent cavities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I live on a barrier island, you can&#x27;t beat the four pack for saving me from making 15 mile round trips to the store just to get some toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Glad I can still get this toothpaste.  I like the Aquafresh products and I am happy I found this toothpaste here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and love it.  I had problems finding this in the store and had run out, so I decided to buy the Crest &amp;#34;equivalent&amp;#34; for sensitive teeth.  Boy was that a mistake!  After a couple weeks, sensitivity to cold, then hot, then it hurt to chew.  I finally figured out that using Crest was causing my sensitivity to return.  When I looked at the label I was surprised to learn that Crest&#x27;s active ingredient for sensitivity was fluoride.  No potassium nitrate.  I had paid an outrageous price for essentially a fluoride toothpaste with nothing for sensitivity.  No wonder my teeth hurt!  I ordered the Aquafresh on-line and waited impatiently for it to come.  I was in such pain; I couldn&#x27;t eat and could only drink lukewarm liquids at this point.  I brushed as soon as the Aquafresh arrived.  Within 3 brushings over a 24 hour period, I am no longer in pain and can chew.  Aquafresh was that fast!!!  From now on I will keep a stash of Aquafresh on hand, especially since you can&#x27;t just pick it up at the store like I used to.  I don&#x27;t know why they took Aquafresh off the shelves, but glad that Amazon carries it.  I am a customer for life.</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste. Especially when I couple it with my whitening booster I notice better results than using any other toothpaste brand alone.</li>
            <li> They used to have this with &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; capability as well, but I can&#x27;t find it anymore. If they had that, I would give it 5 starts. It does help my teeth not to hurt</li>
            <li> Excellent toothpaste. Worked wonders for my mouth at such a great price. A tad bit stale though. But that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive teeth, but since I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste, I don&#x27;t have this problem anymore.  Plus, it leaves my teeth feeling clean and has a great taste.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is inexpensive, tastes good, and works great.  Takes away the pain from my sensitive teeth.  Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find good old toothpaste...everything now seems to have whiteners and that just really increases the sensitivity of my teeth!  I was glad to find this in a multi-pack!  We&#x27;re set for a while!</li>
            <li> Very please with the purchase.</li>
            <li> my wife&#x27;s favorite toothpaste for her sensitive teeth. It&#x27;s getting pretty difficult to find in a store so we signed up for the auto-ship method. Wasn&#x27;t long before they cancelled it on us and said it would no longer be available. Pretty disappointed. Great product though.</li>
            <li> Works OK. There are other sensitive toothpastes that work better, but the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> taste is excellent and easy on my teeth</li>
            <li> Helps sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I love the taste of this toothpaste and they make my teeth less sensitive to food - they contain the same ingredients to more expensive brands.  Why pay more for other products that are similar??  Sadly I can&#x27;t find this toothpaste in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> For some odd reason the flavor &amp;#34;smooth mint&amp;#34; reminds me more of horseradish in cocktail sauce than it does minty toothpaste.  Works great to decrease sensitivity in my teeth though and has also helped whiten them too</li>
            <li> Aquafresh is the most reasonably priced brand of sensitive toothpast Ive found, and it works the same as any other - has the same amount of the active ingredient as the most expensive brand. Ive used it for years.</li>
            <li> If we really want to take care of our teeth &amp; find solution to our mouth problems just go for only this toothpaste. No other brand is as best as Aquafresh.............&lt;br /&gt; I am a regular customer of Aquafresh now since 8 months &amp; i have found a lot of difference in my mouth. My teeth are shining &amp; turned from yellow to white, my mouth doesn&#x27;t smell as it used to before, it has cured my swollen gums &amp; last but not the least it is best for sensitivity, whenever i use to eat or drink cold items i use to have lot of pain but after using this product i can enjoy ice creams &amp; cold beverages without any pain. Thank you Aquafresh........&lt;br /&gt;I would like to suggest all those who are facing mouth problems that just go for this brand.... Its a very beneficial............&lt;br /&gt;I am very thankful to Amazon to provide me Aquafresh. It is so hard to find this toothpaste anywhere. Service of Amazon is very fast, it delivers the product before expected delivery time &amp; its a trustworthy site..........</li>
            <li> good but too expensive</li>
            <li> Stops all sensitivity and tastes good. But if you want your teeth to FEEL CLEAN use Arm &amp; Hammer toothpastes.</li>
            <li> Buying in multi-packs keeps the health and beauty fairy in business.</li>
            <li> Ignore the &amp;#34;$3.03/ounce&amp;#34; - it&#x27;s actually $0.76/ounce - you get four 5.6 tubes which is 22.4 oz.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in the stores, this is by far the best I have used to prevent sensitivity when brushing and the only brand that does not cause issues with the skin tissue in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I used Aquafresh sensitive toothpaste for years and then it became very difficult to find in stores, so I switched brands.  The other sensitive toothpastes that I&#x27;ve tried never did the job thoroughly.  I always seem to have some sensitivity. Aquafresh works very well for me. I never experience sensitivity was long as I use it regularly.</li>
            <li> Thrilled when I found it here. Perfect just what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely order more when needed.</li>
            <li> I have used both Aquafresh and Sensodyne toothpaste made for sensitive teeth and prefer the Aquafresh. Although the active ingredient for sensitivity is the same as listed on the ingredients for both toothpastes, the Aquafresh seems to work great for me but the other one didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I asked my dentist about this since they appear to be the same active ingredient and the same concentration. My dentist said that some formulations work better for some people (due to my body chemistry) since it&#x27;s not just about the strength of the active ingredient, but HOW MY MOUTH allows the product to STICK to the sensitive teeth and keep working long after I spit it out and rinsed. If I switch to another brand toothpaste for a week, my sensitive teeth seem to &#x27;scream&#x27; about cold drinks and the bristles on a toothbrush hurt too.  I have NO dental work of any kind, not even a filling (50 yrs old and still have all my wisdom teeth). Aquafresh works great for me and is a long term solution to my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> This foams an awful lot. It&#x27;s a bit hard to rinse it all out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it isn&#x27;t so strong and harsh a taste, so I like that. And it desensitized my teeth very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this once a day, alternating with Pearl Drops tooth polish (which I adore).</li>
            <li> One of my favorite toothpastes and couldn&#x27;t find it in local stores but there it was on Amazon.  I never expected to find so many of the items I have been interested in and looking for on Amazon.  Now I look first there before shopping elsewhere.  My son encouraged me to join &#x27;Prime&#x27; and it is working out just fine.</li>
            <li> This brand is very hard to find in the pump form.  The price is excellent and it is a very good product.  I always keep extras on hand.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste for a great price. The toothpaste leaves my mouth clean and breath fresh, and the price is low for the awesome quality you get.</li>
            <li> I have used Aquafresh Sensitive toothpaste for years. I have found it is no longer available in all stores, when I most need it. Therefore, I like the convenience of buying in the four pack. I would recommend the four pack, for convenience.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful what kind of toothpaste I get and many of the sensitive ones have &#x27;whitening&#x27; in them which cancels out the sensitive part, at least for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this toothpaste is great and the price was right.</li>
            <li> the best toothpaste for sensitive teeth at a reasonable cost.  Have previously used sensodyne and the aquafresh has the same stuff in it for $2 less.</li>
            <li> Favorite toothpaste &amp; hard to fine in stores!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find the Aquafresh Sensitive anywhere locally.  I used to be able to buy it at my local Ralphs market but they don&#x27;t carry it anywhere.  The Aquafresh has the same ingredient as all the other sensitive toothpastes but for a lot less, and I do like the minty taste.  If a toothpaste does not have POTASSIUM NITRATE 5% listed in the ingredients it will do nothing for your sensitivity problem as I found out when using the Crest Pro toothpaste which listed that it was a sensitivity controller on the front of the tube..I liked the toothpaste but had problems with sensitive areas of my teeth again.  Be aware.</li>
            <li> The best toothpaste, not sure why not available in local stores</li>
            <li> Best Tasting Toothpaste for Sensitive Teeth I have on the market. I have very sensitive teeth and found that most sensitive toothpaste were distasteful to me. I would recommend this on to anyone looking for a sensitive toothpaste with a pleasant taste that doesn&#x27;t make your mouth feel weird either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taken about 3 weeks but I&#x27;m finally starting to notice a difference. It&#x27;s not uncomfortable to drink cold water anymore, but ice cream is still a problem. I don&#x27;t like how it feels \\&quot;light\\&quot; when brushing, but that&#x27;s only because I&#x27;m used to super foamy toothpaste like everyone else, I guess!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It hasn&#x27;t been the miracle I suppose I was looking for, but it helps a lot. I am still careful with very cold things. But I suppose that period of my life is past.  :(</li>
            <li> I have long had sensitive teeth and discovered decades ago that sensitive teeth toothpaste used (2-4x) daily completely eliminates my sensitivity to hot and cold. And Aquafresh produces my favorite flavor toothpaste. Only Aquafresh&#x27;s Sensitive Teeth Toothpaste has become increasingly difficult to find in all the local drugstores. Glad to find it online. Product arrived quickly, fresh and well packaged. Maybe I&#x27;ll stock up on 4 more tubes!</li>
            <li> Same desensitizing effect as Sensodyne and at a fraction of the cost! It not only works just as well, but the flavor is better and bolder, leaving your mouth feeling truly clean!</li>
            <li> Great if your teeth are sensitive.  This was recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> But, remember this is a pretty cheap toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;O&#x27;Doul&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  because of the word requirement I will also say it&#x27;s tasty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A wonderful apperitif after any meal...really stays on the brush!</li>
            <li> I have used this toothpaste for several years since I have sensitive teeth. I have not been able to find it in a store near me, so glad I was able to find it on Amazon. Your teeth feel so clean and your breath fresh with this product. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I developed sensitive teeth.  I tried many products including Crest but finally found this.  I think the reason it took me so long to try this is because it is so inexpensive, I automatically thought it wouldn&#x27;t work. It started to work after the first use.  I&#x27;ve always remembered from when I was younger a dentist telling me to switch out my toothpastes so while I do use this once daily (in the morning), I also use another toothpaste at night.  Even using only once daily, it keeps the pain at bay.  I once ran out of this and after a couple days, my teeth started to hurt again.  I hope they never stop making this!</li>
