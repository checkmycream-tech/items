    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Awesome product -- buy it and try it.  </li>
            <li>and it is the best face cream I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>Excellent product!</li>
            <li>I noticed another person in the reviews said it&#x27;s a great serum for under makeup</li>
            <li>She told me that it may not help with all the aging issues, but that it was a great moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>A friend of mine told me about this product and how great it felt on their skin.</li>
            <li>I too, came to Amazon to review this product before I purchased on one of those \\&quot;great</li>
            <li>The manufacturer said you would notice great improvement after 2 weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>A great purchase for the money.</li>
            <li>Someone on here hinted that the good reviews came from people that work for Amazon or the product manufacturer ....</li>
            <li>To be a fair reviewer, I should confess that I am in my mid-twenties, so I use this as a preventative skincare measure.</li>
            <li>My skin firmness has improved greatly in this time and it just keeps getting better</li>
            <li>Figured it was worth a chance since I was getting a great deal and not spending what Amazon is charging.  </li>
            <li>n.. very important.</li>
            <li>Very cheap packaging</li>
            <li>Love this stiff&lt;br /&gt;works</li>
            <li>I absolutely love their eye serum  </li>
            <li>it has a cool zingy feeling very refreshing .my</li>
            <li>my under eye bags look better</li>
            <li>they just look thicker and better</li>
            <li>I did not buy my products on Amazon and seems like I paid a lot more.</li>
            <li>I actually love this stuff-</li>
            <li>Love the order process and delivery time.</li>
            <li>I also love the product but the pump on the bottle is faulty...</li>
            <li>and I am sure glad I did.</li>
            <li>They obviously work for the company and are putting up 5 star reviews to make this look awesome.</li>
            <li>Great product highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It takes seconds to dry, which is especially nice in the morning when I&#x27;m layering moisturizer, primer, foundation, etc on top of it.</li>
            <li>so I already have pretty good skin</li>
            <li>I continue to purchase it even though this is a huge hassle because I am convinced its \\&quot;better than Botox\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I never saw any \\&quot;instant\\&quot; change as advertised on those fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Where it loses a star: the smell isn&#x27;t the greatest, but that isn&#x27;t uncommon w/ high end skin serums.</li>
            <li>It is light, doesn&#x27;t clog pores and doesn&#x27;t interfere with makeup or sunscreen.</li>
            <li>More importantly, I noticed a distinct improvement in my skin after about three weeks.</li>
            <li>I can literally feel my face tighten up (in a good way, not a dry way) as soon as I put this on.</li>
            <li>I felt a difference after the very first application, after 1 week I noticed significant difference around my eyes and mouth.  </li>
            <li>and it dries quickly and does not leave an oily residue .</li>
            <li>This product is not greasy and dries quickly leaving your skin firm and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I have used this product over and over again and absolutely loveit!!</li>
            <li>I am 51 years old and love this product.  </li>
            <li>and they are right.</li>
            <li>I personally like this skin serum it goes on light and smooth</li>
            <li>I expected it to be equally effective, but it just did not deliver.</li>
            <li>I put it on as the first step in my skincare routine both at night and in the morning, followed by a moisturizer</li>
            <li>Any recommendations or discounts on this would be appreciated!</li>
            <li>Now, if there is someone out there that can tell me why this does this, or what I can do to make it stop, I am all ears and willing to listen.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this item on a social site.  </li>
            <li>Very upset when received product because pump nonfunctionable.</li>
            <li>I do not work for the company, I really do like the product</li>
            <li>Also, as much as I use this product</li>
            <li>and I fully intend to purchase it again, the retail price of $125 is just way too much.</li>
            <li>I tried out this product a couple weeks ago -- I couldn&#x27;t really tell what reviews were legit or not according to the reviewers of Lift.</li>
            <li>and I have to say that it worked really well at reducing the wrinkles under my eyes which have always been a problem of mine.</li>
            <li>But it hasn&#x27;t helped with anything except me having to clean my face again and starting from the beginning.</li>
            <li>I am 50 years old and am a pretty youthful 50.  </li>
            <li>My skin appeared more even toned and the wrinkles were less noticeable.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>You can physically feel this stuff tightening your skin right after you put it on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Granted, it is not a facelift, nor are the effects permanent if you quit using it (as far as I can tell), but it does what it says and unless you have a face and skin that has been used and abused and looks like old leather, you will see (and feel) a difference!!</li>
            <li>If Amazon/Primdent Oral Care are going to continue to sell &amp;#34;seconds&amp;#34; then maybe they should clearly state that so that it is know before placing the order.</li>
            <li>What I can say is that it really does tighten up your skin- especially around the eye area.</li>
            <li>I am 60 years old.  </li>
            <li>Due to my age I cannot speak to whether or not it instantly minimizes fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>There were other products out there with the same ingredients pretty much and there were mixed reviews.  </li>
            <li>Once it&#x27;s dry, you shouldn&#x27;t feel anything different other than smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>I am 46 years old and am holding up relatively well.</li>
            <li>I got it on a social site as well</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I got it on a social site as well</li>
            <li> so payment of refund due from dec/jan/feb/mar four payments of nearly £70.00 each.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> My eyes look a lot less baggy and tired since I started using this, which is a huge plus since I&#x27;m a grad student and my life often consists of long study nights followed by work early in the morning.</li>
            <li> When there were five fabulous reviews, I suspected something fishy too, that they were fake reviews.  </li>
            <li> Love the product because it is very difficult to find something I can use on my face and not have an outbreak, but I&#x27;ve had numerous issues with the pumps.  </li>
            <li> Except one and her reviews were 2 other products on the same line.</li>
            <li> You have to wash your face, dab dry, apply LIFT and let it dry before putting on your moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> And yes, I let it dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried out quite a few different products and in the end I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking to reduce their wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this product a chance after I saw it listed at a heavily discounted price on one of those social coupon sites.</li>
            <li> water - not very good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Only 1 out of the 6 or so bottles that I have purchased worked, causing a lot of wasted serum.  </li>
            <li> I can actually wear under my makeup because since my skin is oily I don&#x27;t ever usually wear any moisturizer during the day or else by 1pm.</li>
            <li> The bottle was partly open so the product was dried out!</li>
            <li> I saw absolutely NO DIFFERENCE in my skin at all, other than it made me break out and gave my skin an odd texture.  </li>
            <li> I looked at the other reviews and looked at their previous reviews</li>
            <li> and I have noticed my lids are less puffy</li>
            <li> It make a mess on your face.</li>
            <li> but it keeps my skin hydrated without a heavy film.</li>
            <li> apply small amounts</li>
            <li> That is a big problem online with fake reviews and you are seeing it here.</li>
            <li> but you have taken payments from my card even after inform not suitable for me and all goods return .</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s hard to get rid of them without clinical assistance</li>
            <li> I too do not understand the negative reviews about this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews about this product.</li>
            <li> Product was thick.  </li>
            <li> I have a whole bottle of this and it is worthless to me.</li>
            <li> not a bad product  but terrible packaging i have ordered two bottles</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m worried in the future I will have really bad problems</li>
            <li> I also have very stereotypical combination skin (oily T-zone and dry cheeks) and I haven&#x27;t had any issues w/ increased oil, dryness, or breakouts.</li>
            <li> your customer service is very rude and not helpful at all.</li>
            <li> Expensive too in my opinion for what you get :/ the fake reviews on here are really disappointing.</li>
            <li> No straw attached to pump so unable to get product out of bottle.</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;ll be purchasing via Amazon/Primdent again for that reason alone, very frustrating!!</li>
            <li> very disgusted dissatisfied angry customer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mrs A. M Flay</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very upset when received product because pump nonfunctionable. No straw attached to pump so unable to get product out of bottle.</li>
            <li> Love the product because it is very difficult to find something I can use on my face and not have an outbreak, but I&#x27;ve had numerous issues with the pumps.  Only 1 out of the 6 or so bottles that I have purchased worked, causing a lot of wasted serum.  I&#x27;ve even returned 2 bottles and received replacements that were also defective.  If Amazon/Primdent Oral Care are going to continue to sell &amp;#34;seconds&amp;#34; then maybe they should clearly state that so that it is know before placing the order. I just recently opened my last order which was back in September and surprise surprise....THE PUMPS ARE DEFECTIVE. Not sure I&#x27;ll be purchasing via Amazon/Primdent again for that reason alone, very frustrating!!</li>
            <li> Love this stiff&lt;br /&gt;works for me!!!&lt;br /&gt;gotta apply small amounts I n.. very important. .CIRCULAR MOTION.&lt;br /&gt;G this is third bottle</li>
            <li> I personally like this skin serum it goes on light and smooth and it dries quickly and does not leave an oily residue . I haven&#x27;t had any break outs or any problems using this product I&#x27;m in skincare so I already have pretty good skin but it keeps my skin hydrated without a heavy film.I noticed another person in the reviews said it&#x27;s a great serum for under makeup and they are right. its the only Serum I can actually wear under my makeup because since my skin is oily I don&#x27;t ever usually wear any moisturizer during the day or else by 1pm. my face will be a mud slide. I absolutely love their eye serum  it has a cool zingy feeling very refreshing .my eyelids are puffy and hooded just genetically and I&#x27;m worried in the future I will have really bad problems and I have noticed my lids are less puffy my under eye bags look better the skin looks smoother but i still need a filler there. I feel like once you have under eye bags and they&#x27;re already there and have set up shop I think it&#x27;s hard to get rid of them without clinical assistance .Since the instructions say to put the eye serum  on your eyebrows and above I&#x27;ve notice improvement in my eyebrows and eyelashes they just look thicker and better I think it may be the peptides or the vitamins I don&#x27;t know.I did not buy my products on Amazon and seems like I paid a lot more.</li>
            <li> made my skin itch my eyes water - not very good for sensitive skin. e-mails sent requesting refund goods return via postal service but you have taken payments from my card even after inform not suitable for me and all goods return . your customer service is very rude and not helpful at all. so payment of refund due from dec/jan/feb/mar four payments of nearly £70.00 each.&lt;br /&gt;A very disgusted dissatisfied angry customer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mrs A. M Flay</li>
            <li> Product was thick.  Would not pump.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this item on a social site.  I too do not understand the negative reviews about this product. Obviously, there is no product out there that will take away all your wrinkles, etc. unless you have plastic surgery.  I am 51 years old and love this product.  I took it to my Dermatologist.  She told me that it may not help with all the aging issues, but that it was a great moisturizer.  My face does noticeably tighten up. I use it every morning under my regular moisturizer especially in the winter  A lot of you mentioned that you didn&#x27;t like the way it felt on your face.  You have to wash your face, dab dry, apply LIFT and let it dry before putting on your moisturizer.  Once it&#x27;s dry, you shouldn&#x27;t feel anything different other than smooth skin.  Awesome product -- buy it and try it.  AND, I do not work for amazon.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine told me about this product and how great it felt on their skin. I felt a difference after the very first application, after 1 week I noticed significant difference around my eyes and mouth.  Great product highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I too, came to Amazon to review this product before I purchased on one of those \\&quot;great deal\\&quot; websites.  When there were five fabulous reviews, I suspected something fishy too, that they were fake reviews.  So I knew this going in but thought I would try it just based on the ingredients.  There were other products out there with the same ingredients pretty much and there were mixed reviews.  Figured it was worth a chance since I was getting a great deal and not spending what Amazon is charging.  So, that being said, I did not like this product at all.  I am 50 years old and am a pretty youthful 50.  But noticing some lines starting and I felt I could use some collagen boosting on one side of my face, I tried it.  I never saw any \\&quot;instant\\&quot; change as advertised on those fine lines.  There was no change at all.  I used this product for a month.  The manufacturer said you would notice great improvement after 2 weeks of use.  I saw absolutely NO DIFFERENCE in my skin at all, other than it made me break out and gave my skin an odd texture.  YUK</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews about this product. I got it on a social site as well and it is the best face cream I have ever tried. I am 46 years old and am holding up relatively well. I can literally feel my face tighten up (in a good way, not a dry way) as soon as I put this on. I use it every morning and again if I&#x27;m going out for the evening. I do not work for the company, I really do like the product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very cheap packaging and I could not tell any difference from using the product for over a month! Expensive too in my opinion for what you get :/ the fake reviews on here are really disappointing.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It is light, doesn&#x27;t clog pores and doesn&#x27;t interfere with makeup or sunscreen. More importantly, I noticed a distinct improvement in my skin after about three weeks. My skin appeared more even toned and the wrinkles were less noticeable. That said, I would not recommend their eye cream (See). I expected it to be equally effective, but it just did not deliver.</li>
            <li> I have used this product over and over again and absolutely loveit!! Someone on here hinted that the good reviews came from people that work for Amazon or the product manufacturer ....how unfair!!Just because it didn&#x27;t make you look 10 years younger is no reason to insinuate something dishonest!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, it is not a facelift, nor are the effects permanent if you quit using it (as far as I can tell), but it does what it says and unless you have a face and skin that has been used and abused and looks like old leather, you will see (and feel) a difference!!</li>
            <li> I decided to give this product a chance after I saw it listed at a heavily discounted price on one of those social coupon sites. I actually love this stuff- I put it on as the first step in my skincare routine both at night and in the morning, followed by a moisturizer (personally I like Philosophy&#x27;s Hope in a Jar). It takes seconds to dry, which is especially nice in the morning when I&#x27;m layering moisturizer, primer, foundation, etc on top of it. You can physically feel this stuff tightening your skin right after you put it on. To be a fair reviewer, I should confess that I am in my mid-twenties, so I use this as a preventative skincare measure. Due to my age I cannot speak to whether or not it instantly minimizes fine lines and wrinkles. What I can say is that it really does tighten up your skin- especially around the eye area. My eyes look a lot less baggy and tired since I started using this, which is a huge plus since I&#x27;m a grad student and my life often consists of long study nights followed by work early in the morning. I also have very stereotypical combination skin (oily T-zone and dry cheeks) and I haven&#x27;t had any issues w/ increased oil, dryness, or breakouts. Where it loses a star: the smell isn&#x27;t the greatest, but that isn&#x27;t uncommon w/ high end skin serums. Also, as much as I use this product and I fully intend to purchase it again, the retail price of $125 is just way too much. Buy it on Amazon or a coupon site.</li>
            <li> Love the order process and delivery time. I also love the product but the pump on the bottle is faulty...the last 3 bottles I&#x27;ve purchased have been the same. I have to remove the cover and use a q tip to get to it. I continue to purchase it even though this is a huge hassle because I am convinced its \\&quot;better than Botox\\&quot;. Any recommendations or discounts on this would be appreciated!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! This product is not greasy and dries quickly leaving your skin firm and beautiful. A great purchase for the money.</li>
            <li> The bottle was partly open so the product was dried out!</li>
            <li> not a bad product  but terrible packaging i have ordered two bottles and they both lost the dispenser in 2 uses</li>
            <li> Does what it says on the bottle.  Been using this product for a year or so now. My skin firmness has improved greatly in this time and it just keeps getting better</li>
            <li> I ordered mine from [...] for 20.00.&lt;br /&gt;I read \\&quot;evil\\&quot; review and I am sure glad I did. I looked at the other reviews and looked at their previous reviews and they had NONE. Except one and her reviews were 2 other products on the same line. I think that is misleading and their product should be reviewed on what is does for the customers. So, even if it works when I get it. I won&#x27;t be buying it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update for Dee.....I did not care for it at all. I tried it and when you put on your make up over it, it rolls up on you. It make a mess on your face. I have a whole bottle of this and it is worthless to me. Now, if there is someone out there that can tell me why this does this, or what I can do to make it stop, I am all ears and willing to listen. But it hasn&#x27;t helped with anything except me having to clean my face again and starting from the beginning. And yes, I let it dry.</li>
            <li> Then I realized all the reviews on here are shills. They only reviewed this product and related company products. They obviously work for the company and are putting up 5 star reviews to make this look awesome. That is a big problem online with fake reviews and you are seeing it here. I don&#x27;t know how Amazon can stop this from happening, but I am staying away from products that have shill reviews like this.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product from a different website.  I am 60 years old.  After receiving it I used it for about 10 days and noticed a big change in the lines on my face.  I continued to use it once a day for a month.  Then I stopped just to see if there would be a change...and yes there was.  The lines started to come back.  I am now using the product everyother day and could not be happier.  I am not from the company and would purchase this product again...that is why I am&lt;br /&gt; here to see where else I can purchase this product as I am running low.</li>
            <li> I tried out this product a couple weeks ago -- I couldn&#x27;t really tell what reviews were legit or not according to the reviewers of Lift. I gave it a shot anyway and I have to say that it worked really well at reducing the wrinkles under my eyes which have always been a problem of mine. I&#x27;ve tried out quite a few different products and in the end I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking to reduce their wrinkles.</li>
