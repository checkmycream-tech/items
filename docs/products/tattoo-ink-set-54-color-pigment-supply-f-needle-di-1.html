            <li>If you want something cheap to use for practice skins, these are great, they colors stay bright on rubber but definitely don&#x27;t use on clients or yourself.</li>
            <li>The colors that did take to the skin were bright and vibrant!</li>
            <li>I bought kuro sumi black outlining ink and my lines were perfect with one pass with these water colors</li>
            <li>ALSO COMES IN ALOT OF THEM CHEAP TATTOO KITS.</li>
            <li>AND IT COMES WITH THEM CHEAP KITS</li>
            <li>and i got them for free in a kit</li>
            <li>The only good thing i have to say about this is that we didn&#x27;t get infected thank god.</li>
            <li>Not a bad smell, just that smell that any artist knows says *</li>
            <li>No good ink...no good!!</li>
            <li>I like too get the right color when needed .</li>
            <li>Spending more money now is definitely worth having a better, safer experience and in the end having a client be at risk because i wanted to save a few bucks.</li>
            <li>how much sense does it make to get 54 bottles of ink for the same cost of 5 bottles from a reputable manufacturer....</li>
            <li>i got a 300.00 doctor bill and that money could been spent on  a safe ink such as star brite or intenze,or several other safe and good inks.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;nt even want to use it for practice ink,it very dangerous,shit from china.i believe its chemical war fair,its fatal, AMAZON needs to make there sellers take it off there sites, so</li>
            <li>Thanks to this company</li>
            <li>it took so many passes just to get the color to stick to the skin half butt.  </li>
            <li>Arrived earlier then expected in nice packaging with the aluminum lining.</li>
            <li>Only contained one yellow, which we tried on 3 clients and found that it doesn&#x27;t take to skin, but not to worry, any colors you don&#x27;t have, you can surely make.</li>
            <li>ONCE BIG MISTAKE LUCKY</li>
            <li>Works great on the fake skin for practice.</li>
            <li>this product is whack attack, it gave more people mad than glad</li>
            <li>u nearly have to dig a trench</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m truly sorry I purchased this product in good faith and</li>
            <li>To get a small job done , it might work fine .  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely sticking to the more expensive, guaranteed higher quality inks from now.</li>
            <li>Other than a few colors not taking, your getting more bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>so the skin wouldn&#x27;t take it, what did go in was faded into a different dirtier looking shade before the tattoo was even completely healed.</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for, apparently.</li>

            <li> I do tattoos and this ink gave me husband allergic reaction. Where the tattoo is and the area around there is also a bunch of little red bumps. It does cause a very bad itch and is red. So just look out for it just in case. I however did not get a reaction. But still will not get this because of this fact it could be a customer so be careful.</li>
            <li> Do not use this ink on anything but a practice skin!!!!! Works great on the fake skin for practice. But there are way to may problems with it if you use in a Tattoo. Like mentioned in other reviews on here it will causes infection or bad reactions in some people and dose not stay in the skin very well. Also the colors fade really badly after the tattoo heals. Do your research before you ever purchase ink remember it might be your art going on them. But it is their health your are dealing with. When it comes to inks remember you get what you pay for...</li>
            <li> No good ink...no good!! Wouldnt waste ur time..or hard earned money, buy american! Too waterd down, almost like food coloring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$THEY SHOULD REFUND HALF OF OUR MONEY ATLEAST!!!! OR SUM BETTER INK....SUMTHING???</li>
            <li> Every tattoo I&#x27;ve done with this ink has faded out so bad that the tattoo looks a hundred years old. Don&#x27;t use this ink or all of your clients will be unhappy with their tattoo.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier then expected in nice packaging with the aluminum lining. Package contained some colors that were very similar. Only contained one yellow, which we tried on 3 clients and found that it doesn&#x27;t take to skin, but not to worry, any colors you don&#x27;t have, you can surely make. Also the grasshopper green wouldn&#x27;t take either. Other than a few colors not taking, your getting more bang for your buck. The colors that did take to the skin were bright and vibrant!</li>
            <li> as In the other 2 reviews, Myself and 3 other ppl I tattoo&#x27;d ended up with infections from the green inks in this set. After eliminating possible causes the only common factor was the green ink...I&#x27;m truly sorry I purchased this product in good faith and it caused us to bcome infected. I would warn against buying this ink... use this for measure.... how much sense does it make to get 54 bottles of ink for the same cost of 5 bottles from a reputable manufacturer.... I should hav known better.... smh.</li>
            <li> after hearing a bunch of praise from a friend of mine, i got this set and totally regret it. Mine were super thin so the skin wouldn&#x27;t take it, what did go in was faded into a different dirtier looking shade before the tattoo was even completely healed. And two weeks after using them, the bottles starting having this weird odor hang around them if they got opened. Not a bad smell, just that smell that any artist knows says *I&#x27;m contaminated*. I wish i had bought them from amazon because maybe then my complaints would have at least been heard. If you want something cheap to use for practice skins, these are great, they colors stay bright on rubber but definitely don&#x27;t use on clients or yourself. It&#x27;s obvious that this is incredibly low quality ink, with dirty pigment and probably wasn&#x27;t sterilized right. I&#x27;m definitely sticking to the more expensive, guaranteed higher quality inks from now. Spending more money now is definitely worth having a better, safer experience and in the end having a client be at risk because i wanted to save a few bucks. this stuff is horrible.</li>
            <li> this inks got on the market and needs to come off the market. just like the comment i just read about it infecting this womans boy friend . it put me in the hospital TWICE with a staff infection.DO NOT BUY ANY INK WITH TATTOOOO.COM,AND A DRAGON ON IT or you might be the next unhappy camper i got a 300.00 doctor bill and that money could been spent on  a safe ink such as star brite or intenze,or several other safe and good inks. PLEASE DON&#x27;NT BUY THIS PRODUCT FOR YOUR ON SAFETY.THIS PRODUCT ALSO COMES IN ALOT OF THEM CHEAP TATTOO KITS. CRAZY RICK.i warned you people about this ink its china piss,i don&#x27;nt even want to use it for practice ink,it very dangerous,shit from china.i believe its chemical war fair,its fatal, AMAZON needs to make there sellers take it off there sites, so they don&#x27;nt get no law suits,it put me in the hospital and other people got infective from it people don&#x27;nt buy this shit if one of your kids or pets get a hold of it &#x27;its going to be fatal maybe even death lol, crazy rick  P.S.DON&#x27;NT USE THIS INK I&#x27;VE WARNED YA ONCE OR TWICE THREE TIMES YOU MIGHT STRIKE OUT,ITS GOT TATOOOO.COM. AND A DRAGON ON IT AND IT COMES WITH THEM CHEAP KITS,THAT PRICE IS GOOD TO BE TRUE TO START WITH.I GOT IT ABOUT A YEAR AGO IN A KIT SOLD BY PRO TATTOOING ITS FATAL, POSION AND ALSO CAUSES BLOOD POISON....................CRAZY RICK</li>
            <li> this product is whack attack, it gave more people mad than glad, i hate it and i got them for free in a kit</li>
            <li> Ink caused infection waste of money total rip off don&#x27;t waste your money will fade and cause infection in skin use only for practice on fake skin</li>
            <li> not that great doesn&#x27;t hold well then there was a recall on it so had to throw away</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and only used on 4 tattoos in which all 4 infected.  The last one to the point I had to go on antibiotics to get rid of the infection.  I contacted Amazon and after several calls they stood up to the plate.  Hats off to Amazon but beware of this ink.</li>
            <li> To get a small job done , it might work fine .  I often work on my self ,not others . I was happy too see the color in the package and use them . They gave me more choosing than I thought . I like too get the right color when needed .</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS ON APRIL 25TH 2012 I USED IT ONCE BIG MISTAKE LUCKY IT WAS ON A FAMILY MEMBER BECAUSE  IF NOT I WOULD HAVE BEEN SUED BECAUSE THE INK IS LIKE SOOO BAD IT GAVE HER A INFECTION AND IF SHE DIDNT GET THE PROBLEM SOLVED SHE COULD OF LOST HER ARM JUST BECAUSE OF THIS INK NEVER EVERRRRRRRR BUY THIS INK</li>
            <li> This is some bs it took so many passes just to get the color to stick to the skin half butt.  All I did was jack up my wife and my skin. I color pack for 3 hours on a 30 minute job. This ink should be illegal and they should be sued for false claims that there product is high quality. It is lowest quality  and makes me look like a horrible dude.. I would like to slap the junk outa people that gave them 5 stars on the product. It&#x27;s not a delivery review. Quit writing reviews before I use the actual product. I bought kuro sumi black outlining ink and my lines were perfect with one pass with these water colors u nearly have to dig a trench make it stick. I  am a mad dude. Thanks to this company my wife won&#x27;t let me Tat her no more cause she don&#x27;t understand it&#x27;s the inks fault.  Anybody that says they done a great tattoo with this is a lie. U can&#x27;t even find anything on this product on google. The only good thing i have to say about this is that we didn&#x27;t get infected thank god. And that&#x27;s just cause I&#x27;ve only used two colors. I will burn all this ink its not good enough to put it in my trash can. Put ur money towards some good ink and ul see, ur tattoos will be so much easier and beautiful.</li>
            <li> This ink is washed out and dirty looking. The pigments don&#x27;t hold in the skin, and what does hold looks dirty and old.I threw mine away after two tattoos with the same results: faded ink. You get what you pay for, apparently.</li>
            <li> bad ink  does not stay, waste of money</li>
            <li> I have not tried the ink yet, but I am so happy that it came so quickly to my door!</li>
            <li> this is exactly what i wanted everything is as it was described in the order im happy with this product</li>
            <li> These were wonderful, they work quite well.  We have had no problem with them at any time; we will be ordering more as they are needed.</li>
