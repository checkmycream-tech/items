            <li>have received many beauty products to review, and received this product for review purpose as well, but  have to say the Oridel Liquid Gem</li>

            <li>I feel that my skin now is so much better than years ago.</li>
            <li>The Liquid Gem™ gets a boost of healing energy and you get a lovely Citrine stone as a reward for finishing your bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love liquid gel.</li>
            <li>Simply the best product I&#x27;ve ever used!  </li>
            <li>you can see in the after picture my skin is glowing and more radiant.</li>
            <li>but it is interesting plus</li>
            <li>Simply, the very best.</li>
            <li>I have tried many, many others (Josie Maran etc.)</li>
            <li>I use this oil morning and evening and love the  effect on my face-</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful serum which leaves skin soft, supple and silky.</li>
            <li>They say after 3-4 months of use, you may see a reduction in pore size, so I&#x27;m excited to see what happens!</li>
            <li>It gives your skin that youthful, healthy glow while diminishing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkle.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and more youthful looking.  </li>
            <li>My face has never felt so smooth and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I also enjoy the light scent of the oils - like a mini aromatherapy!</li>
            <li>I can absolutely see why New Beauty Magazine named it as one of the Best Face Oils.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using this product is easy, just apply as a moisturizer to your face and neck area twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional</li>
            <li>I only use organic products, and this oil is beautiful, non-greasy, and contains</li>
            <li>This is the best product hands down!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I really enjoy using it after a mask.</li>
            <li>I would agree that putting oil on one&#x27;s face might fly in the face (no pun intended) of correct facial care, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier that I did.  </li>
            <li>but I happily pay for this product and every drop is an essential part of my routine.</li>
            <li>This is another one of the absolutely fabulous products from Oridel.</li>
            <li>The oil is not sticky and heavy but also not overly light and watery, a perfect balance, unlike all others.</li>
            <li>It has a strong scent but that fades quickly.</li>
            <li>Top of the line, have shared this tip with many of my friends who live all over the world, and they all agree.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>Based on the effects after a mask, I think it would be very soothing and help the skin heal more</li>
            <li>The oil is fast absorbing and also has a very nice, natural scent - nothing overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I use several of their products and love all of them!</li>
            <li>It really helped with all my fine lines and gave me a glowing complexion.</li>
            <li>Not greasy, use under makeup and look fresh all day.</li>
            <li>addition of the Citrine stone is both fun and functional.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad scent, just intense.</li>
            <li>I am always excited to try new products for bettering my skin and holding off the signs of aging.</li>
            <li>My skin definitely has a more glowing look and does not block my pores.</li>
            <li>Liquid Gem is an absolute must have!</li>
            <li>Unlike many under eye products that actually irritate the eyes</li>
            <li>My skin feels silky smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>: Truly works to give you overall better skin.</li>
            <li>: Truly works to give you overall better skin.</li>
            <li>This face oil from Oridel looked promising because..I can pronounce the ingredients!</li>
            <li>haha!</li>
            <li>you get a pretty semi-precious gemstone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I credit Oridel products, many with Sea Buckthorn, for my facial rejuvenation!</li>
            <li>I was only able to use the product for about three weeks, but the product information says that it can take up to three months for certain effects to take place.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It’s hard to tell the longer term effects just yet, but the short term effects have already been noticeable and I’m very happy.</li>
            <li>If so, you may find a face oil is just what you need to really pump up the hydration as they tend to absorb into the skin better than a traditional moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I’ve been using the product for nearly three weeks and the bottle is still well over three-quarters full.</li>
            <li>is that it can be used by so many different skin types whether you have had facial procedures, biopsies, acne and/or rosacea, sensitive skin and more.</li>
            <li>When I realized that Oridel’s Liquid Gem™ Regenerating Face Oil contains two ingredients that I’ve had success with in the past (Sea Buckthorn Oil and Argan Oil) as well as a variety of other powerful ingredients, I was happy to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I felt like my skin was really plumping up and feeling healthier as the days went by.....</li>
            <li>and I also mix it with my bronzer (just a teeny drop) and it really does give my face a really dewy glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Being cruelty free earns it big bonus points too!!  </li>
            <li>As Oridel points out in the product information, “Quantum physicists have scientifically proven that everything is composed of energy that is in a continuous state of interaction and many believe that there is the synergistic relationship between the earth’s precious minerals and botanicals, and that crystals have specific energies that emit vibrations which correspond to specific physical afflictions.”</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that much about gems and their powers</li>
            <li>I get a lot of products for free as I am in a business which enjoys such perks</li>
            <li>I use it most frequently under my eyes but also over my entire face.</li>
            <li>I also  think it&#x27;s such a unique feature to have a Citrine in the bottle!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does live up to its description!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always waiting for Oridel&#x27;s new skincare products - they put aging in reverse!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for everyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>(there’s plenty of product to last me many weeks) and updating with my further impressions at a later date,</li>
            <li>(there’s plenty of product to last me many weeks) and updating with my further impressions at a later date,</li>
            <li>it feels so soft and  healing!  </li>
            <li>It’s a little oily at first, but quickly absorbed into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The oil is well a little oily at first, but it is quickly absorbed into the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was oily at first but is absorbed by the skin in a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many creams and oils that were far too rich and actually clogged my pores making my skin look worse.</li>
            <li>So great in this cold winter weather.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive combination skin and this product helps hydrate my problem areas.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It made my skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>Regenerating Face Oil is my favorite discovery of late.  </li>
            <li>I received this review through Tomoson, so I am working under their time constraints to complete this review.</li>
            <li>Natural ingredients with proven results.</li>
            <li>Natural ingredients with proven results.</li>
            <li>I have been talking about getting old for a while now.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and well hydrated..</li>
            <li>My face is SO soft.</li>
            <li>I am 66 years old and people tell me that I look like I am in my early 50s.</li>
            <li>The dry spots of my cheekbones and the oily spots in my T-zone have all become a consistent soft, touchable texture.</li>
            <li>As I’ve mentioned a few times in other reviews, I have very sensitive skin (particularly on my hands) after a burn injury many years ago.</li>
            <li>I was starting to be mistaken for older than my 36 years, but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey but the oil really does seem to eliminate dryness and get rid of any minor skin flareups.  </li>
            <li>The new even texture of my skin has created a smoother overall look that people have noticed.</li>
            <li>Her skin is now very soft and she looks 10 years younger.  </li>
            <li>The scent is a bit intense for me, but something I am used to with other products that contain Sea Buckthorn.</li>
            <li>I found it a little heavy for morning use but love applying it in the evening before bed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this &amp;#34;little gem&amp;#34; for several years and would use no other.  </li>
            <li>It can be tough to find products that are gentle on my hands but powerful enough to do what they promise for my face.</li>
            <li>my skin has completely changed from very dry with patches of eczema in the winter time to gloriously dewy</li>
            <li>I found this to be a little too oily to use in the morning, but after applying it in the evening I can really tell the difference in the morning.</li>

            <li> Being cruelty free earns it big bonus points too!!  </li>
            <li> As Oridel points out in the product information, “Quantum physicists have scientifically proven that everything is composed of energy that is in a continuous state of interaction and many believe that there is the synergistic relationship between the earth’s precious minerals and botanicals, and that crystals have specific energies that emit vibrations which correspond to specific physical afflictions.”</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that much about gems and their powers</li>
            <li> I get a lot of products for free as I am in a business which enjoys such perks</li>
            <li> I use it most frequently under my eyes but also over my entire face.</li>
            <li> I also  think it&#x27;s such a unique feature to have a Citrine in the bottle!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does live up to its description!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always waiting for Oridel&#x27;s new skincare products - they put aging in reverse!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for everyone.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this face oil.  I have been using Oridel for about a year. My dermatologist suggested I try it. My skin has never looked or felt better.  It is smooth and more youthful looking.  Not greasy, use under makeup and look fresh all day.</li>
            <li> I use this product every morning and every night.  My face has never felt so smooth and healthy.  My skin definitely has a more glowing look and does not block my pores. Love love love.  Have been using it for years!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey but the oil really does seem to eliminate dryness and get rid of any minor skin flareups.  At least on Amazon it&#x27;s a few dollars cheaper than at your local spa.</li>
            <li> Best face oil I have ever used. It really helped with all my fine lines and gave me a glowing complexion. This is the best product hands down! Very quick shipping too!</li>
            <li> Liquid Gem is an absolute must have! If you purchase one skin care product this is the one!! As a woman in my 50s Liquid Gem is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34;. It gives your skin that youthful, healthy glow while diminishing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkle. It goes on like silk is all natural, feels wonderful and can be worn under your foundation. I highly recommend for everyone. I know I won&#x27;t be without it!</li>
            <li> I have used this oil for almost 2 years now. I use it most frequently under my eyes but also over my entire face. It is a very delicate oil that is not greasy and is readily absorbed into the skin. Unlike many under eye products that actually irritate the eyes this oil is pleasing and non-irritating. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I love this face oil. It makes my skin feel &amp; look great. I use it morning &amp; night. I can even later with other products if needed. It never feels oily or too heavy.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful serum which leaves skin soft, supple and silky. It smells great and absorbs quickly. It arrived quickly and was beautifully packaged.</li>
            <li> This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does live up to its description! I have a sensitive combination skin and this product helps hydrate my problem areas.&lt;br /&gt;It was oily at first but is absorbed by the skin in a few minutes.  It made my skin soft and supple. Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> I have not received my bottle yet. I have tried my mother&#x27;s on occasion. A bit oily. I like the ingredients.</li>
            <li> With Winter in full swing, you may notice that your moisturizer just isn&#x27;t cutting it like it used to.  If so, you may find a face oil is just what you need to really pump up the hydration as they tend to absorb into the skin better than a traditional moisturizer.  I know with the brutal Winter we&#x27;ve been experiencing, my face has been feeling tighter and just not as healthy &amp; hydrated as it usually does.  I&#x27;ve been using the Liquid Gem oil for 3 weeks now and I absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the oil non-greasy (it&#x27;s a common misconception that using oil on the face will make your face oilier and/or clog your pores) and I felt like my skin was really plumping up and feeling healthier as the days went by.....if my skin could speak, it would definitely say &amp;#34;Ahhhh, relief!! Thank you!!&amp;#34; --  The oil is fast absorbing and also has a very nice, natural scent - nothing overpowering.  They say after 3-4 months of use, you may see a reduction in pore size, so I&#x27;m excited to see what happens! A very little goes a long way and, despite using it twice a day for nearly 3 weeks now, I&#x27;ve barely made a dent.  I use this morning &amp; night and I also mix it with my bronzer (just a teeny drop) and it really does give my face a really dewy glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that I can recognize all the ingredients on the label and each of the 16 oils have so many health &amp; beauty benefits! I love that there&#x27;s no parabens, artificial fragrance, or harsh chemicals.  Being cruelty free earns it big bonus points too!!  I also  think it&#x27;s such a unique feature to have a Citrine in the bottle!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received many beauty products to review, and received this product for review purpose as well, but  have to say the Oridel Liquid Gem Regenerating Face Oil is my favorite discovery of late.  I can absolutely see why New Beauty Magazine named it as one of the Best Face Oils. I would absolutely buy this and am happy to recommend it to anyone who is seeking healthier skin!</li>
            <li> I got this oil last year. I like the effect on my skin. Your product makes my face look fresher and softer. It is very good under day/night cream products. Thank you.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend has been using this regenerating oil for about a year. Her skin is now very soft and she looks 10 years younger.  She swears by the Sea Buckthorn that makes the difference</li>
            <li> Liquid Gem face oil is a part of my daily regimen and it keeps my skin moisturized especially in this winter dry weather. Always have it with me when I fly. I have been using Liquid Gem Face Oil from Oridel for several months now and then I&#x27;ve heard of a concept of &amp;#34;layering&amp;#34; of skincare products  from my aesthetician. Since I started using Oridel Silk Day Cream together with Oridel Liquid Gem Regenerating Face Oil my skin has completely changed from very dry with patches of eczema in the winter time to gloriously dewy 24/7. I feel like I am creating a different product every time I combine these two products: a pump of Liquid Gem and small amount of Silk - doesn&#x27;t matter which one goes on first. The end result is always consistent-skin I love and get tons of complements on. I feel that my skin now is so much better than years ago. I&#x27;m always waiting for Oridel&#x27;s new skincare products - they put aging in reverse!</li>
            <li> I am always excited to try new products for bettering my skin and holding off the signs of aging. As I’ve mentioned a few times in other reviews, I have very sensitive skin (particularly on my hands) after a burn injury many years ago. It can be tough to find products that are gentle on my hands but powerful enough to do what they promise for my face. When I realized that Oridel’s Liquid Gem™ Regenerating Face Oil contains two ingredients that I’ve had success with in the past (Sea Buckthorn Oil and Argan Oil) as well as a variety of other powerful ingredients, I was happy to give it a try. Oridel provided me with a full-size sample for my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would describe my skin as combination. I have a definite t-zone of skin that is prone to oiliness, but my cheekbones can get so dry that they flake. I was a bit hesitant to apply an oil to my face, because my experience with oils in the past just left me with greasy-looking skin… even my dry cheekbones… but you know I must soldier on in the name of science… or reviews… or something…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the oil twice daily; once after washing my face on waking and once just before bed. A very little amount of oil goes a long way. I’ve been using the product for nearly three weeks and the bottle is still well over three-quarters full. The scent is a bit intense for me, but something I am used to with other products that contain Sea Buckthorn. It fades within half an hour… faster if you’re applying makeup over it. It feels very light on the skin. It’s a little oily at first, but quickly absorbed into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy using it after a mask. My face tends to feel a little bit tight and dry after a deep cleanse and the The Liquid Gem™ soothes it instantly. I am very curious how it would be after a sunburn or other skin irritation. Based on the effects after a mask, I think it would be very soothing and help the skin heal more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had pictures for you, but there was a software update to my camera in between the before and after shots and the lighting/ coloration is very different. It’s SO frustrating, because I can see a visible difference that just isn’t coming across in the photos!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s hard to tell the longer term effects just yet, but the short term effects have already been noticeable and I’m very happy. My skin feels silky smooth and soft. The dry spots of my cheekbones and the oily spots in my T-zone have all become a consistent soft, touchable texture. The new even texture of my skin has created a smoother overall look that people have noticed. It’s making me look a bit younger. I was starting to be mistaken for older than my 36 years, but now I’m told I look closer to 30. I’ll take that! My problematic pores appear to have shrunken only marginally, but Oridel does state that it can take a few months for those to be affected. Overall, my skin just simply looks better… and who would complain about that?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The addition of the Citrine stone is both fun and functional. Crystals are believed to have healing powers… a belief backed with science. As Oridel points out in the product information, “Quantum physicists have scientifically proven that everything is composed of energy that is in a continuous state of interaction and many believe that there is the synergistic relationship between the earth’s precious minerals and botanicals, and that crystals have specific energies that emit vibrations which correspond to specific physical afflictions.” The Liquid Gem™ gets a boost of healing energy and you get a lovely Citrine stone as a reward for finishing your bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be one of those reviews where I will need to come back at a later date and update. I received this review through Tomoson, so I am working under their time constraints to complete this review. I was only able to use the product for about three weeks, but the product information says that it can take up to three months for certain effects to take place. I will be continuing to use the product (there’s plenty of product to last me many weeks) and updating with my further impressions at a later date, so stay tuned! I hope I can provide you with before and after photos at that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Truly works to give you overall better skin. Natural ingredients with proven results. Citrine gem boost botanicals and rewards you.&lt;br /&gt;CONS: A little pricey, but lasts a long time.rmation says that it can take up to three months for certain effects to take place.

            <li> I have been talking about getting old for a while now. And while my mind would like to force my body to act like it was twenty again... it&#x27;s refusing the challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and even shared about being burned badly from essential oils applied directly to my skin. So to say that I am careful would be an understatement. This face oil from Oridel looked promising because..I can pronounce the ingredients! I know... that doesn&#x27;t happen often with facial products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions say to apply the oil twice daily; once after washing on waking and once just before bed. I found it a little heavy for morning use but love applying it in the evening before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only need a tiny amount of oil goes a long way.  It has a strong scent but that fades quickly. I think it is the Sea Buckthorn. It&#x27;s not a bad scent, just intense. The oil is well a little oily at first, but it is quickly absorbed into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients used in Oridel Liquid Gem Face Oil are Argan oil, Sea Buckthorn Oil, Apricot Oil, Arnica Oil, Avocado Oil, Borage Oil, Calendula Oil, Carrot Seed Oil, Chamomile Oil, Evening Primrose Oil, Jojoba Oil, Neroli Oil, Oil, Rosewood Oil, Sesame Oil, Vitamin E Oil, and Wheat Germ Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this product is easy, just apply as a moisturizer to your face and neck area twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re 30+ and looking for a product that will give hydrate your skin and give you back your glow, this is it. I&#x27;ve tried many creams and oils that were far too rich and actually clogged my pores making my skin look worse. Oridel Liquid Gem, is a gem, the ingredients are top notch and work effectively even on combination skin. If you have been afraid of oil, give this a try and it will change your mind.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oridel products for over 15 years.  I love liquid gel. My skin is soft and well hydrated.. It does not clog your pores. I get complements all the time about my skin and how nice it is for my age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company is wonderful to work with. I use several of their products and love all of them!</li>
            <li> I found this to be a little too oily to use in the morning, but after applying it in the evening I can really tell the difference in the morning. My face is SO soft. I especially like to use it after a microdermabrasion or peel since it soothes my skin. I also enjoy the light scent of the oils - like a mini aromatherapy!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is the best I&#x27;ve ever used!  My skin feels wonderful after I put it on.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years, and people always tell me how beautiful my skin is.</li>
            <li> Simply the best product I&#x27;ve ever used!  Will definitely try other products by Oridel in near future.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with Oridel&#x27;s Liquid Gem Face Oil. I have never used a oil that hasn&#x27;t been heavy or made my face feel greasy, but this stuff is NOTHING like this! It is light, smells wonderful, and easy to blend into makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gave me a really nice glow, as well as moisturized my skin. I have combination skin, so I was a tad worried that it would clog my pores in some spots. However, it didn&#x27;t clog my pores not once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see in the after picture my skin is glowing and more radiant. At one point I could of sworn it started freaking out because of it being so hydrated...haha! In all seriousness, I was thoroughly impressed. It&#x27;s truly unlike any other skincare product I have tried in the past, and let me say I have tried a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best parts is not only getting a beautiful Citrine gem once I&#x27;m done using it, but having amazingly supple and beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for several days now and have noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin. It&#x27;s moisturized and supple looking even with just the one pump. Just apply to face and neck day and/or night. Even though the moisturizer is jam packed with 15 best natural herbal oils*, my face doesn&#x27;t feel too oily. Each bottle also contains a faced Citrine stone to enhance the powers of the botanicals. I don&#x27;t know that much about gems and their powers but it is interesting plus you get a pretty semi-precious gemstone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s great about this face oil is that it can be used by so many different skin types whether you have had facial procedures, biopsies, acne and/or rosacea, sensitive skin and more. I am curious to see how my pores look after using this product for a couple of months!</li>
            <li> Love it! It smells great and absorbs quickly. After a few minutes does not feel oily at all. So great in this cold winter weather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this &amp;#34;little gem&amp;#34; for several years and would use no other.  I would agree that putting oil on one&#x27;s face might fly in the face (no pun intended) of correct facial care, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier that I did.  My face is softer, healthier, the lines diminished, scarring and spots improved, even acne recovery time is lessened.  It, along with a moisturizer, is the extent of my morning and evening regiment.</li>
            <li> Simply, the very best. Not only is my skin supple and glowing, it smells and feels like velvet-- the scent of this product is subtly fragrant but not overwhelming. The oil is not sticky and heavy but also not overly light and watery, a perfect balance, unlike all others. I get a lot of products for free as I am in a business which enjoys such perks but I happily pay for this product and every drop is an essential part of my routine. I have tried many, many others (Josie Maran etc.) but none compare. Top of the line, have shared this tip with many of my friends who live all over the world, and they all agree.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 years now.  I only use organic products, and this oil is beautiful, non-greasy, and contains&lt;br /&gt;the most wonderful combination of healing oils to soften and soothe my face.  I use it in the morning and at night and as a result, I feel&lt;br /&gt;like I&#x27;m looking more youthful and glowing !</li>
            <li> This is another one of the absolutely fabulous products from Oridel. I use this oil morning and evening and love the  effect on my face- it feels so soft and  healing!  I am 66 years old and people tell me that I look like I am in my early 50s. I credit Oridel products, many with Sea Buckthorn, for my facial rejuvenation!</li>
