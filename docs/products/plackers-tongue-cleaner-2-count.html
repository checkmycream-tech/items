            <li>I didn&#x27;t know my tongue could be so clean!</li>
            <li>It cleans off easily and is easy to carry when travelling -</li>
            <li>Just make sure you clean the tongue cleaner after...</li>
            <li>Clean tongue means clean kisses!</li>
            <li>Clean well and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Light, convenient for use at home and travel, does the job.</li>
            <li>cheap but works so well.</li>
            <li>I find it super easy to use this instead.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Gross what it comes out on it but better than it sitting on my tongue!</li>
            <li>exactly as described!</li>
            <li>A lot of people don&#x27;t clean their tongues - but you really should!</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have general good oral heath regardless of cleaning habits I highly recommend this to help.</li>
            <li>I absolutely have found this to make huge differences in my oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use the back-of-toothbrush tongue cleaners - this one will show you what a clean tongue really feels like.</li>
            <li>Overall I think its pretty effective.  </li>
            <li>This made my breath and general oral health much better.</li>
            <li>Works well; fits my need exactly.</li>
            <li>I have used many different types/brands of tongue cleaners.</li>
            <li>It will do exactly what you need it to.</li>
            <li>After using it daily, we love it and do feel fresher and cleaner every morning.</li>
            <li>because it&#x27;s pretty gross! :)</li>
            <li>product lasts a long time and is pretty cheap!</li>
            <li>(I am a big believer that a clean tongue makes for fresh breath)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good for a travel kit but not for long term daily use.</li>
            <li>Especially useful and recommended to anyone who wants to scrape out bad breath and maintain good oral hygeine.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s so much that can build up on your tongue.</li>
            <li>Really gets the gunk off your tongue</li>
            <li>these are awesome, i thought they&#x27;d be painful</li>
            <li>Normally I use a tongue brush, but thought I would give these a try as well.  </li>
            <li>Plus, they are easy to clean (just rinse off and maybe occasionally stir in some mouthwash) and last a very long time.</li>
            <li>Gets stuff off your tongue you didn&#x27;t think could live there.</li>
            <li>saw them while i was browsing on amazon for some new electric toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;d change is making the textured side a little more abrasive, but it still gets the job done.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old has no problem using it.</li>
            <li>breath is fresh and tongue is pink.</li>
            <li>Huge help with the breath odors and overall breaking down the biofilms that hang out on the tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended by Chinese doctors</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it as I have used a few different types over the years and this style works better than the previous ones, plus it cleans up easier.  .</li>
            <li>So some people with strong gag reflexes, trying to use a toothbrush to clean your tongue is impossible.  </li>
            <li>Gentle to your tongue as you scrape without the worries of wearing out your taste buds down.</li>
            <li>No more stank breath from this guy right here after using this on my tongue.</li>

            <li> Love it.. glad to have these</li>
            <li> Good design and comfortable!</li>
            <li> Finally a tongue cleaner that actually works</li>
            <li> These are very good looking tongue cleaners. They work good too. They come in a pack of two and me and my wife using one of each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with them and going to buy them again.</li>
            <li> Slim and very effective! Gross what it comes out on it but better than it sitting on my tongue!</li>
            <li> Does what you want it to do. Sometimes brushing, flossing, and mouthwash isn&#x27;t enough to stop your halitosis. No more stank breath from this guy right here after using this on my tongue.</li>
            <li> Works well; fits my need exactly. Put one in my bathroom and one in my travel bag.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know my tongue could be so clean! More effective than just brushing the tongue. Highly recommended by Chinese doctors</li>
            <li> I have used many different types/brands of tongue cleaners.

            <li> Horrible  I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have bought these.</li>
            <li> Light, convenient for use at home and travel, does the job.</li>
            <li> Normally I use a tongue brush, but thought I would give these a try as well.  It felt like pulling a razor over my tongue and didn&#x27;t seem to remove anything from my tongue. I thought the scraper would be some form of rubber but it is a hard sharp plastic. I will stick with my brush.</li>
            <li> We use these for our kids. Stinky breath be gone. :)</li>
            <li> Notice no cleaning effect.</li>
            <li> Work pretty good for the price. Very good value</li>
            <li> A lot of people don&#x27;t clean their tongues - but you really should! Not cleaning your tongue can lead to bad breath and a white tongue - gross! I absolutely have found this to make huge differences in my oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product lasts a long time and is pretty cheap! It will do exactly what you need it to.

            <li> works as you would expect it to.</li>
            <li> Love this tongue cleaner! It cleanes your tongue without making it bleed. Some tongue cleaners are a little on the rough side and it can hurt. This tongue cleaner is plastic and gets rid of the tongue funk without the pain.</li>
            <li> cheap but works so well. love it!</li>
            <li> It is okey product. The ones that are with brush are better.</li>
            <li> Brush side is a bit hard.  I was hoping for a longer bristle, but the bristle is short and plastic like.  The squeegee side is like hard plastic.  Overall I think its pretty effective.  My tongue feels cleaner and breath smells better immediately.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s body is different. If you don&#x27;t have general good oral heath regardless of cleaning habits I highly recommend this to help. There&#x27;s so much that can build up on your tongue. Brushing and rinsing alone doesn&#x27;t cut it for sure. This made my breath and general oral health much better.

            <li> My 5 year old has no problem using it. My husband loves too. Great at cleaning your tongue and keeping it stink free</li>
            <li> it hurts a bit while using from one of the side...</li>
            <li> My kids loved these..:)</li>
            <li> Not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> I love it! It hate that disgusting ewwiness on my tongue (especially after you eat a lot of candy! :)) And this does what it suppose to do. There is a brush part that scratches our tongue and then this plastic part that scrapes all that gross stuff. Just make sure you clean the tongue cleaner after...because it&#x27;s pretty gross! :)</li>
            <li> love these!!! i never know anything like these existed. saw them while i was browsing on amazon for some new electric toothbrush heads. these are awesome, i thought they&#x27;d be painful but they are not. i was going to go for some other metal ones but thought the plastic might be safer to use. awesome, i don&#x27;t know how my mouth lived without them. breath is fresh and tongue is pink.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for $3.99  or $1.50 each. Not the best not the worst it&#x27;s very thin I don&#x27;t think it will last very long. It&#x27;s a good for a travel kit but not for long term daily use.</li>
            <li> These tongue cleaners are reasonably priced and will make your gross mouth less disgusting. The only thing I&#x27;d change is making the textured side a little more abrasive, but it still gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Clean tongue means clean kisses! My wife love these and so do I.</li>
            <li> I used to use a kitchen teaspoon, turned over, but it seemed a little rough on the tongue, and because of it&#x27;s shape, I felt I had to do it over and over...then..the gag-reflex  LOL  Now with this cleaner, 3 swipes does the trick and no gagging.  Wish I had discovered this sooner.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Really gets the gunk off your tongue</li>
