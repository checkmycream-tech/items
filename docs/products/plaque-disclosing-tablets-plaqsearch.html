            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend using this in the morning if you care about your appearance--for kids, it would be fine because the dye really stains your tongue and takes awhile for it to come off.</li>

            <li>every once in awhile when he doesn&#x27;t expect it....and is amazed each time with how much he has missed.</li>
            <li>I live this product, the only after effect, is a bright pink tounge.</li>
            <li>The old spots and new!  </li>
            <li>a kid, who is now an adult, who SCRUBS his teeth way too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think</li>
            <li>But, a little bit of bleach gets it right off.</li>
            <li>Very helpful in showing my 7 year old where he is missing.  </li>

            <li> The shipping took a long time; by the time it came, we had thought of another solution.</li>
            <li> but, none of the tablets were crushed.  </li>
            <li> the truth is in the pink....</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> Please be careful if you are using these on your youngsters.  </li>
            <li> Small tablet but creates TONS of dye when mixed with your saliva</li>
            <li> gets the job done but is messy and the stain lasts a long time on your tongue</li>
            <li> The taste is very bitter, but can be spit out instead of swallowed while still benefitting from the purpose of the product</li>
            <li> it works, but wow messy and slow ship</li>
            <li> The package itself was not sealed and a little dented.</li>
            <li> Just a little pricey</li>
            <li> I would brush...and brush...and brush...as a little kid as part of the &amp;#34;Tuffy Tooth&amp;#34;</li>

            <li> twice...or at least TEACH your children</li>
            <li> Shipping was SLOW on this too.</li>
            <li> Was a little disappointed in the packaging... as the box of the product was crushed badly on arrival..</li>
            <li> not impressed.  </li>
            <li> these are a &amp;#34;guide&amp;#34; and are not perfect.  </li>
            <li> --it&#x27;s crazy.</li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t get sick, but I read that the ingredients could cause cancer.</li>
            <li> the problem with the tablets is it  will not brush off and will stain your sink very bad.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Definitely works. Small tablet but creates TONS of dye when mixed with your saliva--it&#x27;s crazy. I don&#x27;t recommend using this in the morning if you care about your appearance--for kids, it would be fine because the dye really stains your tongue and takes awhile for it to come off. I did not like the flavor. The package did not say what flavor it was and the package is not what it looks like in the picture. The package itself was not sealed and a little dented. The tablets were sealed. 20 is enough for me, I won&#x27;t buy again unless theres a better flavor.</li>
            <li> Easy to use tablets and less mess than the liquid.</li>
            <li> gets the job done but is messy and the stain lasts a long time on your tongue</li>
            <li> Works just as it should.</li>
            <li> Worked as described.  Was a little disappointed in the packaging... as the box of the product was crushed badly on arrival.. but, none of the tablets were crushed.  it does show places that need attention.  Grandson said said he didnt like the &#x27;taste&#x27;.... but he is very peculiar on EVERYTHING that doesnt taste just like he thinks it should! hahaha  BUT HE DID IT!  Shipping was SLOW on this too.</li>
            <li> Great teaching tool for young children</li>
            <li> My son felt tortured. We felt vindicated! Lol</li>
            <li> Great item to encourage my son to brush his teeth better. I allow him to oy use once or twice a week. I live this product, the only after effect, is a bright pink tounge. We laugh, it&#x27;s funny. It does go away</li>
            <li> they work great for my child. Not only do they show him what he missed, he loves looking at his &amp;#34;monster teeth&amp;#34;.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it stains my sink. But, a little bit of bleach gets it right off.</li>
            <li> Love these things........my son can&#x27;t argue about whether or not he did a good job brushing his teeth anymore........the truth is in the pink....teeth that is lol They work great.......</li>
            <li> Fun and reasonable priced.  Just used it for fun.</li>
            <li> Saving grade for our son&#x27;s teeth, takes the arguing out of &amp;#34;did you brush well enough&amp;#34;. Reviews are accurate that good rinsing is important, also, tablets stain the toothbrush. I recommend changing out brush every 3 months for sure. Shipping time took forever with the supplier being in great britain...you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. Just a little pricey but these are not easily found at a store.</li>
            <li> If you want to teach your kids the importance of brushing well, these Plaque Disclosing Tablets will do the trick!  I asked each of my kids to brush their teeth well and then had them chew a disclosing tablet.  They were amazed at what they had missed and have been a lot more diligent about brushing now that they know what they need to do!</li>
            <li> Our kids love to use these. They think it is fun while it allows us to see how well they are brushing. They can be messy though.</li>
            <li> These things should be in every bathroom and dentist&#x27;s office on the planet. They cost nothing, one box lasts a lifetime, and they are super informative. I went to the dentist after using these and he even noticed an improvement.</li>
            <li> My kids didn&#x27;t like it too much. The shipping took a long time; by the time it came, we had thought of another solution. Check out the shipping time before buying.</li>
            <li> This sure helped my son understand that he needs to spend a little more time in brushing his teeth. I make him chew this every once in awhile when he doesn&#x27;t expect it....and is amazed each time with how much he has missed. Good item to buy for all children.</li>
            <li> The taste is very bitter, but can be spit out instead of swallowed while still benefitting from the purpose of the product</li>
            <li> eh- I guess it did the job but I didn&#x27;t see any purple and red on my kid&#x27;s teeth.  I only saw maroon everywhere and it took 2 brushes to get off.... not impressed.  Possibly work doing this once, but wouldn&#x27;t do it again.</li>
            <li> Please be careful if you are using these on your youngsters.  I&#x27;m 51 and have gum-line recession from YEARS of brushing too hard.  That &amp;#34;behavior&amp;#34; was, no doubt, created by learning to brush and get the red-dye off the gum line.  I would brush...and brush...and brush...as a little kid as part of the &amp;#34;Tuffy Tooth&amp;#34; Campaign (Colgate).  The end result:  a kid, who is now an adult, who SCRUBS his teeth way too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think twice...or at least TEACH your children these are a &amp;#34;guide&amp;#34; and are not perfect.  Use to teach. . .with care.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know it was toxic to swallow.  My son swallowed it.  He didn&#x27;t get sick, but I read that the ingredients could cause cancer.</li>
            <li> the problem with the tablets is it  will not brush off and will stain your sink very bad.</li>
            <li> It stains the sink but it comes off!!</li>
            <li> Pricey, but does what its supposed to do.  Wish these were a little more easy to come by.</li>
            <li> Very helpful in showing my 7 year old where he is missing.  The old spots and new!  Very cool.</li>
            <li> Get these for your kid...no more arguing about teeth brushing...this is the proof you need..my child has NEVER had a cavity</li>
            <li> Love these, great accountability for kids</li>
            <li> Works well, too well dye covers everything</li>
            <li> it works, but wow messy and slow ship</li>
            <li> Great to show my 3yr old the places she is missing when she brushes.</li>
            <li> They expose problem areas as described.</li>
            <li> This product works great. It does exactly what it says it will do. This product would be great for parents wanting to check how well their child is brushing their teeth, or you can even check how well you are doing yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to assessing how well you/someone else is brushing, this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> Works well for showing where you need to brush more.</li>
