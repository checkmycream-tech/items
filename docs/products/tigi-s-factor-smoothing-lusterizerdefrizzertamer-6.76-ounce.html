            <li>I loved the LOOK, FEEL and SMELL and had to have it but didn&#x27;t want to pay the hefty salon price.</li>
            <li>It has a good smell</li>
            <li>oh that smells good&#x27;, just that you can tolerate it.  </li>
            <li>The smell should be good, not like rotting fruit.</li>
            <li>It also smells good.</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>The product smells very good in the bottle but a couple hours after applying it to my hair, I couldn&#x27;t smell it anymore - so that great smell goes away very, very fast.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this.  </li>
            <li>I always order a ton of items from Amazon and have been very pleased with prices and packaging.  </li>

            <li>Thank you for your top quality service!  </li>
            <li>Not the best results the first day...</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>First of all, this product is awesome.</li>
            <li>Love the smell!</li>
            <li>but I do love the product!)</li>
            <li>and I got it for a great cheap price.</li>
            <li>Not to mention that the smell of it is amazing.</li>
            <li>not OMG Amazing or anything like that.</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t amazing</li>
            <li>This product got a lot of amazing reviews</li>
            <li>It smells amazing.</li>
            <li>and it worked amazingly well.  </li>
            <li>It gives a nice shine to your hair and helps control the frizz.</li>
            <li>I really like it and it smells delicious.</li>
            <li>It kind of smelled like rotten food after sitting on my hair all day.</li>
            <li>Not only does this product work great, but it smells great too!!</li>
            <li>Mom also like it for her own hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is kind of normail.</li>
            <li>My hair is on the curly side and this potion gives me the kind of hair you see on models.</li>
            <li>The good side is that it smells good (and a lot, so you better love the smell), and it leaves sparkles on your hair, which may be what you want, or NOT during the day :)</li>
            <li>The best for naturally curly hair!</li>
            <li>Maybe my hair dresser had some kind of magic touch or maybe I&#x27;m not using this product correctly.</li>
            <li>I used to use Pureology products, which I still love, but I really liked the S factor smoothing product by TIGI.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying it on my own and fell in love.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best stuff I have used for my hair.  </li>
            <li>This is the best product, it has a sheen to it which illuminates the hair and gives it a shiny soft feel.</li>
            <li>Love love love it!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d like to say we have been going strong for 3 years now!</li>
            <li>When this first came in the mail, I was so excited because I had all the good reviews of people saying it worked and smelled great.</li>
            <li>Love how this product makes my hair feel so soft and silky :) Especially love the lower price from the Subscribe and save program!</li>
            <li>This product works great for hot, humid climates.  </li>
            <li>I really love this product and recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I was given a sample at my hair salon and fell in love.</li>
            <li>I have medium-length wavy/curly hair that I brush-straighten on a daily basis, so this sounded great!  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>but I just wished it worked better.</li>
            <li>The price is so much better then purchasing from a store.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I am one of many women who color and highlight their hair.  </li>
            <li>Let me say I&#x27;m a hair care junkie and will and have tried so many products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li>My hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li>My daughter has the most tangly hair and all she has to do is just wiggle her head and her hair is tangly.</li>
            <li>found that when I washed with the Bed HEad shampoo and conditioner and did not use the TIGI S Factor Smoothing product, my hair looked and felt better to the touch than when I used it.</li>
            <li>my hair looks and feels better than with any shampoo/conditioner combo</li>
            <li>I was okay-</li>
            <li>the shampoo/conditioner smelled better by themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lovely hair product for my curly hair.</li>
            <li>Love S factor products</li>
            <li>love these S Factor products.</li>
            <li>So happy to see it on Amazon and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>This is a magic smoothing lotion.</li>
            <li>I believe that the $10 Frizz Eaze version of this is better.</li>
            <li>This is lovely stuff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still looking for something better.</li>
            <li>I love it and use it every day.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Found a S Factor review on youtube and figured I&#x27;d give it a try, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s FABULOUS!</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It might take me a year or more to go through the product, so it will be well beyond its best-by date before I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>Used by my stylist &amp; fell in love....</li>
            <li>I love \\&quot;product\\&quot; and have tried almost everything, but this is my number 1 all-time favorite.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found a product that works better than this one for hair smoothing.</li>
            <li>I love TIGI S Factor Heat Protectant, so thought I&#x27;d try the smoothing lusterizer/defrizzer/tamer.  </li>
            <li>So, it works:)</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re probably better off using lotion instead of this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I will reorder this product again. :)</li>
            <li>This is an awesome lusterizer/defrizzer especially after a perm,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>anyone thinking about trying this does buy it &amp; loves it too :)</li>
            <li>One of of my favorite hair products.  </li>

            <li>This is an excellant product for long curly and hair with frize... Will continue to purchase best service</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li>This vendor got it to me very quickly, and I was 100% satisfied with their services.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this for someone who lives in an all-year humid climate, but I don&#x27;t know that it is the best de-frizzer for dry winter weather.</li>
            <li>I love how slky smooth it leaves my hair and also mu amd my.husband love the smell of the producy.</li>
            <li>It even tames the fizziness &amp; static issues my youngest has with her fine,</li>
            <li>So when I first used this product I was very pleased with the results I got.</li>

            <li>It smells great, really works, and the bottle looks cool.</li>
            <li>Overpriced and nothing special!</li>

            <li>I have a lot of hair, it&#x27;s just fine and is frizzy and this product has not helped with the frizz.</li>
            <li>The product makes hair shiny, smooth, and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s baby fine texture</li>
            <li>I have super static prone hair.</li>
            <li>so great feeling soft with a light sweet smell to it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely one of my favorite products!</li>
            <li>When complete strangers tell you your curls are beautiful and ask what you use, you know you&#x27;ve got the right product.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve found for keeping my naturally curly hair soft, frizz-free, and \\&quot;touchable.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>After I am done drying my hair it is nice and straight and smooth instead of kinky.  </li>
            <li>Hair is manageable, smooth and sleek.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve managed to return my hair to silky, smooth, shine.  </li>

            <li>This is some great product that actually does what it claims.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair extremely smooth; even after blow drying it.</li>

            <li>I love this range and highly recommend it :)</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s super fine (think corn silk) but frizzy.</li>
            <li>I believe there are many products shipper and more efficiency than TIGI Factor, i have use it for more than 2 weeks daily but nothing changed !</li>
            <li>OMG, it smells delicious and it leaves my thick hair feeling smooth and bouncy all day.</li>
            <li>Sure my hair felt smooth, but nothing really stood out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a ton of different products and this is by far the best, plus it is so versatile!</li>
            <li>Not so great on dry hair.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave this two stars was because the fragrance is pleasant...</li>
            <li>TIGI S factor is pure magic for your hair.</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;m buying another one right now(tiny bottle lasts me a year!).</li>
            <li>I normally do not write reviews on products, but this product is very deserving.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it say it does and has such a great scent.</li>
            <li>I really like TIGI products in general - always great quality.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>It does seem to really de frizz and relax my hair more than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>Not only does it look good</li>
            <li>The glistening sparkle that we all love is really just some glittery, shimmer stuff you can see on your hands when you apply it.</li>
            <li>I get compliments all the time about the healthy shine and smoothness of my hair, and I really have this product to thank.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was a total sell when we were home &amp; my husband commented on how good we smelled when we walked thru the door.</li>
            <li>I had purchased this product in the past and loved how it made my hair look and feel, so I was thrilled to see it on Amazon for a fraction of the cost that it is in the salon.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair have more body but at the same time the highlights make it absorb more moisture</li>
            <li>Super product.</li>
            <li>Love this product and highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful however, if I use too much it leaves my hair weighed down; I&#x27;m still practicing with this one ;)</li>
            <li>I only use it on summer days with high humidity, helps eliminate frizz and fly aways from the humid air.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find it here on Amazon, and for less than what I was paying before.  </li>
            <li>but overall it is still a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>Good for dry hair.</li>
            <li>You can only guarantee you are buying authentic salon products from a salon!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>oh so easy to straighten your hair and leaves it feeling silky, soft, and smooth.</li>
            <li>Really good product for dry, curly hair!</li>
            <li>Not a miracle, but for someone that has VERY curly hair, this product is fabulous when I straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>Smells great and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li>S Factor Lusterizer is a great detangler and gets rid of the frizz with out being too heavy.</li>
            <li>to say when I found this &amp;#34;hair savor&amp;#34; on Amazon &amp; so much cheaper PLUS free S&amp;H (Prime) I was on cloud 9!!&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li>It defines curls, tames fly aways and frizzy hair without being oily or heavy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used for only a couple of days now and to be honest</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any change in my frizzy hair and the smell is nice in the bottle but gross on my hair.</li>
            <li>Incredible fragrance &amp; it definitely smoothed my hair &amp; left it silkier than any product I have ever used</li>
            <li>This stuff isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the $ for the fragrance and the results.</li>
            <li>and I think it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>it was worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Needless</li>
            <li>This product is awesome, I use it in my wet hair (short pixie-style cut)</li>
            <li>Hair feels soft, smooth, and STRAIGHT!!!  </li>
            <li>Not only does it smell better than any other product ever created, but it makes your hair so soft, so shiny and sooo awesome!!</li>
            <li>It does have a mild fruity fragrance that is powerful when you first put it on but fades after that.</li>
            <li>While I love the smell of this product, I found that TIGI&#x27;s other defrizzer/smoothing conditioner product by Bedhead works better.</li>
            <li>Am a long time fan of Curls Rock as well, but this is another top product that does not disappoint!</li>
            <li>and I scanned the bar code right there in the salon.  </li>
            <li>I especially love that it has a very subtle sparkle that adds shine to your hair.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product to use in small quantities (read: dab) on the ends of your hair.  </li>
            <li>I have longer colored hair that is naturally straight and full.</li>
            <li>For me to keep using the same product for this long it must be good!  </li>
            <li>initially paid $27 for it at the salon &amp; if I hadn&#x27;t loved it so much I would not have paid that much for it.</li>
            <li>i did not like the way this product looks on me, it makes my hair hard instead of smooth and doesn&#x27;t smell as good as its supposed to.</li>
            <li>This is a good product with a slight strawberry scent.</li>
            <li>I apply it once i get out the shower and let it dry on its own.</li>
            <li>I was happy that it did last several months</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much or a build up will surface quickly.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>It does smell pretty good and its great that you only have to use just a little bit to go a long way</li>
            <li>The only reason I won&#x27;t be buying it more is because it contains parabens...</li>
            <li>This is a great product for thick, course hair like mine.</li>
            <li>First discovered it when my hairdresser used it.</li>
            <li>My stylist used to use this stuff on me over the winter because I has such a static problem with my hair.</li>
            <li>and it definitely helps with humidity, static, frizz, dryness and dullness.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Their hair stays soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li>When I first used this, I thought \\&quot;Meh, not that special.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I was the first person my stylist used this on</li>
            <li>I am currently applying it with a leave in conditioner and it seems to work better.</li>
            <li>salon sells this exact bottle of S Factor for $31, I was psyched that I had my Amazon iPhone app</li>
            <li>Another 10 bucks saved thanks to the Amazon app!</li>
            <li>Finally! :)</li>
            <li>So, if this stuff wants your teenager to spend time closer to you, it&#x27;s worth it:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My daughters and I were first introduced to this at our hair salon.</li>
            <li>I will gladly send them the remaining contents in the same box, but not at my expense.  </li>
            <li>and I loved how it helped tame my hair.</li>
            <li>after I air dry it a bit and the result is very smooth curls.</li>
            <li>will help smooth out slightly kinky hair (my hair has more grey in it now and appears slightly wiry while still being fly away hair even though it is colored.  </li>
            <li>The smell is intoxicating and the formula leaves my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>You will not regret it and it is easy to use on all different hair styles as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost 50 years old and have tried hundreds of products over the past 35 years - everything from DevaCurl to Pantene - and nothing made me happy.</li>
            <li>I get this product on a subscription basis which is such an easy thing to do.</li>
            <li>My hair was super soft after using.</li>
            <li>Yum :) Just a side note, there are tiny little specks of glitter in it, you mainly notice that your hands sparkle after use, but it&#x27;s not that noticeable and it actually looks really nice in the hair as it adds shine from where the light hits the glittery</li>
            <li>My Beautician had initially used this product in my hair, and i instantly fell in love with it!</li>
            <li>The only thing is that it works best after you apply to wet hair and blow dry.</li>
            <li>This is the only product I have ever used that truly smoothes my hair which is fine, wavy and unruly.</li>
            <li>The second day my hair looks fine.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the low price and receiving my item in a quick amount of time!</li>
            <li>Keeps hair soft, and it has a bit of sparkle which really brightens up hair!!  </li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t treat my hair with anything it is very poofy and frizzy</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy, it defrizzes my curly hair very well, and I use it to either style my hair</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really seen much of a difference.</li>
            <li>I have very curly, frizzy hair, and it has been a challenge for me to find products that reduce frizz while not making my hair feel \\&quot;crunchy.\\</li>
            <li>i have my hair cut in a keri hilson bob and it helps it get straight</li>
            <li>and i believe stay straight for longer</li>
            <li>It helps control the fly-aways and somewhat tames the ends, but it also leaves a very shiny finish (almost glitter-like) on your hair.   </li>
            <li>This stuff really does the trick.  </li>
            <li>I really do recomend  TIGI S Factor Smoothing Lusterizer and Defrizzer and Tamer, to anyone.</li>
            <li>I must say this one I really really like.</li>
            <li>This product really works at keeping away the frizz.  </li>
            <li>and it smooths out my unruly hair and makes it manageable, shiny and straight.  </li>
            <li>but this one really does the trick...</li>
            <li>This really works well for a non-salon treatment.  </li>
            <li>daily.(I have straight to wavy hair that is dyed and 50%</li>
            <li>Along with the S Factor deep conditioner, my hair is silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>I use it when my hair is curly or straight.</li>
            <li>I use this product regularly and it is fantastic for curly or frizzy hair control.</li>
            <li>I have been buying it from Amazon and it is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li>You really get what you pay for with this product.  </li>
            <li>That might be a tip to see if you are getting the real stuff.</li>
            <li>While this didn&#x27;t do too much for the waves, it did control the frizz and that was the kicker for me.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put too much or your hair will get too greasy.</li>
            <li>Really, I have.</li>
            <li>Then to actually see how it made our hair shiny &amp; frizz free</li>
            <li>it really helps reduce the frizz makes hair shiny.  </li>
            <li>My daughter and I both love this product when applied to wet hair before combing after washing our hair.  </li>
            <li>this really is what Jessie J uses on her hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the real thing.</li>
            <li>imagine if your hair is thick, this would be good for you.</li>
            <li>After reading mostly positive reviews for this product, I had high hopes for it.  </li>
            <li>Better then other defrizzer&#x27;s &amp; tamers.</li>
            <li>i have  used so many other products</li>
            <li>Smooth, silky, shiny hair without a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has the consistency of most other smoothing products-- lotion consistency, holds its shape, is thicker than a serum, yet slippery when rubbed between the fingers.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have try other products that have not work so good on my hair,  leaved it greasy and flat.</li>
            <li>a known carcinogen in many conventional hair products, shampoos, conditioners, and lotions.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy, shoulder length hair that I either  blow dry</li>
            <li>My hair gets pretty frizzy and wild</li>
            <li>use more if hair is thick--leaves hair polished looking without weighing it down and keeps it from being fly-away frizzy</li>
            <li>Overall, I highly recommend this product and will likely be stocking up as it has taken me a long time to find something this effective!</li>
            <li>I live in fear that it will be discontinued someday!</li>
            <li>I use it together with TIGI&#x27;s hair rock amplifier - less frizz and added more bounce to my hair.</li>
            <li>After touching my hair, my hands were a slightly shimmery.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>The best way I can describe it is if you cut up some cantaloupe or honeydew, then threw the seeds and peel in the trash and let it sit for a day, that smell from the trash of the fruit going bad, is what this stuff smells like.</li>
            <li>smells yummy, and it makes the hair soft and tamed, but do not use to much as it will cause a buildup</li>
            <li>for the product itself, it&#x27;s great, but expensive.</li>
            <li>This Smoothing Lusterizer is good, but not great.</li>
            <li>There are few things that could tame my hair but this is definitely one of the best!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other smoothing serums before but always come back to this because I love the results so much.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend for my other platinum sisters out there!</li>
            <li>A new product for me</li>
            <li>I live in Florida so this is a must for me.</li>
            <li>I am super picky and the fact that I&#x27;ve been using this same product for the last 5 + years really says something.</li>
            <li>It also leaves my hair very soft and somewhat shiny so besides hairspray</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m off to the natural stuff!</li>
            <li>This stuff did exactly the opposite of what it said.</li>
            <li>this by far is my all time fave!</li>
            <li>I have slightly wavy fine hair.</li>
            <li>My hair looks exactly the same after I use the product as it did before I applied it.</li>
            <li>We use it extremely sparingly if hair looks fried in the morning and only slightly more liberally for getting stubborn tangles/knots out.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I was looking for and at the same price (with shipping) that I would have paid at the store.</li>
            <li>It keeps my slightly frizzy hair smooth even in St .</li>
            <li>This product helps make my ends less frizzy and gives my hair a shiny and smooth look and feel.</li>
            <li>It has a golden shine to it in your hand but this does not show up after you dry it.  </li>
            <li>Per recommendation I have purchased this item, and for my somewhat fine hair it simply weighted it down too much.</li>
            <li>Keeps hair soft and smooth without weighing down the curl.</li>
            <li>Well, this honey has a really good strawberry smell, but actually it didnt fix very much in the hair, and makes it a little heavy...</li>
            <li>straight  and smooth,  or  scrunch it dry into loose curls.</li>
            <li>We live in Florida which naturally is very humid especially during warm/hot months.  </li>
            <li>but I do have fine hair &amp; it also killed the body.</li>
            <li>It can be a bit heavy for fine hair, though.</li>
            <li>My fine hair just wasn&#x27;t meant for this heavy product..</li>
            <li>The smell is amazingly different, as TIGI is well known for anyway, but it feels great on thick dry curly hair and have noticed a difference in the time</li>
            <li>My 19 year old son and</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft, touchable, manageable and shiny.</li>
            <li>My sister told me about this product and how well it worked to control the frizz and make her hair so soft and lusterious.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that can be frizzy since it is color treated.</li>
            <li>My hair fights humidity nearly all day.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>TIGI S Factor keeps my hair feeling soft and no frizz.  </li>
            <li>The only product that REALLY helps defrizz</li>
            <li>It helps stops the frizz that comes along with natural curly hair.</li>
            <li>I have used this stuff for a long time since my stylist first sold it to me.</li>
            <li>Of course I can only speak for my type of hair, but if someone posts a review and says it made their hair \\&quot;greasy\\&quot;, it means they used too much.</li>
            <li>and I got it for around $17 on Amazon - nearly 50% off.</li>
            <li>I actually didn&#x27;t like this product that much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;10 years so far.</li>
            <li>I have natural curly frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>You can only get the real thing in salons.</li>
            <li>I felt fortunate to find it at half the price on your website.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li>Totally convinced this is NOT the right product disguised as such.</li>
            <li>It makes it so soft and silky and Straight without the flat iron...</li>
            <li>I then went to an outdoor event with my family and this product held up extremely well considering it was 98 degrees outside with 90% humidity and my hair still looked frizz free.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do much to tame my frizz or keep my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I have long straight hair and was looking for something to make my hair shiny and lustrous.  </li>
            <li>My hairstylist at Toni &amp; Guy always uses this product and I don&#x27;t normally buy into hair products, nor do I like to put in several products in my hair</li>
            <li>It works miracles on my fine but thick naturally wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>I live in Singapore now &amp; have NEVER had a problem with frizz before I moved here, even though I&#x27;ve lived in several humid climates.</li>
            <li>curly or blow dry it straight.  </li>
            <li>I blow dry my hair straight.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t really help with the static.</li>
            <li>My local ULTA has the same product for quite a bit more, but their bottle was manufactured within the past year.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how my hair looked, it actually was wavy with almost no frizz.</li>
            <li>My obtuse 18 year old daughter kept wanting to pet the back of my head.</li>
            <li>Is a little heavy on hair at first, but soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it claims and smooths down hair.</li>
            <li>all the live long day.&lt;br /&gt;BTW</li>
            <li>Super slick Jessie J style hair now</li>
            <li>I have straight, normal (not fine or coarse).</li>
            <li>I used it on dry hair the first day and then wet hair on the second day.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended if you need to tame your hair and make it soft.</li>
            <li>Can use on wet or dry hair, curly or straight.</li>
            <li>i use it on my natural african american hair to blow dry</li>
            <li>You only need a little dab of the product and it really does the job.</li>
            <li>Just thought people should know that it&#x27;s hard to tell whether you&#x27;ll get a product with a useful shelf life when you buy this online, unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This really keeps the frizzies down!</li>

            <li> I loved the LOOK, FEEL and SMELL and had to have it but didn&#x27;t want to pay the hefty salon price.</li>
            <li> It has a good smell</li>
            <li> oh that smells good&#x27;, just that you can tolerate it.  </li>
            <li> The smell should be good, not like rotting fruit.</li>
            <li> It also smells good.</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> The product smells very good in the bottle but a couple hours after applying it to my hair, I couldn&#x27;t smell it anymore - so that great smell goes away very, very fast.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this.  </li>
            <li> I always order a ton of items from Amazon and have been very pleased with prices and packaging.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend for sure!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> It defrizzes and tames any fly-aways and most of all, it smells divine!   </li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> Glad I did!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Thank you for your top quality service!  </li>
            <li> Not the best results the first day...</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> First of all, this product is awesome.</li>
            <li> Love the smell!</li>
            <li> but I do love the product!)</li>
            <li> and I got it for a great cheap price.</li>
            <li> Not to mention that the smell of it is amazing.</li>
            <li> not OMG Amazing or anything like that.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t amazing</li>
            <li> This product got a lot of amazing reviews</li>
            <li> It smells amazing.</li>
            <li> and it worked amazingly well.  </li>
            <li> It gives a nice shine to your hair and helps control the frizz.</li>
            <li> I really like it and it smells delicious.</li>
            <li> It kind of smelled like rotten food after sitting on my hair all day.</li>
            <li> Not only does this product work great, but it smells great too!!</li>
            <li> Mom also like it for her own hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is kind of normail.</li>
            <li> My hair is on the curly side and this potion gives me the kind of hair you see on models.</li>
            <li> The good side is that it smells good (and a lot, so you better love the smell), and it leaves sparkles on your hair, which may be what you want, or NOT during the day :)</li>
            <li> The best for naturally curly hair!</li>
            <li> Maybe my hair dresser had some kind of magic touch or maybe I&#x27;m not using this product correctly.</li>
            <li> I used to use Pureology products, which I still love, but I really liked the S factor smoothing product by TIGI.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying it on my own and fell in love.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best stuff I have used for my hair.  </li>
            <li> This is the best product, it has a sheen to it which illuminates the hair and gives it a shiny soft feel.</li>
            <li> Love love love it!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d like to say we have been going strong for 3 years now!</li>
            <li> When this first came in the mail, I was so excited because I had all the good reviews of people saying it worked and smelled great.</li>
            <li> Love how this product makes my hair feel so soft and silky :) Especially love the lower price from the Subscribe and save program!</li>
            <li> This product works great for hot, humid climates.  </li>
            <li> I really love this product and recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample at my hair salon and fell in love.</li>
            <li> I have medium-length wavy/curly hair that I brush-straighten on a daily basis, so this sounded great!  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> but I just wished it worked better.</li>
            <li> The price is so much better then purchasing from a store.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I am one of many women who color and highlight their hair.  </li>
            <li> Let me say I&#x27;m a hair care junkie and will and have tried so many products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li> My daughter has the most tangly hair and all she has to do is just wiggle her head and her hair is tangly.</li>
            <li> found that when I washed with the Bed HEad shampoo and conditioner and did not use the TIGI S Factor Smoothing product, my hair looked and felt better to the touch than when I used it.</li>
            <li> my hair looks and feels better than with any shampoo/conditioner combo</li>
            <li> I was okay-</li>
            <li> the shampoo/conditioner smelled better by themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lovely hair product for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> Love S factor products</li>
            <li> love these S Factor products.</li>
            <li> So happy to see it on Amazon and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This is a magic smoothing lotion.</li>
            <li> I believe that the $10 Frizz Eaze version of this is better.</li>
            <li> This is lovely stuff.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still looking for something better.</li>
            <li> I love it and use it every day.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Found a S Factor review on youtube and figured I&#x27;d give it a try, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s FABULOUS!</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> It might take me a year or more to go through the product, so it will be well beyond its best-by date before I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> Used by my stylist &amp; fell in love....</li>
            <li> I love \\&quot;product\\&quot; and have tried almost everything, but this is my number 1 all-time favorite.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a product that works better than this one for hair smoothing.</li>
            <li> I love TIGI S Factor Heat Protectant, so thought I&#x27;d try the smoothing lusterizer/defrizzer/tamer.  </li>
            <li> So, it works:)</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re probably better off using lotion instead of this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I will reorder this product again. :)</li>
            <li> This is an awesome lusterizer/defrizzer especially after a perm,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> anyone thinking about trying this does buy it &amp; loves it too :)</li>
            <li> One of of my favorite hair products.  </li>
            <li> product is on the Top 10 Hair Products Awards.</li>

            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It smells great and really smoothes my hair.  </li>
            <li> This product works either way to keep my hair shiney and frizz free!  </li>
            <li> this is supposed to be a high end product that works great.</li>
            <li> This is an excellant product for long curly and hair with frize... Will continue to purchase best service</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li> This vendor got it to me very quickly, and I was 100% satisfied with their services.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this for someone who lives in an all-year humid climate, but I don&#x27;t know that it is the best de-frizzer for dry winter weather.</li>
            <li> I love how slky smooth it leaves my hair and also mu amd my.husband love the smell of the producy.</li>
            <li> It even tames the fizziness &amp; static issues my youngest has with her fine,</li>
            <li> So when I first used this product I was very pleased with the results I got.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great in that it does leave your hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> It also helps keep tangles to a minimum in wet hair - which is awesome with squirmy, tender-headed princesses.</li>
            <li> It smells great, really works, and the bottle looks cool.</li>
            <li> Overpriced and nothing special!</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t very frizzy - it is straight and fine but it gets full of static in winter and this stuff works great!</li>
            <li> I love hair products and always like to try new ones, but this one is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li> It came very quickly in the mail</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and REALLY helps to smooth my natural curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It never weighs my fine, wavy hair down, and the shine and softness are awesome.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, it&#x27;s just fine and is frizzy and this product has not helped with the frizz.</li>
            <li> The product makes hair shiny, smooth, and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s baby fine texture</li>
            <li> I have super static prone hair.</li>
            <li> so great feeling soft with a light sweet smell to it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely one of my favorite products!</li>
            <li> When complete strangers tell you your curls are beautiful and ask what you use, you know you&#x27;ve got the right product.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve found for keeping my naturally curly hair soft, frizz-free, and \\&quot;touchable.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> After I am done drying my hair it is nice and straight and smooth instead of kinky.  </li>
            <li> Hair is manageable, smooth and sleek.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve managed to return my hair to silky, smooth, shine.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous.</li>
            <li> After I blow dried it myself, I looked GORGEOUS!!!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> This is some great product that actually does what it claims.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair extremely smooth; even after blow drying it.</li>
            <li> leaves hair silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This helps keep it smooth longer.  </li>
            <li> This product is fantastic for keeping hair smooth.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair turn out smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair feeling smooth and tames your hair.</li>
            <li> Not only does this stuff work amazingly to smooth out your hair, and keep your curls nice or your hair straight, but it smells amazing!  </li>
            <li> I love this range and highly recommend it :)</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s super fine (think corn silk) but frizzy.</li>
            <li> I believe there are many products shipper and more efficiency than TIGI Factor, i have use it for more than 2 weeks daily but nothing changed !</li>
            <li> OMG, it smells delicious and it leaves my thick hair feeling smooth and bouncy all day.</li>
            <li> Sure my hair felt smooth, but nothing really stood out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a ton of different products and this is by far the best, plus it is so versatile!</li>
            <li> Not so great on dry hair.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this two stars was because the fragrance is pleasant...</li>
            <li> TIGI S factor is pure magic for your hair.</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;m buying another one right now(tiny bottle lasts me a year!).</li>
            <li> I normally do not write reviews on products, but this product is very deserving.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it say it does and has such a great scent.</li>
            <li> I really like TIGI products in general - always great quality.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> It does seem to really de frizz and relax my hair more than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Not only does it look good</li>
            <li> The glistening sparkle that we all love is really just some glittery, shimmer stuff you can see on your hands when you apply it.</li>
            <li> I get compliments all the time about the healthy shine and smoothness of my hair, and I really have this product to thank.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was a total sell when we were home &amp; my husband commented on how good we smelled when we walked thru the door.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this product in the past and loved how it made my hair look and feel, so I was thrilled to see it on Amazon for a fraction of the cost that it is in the salon.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair have more body but at the same time the highlights make it absorb more moisture</li>
            <li> Super product.</li>
            <li> Love this product and highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful however, if I use too much it leaves my hair weighed down; I&#x27;m still practicing with this one ;)</li>
            <li> I only use it on summer days with high humidity, helps eliminate frizz and fly aways from the humid air.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find it here on Amazon, and for less than what I was paying before.  </li>
            <li> but overall it is still a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> Good for dry hair.</li>
            <li> You can only guarantee you are buying authentic salon products from a salon!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> oh so easy to straighten your hair and leaves it feeling silky, soft, and smooth.</li>
            <li> Really good product for dry, curly hair!</li>
            <li> Not a miracle, but for someone that has VERY curly hair, this product is fabulous when I straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> Smells great and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> S Factor Lusterizer is a great detangler and gets rid of the frizz with out being too heavy.</li>
            <li> to say when I found this &amp;#34;hair savor&amp;#34; on Amazon &amp; so much cheaper PLUS free S&amp;H (Prime) I was on cloud 9!!&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li> It defines curls, tames fly aways and frizzy hair without being oily or heavy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used for only a couple of days now and to be honest</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any change in my frizzy hair and the smell is nice in the bottle but gross on my hair.</li>
            <li> Incredible fragrance &amp; it definitely smoothed my hair &amp; left it silkier than any product I have ever used</li>
            <li> This stuff isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth the $ for the fragrance and the results.</li>
            <li> and I think it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> it was worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Needless</li>
            <li> This product is awesome, I use it in my wet hair (short pixie-style cut)</li>
            <li> Hair feels soft, smooth, and STRAIGHT!!!  </li>
            <li> Not only does it smell better than any other product ever created, but it makes your hair so soft, so shiny and sooo awesome!!</li>
            <li> It does have a mild fruity fragrance that is powerful when you first put it on but fades after that.</li>
            <li> While I love the smell of this product, I found that TIGI&#x27;s other defrizzer/smoothing conditioner product by Bedhead works better.</li>
            <li> Am a long time fan of Curls Rock as well, but this is another top product that does not disappoint!</li>
            <li> and I scanned the bar code right there in the salon.  </li>
            <li> I especially love that it has a very subtle sparkle that adds shine to your hair.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product to use in small quantities (read: dab) on the ends of your hair.  </li>
            <li> I have longer colored hair that is naturally straight and full.</li>
            <li> For me to keep using the same product for this long it must be good!  </li>
            <li> initially paid $27 for it at the salon &amp; if I hadn&#x27;t loved it so much I would not have paid that much for it.</li>
            <li> i did not like the way this product looks on me, it makes my hair hard instead of smooth and doesn&#x27;t smell as good as its supposed to.</li>
            <li> This is a good product with a slight strawberry scent.</li>
            <li> I apply it once i get out the shower and let it dry on its own.</li>
            <li> I was happy that it did last several months</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much or a build up will surface quickly.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> It does smell pretty good and its great that you only have to use just a little bit to go a long way</li>
            <li> The only reason I won&#x27;t be buying it more is because it contains parabens...</li>
            <li> This is a great product for thick, course hair like mine.</li>
            <li> First discovered it when my hairdresser used it.</li>
            <li> My stylist used to use this stuff on me over the winter because I has such a static problem with my hair.</li>
            <li> and it definitely helps with humidity, static, frizz, dryness and dullness.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Their hair stays soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li> When I first used this, I thought \\&quot;Meh, not that special.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I was the first person my stylist used this on</li>
            <li> I am currently applying it with a leave in conditioner and it seems to work better.</li>
            <li> salon sells this exact bottle of S Factor for $31, I was psyched that I had my Amazon iPhone app</li>
            <li> Another 10 bucks saved thanks to the Amazon app!</li>
            <li> Finally! :)</li>
            <li> So, if this stuff wants your teenager to spend time closer to you, it&#x27;s worth it:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughters and I were first introduced to this at our hair salon.</li>
            <li> I will gladly send them the remaining contents in the same box, but not at my expense.  </li>
            <li> and I loved how it helped tame my hair.</li>
            <li> after I air dry it a bit and the result is very smooth curls.</li>
            <li> will help smooth out slightly kinky hair (my hair has more grey in it now and appears slightly wiry while still being fly away hair even though it is colored.  </li>
            <li> The smell is intoxicating and the formula leaves my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> You will not regret it and it is easy to use on all different hair styles as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 50 years old and have tried hundreds of products over the past 35 years - everything from DevaCurl to Pantene - and nothing made me happy.</li>
            <li> I get this product on a subscription basis which is such an easy thing to do.</li>
            <li> My hair was super soft after using.</li>
            <li> Yum :) Just a side note, there are tiny little specks of glitter in it, you mainly notice that your hands sparkle after use, but it&#x27;s not that noticeable and it actually looks really nice in the hair as it adds shine from where the light hits the glittery</li>
            <li> My Beautician had initially used this product in my hair, and i instantly fell in love with it!</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it works best after you apply to wet hair and blow dry.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have ever used that truly smoothes my hair which is fine, wavy and unruly.</li>
            <li> The second day my hair looks fine.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the low price and receiving my item in a quick amount of time!</li>
            <li> Keeps hair soft, and it has a bit of sparkle which really brightens up hair!!  </li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t treat my hair with anything it is very poofy and frizzy</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy, it defrizzes my curly hair very well, and I use it to either style my hair</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really seen much of a difference.</li>
            <li> I have very curly, frizzy hair, and it has been a challenge for me to find products that reduce frizz while not making my hair feel \\&quot;crunchy.\\</li>
            <li> i have my hair cut in a keri hilson bob and it helps it get straight</li>
            <li> and i believe stay straight for longer</li>
            <li> It helps control the fly-aways and somewhat tames the ends, but it also leaves a very shiny finish (almost glitter-like) on your hair.   </li>
            <li> This stuff really does the trick.  </li>
            <li> I really do recomend  TIGI S Factor Smoothing Lusterizer and Defrizzer and Tamer, to anyone.</li>
            <li> I must say this one I really really like.</li>
            <li> This product really works at keeping away the frizz.  </li>
            <li> and it smooths out my unruly hair and makes it manageable, shiny and straight.  </li>
            <li> but this one really does the trick...</li>
            <li> This really works well for a non-salon treatment.  </li>
            <li> daily.(I have straight to wavy hair that is dyed and 50%</li>
            <li> Along with the S Factor deep conditioner, my hair is silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> I use it when my hair is curly or straight.</li>
            <li> I use this product regularly and it is fantastic for curly or frizzy hair control.</li>
            <li> I have been buying it from Amazon and it is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li> You really get what you pay for with this product.  </li>
            <li> That might be a tip to see if you are getting the real stuff.</li>
            <li> While this didn&#x27;t do too much for the waves, it did control the frizz and that was the kicker for me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put too much or your hair will get too greasy.</li>
            <li> Really, I have.</li>
            <li> Then to actually see how it made our hair shiny &amp; frizz free</li>
            <li> it really helps reduce the frizz makes hair shiny.  </li>
            <li> My daughter and I both love this product when applied to wet hair before combing after washing our hair.  </li>
            <li> this really is what Jessie J uses on her hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the real thing.</li>
            <li> imagine if your hair is thick, this would be good for you.</li>
            <li> After reading mostly positive reviews for this product, I had high hopes for it.  </li>
            <li> Better then other defrizzer&#x27;s &amp; tamers.</li>
            <li> i have  used so many other products</li>
            <li> Smooth, silky, shiny hair without a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has the consistency of most other smoothing products-- lotion consistency, holds its shape, is thicker than a serum, yet slippery when rubbed between the fingers.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have try other products that have not work so good on my hair,  leaved it greasy and flat.</li>
            <li> a known carcinogen in many conventional hair products, shampoos, conditioners, and lotions.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, wavy, shoulder length hair that I either  blow dry</li>
            <li> My hair gets pretty frizzy and wild</li>
            <li> use more if hair is thick--leaves hair polished looking without weighing it down and keeps it from being fly-away frizzy</li>
            <li> Overall, I highly recommend this product and will likely be stocking up as it has taken me a long time to find something this effective!</li>
            <li> I live in fear that it will be discontinued someday!</li>
            <li> I use it together with TIGI&#x27;s hair rock amplifier - less frizz and added more bounce to my hair.</li>
            <li> After touching my hair, my hands were a slightly shimmery.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> The best way I can describe it is if you cut up some cantaloupe or honeydew, then threw the seeds and peel in the trash and let it sit for a day, that smell from the trash of the fruit going bad, is what this stuff smells like.</li>
            <li> smells yummy, and it makes the hair soft and tamed, but do not use to much as it will cause a buildup</li>
            <li> for the product itself, it&#x27;s great, but expensive.</li>
            <li> This Smoothing Lusterizer is good, but not great.</li>
            <li> There are few things that could tame my hair but this is definitely one of the best!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other smoothing serums before but always come back to this because I love the results so much.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend for my other platinum sisters out there!</li>
            <li> A new product for me</li>
            <li> I live in Florida so this is a must for me.</li>
            <li> I am super picky and the fact that I&#x27;ve been using this same product for the last 5 + years really says something.</li>
            <li> It also leaves my hair very soft and somewhat shiny so besides hairspray</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m off to the natural stuff!</li>
            <li> This stuff did exactly the opposite of what it said.</li>
            <li> this by far is my all time fave!</li>
            <li> I have slightly wavy fine hair.</li>
            <li> My hair looks exactly the same after I use the product as it did before I applied it.</li>
            <li> We use it extremely sparingly if hair looks fried in the morning and only slightly more liberally for getting stubborn tangles/knots out.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I was looking for and at the same price (with shipping) that I would have paid at the store.</li>
            <li> It keeps my slightly frizzy hair smooth even in St .</li>
            <li> This product helps make my ends less frizzy and gives my hair a shiny and smooth look and feel.</li>
            <li> It has a golden shine to it in your hand but this does not show up after you dry it.  </li>
            <li> Per recommendation I have purchased this item, and for my somewhat fine hair it simply weighted it down too much.</li>
            <li> Keeps hair soft and smooth without weighing down the curl.</li>
            <li> Well, this honey has a really good strawberry smell, but actually it didnt fix very much in the hair, and makes it a little heavy...</li>
            <li> straight  and smooth,  or  scrunch it dry into loose curls.</li>
            <li> We live in Florida which naturally is very humid especially during warm/hot months.  </li>
            <li> but I do have fine hair &amp; it also killed the body.</li>
            <li> It can be a bit heavy for fine hair, though.</li>
            <li> My fine hair just wasn&#x27;t meant for this heavy product..</li>
            <li> The smell is amazingly different, as TIGI is well known for anyway, but it feels great on thick dry curly hair and have noticed a difference in the time</li>
            <li> My 19 year old son and</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft, touchable, manageable and shiny.</li>
            <li> My sister told me about this product and how well it worked to control the frizz and make her hair so soft and lusterious.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that can be frizzy since it is color treated.</li>
            <li> My hair fights humidity nearly all day.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> TIGI S Factor keeps my hair feeling soft and no frizz.  </li>
            <li> The only product that REALLY helps defrizz</li>
            <li> It helps stops the frizz that comes along with natural curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff for a long time since my stylist first sold it to me.</li>
            <li> Of course I can only speak for my type of hair, but if someone posts a review and says it made their hair \\&quot;greasy\\&quot;, it means they used too much.</li>
            <li> and I got it for around $17 on Amazon - nearly 50% off.</li>
            <li> I actually didn&#x27;t like this product that much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;10 years so far.</li>
            <li> I have natural curly frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> You can only get the real thing in salons.</li>
            <li> I felt fortunate to find it at half the price on your website.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Totally convinced this is NOT the right product disguised as such.</li>
            <li> It makes it so soft and silky and Straight without the flat iron...</li>
            <li> I then went to an outdoor event with my family and this product held up extremely well considering it was 98 degrees outside with 90% humidity and my hair still looked frizz free.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do much to tame my frizz or keep my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have long straight hair and was looking for something to make my hair shiny and lustrous.  </li>
            <li> My hairstylist at Toni &amp; Guy always uses this product and I don&#x27;t normally buy into hair products, nor do I like to put in several products in my hair</li>
            <li> It works miracles on my fine but thick naturally wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I live in Singapore now &amp; have NEVER had a problem with frizz before I moved here, even though I&#x27;ve lived in several humid climates.</li>
            <li> curly or blow dry it straight.  </li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair straight.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t really help with the static.</li>
            <li> My local ULTA has the same product for quite a bit more, but their bottle was manufactured within the past year.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how my hair looked, it actually was wavy with almost no frizz.</li>
            <li> My obtuse 18 year old daughter kept wanting to pet the back of my head.</li>
            <li> Is a little heavy on hair at first, but soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it claims and smooths down hair.</li>
            <li> all the live long day.&lt;br /&gt;BTW</li>
            <li> Super slick Jessie J style hair now</li>
            <li> I have straight, normal (not fine or coarse).</li>
            <li> I used it on dry hair the first day and then wet hair on the second day.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended if you need to tame your hair and make it soft.</li>
            <li> Can use on wet or dry hair, curly or straight.</li>
            <li> i use it on my natural african american hair to blow dry</li>
            <li> You only need a little dab of the product and it really does the job.</li>
            <li> Just thought people should know that it&#x27;s hard to tell whether you&#x27;ll get a product with a useful shelf life when you buy this online, unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This really keeps the frizzies down!</li>
            <li> I have to be careful not to put too much on though because my hair isn&#x27;t thick or course and if I put too much it looks greasy.  </li>
            <li> :) I usually use a little bit when my hair is damp, then blow dry.</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t use too much, it will not weigh your hair down or make it look oily, etc.</li>
            <li> Before I had long dry frizzy hair and than I started using this, If you want soft silky hair, this is the product.</li>
            <li> and you only need a very small amount when using for frizz and a little more when using a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I have tried this product on wet and dry hair, I&#x27;ve tried a little and more than a little, but nothing I&#x27;ve tried seems to work.</li>
            <li> Really fine hair usually has a bunch of flyaways, this smoothes it down -- all without making you look like a greaseball!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and not oily like other products.</li>
            <li> Have to use a lot to get a smooth affect all over but careful not to use too much otherwise your hair will feel/look greasy and dirty.</li>
            <li> The bottle goes a long way as you only need to use about a dime amount when you use it.</li>
            <li> IT TAKES OUT ALL OF THE FRIZZ AFTER FLAT IRONING, EVEN IN RAINY WEATHER.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> I blow-dry and flat iron</li>
            <li> I often use a flat iron on my hair and it was drying it out.  </li>
            <li> have a few if the other Tigi S Factor products, including their salon size shampoo and hair mask &amp;#60;-- I highly recommend the hair mask!!</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, a little product goes a long way, so I expect this to last a pretty long time.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this, but in NYC summer humidity, it did nothing to tame my frizz and made my hair feel a bit straw-like.</li>
            <li> Blow dry, straighten, and then about a pea size to go over any extra flyaways.</li>
            <li> But after about 7 hours, and especially in low-humidity conditions, I find that my hair starts to feel dry and somewhat frizzy.</li>
            <li> I suppose it is possible it shortens my dry time by a minute or two.</li>
            <li> but I can also reapply any time after it is dry to add extra shine and control.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for less than $20 on Amazon which is the cheapest I have found it so far.  </li>
            <li> so I normally wash my hair every other day due to the crappy water out here.</li>
            <li> I have long flowy hair, and this product treats it so well.  </li>
            <li> One bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> pin straight hair (without weighing it down or making it limp  </li>
            <li> I try and try to find something better or less expensive but cannot...</li>
            <li> I use this with the chi straightening gurad when I get out of shower, I then blow dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> Dry hair and frizz are gone.  </li>
            <li> It does work when I blow dry it into my hair</li>
            <li> I would recommend for anyone with dry or curly hair.</li>
            <li> But aside from that, I find it leaves my hair rather dry.</li>
            <li> When my hair was fully dry</li>
            <li> I have hypothyroidism, so I have some split ends in my hair because it&#x27;s dry.  </li>
            <li> This is the only product that can keep my damaged permed hair from frizzing - but it is a little flat, I do sacrifice some volume.</li>
            <li> My hair is halfway down my back</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and without it cannot get a comb through it after washing without this product!  </li>
            <li> I just added it in my wet hair after applying a leave in conditioner and let my hair air dry .</li>
            <li> use about a quarter size dollop and run thru wet hair and then blow dry...</li>
            <li> I have tried it on both wet hair and dry hair, and it there was no visible difference at all.</li>
            <li> I even tried putting it on only half my head and asked people if they could tell the difference, they couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> You only need a little amount</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the only product I use on my hair on an everyday basis.</li>
            <li> My mother was curious and I let her use mine</li>
            <li> I use about a quarter size amount when wet.</li>
            <li> It is not very curly and not smoothy, this produce was not what i was looking for at all.</li>
            <li> Not much to ssay.</li>
            <li> (o.k., not really,</li>
            <li> but i only used it a few times and now it is just sitting in my bathroom unused.</li>
            <li> When applied to wet hair the product tames frizzes well.</li>
            <li> She mixed it in her hand with a few pumps of Moroccan Oil and then thoroughly worked it through my wet hair with her fingers.  </li>
            <li> When you put it on, it leaves the microscopic glitters all over your fingers, which is kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> I use this product on towel-dried hair, so I&#x27;m not sure if it would be the same on completely dry hair.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and mine is usually like straw!</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way...</li>
            <li> a little product goes a long  way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways and this stuff works.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> ...lusterizes (it comes out extremely pearlescent and you&#x27;ll have sparkles on your palms but</li>
            <li> Never feels greasy and mixes well with other hair products.</li>
            <li> In other words, nightmare hair.</li>
            <li> I always like to read other customers&#x27; reviews before I buy something, so want to return the favor.</li>
            <li> My hair also never glistened as other reviewers have reported theirs did.</li>
            <li> The other thing is the smell of this product, which to me smells of strawberry yogurt.</li>
            <li> Where we live the humidity is my hairs worse enemy.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I would not recommend this product, especially if your face is sensitive or prone to allergic breakouts.</li>
            <li> My hair usually looks like a big lions mane due to the humidity and heat here!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m very annoyed that I even spent so much money on this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost as if there was a tiny amount of the real stuff in there then some other CRAP PRODUCT was mixed in, sealed and shipped to me.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I was a little worried purchasing online, I was afraid I might get a stale/older product since the price was so good, but I was completely wrong.</li>
            <li> My hair typically gets weighed down easily due to</li>
            <li> The only complaint I would have is the price if you buy at a salon.</li>
            <li> (I HATE flowery fragrances), definitely fruity, and not so overpoweringly sweet that I couldn&#x27;t stand it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a great fan of that, and cringe when I think about the glitter getting on my sensitive skin around my face an neck.</li>
            <li> I use it daily to help control frizz, as I have thin, dry hair.</li>
            <li> S Factor&#x27;s Smoothing Lusterizer defrizzes my hair and lasts aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaallll day without weighing it down or leaving it greasy.  </li>
            <li> I have to try and pat down my hair.</li>
            <li> After my hair dries, it looks smoothed down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found a product that does everything this does without weighing my hair down or making it oily looking.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know any other hair product that creates a response like that!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, I use less than a dime size of product and it doesn&#x27;t leave the hair slick, greasy, or weighed down.  </li>
            <li> You only need a very small amount.  </li>
            <li> I get it through amazon at half that cost.</li>
            <li> This is half the price I was paying.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t now what it does, but my hair is a mess without it.</li>
            <li> It adds a little bit of control, but does nothing to smooth/lusterize/de-frizz my hair...and, to boot, it makes my face break out every time I use it.  </li>
            <li> , I realized my hair was a little dingier than before and wondered why.</li>
            <li> Bleach my hair and it tends to get a little crispy, but with this and dumb blonde shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> Just need a little bit</li>
            <li> Within a few hours its like I didn&#x27;t put anything on it at all.</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts me about 3 months with everyday use.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> and it smelled , as another reviewer put it, like melons were thrown in the trash and rotting for a few days.</li>
            <li> Bummed to hear that a few reviewers are not getting what is being advertised.</li>
            <li> , my coworkers (who are not cheap with their compliments) noticed I had &amp;#34;done</li>
            <li> and this does not make it feel heavy at all.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this product on me a few weeks ago and I wanted to purchase it</li>
            <li> This is very thick and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My goal for purchasing this product was to to tame it somewhat.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m always looking for something that claims to tame and defrizz.</li>
            <li> I have thin, long hair.</li>
            <li> I have a LOT of thin, long hair.</li>
            <li> no matter how little I put on the ends alone!</li>
            <li> it also leaves a little sparkle in your hair!</li>
            <li> I checked the expiration date on the side and it was past the expiation date listed.</li>
            <li> Usually I just apply it to damp hair, scrunch and go.</li>
            <li> A small amount, the size of a pea, is all I need.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve order a lot of liquid items from Amazon and they usually always use shrink wrap to prevent this type of disaster.</li>
            <li> Shady to say the least.</li>
            <li> Products can go bad, cannot be guaranteed if not sold by a professional because of counterfeit products....</li>
            <li> One bottle lasts me at least a year.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy, wavy hair that is moderately thick.</li>
            <li> (my eldest &amp; I have thick hair, hers is wavy while mine is curly)</li>
            <li> no more frizz!</li>
            <li> Use this stuff just once and you&#x27;ll know what I mean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it in the past 35 years!  </li>
            <li> I try to go with something less expensive to save money I regret it.  </li>
            <li> My husband actually, seriously asked me to keep using it just because of the smell.</li>
            <li> a serious note</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s called Serious Conditioner?</li>
            <li> Finding a product that will straighten and de-frizz without weighing my hair down or making it look dirty has been a challenge.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick and curly hair with frizz just to complicate things.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not so great.  </li>
            <li> The bottle arrived with a broken hinge on the lid for one thing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle worker but it doesn&#x27;t make things worse and it won&#x27;t leave you hair feeling like it have something in it.  </li>
            <li> This was yet another disappointing waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, thin, wavy, curly, frizzy hair, so a product claiming to &amp;#34;defrizz&amp;#34; hair is my Achilles heal.</li>
            <li> I used this product probably 7-8 times after washing my hair, which means I gave this product a solid amount of use before deciding I hate it.</li>
            <li> At least for me!!</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally very thick, curly/wavy and FRIZZY!  </li>
            <li> and I hate products that wear off after just a few hours.  </li>
            <li> something is wrong.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this at my local salon for years and paying an outrageous price.</li>
            <li> But unfortunately it was not so.</li>
            <li> I was unable to find this at my beauty supply store anymore, so I panicked and thought Tigi might be discontinuing this product.  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad, but it&#x27;s also not great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed in any way.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED when u opened it</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in terms of lusterizing, but I did notice the insane amount of glitter on my hands after I applied the product.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The product is great.</li>
            <li> I really love this product and recommend it to anyone. It gives a nice shine to your hair and helps control the frizz.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample at my hair salon and fell in love. I only use it on summer days with high humidity, helps eliminate frizz and fly aways from the humid air. The bottle goes a long way as you only need to use about a dime amount when you use it. Does not leave hair greasy or oily. Would recommend for sure! Only product I&#x27;ve ever used that actually works as described.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I have long flowy hair, and this product treats it so well.  If I don&#x27;t treat my hair with anything it is very poofy and frizzy and I hate products that wear off after just a few hours.  S Factor&#x27;s Smoothing Lusterizer defrizzes my hair and lasts aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaallll day without weighing it down or leaving it greasy.  It also leaves my hair very soft and somewhat shiny so besides hairspray it&#x27;s the only product I use on my hair on an everyday basis.</li>
            <li> I use this with the chi straightening gurad when I get out of shower, I then blow dry my hair.  It makes it so soft and silky and Straight without the flat iron...</li>
            <li> After reading mostly positive reviews for this product, I had high hopes for it.  I have medium-length wavy/curly hair that I brush-straighten on a daily basis, so this sounded great!  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not so great.  It adds a little bit of control, but does nothing to smooth/lusterize/de-frizz my hair...and, to boot, it makes my face break out every time I use it.  The only reason I gave this two stars was because the fragrance is pleasant...not flowery (I HATE flowery fragrances), definitely fruity, and not so overpoweringly sweet that I couldn&#x27;t stand it.  Unfortunately, I would not recommend this product, especially if your face is sensitive or prone to allergic breakouts.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST HAIR SLEEK HAIR CREME EVER!!! IT TAKES OUT ALL OF THE FRIZZ AFTER FLAT IRONING, EVEN IN RAINY WEATHER.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair product.  It isn&#x27;t greasy, it defrizzes my curly hair very well, and I use it to either style my hair curly or blow dry it straight.  I especially love that it has a very subtle sparkle that adds shine to your hair.  The only reason I won&#x27;t be buying it more is because it contains parabens...a known carcinogen in many conventional hair products, shampoos, conditioners, and lotions.  I&#x27;m off to the natural stuff!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for thick, course hair like mine.</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair straight.  This product helps me accomplish that faster and easier than if I didn&#x27;t use it.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Not only does this stuff work amazingly to smooth out your hair, and keep your curls nice or your hair straight, but it smells amazing!  Love love love it!</li>
            <li> My Beautician had initially used this product in my hair, and i instantly fell in love with it! A little bit goes a long way...you will only need a pea size amount for each section. This is a great product that gives the hair a sheen, smells very good, and defrizzes!</li>
            <li> My 19 year old son and I love this product.  It was recommended to us by our hair stylist and we have been using it for over one year.  It is so simple to use. Apply to hair no rinsing.  Dry hair and frizz are gone.  Hair is manageable, smooth and sleek.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product hoping that it would help my frizziness and whatnot because my John Frieda Frizzez was not working for me. It smells great and I got it for a great cheap price. I remembered this product from last year when my hair dresser used this on my hair. I remembered it worked great then. I&#x27;ve used for only a couple of days now and to be honest I haven&#x27;t really seen much of a difference. I used it on dry hair the first day and then wet hair on the second day. Maybe my hair dresser had some kind of magic touch or maybe I&#x27;m not using this product correctly. It does work when I blow dry it into my hair but it doesn&#x27;t last long at all. Within a few hours its like I didn&#x27;t put anything on it at all. It does smell pretty good and its great that you only have to use just a little bit to go a long way but I just wished it worked better.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist at Toni &amp; Guy always uses this product and I don&#x27;t normally buy into hair products, nor do I like to put in several products in my hair but I found this product to be great! It does just that...lusterizes (it comes out extremely pearlescent and you&#x27;ll have sparkles on your palms but the shimmer is not visible in your hair so don&#x27;t worry, you won&#x27;t have disco ball hair). It defrizzes and tames any fly-aways and most of all, it smells divine!   My mother was curious and I let her use mine and since then she&#x27;s been a devoted user as well and I&#x27;d like to say we have been going strong for 3 years now!</li>
            <li> I have very curly, frizzy hair, and it has been a challenge for me to find products that reduce frizz while not making my hair feel \\&quot;crunchy.\\&quot; I put this in my hair after I air dry it a bit and the result is very smooth curls. I really like it and it smells delicious. I would recommend for anyone with dry or curly hair.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve found for keeping my naturally curly hair soft, frizz-free, and \\&quot;touchable.\\&quot;  I love hair products and always like to try new ones, but this one is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Have been using it for several years.  Best price I&#x27;ve found is on amazon--much cheaper than buying at the salon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about four years now, and my hair has never been the same. There is a noticeable difference for when I do use it and when I don&#x27;t. It makes my hair soft, touchable, manageable and shiny. Not to mention that the smell of it is amazing. This vendor got it to me very quickly, and I was 100% satisfied with their services.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any change in my frizzy hair and the smell is nice in the bottle but gross on my hair. It kind of smelled like rotten food after sitting on my hair all day.</li>
            <li> This stuff did exactly the opposite of what it said. My hair is wavy, and it just made it frizzy. I&#x27;ve never had any product make my hair so frizzy. I returned it.</li>
            <li> Really good product for dry, curly hair! Gives you a moisture and shine. I use it every day and I love it!!!</li>
            <li> i use it on my natural african american hair to blow dry i have my hair cut in a keri hilson bob and it helps it get straight and i believe stay straight for longer than it would if i didnt use itgo to the web site though you&#x27;ll get a kit for close to same price</li>
            <li> Love this product! Will purchase again! Better then other defrizzer&#x27;s &amp; tamers. The price is so much better then purchasing from a store.</li>
            <li> Incredible fragrance &amp; it definitely smoothed my hair &amp; left it silkier than any product I have ever used but I do have fine hair &amp; it also killed the body.</li>
            <li> A new product for me and I love it. Does exactly what it say it does and has such a great scent.</li>
            <li> Not a miracle, but for someone that has VERY curly hair, this product is fabulous when I straighten my hair. It helps control the fly-aways and somewhat tames the ends, but it also leaves a very shiny finish (almost glitter-like) on your hair.   I&#x27;ve received a lot of compliments when I&#x27;ve used it.   Makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried purchasing online, I was afraid I might get a stale/older product since the price was so good, but I was completely wrong. Product was the same as if I purchased at the salon. Will now buy on Amazon and save a ton of money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 8 months. It keeps my slightly frizzy hair smooth even in St . Louis humidity. It doesn&#x27;t flatten my hair like similar products. I still have volume in my shoulder length hair. This is a good product with a slight strawberry scent. I would recommend it. The bottle lasts me about 3 months with everyday use.</li>
            <li> I have baby-fine hair, but lots of it and it&#x27;s curly.  Finding a product that will straighten and de-frizz without weighing my hair down or making it look dirty has been a challenge.  This stuff really does the trick.  It also moisturizes, which is great.  I&#x27;m very pleased!!</li>
            <li> smells yummy, and it makes the hair soft and tamed, but do not use to much as it will cause a buildup</li>
            <li> I am one of many women who color and highlight their hair.  That has it&#x27;s pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s.  It makes my hair have more body but at the same time the highlights make it absorb more moisture and shall we say, frizz...  My sister told me about this product and how well it worked to control the frizz and make her hair so soft and lusterious.  I really do recomend  TIGI S Factor Smoothing Lusterizer and Defrizzer and Tamer, to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that can be frizzy since it is color treated. With the great reviews I decided to give this a try. Let me say I&#x27;m a hair care junkie and will and have tried so many products. I must say this one I really really like. It does seem to really de frizz and relax my hair more than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried. Not gooey and funky like some of the stuff I&#x27;ve used before. I think this will become a regular product for me. Give it a try!! Glad I did!</li>
            <li> I used to use Pureology products, which I still love, but I really liked the S factor smoothing product by TIGI. I like that there is a bit of shimmer in the product that makes your hair shiny. I notice that when I don&#x27;t use the product my hair gets a bit frizzy with the humidity. Also, my hair is easier to style if I start with this product.</li>
            <li> This product really works at keeping away the frizz.  i have been using it for quite awhile   and it smooths out my unruly hair and makes it manageable, shiny and straight.  i have  used so many other products but this one really does the trick...a little product goes a long  way.</li>
            <li> If you can buy a product cheaper than what a licensed cosmetologist can buy it for then something is wrong. Products can go bad, cannot be guaranteed if not sold by a professional because of counterfeit products....ect..this is supposed to be a high end product that works great. However, I don&#x27;t trust this. Shady to say the least.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t do my hair without this stuff. It&#x27;s magic. I don&#x27;t now what it does, but my hair is a mess without it. First discovered it when my hairdresser used it. Best price is on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This really works well for a non-salon treatment.  Smooths the frizzes and adds a bit of shine.  Just FYI, your hands will look glittery after you put it on, but your hair won&#x27;t.  Definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> This is an excellant product for long curly and hair with frize... Will continue to purchase best service</li>
            <li> The lady that cut my hair used S Factor Smoothing Lusterizer to style my hair and I had to buy it!     This stuff works great and smells awesome! My hair has never looked better. Since I have started using this I have received a lot of compliments about how good my hair looks.     I cannot believe that after all of these years of looking, I have FINALLY found something that controls the frizz in my hair.     Awesome product!</li>
            <li> This is just great &#x27;stuff&#x27;. My daughter has the most tangly hair and all she has to do is just wiggle her head and her hair is tangly. This stuff works great at combing out the tangles and keeping them out for the day. This is very thick and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to use in small quantities (read: dab) on the ends of your hair.  I especially focus on using it where I am going to flat-iron my hair - it makes it oh so easy to straighten your hair and leaves it feeling silky, soft, and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! My stylist used it on my hair and I loved how it helped tame my hair. Not only does it look good but it smells awesome. You don&#x27;t need alot. My hair is almost to the middle of my hair and tends to be \\&quot;fluffy\\&quot;. I use about a quarter size amount when wet. Blow dry, straighten, and then about a pea size to go over any extra flyaways. It makes my hair soft and not oily like other products. The only complaint I would have is the price if you buy at a salon.</li>
            <li> Use this product to control my frizzes.  Where we live the humidity is my hairs worse enemy.  Controls my curls!!</li>
            <li> I really like TIGI products in general - always great quality. This Smoothing Lusterizer is good, but not great. The bottle arrived with a broken hinge on the lid for one thing. But aside from that, I find it leaves my hair rather dry. I like the \\&quot;lusterizing\\&quot; sparkle it leaves in my hair, and it definitely smoothes out the frizz. But after about 7 hours, and especially in low-humidity conditions, I find that my hair starts to feel dry and somewhat frizzy. I&#x27;d recommend this for someone who lives in an all-year humid climate, but I don&#x27;t know that it is the best de-frizzer for dry winter weather.</li>
            <li> A former salon worker turned me on to this product eight years ago. Never feels greasy and mixes well with other hair products. Hope it&#x27;s not discontinued some day.</li>
            <li> I live in Singapore now &amp; have NEVER had a problem with frizz before I moved here, even though I&#x27;ve lived in several humid climates. Nothing else I tried seemed to work. This is truly a humidity killer. My hair fights humidity nearly all day. Great product, and all I have to use is the size of a pea.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Before I had long dry frizzy hair and than I started using this, If you want soft silky hair, this is the product. I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways and this stuff works. I have naturally curly hair and I like to use this ine the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I use it once a day and it smells very nice. I have tried many products and this one is the best.</li>
            <li> I have straight, normal (not fine or coarse). This product helps make my ends less frizzy and gives my hair a shiny and smooth look and feel. :) I usually use a little bit when my hair is damp, then blow dry.</li>
            <li> TIGI S factor is pure magic for your hair. It de-frizzes, but it also add a softness and shimmer that I&#x27;ve never seen before. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Use this product all the time.  It helps keep hair from having frizzies.  Will order it again.  That is all.</li>
            <li> Wife had used this before and asked me to get it for her.&lt;br /&gt;She has the thickest and greatest looking hair a lady could have and she raves about this product.&lt;br /&gt;And that doesn&#x27;t happen often...Great product!!</li>
            <li> I bought this with the Bed Head Recovery Shampoo/Conditioner set. I added the TIGI S Factor Smoothing product because of the great reviews. I wanted something to limit fly-aways and add softness and shine to my hair. I blow-dry and flat iron my hair daily.(I have straight to wavy hair that is dyed and 50% gray)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that when I washed with the Bed HEad shampoo and conditioner and did not use the TIGI S Factor Smoothing product, my hair looked and felt better to the touch than when I used it. It didn&#x27;t help with styling, frizz nor did it make my hair look healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo/conditioner alone work wonders- my hair looks and feels better than with any shampoo/conditioner combo I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers said this smelled great. I didn&#x27;t think so. I was okay- not OMG Amazing or anything like that. Again- the shampoo/conditioner smelled better by themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that&#x27;s my feedback- don&#x27;t waste your money. This stuff isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> Lovely hair product for my curly hair. Smells wnderful too!</li>
            <li> I have been using Smoothing Lusterizer for 3 years now...I use the Subscribe and Save and get it every 6 months.  I have very long hair and without it cannot get a comb through it after washing without this product!  For me to keep using the same product for this long it must be good!  I try and try to find something better or less expensive but cannot...this is a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> This came to me recommended by my hair stylist.  I have curly, frizzy hair that i regularly straighten.  Along with the S Factor deep conditioner, my hair is silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> Great product ,fast shipping and best of all great price! 1/2 the price of what a salon would charge. Will be ordering agsin</li>
            <li> Not only does this product work great, but it smells great too!! It has a great fruity smell.  You only need a little dab of the product and it really does the job.</li>
            <li> Product works as advertised.I use daily for my shoulder length hair. It leaves my hair sleek, in control and enhances the shine.</li>
            <li> I love this!!!  I often use a flat iron on my hair and it was drying it out.  TIGI S Factor keeps my hair feeling soft and no frizz.  And it smells wonderful so that&#x27;s a plus!</li>
            <li> I adore this product. The smell is intoxicating and the formula leaves my hair super soft. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this stuff!!! Not only does it smell better than any other product ever created, but it makes your hair so soft, so shiny and sooo awesome!! My stylist used to use this stuff on me over the winter because I has such a static problem with my hair. I ended up buying it on my own and fell in love. It smells and works great. You only need a little amount and it definitely helps with humidity, static, frizz, dryness and dullness. Get this product! Whenever I mention it to my girlfriends they moan with excitement! I don&#x27;t know any other hair product that creates a response like that! ;)</li>
            <li> This is a re-order of S Factor. I love it! Highly recommended if you need to tame your hair and make it soft.</li>
            <li> You can only guarantee you are buying authentic salon products from a salon! I knew this and still ordered this product via Amazom anyway. I&#x27;ve been using Smoothing Lustrizer for years and after using my Amazon purchased one, I realized my hair was a little dingier than before and wondered why. I checked the expiration date on the side and it was past the expiation date listed. I will not cheat on my hairdresser and buy online again!</li>
            <li> Love S factor products</li>
            <li> I use this on my three granddaughters hair after baths when they spend the night.  It Detangles and makes combing a lot easier.&lt;br /&gt;I also notice the difference the next day. Their hair stays soft and tangle free. I also purchased a extra bottle and sent one home&lt;br /&gt;With them. Mom also like it for her own hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve found for defriz and smoothing.  Bleach my hair and it tends to get a little crispy, but with this and dumb blonde shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve managed to return my hair to silky, smooth, shine.  Strongly recommend for my other platinum sisters out there!</li>
            <li> love these S Factor products. this by far is my all time fave! I use it when my hair is curly or straight. Adds lots of shine without that greasy feeling!</li>
            <li> Purchased this product after my LICENSED hairdresser used it on my Hair. I loved the LOOK, FEEL and SMELL and had to have it but didn&#x27;t want to pay the hefty salon price. Stoked when this came in the mail. VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED when u opened it and it smelled , as another reviewer put it, like melons were thrown in the trash and rotting for a few days. It&#x27;s almost as if there was a tiny amount of the real stuff in there then some other CRAP PRODUCT was mixed in, sealed and shipped to me.&lt;br /&gt;Will NEVER purchase from this seller again. Totally convinced this is NOT the right product disguised as such. Boooo</li>
            <li> I use this product regularly and it is fantastic for curly or frizzy hair control.</li>
            <li> This is a product I have been using for quite sometime.  I felt fortunate to find it at half the price on your website.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they changed the formula but it isn&#x27;t amazing like I recall it being. Have to use a lot to get a smooth affect all over but careful not to use too much otherwise your hair will feel/look greasy and dirty.</li>
            <li> The best for taming frizzy hair and I&#x27;ve tried many products.</li>
            <li> This product is great for taming unruly, frizzy hair and smells great too. I like to use it before I use gel for extra control.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this at my local salon for years and paying an outrageous price. So happy to see it on Amazon and at a reasonable price. I have been buying it from Amazon and it is the real deal. This is a magic smoothing lotion. OMG, it smells delicious and it leaves my thick hair feeling smooth and bouncy all day. My hair will keep for days when this is applied with a 450 styling brush when blow drying my hair!</li>
            <li> I have super static prone hair. This product got a lot of amazing reviews so I figured I would go for it!! It has a good smell but I was expecting something Godly since all of the comments here rave about it. It does not leave a greasy texture in my hair which is awesome!! I suppose it is possible it shortens my dry time by a minute or two. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t really help with the static. I believe that the $10 Frizz Eaze version of this is better. At least for me!! So I am going to stick with that.</li>
            <li> This is lovely stuff.  Keeps hair soft, and it has a bit of sparkle which really brightens up hair!!  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  It&#x27;s not a miracle worker but it doesn&#x27;t make things worse and it won&#x27;t leave you hair feeling like it have something in it.  I am super picky and the fact that I&#x27;ve been using this same product for the last 5 + years really says something.</li>
            <li> Just enough control without drying out your hair. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I have slightly wavy fine hair. When I first used this, I thought \\&quot;Meh, not that special.\\&quot; Sure my hair felt smooth, but nothing really stood out. But THEN, during one hectic week, I didn&#x27;t get a chance to use it at all...and boy did I see the difference. My hair was noticeably frizzier and tangly. So now I see what a difference TIGI does for your hair. The only thing is that it works best after you apply to wet hair and blow dry.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best stuff I have used for my hair.  There are few things that could tame my hair but this is definitely one of the best!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.  It is an excellent lusterizer/defrizzer/tamer.  I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed in any way.</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff for years and I still tell people about it. Can use on wet or dry hair, curly or straight. Smells great and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product. I have tried this product on wet and dry hair, I&#x27;ve tried a little and more than a little, but nothing I&#x27;ve tried seems to work. My hair looks exactly the same after I use the product as it did before I applied it. The smell isn&#x27;t bad, but it&#x27;s also not great. It&#x27;s different and not something you&#x27;ll say &#x27;oh that smells good&#x27;, just that you can tolerate it.  I have long, fine hair. I have a lot of hair, it&#x27;s just fine and is frizzy and this product has not helped with the frizz. From the reviews, it obviously works for some people, just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I have long straight hair and was looking for something to make my hair shiny and lustrous.  This product eliminates flyaways and smoothes the hair, but it doesn&#x27;t leave it looking lustrous.  A little goes a long way, I use less than a dime size of product and it doesn&#x27;t leave the hair slick, greasy, or weighed down.  It does have a mild fruity fragrance that is powerful when you first put it on but fades after that. I&#x27;m still looking for something better.</li>
            <li> This tamer works so pefectly on my hair - no more frizz! I love it and use it every day.</li>
            <li> Love how this product makes my hair feel so soft and silky :) Especially love the lower price from the Subscribe and save program!</li>
            <li> The product makes hair shiny, smooth, and easy to manage.  Will continue to order the product from now on.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Works great! You smell and look like you just the salon. Buy it! You will not regret it and it is easy to use on all different hair styles as well.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for three years now. I am 50 and color my hair so frizz is a problem. S Factor Lusterizer is a great detangler and gets rid of the frizz with out being too heavy. Great shine too!</li>
            <li> Fabulous. The only product that REALLY helps defrizz</li>
            <li> To buy this cream I mestioned the feed backs and reviews, but i dont know why it has 4 stars. My hair is kind of normail. It is not very curly and not smoothy, this produce was not what i was looking for at all. I used that before blow drying . It just makes my hair sticky . I did not like that.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida so this is a must for me. My hair usually looks like a big lions mane due to the humidity and heat here! So when I first used this product I was very pleased with the results I got. I just added it in my wet hair after applying a leave in conditioner and let my hair air dry . When my hair was fully dry I was surprised at how my hair looked, it actually was wavy with almost no frizz. I then went to an outdoor event with my family and this product held up extremely well considering it was 98 degrees outside with 90% humidity and my hair still looked frizz free.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that can keep my damaged permed hair from frizzing - but it is a little flat, I do sacrifice some volume.</li>
            <li> This can be a godsend for both my hair and my daughter&#x27;s. It can be a bit heavy for fine hair, though. We use it extremely sparingly if hair looks fried in the morning and only slightly more liberally for getting stubborn tangles/knots out.</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of products for straightening that this is the best.  I remember years ago when this came out I was the first person my stylist used this on and she and I have been using it ever since!  Everytime I try to go with something less expensive to save money I regret it.  You really get what you pay for with this product.  I recommend to friends all the time!</li>
            <li> This works excellent for a leave in conditioner. I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Takes out tangles in the finest hair yet doesn&#x27;t leave the hair sticky or greasy. Love this product and highly recommend it</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have ever used that truly smoothes my hair which is fine, wavy and unruly. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It makes my hair so soft and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Thank you for your top quality service!  I appreciate the low price and receiving my item in a quick amount of time!</li>
            <li> I decided to try out this product after checking out the reviews and wanting to try something different in my hair. This stuff is great in that it does leave your hair shiny and soft. Only downfall to that is that if you rub your hands through your hair.... yup your hands are shiny as well... lol    My hair is still frizzy and had fly aways once it dries. I have to try and pat down my hair. The second day my hair looks fine. I am in Afghanistan so I normally wash my hair every other day due to the crappy water out here. I apply it once i get out the shower and let it dry on its own. Not the best results the first day... but overall it is still a pretty good product. I will have to try using it when I get back home. I am unsure how it will react to humidity but I will give it another shot.   I am currently applying it with a leave in conditioner and it seems to work better.</li>
            <li> My salon was encouraging me to have a $350 Keratin hair treatment to smooth my frizzy hair, and when I decided not to get it ($350!?!?!?!?!) my stylist suggested S Factor.  She mixed it in her hand with a few pumps of Moroccan Oil and then thoroughly worked it through my wet hair with her fingers.  After I blow dried it myself, I looked GORGEOUS!!!!!!!!  Smooth, silky, shiny hair without a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My salon sells this exact bottle of S Factor for $31, I was psyched that I had my Amazon iPhone app and I scanned the bar code right there in the salon.  Another 10 bucks saved thanks to the Amazon app!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and REALLY helps to smooth my natural curly hair.  One bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mixed woman (black-german) with curly corkscrew hair that&#x27;s super fine (think corn silk) but frizzy. In other words, nightmare hair. I&#x27;m almost 50 years old and have tried hundreds of products over the past 35 years - everything from DevaCurl to Pantene - and nothing made me happy. Found a S Factor review on youtube and figured I&#x27;d give it a try, and I&#x27;m glad I did. It&#x27;s FABULOUS! When complete strangers tell you your curls are beautiful and ask what you use, you know you&#x27;ve got the right product. Finally! :)</li>
            <li> Per recommendation I have purchased this item, and for my somewhat fine hair it simply weighted it down too much. The good side is that it smells good (and a lot, so you better love the smell), and it leaves sparkles on your hair, which may be what you want, or NOT during the day :) But it does leave sparkles, not just a healthy-hair glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I imagine if your hair is thick, this would be good for you. My fine hair just wasn&#x27;t meant for this heavy product..no matter how little I put on the ends alone! For people like me, I&#x27;d recommend a shine serum from Wella, which is amazing! In fact, I&#x27;m buying another one right now(tiny bottle lasts me a year!).</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this, but in NYC summer humidity, it did nothing to tame my frizz and made my hair feel a bit straw-like.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I was looking for and at the same price (with shipping) that I would have paid at the store. The product itself is amazing and gives my hair a great shine and it dries so great feeling soft with a light sweet smell to it. Absolutely one of my favorite products! It came very quickly in the mail and I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> use about a quarter size dollop and run thru wet hair and then blow dry...will help smooth out slightly kinky hair (my hair has more grey in it now and appears slightly wiry while still being fly away hair even though it is colored.  Also helps with humid days....use more if hair is thick--leaves hair polished looking without weighing it down and keeps it from being fly-away frizzy</li>
            <li> I believe there are many products shipper and more efficiency than TIGI Factor, i have use it for more than 2 weeks daily but nothing changed !</li>
            <li> Love this product. I use it daily to help control frizz, as I have thin, dry hair.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful however, if I use too much it leaves my hair weighed down; I&#x27;m still practicing with this one ;)</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this product on my hair and it is the best stuff. It helps stops the frizz that comes along with natural curly hair. I get this product on a subscription basis which is such an easy thing to do. I bought this from the hair salon and it cost 35.00 dollars. I get it through amazon at half that cost. Love this product. Hope you will too</li>
            <li> Well, this honey has a really good strawberry smell, but actually it didnt fix very much in the hair, and makes it a little heavy...</li>
            <li> I bought mine from GSM King (3rd party seller) and the product was manufactured 2 years, 11 months, and 2 weeks before I ordered it. TIGI says the product has a 3-year shelf life. It might take me a year or more to go through the product, so it will be well beyond its best-by date before I&#x27;m done. I&#x27;ll take my chances on this bottle, but don&#x27;t plan to buy from this seller again. My local ULTA has the same product for quite a bit more, but their bottle was manufactured within the past year. Just thought people should know that it&#x27;s hard to tell whether you&#x27;ll get a product with a useful shelf life when you buy this online, unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself, it&#x27;s great, but expensive.</li>
            <li> Used by my stylist &amp; fell in love.... It makes my hair so soft and mine is usually like straw! Must have for damaged/frizzy hair. Plus Amazon had the best price!</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff for a long time since my stylist first sold it to me. Bummed to hear that a few reviewers are not getting what is being advertised. The smell should be good, not like rotting fruit. It smells amazing. My husband actually, seriously asked me to keep using it just because of the smell. And nothing in the world has ever worked like this stuff at keeping my sorta-frizzy, sorta-curly-in-some-places-sorta-wavy-in-others hair in line. I&#x27;ve tried a ton of different products and this is by far the best, plus it is so versatile! I don&#x27;t need to have a different product for every style. Usually I just apply it to damp hair, scrunch and go. And all my curls come to a defined, shiny, point. The glistening sparkle that we all love is really just some glittery, shimmer stuff you can see on your hands when you apply it. That might be a tip to see if you are getting the real stuff. Anyway don&#x27;t pass this up if you have the opportunity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. I&#x27;ve tried other smoothing serums before but always come back to this because I love the results so much. I have longer colored hair that is naturally straight and full. I get compliments all the time about the healthy shine and smoothness of my hair, and I really have this product to thank. Of course I can only speak for my type of hair, but if someone posts a review and says it made their hair \\&quot;greasy\\&quot;, it means they used too much. My hair is halfway down my back and I use a dime-sized amount on my hair.</li>
            <li> This is some great product that actually does what it claims. I read all the reviews, and they were fact. The smell is amazingly different, as TIGI is well known for anyway, but it feels great on thick dry curly hair and have noticed a difference in the time sine I have been using it. Am a long time fan of Curls Rock as well, but this is another top product that does not disappoint!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years. I love \\&quot;product\\&quot; and have tried almost everything, but this is my number 1 all-time favorite. It never weighs my fine, wavy hair down, and the shine and softness are awesome. I live in fear that it will be discontinued someday!</li>
            <li> Worth the $ for the fragrance and the results. I love this product!</li>
            <li> Came as described.  This product is great and works just like it claims it does.  Is a little heavy on hair at first, but soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li> Very happy with product make a great difference in your hair</li>
            <li> I normally do not write reviews on products, but this product is very deserving. I always like to read other customers&#x27; reviews before I buy something, so want to return the favor. First of all, this product is awesome. I watched several YouTube videos reviewing this product and of course read the amazon ratings before purchasing. This was $33 at Ulta and I got it for around $17 on Amazon - nearly 50% off. I have frizzy, wavy hair that is moderately thick. While this didn&#x27;t do too much for the waves, it did control the frizz and that was the kicker for me. As other reviewers have noted, a little product goes a long way, so I expect this to last a pretty long time. As long as you don&#x27;t use too much, it will not weigh your hair down or make it look oily, etc. I use this product on towel-dried hair, so I&#x27;m not sure if it would be the same on completely dry hair. Overall, I highly recommend this product and will likely be stocking up as it has taken me a long time to find something this effective!</li>
            <li> Use this stuff just once and you&#x27;ll know what I mean. My hair is on the curly side and this potion gives me the kind of hair you see on models. When I don&#x27;t use it, I just look middle-aged.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. My hair isn&#x27;t very frizzy - it is straight and fine but it gets full of static in winter and this stuff works great!</li>
            <li> This really keeps the frizzies down! Really fine hair usually has a bunch of flyaways, this smoothes it down -- all without making you look like a greaseball!</li>
            <li> This product is excellant for keeping my curls from getting frizzy even though it is made to use when straightening hair. I have used it for both and you only need a very small amount when using for frizz and a little more when using a flat iron.  It also smells good. I would recommend it to anyone for these uses and I think it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair extremely smooth; even after blow drying it. I haven&#x27;t found a product that works better than this one for hair smoothing.</li>
            <li> Love the smell! Smells like strawberry yogurt or something. Don&#x27;t put too much or your hair will get too greasy. I use it together with TIGI&#x27;s hair rock amplifier - less frizz and added more bounce to my hair.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this product in the past and loved how it made my hair look and feel, so I was thrilled to see it on Amazon for a fraction of the cost that it is in the salon.  You only need a very small amount.  It is a wonderful product and helps smooth all the fly aways</li>
            <li> When this first came in the mail, I was so excited because I had all the good reviews of people saying it worked and smelled great. But unfortunately it was not so. I have tried it on both wet hair and dry hair, and it there was no visible difference at all. I even tried putting it on only half my head and asked people if they could tell the difference, they couldn&#x27;t. In addition...the smell is off-putting. The best way I can describe it is if you cut up some cantaloupe or honeydew, then threw the seeds and peel in the trash and let it sit for a day, that smell from the trash of the fruit going bad, is what this stuff smells like. Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love TIGI S Factor Heat Protectant, so thought I&#x27;d try the smoothing lusterizer/defrizzer/tamer.  It&#x27;s basically hype.  No difference in my frizzies whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I actually didn&#x27;t like this product that much. It didn&#x27;t do much to tame my frizz or keep my hair smooth and shiny. When you put it on, it leaves the microscopic glitters all over your fingers, which is kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> Good for dry hair. it also leaves a little sparkle in your hair!</li>
            <li> I have wavy, color treated hair that takes flight in humid weather. My goal for purchasing this product was to to tame it somewhat. It didn&#x27;t. My hair also never glistened as other reviewers have reported theirs did. This was yet another disappointing waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have thin, long hair. I have a LOT of thin, long hair. It has zero shine or luster. I have tried TONS of stuff. Really, I have. This stuff makes my hair feel thicker and softer! My obtuse 18 year old daughter kept wanting to pet the back of my head. So, if this stuff wants your teenager to spend time closer to you, it&#x27;s worth it:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a serious note, my coworkers (who are not cheap with their compliments) noticed I had &amp;#34;done something different.&amp;#34; They said my hair looked healthier after using. So, it works:)</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, thin, wavy, curly, frizzy hair, so a product claiming to &amp;#34;defrizz&amp;#34; hair is my Achilles heal. I used this product probably 7-8 times after washing my hair, which means I gave this product a solid amount of use before deciding I hate it. I didn&#x27;t notice any change to my hair. It did not defrizz my hair. The product smells very good in the bottle but a couple hours after applying it to my hair, I couldn&#x27;t smell it anymore - so that great smell goes away very, very fast. After touching my hair, my hands were a slightly shimmery. I do not recommend buying this product. Honestly, I&#x27;m very annoyed that I even spent so much money on this. You&#x27;re probably better off using lotion instead of this stuff.</li>
            <li> Not much to ssay. Love this product. I have used it for years. I will reorder this product again. :)</li>
            <li> While I love the smell of this product, I found that TIGI&#x27;s other defrizzer/smoothing conditioner product by Bedhead works better.</li>
            <li> It does what it says it does and helps ease frizz. It has tiny sparkles in it that make hair shiny. My daughters call it Princess Goo. It also helps keep tangles to a minimum in wet hair - which is awesome with squirmy, tender-headed princesses. I would recommend the Princess Goo to anyone!</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd time I have ordered this product and both times they came in on time with no problems.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and curly hair with frizz just to complicate things.  My hairdresser recommended this product and I have used it for several years.  A small amount, the size of a pea, is all I need.  Amazon has the best price I have found.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome lusterizer/defrizzer especially after a perm,&lt;br /&gt;and towards the end of the perm longitivity.  I have used it for about&lt;br /&gt;10 years so far.</li>
            <li> leaves hair silky and smooth.  Very pleased with this.  My hair was super soft after using. I would recommend this to anyone who needs the frizz out of their hair.</li>
            <li> My daughters and I were first introduced to this at our hair salon. Our hairdresser put it in after our hair wash &amp; the smell was incredible, like candy.&lt;br /&gt;It was a total sell when we were home &amp; my husband commented on how good we smelled when we walked thru the door. Then to actually see how it made our hair shiny &amp; frizz free (my eldest &amp; I have thick hair, hers is wavy while mine is curly) so fizziness &amp; dullness were the norm for us, we knew immediately we had to buy this product. It even tames the fizziness &amp; static issues my youngest has with her fine, pin straight hair (without weighing it down or making it limp  looking).&lt;br /&gt;I initially paid $27 for it at the salon &amp; if I hadn&#x27;t loved it so much I would not have paid that much for it. I was happy that it did last several months and that&#x27;s with three people using it, so it was worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say when I found this &amp;#34;hair savor&amp;#34; on Amazon &amp; so much cheaper PLUS free S&amp;H (Prime) I was on cloud 9!!&lt;br /&gt;Hope anyone thinking about trying this does buy it &amp; loves it too :)</li>
            <li> One of of my favorite hair products.  Works great</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it claims and smooths down hair. It has the consistency of most other smoothing products-- lotion consistency, holds its shape, is thicker than a serum, yet slippery when rubbed between the fingers. I run it through my ends when my hair is still damp. It helps to de-tangle and de-frizz. After my hair dries, it looks smoothed down. I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in terms of lusterizing, but I did notice the insane amount of glitter on my hands after I applied the product. I&#x27;m not a great fan of that, and cringe when I think about the glitter getting on my sensitive skin around my face an neck. The other thing is the smell of this product, which to me smells of strawberry yogurt. I would skip this next time around in favor of Jonathan Dirt or Phyto 7.</li>
            <li> My hair gets frizzy with the humidity.  This helps keep it smooth longer.  Good product.  Just need a little bit and it does not leave a sticky residue.</li>
            <li> Hair feels soft, smooth, and STRAIGHT!!!  Super product. My hair typically gets weighed down easily due to it&#x27;s baby fine texture and this does not make it feel heavy at all.</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for years. One bottle lasts me at least a year. A little goes a long way. Great smell!</li>
            <li> I have natural curly frizzy hair.  This product makes me look like a movie star!  (o.k., not really, but I do love the product!)</li>
            <li> I love how slky smooth it leaves my hair and also mu amd my.husband love the smell of the producy.</li>
            <li> i did not like the way this product looks on me, it makes my hair hard instead of smooth and doesn&#x27;t smell as good as its supposed to. i don&#x27;t know if its because of my hair or the product but i only used it a few times and now it is just sitting in my bathroom unused.</li>
            <li> My hair gets pretty frizzy and wild so I&#x27;m always looking for something that claims to tame and defrizz. I was not disappointed! Is product is great, I love the smell!! Smells like strawberries and cream! Yum :) Just a side note, there are tiny little specks of glitter in it, you mainly notice that your hands sparkle after use, but it&#x27;s not that noticeable and it actually looks really nice in the hair as it adds shine from where the light hits the glittery bits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a few if the other Tigi S Factor products, including their salon size shampoo and hair mask &amp;#60;-- I highly recommend the hair mask!! I think it&#x27;s called Serious Conditioner? But it is AMAZING!! I love this range and highly recommend it :)</li>
            <li> This is the best product, it has a sheen to it which illuminates the hair and gives it a shiny soft feel. I would recommend it to anyone, especially someone who has medium/long hair.</li>
            <li> When applied to wet hair the product tames frizzes well. Don&#x27;t use too much or a build up will surface quickly. Not so great on dry hair.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic for keeping hair smooth.</li>
            <li> Terrific product!  it really helps reduce the frizz makes hair shiny.  Salon price is almost double.  I would reccommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> It smells great, really works, and the bottle looks cool. My salon stopped carrying it for some reason so I had to look elsewhere for the lusterizer. This is half the price I was paying.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both love this product when applied to wet hair before combing after washing our hair.  It gives a wonderul shine and bounce.  We live in Florida which naturally is very humid especially during warm/hot months.  It does help with frizziness until the next shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;This product is on the Top 10 Hair Products Awards.</li>
            <li> I was unable to find this at my beauty supply store anymore, so I panicked and thought Tigi might be discontinuing this product.  I was so happy to find it here on Amazon, and for less than what I was paying before.  I am happy to report that this stuff is not discontinued.  It works miracles on my fine but thick naturally wavy hair.  After I am done drying my hair it is nice and straight and smooth instead of kinky.  Love this stuff and can&#x27;t imagine living without it.</li>
            <li> Overpriced and nothing special!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this product on me a few weeks ago and I wanted to purchase it but at a lower cost.  I always order a ton of items from Amazon and have been very pleased with prices and packaging.  The shipper did not use shrink wrap and the contents of the Lusterizer exploded inside the box.  It says I cannot return or exchange this item and therefore I don&#x27;t know how to contact the seller to get a replacement.  I will gladly send them the remaining contents in the same box, but not at my expense.  I&#x27;ve order a lot of liquid items from Amazon and they usually always use shrink wrap to prevent this type of disaster.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it.  Super slick Jessie J style hair now all the live long day.&lt;br /&gt;BTW this really is what Jessie J uses on her hair.</li>
            <li> I have hypothyroidism, so I have some split ends in my hair because it&#x27;s dry.  I love this stuff.  It smells great and really smoothes my hair.  I have to be careful not to put too much on though because my hair isn&#x27;t thick or course and if I put too much it looks greasy.  It has a golden shine to it in your hand but this does not show up after you dry it.  Makes my hair turn out smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> The best product for wave and curly hair I&#x27;ve tried it in the past 35 years!  It defines curls, tames fly aways and frizzy hair without being oily or heavy.  Higly recomended!</li>
            <li> I have fine, wavy, shoulder length hair that I either  blow dry straight  and smooth,  or  scrunch it dry into loose curls. This product works either way to keep my hair shiney and frizz free!  I put it on my hair while damp before styling but I can also reapply any time after it is dry to add extra shine and control.  I&#x27;ve never found a product that does everything this does without weighing my hair down or making it oily looking.  Have no &amp;#34;cons&amp;#34; about it!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome, I use it in my wet hair (short pixie-style cut) every morning after I shower.  It keeps the frizz at bay and holds a style while I blow-dry.  Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally very thick, curly/wavy and FRIZZY!  This product works great for hot, humid climates.  I have used it in both Dubai (Middle East) and Curacao (Caribbean) and it worked amazingly well.  I bought it for less than $20 on Amazon which is the cheapest I have found it so far.  A little goes a long way and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the real thing. You can only get the real thing in salons. Definitely didn&#x27;t work the same as the one that was used on me at Toni &amp; Guy</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair feeling smooth and tames your hair. I have try other products that have not work so good on my hair,  leaved it greasy and flat.</li>
            <li> The best for naturally curly hair! Keeps hair soft and smooth without weighing down the curl.</li>
