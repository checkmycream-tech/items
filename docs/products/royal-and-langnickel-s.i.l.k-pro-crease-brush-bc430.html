            <li> I&#x27;m going to see about other brushes by Royal and Langnickel.</li>

I give it only 4 stars because when mine arrived it would make a weird clicking sound like the brush was loose on the handle. One day I decided just to pull off the brush tip and pop it back one. Since doing that, it no longer makes that loose clicking noise.</li>

            <li> So far so good. I use this to blend my transition colors in my crease. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it but if I do I will definitely come back and edit this.</li>
