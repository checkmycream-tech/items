    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Since I am almost 68 years of age my hair had been thinning so this is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Best of all</li>
            <li>I like the product and Amazon was great!</li>
            <li>GREAT!</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>Nice to have something that works.</li>
            <li>I got it colored which gave it more body</li>
            <li>Of course, I asked my doctor if it was okay</li>
            <li>As a result of all this trauma, nutrional issues, medicines, and so forth, my mother&#x27;s hair thinned significantly on top and looked like straw all over.</li>
            <li>She is still on a lot of medicine for her illness, so her hair doesn&#x27;t grow as quickly as a healthy person, but I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>&amp; she looked at it &amp; said it would be fine to take.</li>
            <li>light that it is gone before you swallow</li>
            <li>If your hair is thinning significantly, pair this with Keranique, and you should see a difference in a week or two.</li>
            <li>I have started to see a bit of fullness in my hair; will wait until the box finishes and will order another to see more results; sill too early to tell, of course, but I think I will continue with it!</li>
            <li>I have been taking the pill for Hair Volume for 3 months now &amp; I do notice a distinct difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Today, she has hair on top where it was thinning, and her hair looks profoundly healthier.</li>
            <li>So far so good but will take a few more weeks to see the maximum results.  </li>
            <li>It has more volume and I am able to style the way I want and cover any thin spots easily.  </li>
            <li>It actually gives her hair more volume, just as it expresses on the package.  </li>
            <li>I take a vitamin same size but the coating is easy to swallow l wish that they would chancee their coating</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t falling out as much</li>
            <li>I really like this produce because I think it works for me.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be working very well.  </li>
            <li>I must say I&#x27;ve noticed a significant different in my hair, skin, and nails!</li>
            <li>It pretty much equals out as far as price.</li>
            <li>and I know because in the last few days I am getting lots of good compliments about my hair, even my husband noticed.</li>
            <li>I have just started this first box and just finished the first 15 tabs; now on to the 2nd card.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it a little more time to see if it does work as described.</li>
            <li>I have no side effects from taking the New Nordic Hair Volume.  </li>
            <li>and it really is more like my usual hair.  </li>

            <li> Present for my grandma</li>
            <li> This product I take with beauty-bursts, which you can buy here as well. I must say I&#x27;ve noticed a significant different in my hair, skin, and nails! I&#x27;ve always suffered from acne since a teenager, and well (despite my few breakouts-which everyone gets) I definitely can see a major improvement in my skin as well. I have finally found the answer. It lies in multivitamins!</li>
            <li> Wife says it works!  It actually gives her hair more volume, just as it expresses on the package.  Nice to have something that works.</li>
            <li> This product works, only one month and I know because in the last few days I am getting lots of good compliments about my hair, even my husband noticed.</li>
            <li> This was a terrible try on pills for my hair&lt;br /&gt;Impossible to swllow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so.  light that it is gone before you swallow I got one stuck in my throat which lasted about 45 mins I am afraid to take.  They were a big wastes of money.  I take a vitamin same size but the coating is easy to swallow l wish that they would chancee their coating</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to be working but I&#x27;m only on the second package. A little pricey for the amount of tablets in the package. I&#x27;ll give it a little more time to see if it does work as described.</li>
            <li> I have been taking the pill for Hair Volume for 3 months now &amp; I do notice a distinct difference in my hair.  It has more volume and I am able to style the way I want and cover any thin spots easily.  Since I am almost 68 years of age my hair had been thinning so this is wonderful.  I got it colored which gave it more body and it really is more like my usual hair.  Best of all I have no side effects from taking the New Nordic Hair Volume.  Of course, I asked my doctor if it was okay &amp; she looked at it &amp; said it would be fine to take.</li>
            <li> My mother was very sick in the hospital for nearly three months and had to have a feeding tube. As a result of all this trauma, nutrional issues, medicines, and so forth, my mother&#x27;s hair thinned significantly on top and looked like straw all over. She was mortified. She tried to let on like it didn&#x27;t matter, but it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did some research and paired this with Keranique, biotin, Vitamin B12 and a multivitamin. I figured we would approach the issue internally and externally. We started this in November.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, she has hair on top where it was thinning, and her hair looks profoundly healthier. She is still on a lot of medicine for her illness, so her hair doesn&#x27;t grow as quickly as a healthy person, but I would recommend this to anyone. Either buy this OR buy the biotin, multivitamin, and B12. It pretty much equals out as far as price. If your hair is thinning significantly, pair this with Keranique, and you should see a difference in a week or two.</li>
            <li> I like the product and Amazon was great!</li>
            <li> So far so good but will take a few more weeks to see the maximum results.  My hair isn&#x27;t falling out as much so something must be happening.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> dont know what to slay...cant tell if it is working b ut will take it away...here is hoping...and so on</li>
            <li> I really like this produce because I think it works for me.  I would recommend to anyone who has trouble with there hair and nails.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working very well.  Hair loss seems to be much less now.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference</li>
            <li> Nails grow yet still peel.</li>
            <li> I have just started this first box and just finished the first 15 tabs; now on to the 2nd card. I have started to see a bit of fullness in my hair; will wait until the box finishes and will order another to see more results; sill too early to tell, of course, but I think I will continue with it!</li>
            <li> I have tried Viviscal and it gave me headaches and caused me to have and ocular migrane, twice.  Hair Volume has brought my hair back without any side effects.  GREAT!</li>
