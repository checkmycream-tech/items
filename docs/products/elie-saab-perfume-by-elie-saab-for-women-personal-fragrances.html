            <li>Nice fragrance worth the money</li>
            <li>This perfume is definitely strong stuff.</li>
            <li>Wife love it soft sweet smell good price too.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>Not overpowering at all, and very distinct.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been this excited about a fragrance in years.  </li>
            <li>My husband said it smelled rich</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wearing it right now!</li>
            <li>I fell in love with it because of a magazine sample (which I know are unreliable) and I really wanted to try it.</li>
            <li>It is my new favorite</li>
            <li>the flowery smell accompanied with other soft smell make it perfect for all times and all season ,iam asthmatic and sensitive  for strong smells</li>
            <li>You have to take the time to apply it gently to your pulse points and maybe walk into a light mist of it.</li>
            <li>Smells great, as usual.</li>
            <li>A true classic.  </li>
            <li>This is such a warm, soft perfume.  </li>
            <li>If you do that and wait until it mellows into your skin, you might just like this as much as I do.</li>
            <li>The perfume is almost everything I expected, absolutely lovely.</li>
            <li>Came brand new wrapped in box!</li>
            <li>The only problem is that it does NOT last as long as a nice perfume should.</li>
            <li>Not only from me, but other people are always saying they love the scent of this stuff.</li>
            <li>Very feminine, but frankly all i smell is the patchouli some days... if you don&#x27;t like that scent, definitely don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li>It has that classy smell to it...</li>
            <li>Found it at Nordstroms, but Amazon offered it at nearly 1/2 the price.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper on amazon and same product.</li>
            <li>I wear any other type?!\\&quot;  HAHA</li>
            <li>It is fresh, yet has a pleasingly deep dry down.</li>
            <li>Little too much patchouli for me, gives me nightmare flashbacks of Berkeley, CA in my youth.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I had to buy it blindly because I couldn&#x27;t find it locally to try it.</li>
            <li> Not sure how/why,</li>

            <li> I wanna express my opinion toward the product. all things were done perfectly. the product was that which I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> Wonderful perfume. Smells great and the product is just as described.</li>

            <li> üëçüëçüëçhappy with my purchase</li>
            <li> Smells beautiful! Sold by Amazon and is 100% authentic.</li>
            <li> Simply splendid! Beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li> Counterfeit, fake product sold as 100% genuine.</li>
            <li> Wife love it soft sweet smell good price too.&lt;br /&gt;Does not overwear your senses.i would recommend to&lt;br /&gt;My friends anytime</li>
            <li> Fast delivery &amp; GREAT PRICE!!!!</li>
            <li> Not only from me, but other people are always saying they love the scent of this stuff. Not overpowering at all, and very distinct.</li>
            <li> I was wary when I read the previous reviews that this perfume was strong. I had to buy it blindly because I couldn&#x27;t find it locally to try it. I fell in love with it because of a magazine sample (which I know are unreliable) and I really wanted to try it. This perfume is definitely strong stuff. But if you know that, and you still like the smell of it, you can prepare for the strength. You cant just spray this on your wrists and chest before you run out the door. You have to take the time to apply it gently to your pulse points and maybe walk into a light mist of it. If you do that and wait until it mellows into your skin, you might just like this as much as I do.</li>
            <li> the flowery smell accompanied with other soft smell make it perfect for all times and all season ,iam asthmatic and sensitive  for strong smells but this one is not bothering me at all even if  it is not a light smell&lt;br /&gt;it last long through the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no perfume enthusiast but I love this perfume!  It has that classy smell to it...flowery/floral. Wish it was cheaper though...</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance!!  I had only smelled it from a sample in a magazine and was a bit afraid it would not be the same!  I am wearing it everyday and getting lots of compliments on it!!  My husband said it smelled rich and I said, \\&quot;Do I wear any other type?!\\&quot;  HAHA</li>
            <li> The perfume is almost everything I expected, absolutely lovely. Beautiful, even sophisticated. The only problem is that it does NOT last as long as a nice perfume should. Not sure how/why, but that&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> I love the scent. Always did.</li>
            <li> A true classic.  Very nice light scent.  Great designer bottle too.</li>
            <li> This is such a warm, soft perfume.  Found it at Nordstroms, but Amazon offered it at nearly 1/2 the price.  It is a very nice perfume.  Try a sample and then order from here. You will love it. Last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wearing it right now! A friend gave me this fragrance to try and I&#x27;ve loved it ever since. I get compliments on it all of the time. It&#x27;s very soft and sensual, perfect for day and evening.</li>
            <li> have also purchased from Saks. Much cheaper on amazon and same product. Smells great, as usual.</li>
            <li> Came brand new wrapped in box! Love this perfume!</li>
