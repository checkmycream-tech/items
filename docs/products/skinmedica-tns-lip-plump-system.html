    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I was recommended to me by a wonderful facialist</li>
            <li>not as perfect as excepted</li>
            <li>My lips look awesome...</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful for chapped lips.</li>
            <li>Absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>that I realized how great it was!\\</li>
            <li>It is great</li>
            <li>Arrived in good time and well packed.  </li>
            <li>you gotten a good look at the ingredients?&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re consistent in using it, people will begin to notice how great your lips look too!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing in my book.</li>
            <li>I asked her how she liked it, and she said it was \\&quot;ok.\\</li>
            <li>I wish it plumped more, but very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love the way this system plumps my lips.</li>
            <li>or they stopped working after so many applications.</li>
            <li>Both are so much better now.  </li>
            <li>I  felt the same way about Ceramide Plump Perfect.</li>
            <li>I cannot stress this enough - this is the best product for lips I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about 2 years now and love the way it makes my gloss look on my lips.</li>
            <li>I use many of the SkinMedica products to include Lytera, dermal repair, under eye treatment.</li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>best thing i&#x27;ve ever used on my lips, didn/t dry them out like some lip products.</li>
            <li>I bought this to help dryness and fine lines.</li>
            <li>Fills little lines in lips perfectly.</li>
            <li>I am fortunate to have fuller lips anyway.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much I continue to order it.</li>
            <li>Might start looking for something else more economical soon.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this product as Dr. Oz advertised it on his TV show.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>Also add that I did not see the full effect for about 3 weeks, but will now continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost like using this on a daily basis restores my lips to the beautiful condition of a young child&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T be the first on the block to buy something - wait for the reviews!  </li>
            <li>Not much in it for the price, sure glad I tried it at a discounted price.</li>
            <li>I am so surprised to see so many saying it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>You would do better to purchase Bare Escentuals Buxom Lips lip plumping gloss.  </li>
            <li>Prior to using this great lip plumping duo, my lips were constantly chapped and had been since I was in my teens.  </li>
            <li>( Pun, very much, intended )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended it to me when I started complaining about fine lines and losing my natural lip color.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time that I have encountered a problem ordering through&lt;br /&gt;Amazon.</li>
            <li>This product was supposed to work the first time it was used, or so I have been lead to believe.</li>
            <li>Over the couple of years that I&#x27;ve used it, it has definitely helped those lines but also my lips look more defined.  </li>
            <li>did nothing for me the first time I ordered it; so would not have ordered again,</li>
            <li>Great product, a little pricey, but better than the other plumpers i have tried.  </li>
            <li>Most products do not deliver but, to my surprise, my lips are back to their original size in a rather short period of time.</li>
            <li>do any of these &#x27;lip plumpers&#x27; really work anyway?  </li>
            <li>Every morning when I am applying my makeup, I put this product on, and by the time I am ready to apply my liner and lipstick</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 years now and it really works.  </li>
            <li>I would imagine that if you had a real desire to get cancer really really fast&lt;</li>
            <li>br /&gt;you could mainline this lip plump into your veins.&lt;br /&gt;For those who are not as much in a hurry...</li>
            <li>She said, \\&quot;I didn&#x27;t think it did much, but I used it like you said.  </li>
            <li>This product really does not do the job it states.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The little inexpensive Lip Inflation by Sally Hansen seemed to work much better at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>Live &amp; learn:</li>
            <li>the New Brilliance dermabrasion machine&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am 54 years old, and I only use the Lip Renewal portion of this product and it is still worth the money.  </li>
            <li>amazing results, although its difficult to use a lipstick right after application</li>
            <li>If I run out and don&#x27;t get a new supply quick my lips are back to dry and splitting.</li>
            <li>my lips are soft and moist.  </li>
            <li>I bought directly from Skin Medica (?)  </li>
            <li>As far as pluming your lips, no way.</li>
            <li>I actually have a few extra plumping tubes left, it is just the renewal that I love.</li>
            <li>I barely got 8 maybe 10 applications, which I think I&#x27;m being generous</li>
            <li>The TNS is clearly a cut above the others and relative to the price, it delivers the results.</li>
            <li>It certainly was not worth $50.00.</li>
            <li>I struggle with dry lips, it doesn&#x27;t matter what I do or how much water I drink, my lips are always dry.</li>

            <li> A complete and utter waste of money.</li>
            <li> They have gotten very skimpy and it is just not nice to do.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find any other lip conditioner that does the same thing as this product.</li>
            <li> and plump (A little too big actually!)</li>
            <li> Used as directed for 10 days and saw absolutely NO change.</li>
            <li> This was a TOTAL waste of $$ to me....  </li>
            <li> It only makes my lips  feel heavy and sticky.</li>
            <li> i have also noticed with other plumpers that i became immune to them</li>
            <li> Just put this on the shelf with all the other skin renewal products I got suckered into that</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was losing the outline of my lips due to aging.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty expensive for the amount of time , it lasts.</li>
            <li> so if you use one faster than the other you can replace just the one you need.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but for what you get it&#x27;s not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I would not order again, not even for a discounted price not worth it.</li>
            <li> but I am starting to notice that lately they are using less to fill it up .</li>
            <li> My lips are not full...</li>
            <li> (some peoples lips are so small that when they have their mouths closed (</li>
            <li> one is because the thick gloss stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li> What a sham and a huge disappointment!</li>
            <li> it is much less sticky and heavy than others I have used.    </li>
            <li> This product is moisturizing but a little sticky.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even work a little bit.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few limp plumpers ranging from the Drug Store brands, a custom line from a day spa to the TNS product.  </li>
            <li> I am a firm believer in taking care of all of ones self, to include your skin.</li>
            <li> not speaking)you see NO lip at all, mine are not that small.</li>
            <li> I usually purchase 3 sets at a time because I don&#x27;t want to run out.  </li>
            <li> There was no change,not the slightest difference in my lips, at least not visably.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to give a negative review, so please don&#x27;t go by my results.</li>
            <li> Did P.T. Barnum say \\&quot;There&#x27;s a sucker born every day.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> At $50 for this product, I was expecting to get at least 20-25 applications.  </li>
            <li> The problem that I have is that I use the plumper much faster than the renewal; thus I have a surplus collection of the renewal which is annoying.  </li>
            <li> And no more chapped lips as a bonus!</li>
            <li> Waste of money!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much less expensive.    </li>
            <li> It is expensive and all it did was darken my lipcolor very very slightly.  </li>
            <li> Apparently he&#x27;s just raking in the promo cash for hawking this crap....  </li>
            <li> I am really disappointed in not only the crappy product, but that someone of his stature would recommend this.  </li>
            <li> At my age, sticky looking glossy lips are not attractive, so I don&#x27;t bother with the plumper portion.  </li>
            <li> It does not give you surgery-looking-lips, but I hate that look and just wanted my lips back.</li>
            <li> It was expensive and I feel badly that I spent money on something that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It is totally worthless and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It has turned out to be a VERY expensive lip cream (it cost close to $60).  </li>
            <li> Very sorry that I cannot review this product as I never received it!  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work. It is totally worthless and a waste of money. It was shown on the Today show, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Arrived in good time and well packed.  I originally purchased this product as Dr. Oz advertised it on his TV show.  It does not work.  It has turned out to be a VERY expensive lip cream (it cost close to $60).  Snake oil.  Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Very sorry that I cannot review this product as I never received it!  I had a couple of communications with the supplier and assumed that she would fix the issue, which she did not.  This is the first time that I have encountered a problem ordering through&lt;br /&gt;Amazon.</li>
            <li> Did nothing.  Waste of money.  Used as directed for 10 days and saw absolutely NO change.</li>
            <li> I also saw this on Dr. Oz.  It is expensive and all it did was darken my lipcolor very very slightly.  I wasted my money.  I might try another brand do any of these &#x27;lip plumpers&#x27; really work anyway?  Next time I will read the reviews before buying.</li>
            <li> This product was supposed to work the first time it was used, or so I have been lead to believe. However, this did not happen. I gave it  longer time to work, and nothing happened. I was very disappointed with this product. I will not buy it again. It certainly was not worth $50.00. A complete and utter waste of money.</li>
            <li> I love the way this system plumps my lips. the effect lasts almost all day, especially if you use them at night and then in the morning.  It looks natural, not overly plumped, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips like all of the other lip plumpers.  It also doesn&#x27;t sting! Great product, a little pricey, but better than the other plumpers i have tried.  i have also noticed with other plumpers that i became immune to them or they stopped working after so many applications. I don&#x27;t know why that is, but this lip plump system keeps plumping my lips day after day.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my take on this product.  I DO NOT WATCH DR. OZ but purchased my initial SkinMedica products from my dermatologist.  I am 54 years old, and I only use the Lip Renewal portion of this product and it is still worth the money.  Every morning when I am applying my makeup, I put this product on, and by the time I am ready to apply my liner and lipstick my lips are soft and moist.  At my age, sticky looking glossy lips are not attractive, so I don&#x27;t bother with the plumper portion.  I am fortunate to have fuller lips anyway.  Still, I wish they sold just the Renewal tube.  I can&#x27;t find any other lip conditioner that does the same thing as this product.</li>
            <li> Saw this product on Dr. Oz show, and so trusted his endorsement.  Just put this on the shelf with all the other skin renewal products I got suckered into that dont work!  Does nothing.</li>
            <li> No plumping.  No tingling.  Just sticky lips.  This was a TOTAL waste of $$ to me....  Saw this on Dr. Oz and thought he would be a reliable source backing products &#x27;endorsed&#x27; on his show.  At the time I ordered, I didn&#x27;t find any reviews.  Apparently he&#x27;s just raking in the promo cash for hawking this crap....  I am really disappointed in not only the crappy product, but that someone of his stature would recommend this.  Shame on him.  Live &amp; learn: DON&#x27;T be the first on the block to buy something - wait for the reviews!  LOL</li>
            <li> Could not see any improvement with wrinkles around the lips nor did the product \\&quot;plump\\&quot; the lips in anyway.  Also, with shipping &amp; handling the cost was $45.00 and did not last long at all.</li>
            <li> There was no change,not the slightest difference in my lips, at least not visably. It was expensive and I feel badly that I spent money on something that doesn&#x27;t work. It may possibly work on those that already have fuller lips. I don&#x27;t like to give a negative review, so please don&#x27;t go by my results. My lips are not full...I do have lips (some peoples lips are so small that when they have their mouths closed (not speaking)you see NO lip at all, mine are not that small.</li>
            <li> When my lips were done the doctors office gave the kit to me. I liked it so much I continue to order it. It does work and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. It works.</li>
            <li> I used this product for two weeks before I threw it in the trash.  This product did not provide one benefit.</li>
            <li> I only use the lip moisturizer tube of this.  I was recommended to me by a wonderful facialist and she said to apply in all the way up into the lip lines above your lips.  I don&#x27;t use the lip plumber tube at all.  I wanted it for the lip lines.  Over the couple of years that I&#x27;ve used it, it has definitely helped those lines but also my lips look more defined.  I&#x27;m 68 and I receive compliments on my lips, so I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> not as perfect as excepted</li>
            <li> I have been putting this on daily. It only makes my lips  feel heavy and sticky. No change in appearance has been seen  by myself or anyone I have come in contact with. Will continue  to use daily until it runs out but will not re-order.</li>
            <li> If you want truly plumper lips, get surgery. I bought this to help dryness and fine lines. It restored the color and smoothness. I wish it plumped more, but very satisfied. Also add that I did not see the full effect for about 3 weeks, but will now continue to use it.  And i don&#x27;t have to keep reapplying like regular balms and glosses.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but for what you get it&#x27;s not worth the price. I barely got 8 maybe 10 applications, which I think I&#x27;m being generous and I only used at night. I would not order again, not even for a discounted price not worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought directly from Skin Medica (?)  You would do better to purchase Bare Escentuals Buxom Lips lip plumping gloss.  It&#x27;s much less expensive.    Did P.T. Barnum say \\&quot;There&#x27;s a sucker born every day.\\&quot;  He must have been looking into the future for women buying snake oil.  I saw this on Dr. Oz.  Shame on you Dr. Oz for allowing those vipers on your show.    What a sham and a huge disappointment!</li>
            <li> Not much in it for the price, sure glad I tried it at a discounted price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 years now and it really works.  My dermatologist recommended it to me when I started complaining about fine lines and losing my natural lip color.  Both are so much better now.  I have noticed that my lip color lessens when I don&#x27;t use it on a regular basis.  I won&#x27;t stop using it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was losing the outline of my lips due to aging.  Most products do not deliver but, to my surprise, my lips are back to their original size in a rather short period of time. It does not give you surgery-looking-lips, but I hate that look and just wanted my lips back.</li>
            <li> I am so surprised to see so many saying it didn&#x27;t work. Not only did it enhance color...and plump (A little too big actually!) it is much less sticky and heavy than others I have used.    My lips look awesome...even when I don&#x27;t have the plumper on!</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few limp plumpers ranging from the Drug Store brands, a custom line from a day spa to the TNS product.  The TNS is clearly a cut above the others and relative to the price, it delivers the results.</li>
            <li> This product is moisturizing but a little sticky. I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference in how my lips looked visually. I  felt the same way about Ceramide Plump Perfect. The little inexpensive Lip Inflation by Sally Hansen seemed to work much better at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I would imagine that if you had a real desire to get cancer really really fast&lt;br /&gt;you could mainline this lip plump into your veins.&lt;br /&gt;For those who are not as much in a hurry... just put this on your lips everyday.&lt;br /&gt;Have you gotten a good look at the ingredients?&lt;br /&gt;You literally would have to be DYING to have plumper lips, to use this product&lt;br /&gt;( Pun, very much, intended )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less harmful, would be to put some peppermint oil, or cinnamon oil  on your lips.&lt;br /&gt;Or get one of those sucking machines like Cynthia Rowland&#x27;s Lip Plumper,&lt;br /&gt;or the New Brilliance dermabrasion machine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DR OZ - SHAME ON YOU !!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the TNS Lip Plumper two times, and both times I did not over do it.. I put it on in the am and again at night.  At $50 for this product, I was expecting to get at least 20-25 applications.  Instead I think it ran out around 8..  Won&#x27;t be wasting my money on this product again!</li>
            <li> I struggle with dry lips, it doesn&#x27;t matter what I do or how much water I drink, my lips are always dry. I didn&#x27;t buy this system for the plumping aspect. I actually have a few extra plumping tubes left, it is just the renewal that I love. I wish I could buy the renewal alone. It is the only thing that keeps my lips hydrated. I have used a number of things even resorting to Neosporin on my lips and this is the only thing that works. If I run out and don&#x27;t get a new supply quick my lips are back to dry and splitting. This stuff is amazing in my book.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 4 years now.  I usually purchase 3 sets at a time because I don&#x27;t want to run out.  Prior to using this great lip plumping duo, my lips were constantly chapped and had been since I was in my teens.  I&#x27;m 55 at this time.  Now, not only are my lips not chapped, they are plumper, smoother, and darker.  It&#x27;s almost like using this on a daily basis restores my lips to the beautiful condition of a young child&#x27;s.  My friends are always asking if I&#x27;ve had something \\&quot;done\\&quot; to my lips.  I tell them no, and then tell them about this product.  I gave my mom the lip plumper duo for Christmas.  I asked her how she liked it, and she said it was \\&quot;ok.\\&quot;  One day she called me and asked me where she could buy some because she had run out.  She said, \\&quot;I didn&#x27;t think it did much, but I used it like you said.  It wasn&#x27;t until I was out and my lips started looking wrinkly that I realized how great it was!\\&quot;  She now uses it all the time, and has her friends asking if she had something \\&quot;done\\&quot; to her lips too!  I cannot stress this enough - this is the best product for lips I have ever used!  But you must use it regularly.  The result is gradual, not instantaneous.  But if you&#x27;re consistent in using it, people will begin to notice how great your lips look too!  And no more chapped lips as a bonus!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is great but I am starting to notice that lately they are using less to fill it up . It is pretty expensive for the amount of time , it lasts. Might start looking for something else more economical soon. They have gotten very skimpy and it is just not nice to do.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful for chapped lips. I have been using it for about 2 years now and love the way it makes my gloss look on my lips. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The only reason this gets 2 stars instead of one is because the thick gloss stays on for a long time. As far as pluming your lips, no way. Doesn&#x27;t even work a little bit. Waste of money!!</li>
            <li> Double shipped me and had to return one at my expense.  did nothing for me the first time I ordered it; so would not have ordered again,</li>
            <li> This product really does not do the job it states.&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy this again and in fact, stopped using it&lt;br /&gt;due to no results.</li>
            <li> it was expensive but if it were easier to get i would buy it more often. best thing i&#x27;ve ever used on my lips, didn/t dry them out like some lip products. wish i could buy it at the store.</li>
            <li> I use many of the SkinMedica products to include Lytera, dermal repair, under eye treatment. I am a firm believer in taking care of all of ones self, to include your skin.</li>
            <li> Fills little lines in lips perfectly. Absolutely wonderful. I use this as a supplement to my moisturizer and always have it on hand.</li>
            <li> amazing results, although its difficult to use a lipstick right after application</li>
            <li> Love the product.  The problem that I have is that I use the plumper much faster than the renewal; thus I have a surplus collection of the renewal which is annoying.  I wish they would offer products separate so if you use one faster than the other you can replace just the one you need.</li>
