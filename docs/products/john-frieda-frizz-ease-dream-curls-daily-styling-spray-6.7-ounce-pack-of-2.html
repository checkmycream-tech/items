            <li>Best product for those of us with Curly Hair,  use the entire Curl line and you will have beautiful salon curls,  silky,  touchable hair.  </li>
            <li>This is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a &amp;#34;wild thing&amp;#34; kind of look, and I like it.</li>
            <li>I have had the hardest time finding a product that makes my curls look nice.</li>
            <li>It does nothing to make my hair any curlier and it can make my hair kind of crunchy.</li>
            <li>It is also very easy to use, just spray it</li>
            <li>This product sounded like it would be perfect: \\&quot;Restores definition, elasticity and bounce to natural curls.</li>
            <li>work nicely as a detangler, but did not enhance my curls or make my any better.  </li>
            <li>It smells great, but this product just isn&#x27;t worth buying.</li>
            <li>This is a great combo to try, and its not expensive at all.</li>
            <li>Love John Frieda products.</li>
            <li>Thank you :)</li>
            <li>I will not be using John Frieda again, all it did was make my type of hair More frizzy.</li>
            <li>I will be getting more of this when I run out.</li>
            <li>The definition could be better, but that just probably depends on how curly your hair actualyl is.</li>
            <li>I actually love this product but refuse to pay the price increase of $4.00.</li>
            <li>for some reason i haven&#x27;t been able to find this in stores</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It being alcohol free is a plus!</li>
            <li>I will buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li>I ended up dumping out most of the bottle.</li>
            <li>It tames curls in the most humid of weather and leaves hair touchable.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product for curly hair!</li>
            <li>Used alone or in addition to mousse, I find my hair looking much better than with mousse alone.</li>
            <li>I was wanting something with more shine.</li>
            <li>Frieda was at one time a famous, award winning hairdresser.  </li>
            <li>manufacturer states that this product will transform wilted waves and curls into sexy swerves, curves &amp; spirals, and that its alcohol-free formula will leave hair super-silky, never crispy.</li>
            <li>There are sections of my hair that are more wavy than others &amp; sections that tend to lose their wave easier.  </li>
            <li>I find I get much better coverage/control if I work it through my hair instead of spraying it on.  </li>
            <li>The heat of the blow dryer seems to make the argan oil &amp; Dream Curl coat my hair better.  </li>
            <li>I want even more curls, I use a diffuser on my blow dryer instead of just drying my roots.  </li>
            <li>okay...</li>
            <li>Works great for keeping your hair in good shape throughout the day and avoiding frizzing(as should be expected).</li>
            <li>Works great on my naturally frizzy curly hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter has natural curly hair and it works great on hers as well.</li>
            <li>It has made a good reputation for itself particularly in the areas of color  enhancement and frizz prevention</li>
            <li>I used this product on my ocean wave weave and this brought back all the beautiful curls after washing.</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair of fine to medium thickness and density and this spray brings my hair to manageable ringlets with NO frizz.</li>
            <li>may well look very pretty and last for up to a week, or even more, when I do my own hair, even with mousse or some kind of hair product, and leave it curly, it seldom lasts even overnight.  </li>
            <li>I do use it in conjunction with a light oil or spray laminate which also helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks more natural and feels nice too.  </li>
            <li>This product by far is the most effective one.</li>
            <li>It looked just ok when I was done, but 5 hours later (after sitting at a desk on an ideal mild, low-humidity day, my hair was very frizzy and stringy.  </li>
            <li>I had originally found it at Walmart.  </li>
            <li>I liked how light this was,  I kept scrunching as it was drying naturally and got wavy curls!:D</li>
            <li>Somewhere someone will get this item as I have two full bottles, as I will donate the item.</li>
            <li>hair is naturally curly with a tendency to frizz, so of course I&#x27;m always looking for products that will enhance my efforts in this line: frankly, am not as adept as I might be  in dealing with hair.  </li>
            <li>Have found, over the years, frustratingly enough that whereas a good hairdresser blowout that allows for my curls and waves  </li>
            <li>I buy this stuff in bulk, I love it so much.</li>
            <li>My hair is beautiful now,no more frizzy, my hair is curly and this Frizz-Ease Dream Curls, Curl Perfecting Spray, keep my hair without Frizz for whole day, this product is amazing, for curly hair or extra dry hair, I recommend it 100%!!!</li>
            <li>I like bold strings of curls defff not getting that with this product.</li>
            <li>It makes getting ready in the morning easy for her.</li>
            <li>They add that the product&#x27;s innovative magnesium enriched formula will penetrate your hair to restore elasticity and spring, boosting and enhancing your natural curl pattern.</li>
            <li>It will re-set the curls right without having to re-wash your hair.</li>
            <li>Frizz Ease Dream Curls gives me hair just the right amount of curl without the crunchy texture or frizz.  </li>
            <li>I have super straight hair.</li>
            <li>not heavy and sent is fine</li>
            <li>Frieda furthermore claims that this product&#x27;s breakthrough curl perfecter will work if you just  spray and scrunch your hair; that it will produce highly defined swirls and curls that are soft, sexy and silky.</li>
            <li>Finally they state that the product&#x27;s special conditioning and glossing agents, and its non-greasy and non-sticky formula, will help leave hair frizz free and glistening with healthy-looking shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but now I have to spray more the second day because the first day didn&#x27;t hold the curls well.</li>
            <li>This spray helps make the curls more defined and last longer.</li>
            <li>I tried to apply this in so many different ways.</li>
            <li>So, in my latest efforts to figure this problem out, have bought several John Frieda products, including this one.  </li>
            <li>&amp; then I put in a tiny drop of argan oil on top of that.  </li>
            <li>I keep the drier mostly on the low heat &amp; air flow setting.  </li>
            <li>Makes me able to comb my very curly hair without totally wetting it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that it works better for me if I let it build up - spray it on towel-dried hair thoroughly and scrunch, turn my head upside and blow dry while scrunching (</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly but the curls tend to lose shape quickly.</li>
            <li>I like to use this spray when I let my hair mostly air dry</li>
            <li>I use this everyday on my hair and love it!  </li>
            <li>It helps SO much with styling my hair.  </li>
            <li>but it makes my straight hair curly every day.</li>
            <li>I really REALLY hope it has not been discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair really cant do anything else</li>
            <li>really dont like that who ever pack my package</li>
            <li>Made my hair really crunchy, wasn&#x27;t a fan.</li>
            <li>I wouldve appreciated a lil&#x27; something, but it did nothing at all.</li>
            <li>so it wasn&#x27;t too much lost.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair much easier to comb through.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Then, I gently scrunch through my hair.  </li>
            <li>I bend over &amp; gently cup my hair in to the diffuser &amp; push the diffuser to my head.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife says that this product works really well to control her curly hair.</li>
            <li>thin hair will hair even MORE volume and there will be more curls.</li>
            <li>I like it better than using moose or other curl holders, as it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking like it has lots of product in it.  </li>
            <li>It leaves her hair looking beautiful and natural (not wet looking or hard).</li>
            <li>For the first time I can feel my hair&#x27;s natural texture to the touch, as if it is without any hair product on it.</li>
            <li>It gives my slightly wavy hair more curl power.</li>
            <li>I have a mix of curls, more curly here, less there</li>
            <li>and when I use this with the Frizz Ease mousse, I get a decent hold.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin, frizzy curls and this turns them into perfect spirals and tames down the volume and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li>These are a little better.</li>
            <li>Those sections get a little more of this product.  </li>
            <li>I do not put this on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;-I often spray a little more Dream Curl on to my palm &amp; put it in the parts of my hair that tend to uncurl</li>
            <li>you do NOT happen to have put texterizing powder in your hair, then the next day you can spray more of this spray onto your hair, really get it wet, and refresh it, scrunching again, taking a break while it&#x27;s still damp to put some silk product on it to take away any frizz from the scrunching...</li>
            <li>I like the leave in quality and being able to not have stiff hair.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair but use to straighten it every day because my curls weren&#x27;t very pretty, but decided to finally embrace my curls.</li>
            <li>I seriously live by this stuff.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work on my fine hair just weighs my hair down.</li>
            <li>I got styling spray with the dark blue top.  </li>
            <li>I spray my clean, slightly damp hair before bed.</li>
            <li>I am a frequent user of this product.  </li>
            <li>I take out my hair in the morning and there are soft ringlets every time.</li>
            <li>They are soft and look like I used a curling iron.</li>
            <li>have naturally curly hair, and I use it, after I have combed my hair out from the shower.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that tends to frizz</li>
            <li>Leaves hair touchably soft and shiny.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I am surprised that Amazon would do this.</li>
            <li>I went natural (no longer relaxed)</li>
            <li>I get lots of compliments and people can&#x27;t believe the curls are natural.</li>
            <li>Soft and defined, shiny curls.</li>
            <li>well  this product will not leave hair silky soft but it will do what is suppose to do</li>
            <li>Just as good as expensive brands, but you can buy at grocery store on on Amazon for alot cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So I was looking for a quick spray product to deal with the frizzy mess.</li>
            <li>If I have sections of my hair that are a little frizzy, I just use a tiny amount of argan oil to smooth them</li>

            <li>I compared my last bottle with this new one.</li>
            <li>He was inspired to found a self-named beauty products corporation that has become a major player in the hair products world.  </li>
            <li>have been using this product for a while now and have found that it does, indeed, create darling little curls when freshly done.  </li>
            <li>me.have been using this product for a while now and have found that it does, indeed, create darling little curls when freshly done.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes the grass does look greener when the marketing approach is so general, and you think they are talking about your hair.  </li>
            <li>I went back to my old favorites, and I am happier with my look.</li>
            <li>Minimal frizz and makes my curls really spiral.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s miraculous how quickly they perk back up after a little spritz.  </li>
            <li>I love this product to revive my curls whenever they get limp or matted down.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think this would work, but since it&#x27;s winter and its sooooo dry outside my hair is pin straight and flips out at the end, no waves no curl.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried far more expensive products with less consistent results.</li>
            <li>After the wash, while damp I use the Extra Strength 6 Effects Serum,  let air dry,  then Spray the Dream Curls Daily Styling Spray,  work through hair and you are ready for the day.&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li>but it seemed to be more harsh &amp; dried out my hair.  </li>
            <li>but it seemed to be more harsh &amp; dried out my hair.  </li>
            <li>Much heavier than expected, made my curls flat</li>
            <li>But they last barely a day, and that&#x27;s without getting caught in the rain, or on a humid day, or doing anything vigorous and sweaty.  </li>

            <li>and so I went out and purchased this because I seen a lot of girls on other forums speak highly about it.</li>
            <li>if I let it dry naturally.  </li>
            <li>Really does well defining my curls since mine aren&#x27;t tight.</li>

            <li> manufacturer states that this product will transform wilted waves and curls into sexy swerves, curves &amp; spirals, and that its alcohol-free formula will leave hair super-silky, never crispy.</li>
            <li> There are sections of my hair that are more wavy than others &amp; sections that tend to lose their wave easier.  </li>
            <li> I find I get much better coverage/control if I work it through my hair instead of spraying it on.  </li>
            <li> The heat of the blow dryer seems to make the argan oil &amp; Dream Curl coat my hair better.  </li>
            <li> I want even more curls, I use a diffuser on my blow dryer instead of just drying my roots.  </li>
            <li> okay...</li>
            <li> Works great for keeping your hair in good shape throughout the day and avoiding frizzing(as should be expected).</li>
            <li> Works great on my naturally frizzy curly hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter has natural curly hair and it works great on hers as well.</li>
            <li> It has made a good reputation for itself particularly in the areas of color  enhancement and frizz prevention</li>
            <li> I used this product on my ocean wave weave and this brought back all the beautiful curls after washing.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair of fine to medium thickness and density and this spray brings my hair to manageable ringlets with NO frizz.</li>
            <li> may well look very pretty and last for up to a week, or even more, when I do my own hair, even with mousse or some kind of hair product, and leave it curly, it seldom lasts even overnight.  </li>
            <li> I do use it in conjunction with a light oil or spray laminate which also helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks more natural and feels nice too.  </li>
            <li> This product by far is the most effective one.</li>
            <li> It looked just ok when I was done, but 5 hours later (after sitting at a desk on an ideal mild, low-humidity day, my hair was very frizzy and stringy.  </li>
            <li> I had originally found it at Walmart.  </li>
            <li> I liked how light this was,  I kept scrunching as it was drying naturally and got wavy curls!:D</li>
            <li> Somewhere someone will get this item as I have two full bottles, as I will donate the item.</li>
            <li> hair is naturally curly with a tendency to frizz, so of course I&#x27;m always looking for products that will enhance my efforts in this line: frankly, am not as adept as I might be  in dealing with hair.  </li>
            <li> Have found, over the years, frustratingly enough that whereas a good hairdresser blowout that allows for my curls and waves  </li>
            <li> I buy this stuff in bulk, I love it so much.</li>
            <li> My hair is beautiful now,no more frizzy, my hair is curly and this Frizz-Ease Dream Curls, Curl Perfecting Spray, keep my hair without Frizz for whole day, this product is amazing, for curly hair or extra dry hair, I recommend it 100%!!!</li>
            <li> I like bold strings of curls defff not getting that with this product.</li>
            <li> It makes getting ready in the morning easy for her.</li>
            <li> They add that the product&#x27;s innovative magnesium enriched formula will penetrate your hair to restore elasticity and spring, boosting and enhancing your natural curl pattern.</li>
            <li> It will re-set the curls right without having to re-wash your hair.</li>
            <li> Frizz Ease Dream Curls gives me hair just the right amount of curl without the crunchy texture or frizz.  </li>
            <li> I have super straight hair.</li>
            <li> not heavy and sent is fine</li>
            <li> Frieda furthermore claims that this product&#x27;s breakthrough curl perfecter will work if you just  spray and scrunch your hair; that it will produce highly defined swirls and curls that are soft, sexy and silky.</li>
            <li> Finally they state that the product&#x27;s special conditioning and glossing agents, and its non-greasy and non-sticky formula, will help leave hair frizz free and glistening with healthy-looking shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but now I have to spray more the second day because the first day didn&#x27;t hold the curls well.</li>
            <li> This spray helps make the curls more defined and last longer.</li>
            <li> I tried to apply this in so many different ways.</li>
            <li> So, in my latest efforts to figure this problem out, have bought several John Frieda products, including this one.  </li>
            <li> &amp; then I put in a tiny drop of argan oil on top of that.  </li>
            <li> I keep the drier mostly on the low heat &amp; air flow setting.  </li>
            <li> Makes me able to comb my very curly hair without totally wetting it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that it works better for me if I let it build up - spray it on towel-dried hair thoroughly and scrunch, turn my head upside and blow dry while scrunching (</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly but the curls tend to lose shape quickly.</li>
            <li> I like to use this spray when I let my hair mostly air dry</li>
            <li> I use this everyday on my hair and love it!  </li>
            <li> It helps SO much with styling my hair.  </li>
            <li> but it makes my straight hair curly every day.</li>
            <li> I really REALLY hope it has not been discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair really cant do anything else</li>
            <li> really dont like that who ever pack my package</li>
            <li> Made my hair really crunchy, wasn&#x27;t a fan.</li>
            <li> I wouldve appreciated a lil&#x27; something, but it did nothing at all.</li>
            <li> so it wasn&#x27;t too much lost.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair much easier to comb through.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Then, I gently scrunch through my hair.  </li>
            <li> I bend over &amp; gently cup my hair in to the diffuser &amp; push the diffuser to my head.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife says that this product works really well to control her curly hair.</li>
            <li> thin hair will hair even MORE volume and there will be more curls.</li>
            <li> I like it better than using moose or other curl holders, as it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking like it has lots of product in it.  </li>
            <li> It leaves her hair looking beautiful and natural (not wet looking or hard).</li>
            <li> For the first time I can feel my hair&#x27;s natural texture to the touch, as if it is without any hair product on it.</li>
            <li> It gives my slightly wavy hair more curl power.</li>
            <li> I have a mix of curls, more curly here, less there</li>
            <li> and when I use this with the Frizz Ease mousse, I get a decent hold.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin, frizzy curls and this turns them into perfect spirals and tames down the volume and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> These are a little better.</li>
            <li> Those sections get a little more of this product.  </li>
            <li> I do not put this on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;-I often spray a little more Dream Curl on to my palm &amp; put it in the parts of my hair that tend to uncurl</li>
            <li> you do NOT happen to have put texterizing powder in your hair, then the next day you can spray more of this spray onto your hair, really get it wet, and refresh it, scrunching again, taking a break while it&#x27;s still damp to put some silk product on it to take away any frizz from the scrunching...</li>
            <li> I like the leave in quality and being able to not have stiff hair.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair but use to straighten it every day because my curls weren&#x27;t very pretty, but decided to finally embrace my curls.</li>
            <li> I seriously live by this stuff.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on my fine hair just weighs my hair down.</li>
            <li> I got styling spray with the dark blue top.  </li>
            <li> I spray my clean, slightly damp hair before bed.</li>
            <li> I am a frequent user of this product.  </li>
            <li> I take out my hair in the morning and there are soft ringlets every time.</li>
            <li> They are soft and look like I used a curling iron.</li>
            <li> have naturally curly hair, and I use it, after I have combed my hair out from the shower.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that tends to frizz</li>
            <li> Leaves hair touchably soft and shiny.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I am surprised that Amazon would do this.</li>
            <li> I went natural (no longer relaxed)</li>
            <li> I get lots of compliments and people can&#x27;t believe the curls are natural.</li>
            <li> Soft and defined, shiny curls.</li>
            <li> well  this product will not leave hair silky soft but it will do what is suppose to do</li>
            <li> Just as good as expensive brands, but you can buy at grocery store on on Amazon for alot cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So I was looking for a quick spray product to deal with the frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> If I have sections of my hair that are a little frizzy, I just use a tiny amount of argan oil to smooth them</li>
            <li> If I have sections of my hair that are a little frizzy, I just use a tiny amount of argan oil to smooth them</li>
            <li> I compared my last bottle with this new one.</li>
            <li> He was inspired to found a self-named beauty products corporation that has become a major player in the hair products world.  </li>
            <li> have been using this product for a while now and have found that it does, indeed, create darling little curls when freshly done.  </li>
            <li> me.have been using this product for a while now and have found that it does, indeed, create darling little curls when freshly done.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes the grass does look greener when the marketing approach is so general, and you think they are talking about your hair.  </li>
            <li> I went back to my old favorites, and I am happier with my look.</li>
            <li> Minimal frizz and makes my curls really spiral.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s miraculous how quickly they perk back up after a little spritz.  </li>
            <li> I love this product to revive my curls whenever they get limp or matted down.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this would work, but since it&#x27;s winter and its sooooo dry outside my hair is pin straight and flips out at the end, no waves no curl.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried far more expensive products with less consistent results.</li>
            <li> After the wash, while damp I use the Extra Strength 6 Effects Serum,  let air dry,  then Spray the Dream Curls Daily Styling Spray,  work through hair and you are ready for the day.&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> but it seemed to be more harsh &amp; dried out my hair.  </li>
            <li> but it seemed to be more harsh &amp; dried out my hair.  </li>
            <li> Much heavier than expected, made my curls flat</li>
            <li> But they last barely a day, and that&#x27;s without getting caught in the rain, or on a humid day, or doing anything vigorous and sweaty.  </li>

            <li> and so I went out and purchased this because I seen a lot of girls on other forums speak highly about it.</li>
            <li> if I let it dry naturally.  </li>
            <li> Really does well defining my curls since mine aren&#x27;t tight.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have one), getting it pretty much dry and curly, and then about fifteen minutes later spraying it all over again and scrunching again, and scrunching as I blow dry with my head upside down.</li>
            <li> It works whether I blow dry my hair with a diffuser or let it dry naturally.</li>
            <li> Yesterday I went into an hour&#x27;s tough aerobic dancing class with adorable curls, and came out a frizzy mess.  </li>

            <li> or they will frizz &amp; go flat even with the product in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only do my hair a couple times of week since it&#x27;s dry, and this helps hold the curls.</li>
            <li> I have long, wavy/curly hair, pretty thick.</li>
            <li> Only thing is I have to be careful that products don&#x27;t dry out my already dry hair.</li>
            <li> I do not get my roots wet because I don&#x27;t want my roots to go flat.  </li>
            <li> I like this product because it contains does not contain any alcohol and doesn&#x27;t dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I spray it on,apply mousse and then let air dry.</li>
            <li> And letting it air dry is the trick.  </li>
            <li> , I blow dry my roots (bend over with head facing floor) &amp; slightly dry all my hair.  </li>
            <li> I do not comb my hair again until it is completely dry.  </li>
            <li> I do not comb my hair again until it is completely dry.  </li>

            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that will get my over-processed, bleached blonde hair to do something besides look dead and straw-like.</li>
            <li> If I need to comb my hair, I only use a wide tooth comb &amp; I&#x27;m careful not to stretch out the waves.  </li>

            <li> and I had no previous experience on how to tame it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the price to send it back.  </li>
            <li> I then diffuse dried it until it was barely damp.  </li>
            <li> Combined with a good reconstructor/moisturizer beforehand, this spray makes my brittle hair soft, and coaxs little spirals of curls so that soon my thin head of hair has turned into this glorious crazy mane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I go work with my hair wet, and it&#x27;s usually dry around 10am--</li>
            <li> I tried using it when my hair was wet, damp, and dry; nothing worked.</li>
            <li> Either with or without other products in my hair and still no action.</li>

            <li> Not sticky or hard and reduces frizz while looking natural.</li>
            <li> But last time could not and even had trouble finding it.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a miracle curl-making product; it works with what you have &amp; you have to treat your curls/waves carefully</li>
            <li> hair is still wet, I spray a generous amount of  the \\&quot;Dream Curl\\&quot; product in to my palm</li>

            <li> Best product for those of us with Curly Hair,  use the entire Curl line and you will have beautiful salon curls,  silky,  touchable hair.  No need for harsh styling products.&lt;br /&gt;I use the shampoo, conditioner. After the wash, while damp I use the Extra Strength 6 Effects Serum,  let air dry,  then Spray the Dream Curls Daily Styling Spray,  work through hair and you are ready for the day.&lt;br /&gt;Hair remains touchable, can run your hands through your hair without destroying the style.&lt;br /&gt;Have used these products for years and would  Not use anything else....</li>
            <li> This product is one I have used for several years.  It helps SO much with styling my hair.  I had originally found it at Walmart.  But last time could not and even had trouble finding it.  Being able to order this way was great.</li>
            <li> I am a frequent user of this product.  It seems to work fairly well with my curls and is non-sticky. Plus, l like the fact that it&#x27;s a spray and don&#x27;t have to dispense the product into my hands to use.</li>
            <li> This spray is my solution for no-heat curls everyday. I have super straight hair. I spray my clean, slightly damp hair before bed. I put it in a bun and spray about 15-20 times, then press the drops into the hair. The spray does go on wet, so if you use this method to curl, give yourself at least an hour for the spray to dry. Leaving the bun and spray in overnight helps set the curl longer. I take out my hair in the morning and there are soft ringlets every time. The curls last all day. They are soft and look like I used a curling iron. If the bun was not brushed enough before putting up, you can re-do it the next night by making the bun neater. Spray the bun with water, not the spray. It will re-set the curls right without having to re-wash your hair. This spray says it&#x27;s made for curly or wavy hair to tousle but it makes my straight hair curly every day. I just keep putting it into the same shaped bun every night to keep the shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: this a similar formula to their curl spray. They kept the ingredients similar with the same scent as the one they replaced. I compared my last bottle with this new one. My only complaint is that this formula by a different name seems to be diluted compared to the previous formula. I now have to use up to 30 sprays to get my no-heat curls to stay. The previous formula worked every time I did the no-heat curls but now I have to spray more the second day because the first day didn&#x27;t hold the curls well.</li>
            <li> Love John Frieda products. Amazon is the best place to get deals</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that will get my over-processed, bleached blonde hair to do something besides look dead and straw-like. Combined with a good reconstructor/moisturizer beforehand, this spray makes my brittle hair soft, and coaxs little spirals of curls so that soon my thin head of hair has turned into this glorious crazy mane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve found that it works better for me if I let it build up - spray it on towel-dried hair thoroughly and scrunch, turn my head upside and blow dry while scrunching (using a diffuser would be a good idea but I don&#x27;t have one), getting it pretty much dry and curly, and then about fifteen minutes later spraying it all over again and scrunching again, and scrunching as I blow dry with my head upside down.I don&#x27;t  I finish with a little texturizing powder at my roots which helps me direct the messy curls, put a little hair spray on, and sometimes a little of Freida&#x27;s Shine Spray (VERY little or it will look like you haven&#x27;t washed your hair in a decade).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh,sometimes, I put some Silk Drops or Biosilk on my hands and rub them together and through my towel-dried hair before I spray this on. That way, my hair isn&#x27;t trying to grab it all for the moisture. It seems like instead the silk stuff acts like primer does for foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had to order this from Amazon because I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in stores locally. I really REALLY hope it has not been discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do NOT happen to have put texterizing powder in your hair, then the next day you can spray more of this spray onto your hair, really get it wet, and refresh it, scrunching again, taking a break while it&#x27;s still damp to put some silk product on it to take away any frizz from the scrunching...thin hair will hair even MORE volume and there will be more curls. It&#x27;s a &amp;#34;wild thing&amp;#34; kind of look, and I like it. My hair really cant do anything else and I can&#x27;t afford extensions. So Amazon, PLEASE, keep carrying this! Thank you :)</li>
            <li> Much heavier than expected, made my curls flat</li>
            <li> I like this product because it contains does not contain any alcohol and doesn&#x27;t dry my hair. It gives my slightly wavy hair more curl power.</li>
            <li> If you have 4C type hair, do not use this.  Dries your hair out, takes the shine with it, and leaves it hard.  It is a pump spray.  I will not be using John Frieda again, all it did was make my type of hair More frizzy. I went back to my old favorites, and I am happier with my look. Sometimes the grass does look greener when the marketing approach is so general, and you think they are talking about your hair.  Frizzy and tight nappy are not the same.  Somewhere someone will get this item as I have two full bottles, as I will donate the item.</li>
            <li> Just as good as expensive brands, but you can buy at grocery store on on Amazon for alot cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally curly hair, and I use it, after I have combed my hair out from the shower. I spray it on,apply mousse and then let air dry. I also use John Frieda mousse.  Both products together give my curls a beautiful spiral look, without crunchiness or stickiness. And believe me I have tried over 50 products for curly hair. This is a great combo to try, and its not expensive at all. And letting it air dry is the trick.  The less you play with it, the curlier it will be.  I go work with my hair wet, and it&#x27;s usually dry around 10am--then I just shake out a little and it s great for the rest of the day. Don&#x27;t even try those transfuser-they just add frizz.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my curls at all</li>
            <li> This is great for permed hair.  It is a good product for getting a perm to stay curly without the frizzing that happens all to often.  I like it better than using moose or other curl holders, as it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking like it has lots of product in it.  It looks more natural and feels nice too.  Not sticky or stiff.  I will be getting more of this when I run out.</li>
            <li> This is the best curl product I&#x27;ve found. The definition could be better, but that just probably depends on how curly your hair actualyl is. It minimizes frizz and defines curl without that sticky, stiff feeling and look! Great value also on amazon.</li>
            <li> It keeps my curls curly and not frizzy. not heavy and sent is fine</li>
            <li> I have type 3A hair.  I followed the directions and applied it liberally throughout all the layers of my hair.  I then diffuse dried it until it was barely damp.  It looked just ok when I was done, but 5 hours later (after sitting at a desk on an ideal mild, low-humidity day, my hair was very frizzy and stringy.  I may as well have put nothing at all in my hair before I diffused it.  Also, I agree with other reviewers who say the bottle design is awful.  The bottle is horribly shaped for something you&#x27;re supposed to spray over and over and over..... and over again (to apply \\&quot;liberally\\&quot;).  My hand was cramping half-way through.  I wish I had my receipt because I would ask for my money back.  On to something else.</li>
            <li> I actually love this product but refuse to pay the price increase of $4.00. I will have to buy elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This worked PERFECTLY!! I have had the hardest time finding a product that makes my curls look nice. This is amazing. I have fine, thin, frizzy curls and this turns them into perfect spirals and tames down the volume and doesn&#x27;t dry it out. I would tell anyone and everyone to use this. Use it with a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to have it work best!</li>
            <li> Love it! Keeps frizz to a minimum and holds the curls.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that tends to frizz if I let it dry naturally.  Frizz Ease Dream Curls gives me hair just the right amount of curl without the crunchy texture or frizz.  Love it!</li>
            <li> i just recived my package at 1/16/2014 n it was open n leaking. . n  really dont like that who ever pack my package had no respect for me are my things</li>
            <li> for some reason i haven&#x27;t been able to find this in stores but i had used it before. so happy i found it again!</li>
            <li> My hair is beautiful now,no more frizzy, my hair is curly and this Frizz-Ease Dream Curls, Curl Perfecting Spray, keep my hair without Frizz for whole day, this product is amazing, for curly hair or extra dry hair, I recommend it 100%!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using dream curls for years in addition to a smoothing cream after i apply the spray. It works great! Really does well defining my curls since mine aren&#x27;t tight. Makes it a breeze doing my hair since I don&#x27;t like to spend a lot of time on styling!</li>
            <li> The spray apparatus was not working on both, so sent them back.&lt;br /&gt;They replaced them.  These are a little better.</li>
            <li> Made my hair really crunchy, wasn&#x27;t a fan.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My daughter has curly hair and I had no previous experience on how to tame it. With this I can just spritz it on her and the frizz is gone and her curls look gorgeous. It being alcohol free is a plus! I didn&#x27;t want to use anything that would be damaging on her hair. It leaves her hair looking beautiful and natural (not wet looking or hard). Don&#x27;t know what I would have done without it!</li>
            <li> Great deal for its price. I recommend it. It came very fast and perfect conditions. I will buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly but the curls tend to lose shape quickly. This spray helps make the curls more defined and last longer. It works whether I blow dry my hair with a diffuser or let it dry naturally.</li>
            <li> I have naturally thick wavy/curly hair and I usually use product to prevent frizz. This product sounded like it would be perfect: \\&quot;Restores definition, elasticity and bounce to natural curls. Leaves hair touchably soft and shiny.\\&quot; However, it did none of those things. I tried using it when my hair was wet, damp, and dry; nothing worked. It was like I was just spraying water on my hair. I ended up dumping out most of the bottle. Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Works great on my naturally frizzy curly hair. Makes the curls less frizzy. Saves time in the morning for me.</li>
            <li> After using both bottles on shoulder length medium curly hair, was not impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did not seem to make a difference whether I used it or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does work nicely as a detangler, but did not enhance my curls or make my any better.  Will pass on this one in the future.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy the product in Amazon, so the review is not about the transaction nor the seller; the review is about the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have &amp;#34;corkscrew&amp;#34; curls and What I look for on a curl product is to keep strings of curls together... Eliminate the frizz and don&#x27;t make them &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;, with this product my hair looks like a bunch of THIN wires.. Moisturized wires by the way... I like bold strings of curls defff not getting that with this product. It makes your hair look wet, soft to the touch but defff NOT for curls</li>
            <li> What is pictured here is not what I got  I got styling spray with the dark blue top.  It&#x27;s not worth the price to send it back.  I am surprised that Amazon would do this.</li>
            <li> It tames curls in the most humid of weather and leaves hair touchable.</li>
            <li> I tried to apply this in so many different ways. Either with or without other products in my hair and still no action. I went natural (no longer relaxed) about 2yrs ago and have curly, shoulder length hair. I&#x27;m getting really tired of buying very expensive products just to maintain my hair and deal with the frizz and so I went out and purchased this because I seen a lot of girls on other forums speak highly about it. Well it didn&#x27;t do anything for me at all, my cousin has wavy hair and I gave the rest of the bottle to her, and she as well said it didn&#x27;t do anything after the 3rd try. I wouldve appreciated a lil&#x27; something, but it did nothing at all. I guess I just have to continue looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to add: I bought my bottle at Target for $5 so it wasn&#x27;t too much lost.</li>
            <li> I used this product on my ocean wave weave and this brought back all the beautiful curls after washing. This product does not make your cursl hard or flake up. I definitely suggest this for curly hair. My daughter has natural curly hair and it works great on hers as well. This products revives the curls in no time.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair that is atrocious to deal with in the morning. So I was looking for a quick spray product to deal with the frizzy mess. And it does take care of that. It makes my hair much easier to comb through. Only thing is I have to be careful that products don&#x27;t dry out my already dry hair. I can&#x27;t say  I trust this spray 100percent not to do that. So I can&#x27;t use it every day, only when in a hurry.</li>
            <li> I have used different kinds of products or brands to help control my curls and add shine. This product by far is the most effective one. For the first time I can feel my hair&#x27;s natural texture to the touch, as if it is without any hair product on it. It is also very easy to use, just spray it and I can wear my perfume and don&#x27;t have to worry about the scent from the hair product may compromise the fragrance. Love it.</li>
            <li> My hair loves this product. I have naturally curly hair but use to straighten it every day because my curls weren&#x27;t very pretty, but decided to finally embrace my curls. I use this along with the dream curls shampoo and conditioner and my curls are wonderful. I get lots of compliments and people can&#x27;t believe the curls are natural. Definitely my favorite product!</li>
            <li> Fabulous product for curly hair! I use this almost daily and it is awesome! Not sticky or hard and reduces frizz while looking natural. One of the best products for curly hair out there!</li>
            <li> My daughter always puts this John Frienda Spray on her Christmas list because she feels like it does the best for her curls!!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Used alone or in addition to mousse, I find my hair looking much better than with mousse alone.</li>
            <li> Was a little sticky, but dried well. Not sure if I would buy again. I was wanting something with more shine. I should read in detail next time.</li>
            <li> John Frieda Frizz-Ease Dream Curls Curl Perfecting Spray is, of course, a product of the John Frieda Corporation.  Frieda was at one time a famous, award winning hairdresser.  He was inspired to found a self-named beauty products corporation that has become a major player in the hair products world.  It has made a good reputation for itself particularly in the areas of color  enhancement and frizz prevention products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is naturally curly with a tendency to frizz, so of course I&#x27;m always looking for products that will enhance my efforts in this line: frankly, am not as adept as I might be  in dealing with hair.  Have found, over the years, frustratingly enough that whereas a good hairdresser blowout that allows for my curls and waves  may well look very pretty and last for up to a week, or even more, when I do my own hair, even with mousse or some kind of hair product, and leave it curly, it seldom lasts even overnight.  And that&#x27;s now with the long overdue acquisition of silk pillowcases that do make my blowouts last forever.  So, in my latest efforts to figure this problem out, have bought several John Frieda products, including this one.  Used it as instructed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer states that this product will transform wilted waves and curls into sexy swerves, curves &amp; spirals, and that its alcohol-free formula will leave hair super-silky, never crispy. Frieda furthermore claims that this product&#x27;s breakthrough curl perfecter will work if you just  spray and scrunch your hair; that it will produce highly defined swirls and curls that are soft, sexy and silky. They add that the product&#x27;s innovative magnesium enriched formula will penetrate your hair to restore elasticity and spring, boosting and enhancing your natural curl pattern. Finally they state that the product&#x27;s special conditioning and glossing agents, and its non-greasy and non-sticky formula, will help leave hair frizz free and glistening with healthy-looking shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for a while now and have found that it does, indeed, create darling little curls when freshly done.  But they last barely a day, and that&#x27;s without getting caught in the rain, or on a humid day, or doing anything vigorous and sweaty.  Yesterday I went into an hour&#x27;s tough aerobic dancing class with adorable curls, and came out a frizzy mess.  I&#x27;m afraid this product doesn&#x27;t work, at least not for me.have been using this product for a while now and have found that it does, indeed, create darling little curls when freshly done.

            <li> I have shoulder length naturally wavy hair; not really curls but generous waves.  I like to use this spray when I let my hair mostly air dry &amp; I want extra waves &amp; lasting waves.  There are sections of my hair that are more wavy than others &amp; sections that tend to lose their wave easier.  Those sections get a little more of this product.  This isn&#x27;t a miracle curl-making product; it works with what you have &amp; you have to treat your curls/waves carefully or they will frizz &amp; go flat even with the product in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my technique:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Washed/Conditioned Hair, combed out.&lt;br /&gt;-While hair is still wet, I spray a generous amount of  the \\&quot;Dream Curl\\&quot; product in to my palm &amp; then I put in a tiny drop of argan oil on top of that.  I rub my palms together to mix it &amp; coat my palms.  I find I get much better coverage/control if I work it through my hair instead of spraying it on.  Spraying is also messy.&lt;br /&gt;-Then, I gently scrunch through my hair.  I do not put this on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;-I often spray a little more Dream Curl on to my palm &amp; put it in the parts of my hair that tend to uncurl easier.&lt;br /&gt;-Now, I blow dry my roots (bend over with head facing floor) &amp; slightly dry all my hair.  I keep the drier mostly on the low heat &amp; air flow setting.  Blowing my roots gives my hair lift/body.  The heat of the blow dryer seems to make the argan oil &amp; Dream Curl coat my hair better.  Using a diffuser will give you even better/more curls (if you have them to start with).&lt;br /&gt;-If I want even more curls, I use a diffuser on my blow dryer instead of just drying my roots.  I bend over &amp; gently cup my hair in to the diffuser &amp; push the diffuser to my head.&lt;br /&gt;-I comb out my hair with a wide tooth comb being careful not to stretch out my waves.&lt;br /&gt;-Then I put my hands under the faucet, get them a little wet &amp; scrunch through my hair to revitalize the curl/wave that may have blown out.  I do not get my roots wet because I don&#x27;t want my roots to go flat.  If I need to neaten up my hair, I carefully use a wide tooth comb.&lt;br /&gt;-My hair air dries.  I do not comb my hair again until it is completely dry.  If I need to comb my hair, I only use a wide tooth comb &amp; I&#x27;m careful not to stretch out the waves.  A hair brush will kill your waves/curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use this product, all I have to do is dampen my hair with my hands to bring back the waves.  Even the second day I can get away with just dampening my hair.  If I have sections of my hair that are a little frizzy, I just use a tiny amount of argan oil to smooth them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other another company&#x27;s \\&quot;curl\\&quot; product but it seemed to be more harsh &amp; dried out my hair.  This John Frieda does not seem to cause those problems for me. This product is not overly perfumed.  There is a slight citrusy scent but it goes away.  I do not like heavily scented hair products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the Argan Oil I use.  It&#x27;s not pure Argan Oil but it works!:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002PR2GLM One N&#x27; Only Argan Oil Treatment, 3.4 Ounce]]t.

            <li> Makes me able to comb my very curly hair without totally wetting it. I can dampen with a cloth or shower mist, spray and comb.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday on my hair and love it!  This is a great deal.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on my fine hair just weighs my hair down.</li>
            <li> Finally an anti frizz product that works. Thank you! I would recommend this for anyone with dry, frizzy hair, Works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this would work, but since it&#x27;s winter and its sooooo dry outside my hair is pin straight and flips out at the end, no waves no curl. In the summer, my hair actually has lots of waves and curls. I liked how light this was,  I kept scrunching as it was drying naturally and got wavy curls!:D</li>
            <li> This stuff works okay... It keeps the frizz down, but it&#x27;s definitely not perfect. It does nothing to make my hair any curlier and it can make my hair kind of crunchy. It smells great, but this product just isn&#x27;t worth buying. It doesn&#x27;t do what it says it does. Dream curls? Nope.</li>
            <li> Curly without being crunchy! Soft and defined, shiny curls. I buy this stuff in bulk, I love it so much. I have long, wavy/curly hair, pretty thick. I seriously live by this stuff.</li>
            <li> This works well to control frizz while having curls.  I like the leave in quality and being able to not have stiff hair.</li>
            <li> My wife says that this product works really well to control her curly hair. It makes getting ready in the morning easy for her.</li>
            <li> I use this on wet or damp hair. I have wavy hair of fine to medium thickness and density and this spray brings my hair to manageable ringlets with NO frizz. I do use it in conjunction with a light oil or spray laminate which also helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried far more expensive products with less consistent results. This is always in my beauty cabinet. Recommended!</li>
            <li> Works great for keeping your hair in good shape throughout the day and avoiding frizzing(as should be expected).</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the only products that actually helps my frizzy/thick/curly hair. I notice a big difference when I forget to put this in!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for curls</li>
            <li> Great for day 2 and 3 when you just need to refresh your curls if you&#x27;re not washing your hair! Not too crunchy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. Minimal frizz and makes my curls really spiral.</li>
            <li> Best product for curly hair. Doesn&#x27;t make it hard and gets rid of frizz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this four stars because despite it being the best curl spray I can find, I feel like there should be something better out there. I have a mix of curls, more curly here, less there and when I use this with the Frizz Ease mousse, I get a decent hold. I only do my hair a couple times of week since it&#x27;s dry, and this helps hold the curls. It works especially well for touch ups.</li>
            <li> I love this product to revive my curls whenever they get limp or matted down.  It&#x27;s miraculous how quickly they perk back up after a little spritz.  It&#x27;s a lifesaver for curly girls who prefer to shower at night!</li>
            <li> Good product it curls hair well  this product will not leave hair silky soft but it will do what is suppose to do</li>
