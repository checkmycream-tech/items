            <li>It does a good job balancing my combination skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very gentle exfoliant, and works perfectly for once or twice a day cleansing.</li>

            <li>My favorite cleanser ever!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing..</li>
            <li>Great cleanser with light exfoliation.</li>
            <li>In order to be effective in removing make-up etc.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s not an effective product -</li>
            <li>However, it does clean your face and will be great for a plane ride.</li>
            <li>some have said, the smell isn&#x27;t amazing, not awful, but just smells kind of like ...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this Bare Escentuals cleanser since it came out, &amp; I LOVE it!!!</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping that it would full fill the stated claims of \\&quot;Clinically proven to reveal brighter, smoother, younger-looking skin, reduced fine lines and wrinkles, and remarkably smaller-looking</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re looking for a light scrub, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Do not add more water than that.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My husband and I both love this product.  </li>
            <li>So now I have to remove the top in order to apply the product.</li>
            <li>The product is interesting..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s job. :)</li>
            <li>so I just sprinkled it across the palm of my hands WITHOUT adding any more water than was already on them, and rubbed them together to distribute the powder, and then washed my face/neck with it as if it were the my cleanser</li>
            <li>but I am using it, seems to be okay</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin glowing, I can use it as a mask, and I love it for make-up removal at night.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser.</li>
            <li>I have used it for many years</li>
            <li>Ok, I love this product.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s the best part though, if I wash my face at night, the next morning, the pimple is visibly reduced.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love, love this product</li>
            <li>It feels soo good, and the smell is nice and relaxing, like oats (smells like a less-delicious version of Lush&#x27;s Oatafix).  </li>
            <li>The ingredients are natural and great for the skin.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t even really exfoliate, but it does leave my face feeling good, like I just put oatmeal on it and washed it off.  </li>
            <li>The water-activated powder is so unique, and I love the feel of it.</li>
            <li>It is very mild ...</li>
            <li>This would be good for someone with normal skin.</li>
            <li>Good for normal, budget concerned women, not concerned about wrinkles yet.</li>
            <li>Like new technology and good quality...</li>
            <li>I enjoy the BM line of make up</li>
            <li>You must make sure that it&#x27;s fresh; it goes rancid.</li>
            <li>This is a light exfoliating powdery cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Unique design in that you squeeze out the powder and add water.  </li>
            <li>I was used to feeling the &#x27;scrub&#x27; as that first layer of cells was forcibly stripped off my skin--</li>
            <li>I try to spread it out first to get more even coverage.  </li>
            <li>and I felt comfortable using it while pregnant.</li>
            <li>In my experience, it leaves the face clean and cool.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried sooo many other cleansers, and none of them are as ideal for sensitive skin as this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried Bare Minerals skincare before, but bought this with the cell renewal serum and am loving the results.</li>
            <li>I had read the mixed reviews before purchasing, but am thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li>Good price and new, just like if I had bought it local.</li>
            <li>I have been using Bare Minerals makeup for years and love it, so I decided to try a cleanser.</li>
            <li>Although it doesn&#x27;t feel abrasive like many exfoliators, it definitely keeps my skin soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>I love Bare Minerals products, almost without exception.  </li>
            <li>will allow you to control the moisture and not add too much water too quickly which will lead to a watery nothing in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>It is very gentle cleansing without drying.</li>
            <li>Exfoliation is always a very, very tricky matter for me.</li>
            <li>This is a VERY gentle exfoliator, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>will do.&lt;br /&gt;Follow up by adding a very gentle dribble of water with a your finger.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>First time I ran across it was at a mall in Pheonix in 2005.  </li>
            <li>I would most likely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li>I first started using it, I didn&#x27;t think it was working either.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Wet your face first to prepare for the cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;Puff</li>
            <li>I like the regular cleanser with the pump way better.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day, and in the evening follow it up with Pure Transformation Night Treatment and my pores are smaller, skin smoother, and more even toned.  </li>
            <li>I looked for a good skin-care line, but even the gentle ones left me red.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that compares is Lush&#x27;s Angels on Bare Skin, but even that&#x27;s not quite as good because my skin doesn&#x27;t literally drink it up like</li>
            <li>as well as to exfoliate, it has to be placed on some sort of cloth-like surface, mixed with water into a light paste, and then applied to the face to be used as a scrub.  </li>
            <li>as has my whole family, I am 55 and</li>
            <li>I expected more from the reviews.</li>
            <li>My favorite part of this product is that it comes in a powder form that creates a paste when you get it wet with water.</li>
            <li>It has an &#x27;oatmeal&#x27; smell but that is not so much of a problem that it prevents me from using it.</li>
            <li>For that reason is doesn&#x27;t seem like it exfoliates as much as I want</li>
            <li>A lot of people don&#x27;t feel it exfoliate because they use to much water.  </li>
            <li>I know I sound like a sales lady, but this is the only product I have found that works for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I really like the way my skin feels after I have used this cleanser.</li>
            <li>and it goes fast plus with this one i also needed to buy an eye make up remover.</li>
            <li>and they work really well.</li>
            <li>My skin is very clear regardless of washing, but this works wonders for keeping it soft, clean, and touchable.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s actually really easy to use in the shower, because the top slides back and forth really tightly</li>
            <li>If you see my other reviews, you&#x27;ll see I have reviewed a lot more than just BE products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had really high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>I like to mix this paste with other facial cleansers or I use it as a mask on its own.</li>
            <li>decided that I had to use it, though, because it&#x27;s really not a bit cheap</li>
            <li>I have normal skin, maybe that&#x27;s my problem.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m thinking that the BE line isn&#x27;t made for normal skin</li>
            <li>The only problem you could be having is if you&#x27;re dispensing too much product in the first place.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried (and spent way too much money on) countless face cleansers, but my picky skin just seems to get irritated with most of them.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally call customer service, but if you spend $20 on a cleanser, you should try everything before you throw it away.  </li>
            <li>skincare line that I can definitely tell uses better quality ingredients, and moisturizes my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>QVC sells Pure Transformation Night Treatment and the wrinkle treatment for the same price of just the Pure Transformation Night Treatment ($60).  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin with roseacea.  </li>
            <li>You should definitely follow up with a moisturizer after using to keep the face extra soft and smooth - I recommend using Bare Escentuals Purely Nourishing moisturizer.</li>
            <li>this doesn&#x27;t feel that way, except for the first second or two between your hands before it melts into the water you&#x27;re using.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a lift top, it has a slat that slides forward or back, and there is a big hole you can see through to see that it is open.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried normal and sensitive skin products.  </li>
            <li>The cleanser sort of melts away (becomes less gritty) when you add more water.  </li>
            <li>I only use it every other day, or it will clean my skin too much</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a very different exfoliating action--you don&#x27;t feel any of the &#x27;scrub&#x27; against your skin that&#x27;s very apparent with most exfo-cleansers or with sponges, the Mia or other face cleaning brushes.</li>
            <li>Bare Minerals originally sold it as their only facial cleanser and eventually changed it to their exfoliating cleanser, I now use both products and mix it up through the week.</li>
            <li>old)before I get too old</li>
            <li>This cleanser lathers up so creamy and leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>my face is so soft now.</li>
            <li>It comes in a powder form, which stresses me out cause don&#x27;t want to keep it near water to get it</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive, but it also gets oily.....  </li>
            <li>I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had sensitive skin and this product has worked wonders for me.</li>
            <li>have problems with adult acne.  </li>
            <li>Works well with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>personally like to add a bit of gentle face cleanser to this one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This one is natural ...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never use anything else on my face but Bare!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Regular use keeps my skin fresh and blemish free without the harsh drying of other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to exfoliate, or I end up with those little bumps over time; but exfoliating has always caused a reaction, sometimes even a full on rash, depending on the product.</li>
            <li>It can get a little tricky to pour, so make sure your hands aren&#x27;t too wet when you&#x27;re holding it.  </li>
            <li>I gave it another week--and my pores looked even smaller, and my skin was less reactive; and the real proof was that when I went in for my monthly facial, my facialist asked me what I&#x27;d changed since I&#x27;d seen her last--because I didn&#x27;t need the product that&#x27;s been my &#x27;deep clean&#x27; for several years now, and there was no need for even one extraction.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I think as an exfoliator, it completely falls short.</li>
            <li>It never really felt like it was doing anything for my skin, and I also didn&#x27;t really care for the scent.    </li>
            <li>Could be better, could be worse.</li>
            <li>Kind of weird</li>
            <li>I often have a hard time getting rid of the dry skin (especially on either side of my nose) without irritating the rest of my face and this cleanser strikes the perfect balance.</li>
            <li>I was using this cleanser with the rich moisturizer for dry skin, and my dry areas were too dry with this routine.</li>
            <li>My skin is generally normal, with dry cheeks and forehead.</li>
            <li>a great as a face wash, though a little weird.</li>
            <li>I had a hugely difficult time at first, with how much water to put on my hands, how much to have on my face, did I need a washcloth or a sponge....</li>
            <li>If you like a rough exfoliator (like apricot scrub) skip this, but if you want something gentle enough to use every day, give it a try.</li>
            <li>Definitely not dry, and wouldn&#x27;t think oily.   </li>
            <li>I am so glad I got this free with a gift card because I hate this product.  </li>
            <li>I am a big fan of Bare Minerals, but I think this product falls short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing Bare Escentuals makeup for two years now, and finally decided to try their cleansing products.</li>
            <li>I have large pores and this cleanser seems to make them less noticeable.</li>
            <li>It feels very creamy, almost silky, sliding over your skin--except that after you rinse off, your face has an every so slightly squeaky feeling, it doesn&#x27;t even feel like you&#x27;ve done anything.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried Bare Minerals skincare before, but bought this with the cell renewal serum and am loving the results.</li>
            <li> I had read the mixed reviews before purchasing, but am thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li> Good price and new, just like if I had bought it local.</li>
            <li> I have been using Bare Minerals makeup for years and love it, so I decided to try a cleanser.</li>
            <li> Although it doesn&#x27;t feel abrasive like many exfoliators, it definitely keeps my skin soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> I love Bare Minerals products, almost without exception.  </li>
            <li> will allow you to control the moisture and not add too much water too quickly which will lead to a watery nothing in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> It is very gentle cleansing without drying.</li>
            <li> Exfoliation is always a very, very tricky matter for me.</li>
            <li> This is a VERY gentle exfoliator, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> will do.&lt;br /&gt;Follow up by adding a very gentle dribble of water with a your finger.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> First time I ran across it was at a mall in Pheonix in 2005.  </li>
            <li> I would most likely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I first started using it, I didn&#x27;t think it was working either.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Wet your face first to prepare for the cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;Puff</li>
            <li> I like the regular cleanser with the pump way better.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day, and in the evening follow it up with Pure Transformation Night Treatment and my pores are smaller, skin smoother, and more even toned.  </li>
            <li> I looked for a good skin-care line, but even the gentle ones left me red.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that compares is Lush&#x27;s Angels on Bare Skin, but even that&#x27;s not quite as good because my skin doesn&#x27;t literally drink it up like</li>
            <li> as well as to exfoliate, it has to be placed on some sort of cloth-like surface, mixed with water into a light paste, and then applied to the face to be used as a scrub.  </li>
            <li> as has my whole family, I am 55 and</li>
            <li> I expected more from the reviews.</li>
            <li> My favorite part of this product is that it comes in a powder form that creates a paste when you get it wet with water.</li>
            <li> It has an &#x27;oatmeal&#x27; smell but that is not so much of a problem that it prevents me from using it.</li>
            <li> For that reason is doesn&#x27;t seem like it exfoliates as much as I want</li>
            <li> A lot of people don&#x27;t feel it exfoliate because they use to much water.  </li>
            <li> I know I sound like a sales lady, but this is the only product I have found that works for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I really like the way my skin feels after I have used this cleanser.</li>
            <li> and it goes fast plus with this one i also needed to buy an eye make up remover.</li>
            <li> and they work really well.</li>
            <li> My skin is very clear regardless of washing, but this works wonders for keeping it soft, clean, and touchable.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s actually really easy to use in the shower, because the top slides back and forth really tightly</li>
            <li> If you see my other reviews, you&#x27;ll see I have reviewed a lot more than just BE products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> I like to mix this paste with other facial cleansers or I use it as a mask on its own.</li>
            <li> decided that I had to use it, though, because it&#x27;s really not a bit cheap</li>
            <li> I have normal skin, maybe that&#x27;s my problem.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m thinking that the BE line isn&#x27;t made for normal skin</li>
            <li> The only problem you could be having is if you&#x27;re dispensing too much product in the first place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried (and spent way too much money on) countless face cleansers, but my picky skin just seems to get irritated with most of them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally call customer service, but if you spend $20 on a cleanser, you should try everything before you throw it away.  </li>
            <li> skincare line that I can definitely tell uses better quality ingredients, and moisturizes my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> QVC sells Pure Transformation Night Treatment and the wrinkle treatment for the same price of just the Pure Transformation Night Treatment ($60).  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin with roseacea.  </li>
            <li> You should definitely follow up with a moisturizer after using to keep the face extra soft and smooth - I recommend using Bare Escentuals Purely Nourishing moisturizer.</li>
            <li> this doesn&#x27;t feel that way, except for the first second or two between your hands before it melts into the water you&#x27;re using.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a lift top, it has a slat that slides forward or back, and there is a big hole you can see through to see that it is open.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried normal and sensitive skin products.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser sort of melts away (becomes less gritty) when you add more water.  </li>
            <li> I only use it every other day, or it will clean my skin too much</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a very different exfoliating action--you don&#x27;t feel any of the &#x27;scrub&#x27; against your skin that&#x27;s very apparent with most exfo-cleansers or with sponges, the Mia or other face cleaning brushes.</li>
            <li> Bare Minerals originally sold it as their only facial cleanser and eventually changed it to their exfoliating cleanser, I now use both products and mix it up through the week.</li>
            <li> old)before I get too old</li>
            <li> This cleanser lathers up so creamy and leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> my face is so soft now.</li>
            <li> It comes in a powder form, which stresses me out cause don&#x27;t want to keep it near water to get it</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive, but it also gets oily.....  </li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had sensitive skin and this product has worked wonders for me.</li>
            <li> have problems with adult acne.  </li>
            <li> Works well with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> personally like to add a bit of gentle face cleanser to this one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This one is natural ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never use anything else on my face but Bare!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Regular use keeps my skin fresh and blemish free without the harsh drying of other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to exfoliate, or I end up with those little bumps over time; but exfoliating has always caused a reaction, sometimes even a full on rash, depending on the product.</li>
            <li> It can get a little tricky to pour, so make sure your hands aren&#x27;t too wet when you&#x27;re holding it.  </li>
            <li> I gave it another week--and my pores looked even smaller, and my skin was less reactive; and the real proof was that when I went in for my monthly facial, my facialist asked me what I&#x27;d changed since I&#x27;d seen her last--because I didn&#x27;t need the product that&#x27;s been my &#x27;deep clean&#x27; for several years now, and there was no need for even one extraction.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I think as an exfoliator, it completely falls short.</li>
            <li> It never really felt like it was doing anything for my skin, and I also didn&#x27;t really care for the scent.    </li>
            <li> Could be better, could be worse.</li>
            <li> Kind of weird</li>
            <li> I often have a hard time getting rid of the dry skin (especially on either side of my nose) without irritating the rest of my face and this cleanser strikes the perfect balance.</li>
            <li> I was using this cleanser with the rich moisturizer for dry skin, and my dry areas were too dry with this routine.</li>
            <li> My skin is generally normal, with dry cheeks and forehead.</li>
            <li> a great as a face wash, though a little weird.</li>
            <li> I had a hugely difficult time at first, with how much water to put on my hands, how much to have on my face, did I need a washcloth or a sponge....</li>
            <li> If you like a rough exfoliator (like apricot scrub) skip this, but if you want something gentle enough to use every day, give it a try.</li>
            <li> Definitely not dry, and wouldn&#x27;t think oily.   </li>
            <li> I am so glad I got this free with a gift card because I hate this product.  </li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Bare Minerals, but I think this product falls short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Bare Escentuals makeup for two years now, and finally decided to try their cleansing products.</li>
            <li> I have large pores and this cleanser seems to make them less noticeable.</li>
            <li> It feels very creamy, almost silky, sliding over your skin--except that after you rinse off, your face has an every so slightly squeaky feeling, it doesn&#x27;t even feel like you&#x27;ve done anything.  </li>
            <li> but at least it doesn&#x27;t work too hard and take off a top layer of skin.</li>
            <li> it is a powder that seems to dissolve almost instantly when put on a wet face.</li>
            <li> key is not using any additional water at all--wet face, wet hands, and that&#x27;s IT.  </li>
            <li> I have spent years looking for an exfoliating wash that wouldn&#x27;t leave my skin all blotchy and red.  </li>
            <li> (I thought I&#x27;d use it up in about a month, but it&#x27;s been nearly 4, and it&#x27;s not closeto empty; a little goes a long way.)  </li>
            <li> This cleanser is different from any other I&#x27;ve ever used, works well, wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> ; so since it was a dry powder, I decided to use it in the morning in the shower, instead of the moisturizing glycerin product I&#x27;ve used morning and night for years.  </li>
            <li> One customer had said that it got wet in the shower because she didn&#x27;t know if it was open or closed.</li>
            <li> After about two weeks of using it every morning, I realized that my pores were smaller, and did not have that look of incipient clogging that has always meant I had to give up and exfoliate; in fact, my face was significantly less reactive than it had been in a while.  </li>
            <li> This size bottle has lasted me a LONG time as I have only used small amounts at one time.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;cleanser\\&quot; is a total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> So this product was not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> You wet your face and hands, put this in your hands and lather up.  </li>
            <li> All you need is a pea size amount on wet hands, then rub on your face.</li>
            <li> It says to simply wet your face and hands and blend them together with the product.</li>
            <li> Because in the shower, my hands and my face/neck were all wet already--</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, but the bottle lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li> I suffer from extreme sensitivity, as well as rosacea.</li>
            <li> Average product, average quality.  </li>
            <li> I do not get dried out and it does not burn my skin unlike other products.</li>
            <li> As the previous review states, it&#x27;s supposed to lather up</li>
            <li> I agree with the previous reviewers that it doesn&#x27;t lather, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s designed to do anything of the sort.  </li>
            <li> This is a little too mesy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how people are having trouble with the water-to-product ratio.</li>
            <li> This is the only cleanser I&#x27;ve found that cleans thoroughly without irritating.  </li>
            <li> Everything dried out my skin (even with moisturizer and toners).  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> It felt clumpy, and was hard to blend with water.  </li>
            <li> I hated it at first, to be honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It cleans well, but not a very good exfoliating treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Not irritating, not exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this product especially for what I paid.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it will not become a part of my beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Silly</li>
            <li> and I hate the small.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the smell is unpleasant at all, it just kinda smells a bit like rice paper or something.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using Bare Minerals makeup for years and love it, so I decided to try a cleanser. This \\&quot;cleanser\\&quot; is a total waste of money.  As the previous review states, it&#x27;s supposed to lather up but it doesn&#x27;t. You end up washing your face with just your hands. It doesn&#x27;t remove all of my makeup and it doesn&#x27;t exfoliate anything. I don&#x27;t know how this product made it through testing.  They need to go back to the drawing board on this one. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I agree with the previous reviewers that it doesn&#x27;t lather, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s designed to do anything of the sort.  In order to be effective in removing make-up etc. as well as to exfoliate, it has to be placed on some sort of cloth-like surface, mixed with water into a light paste, and then applied to the face to be used as a scrub.  I was told it can also be kept on the face as a mask.  In my experience, it leaves the face clean and cool.</li>
            <li> So this product was not what I expected.  It&#x27;s actually in powder form.  You wet your face and hands, put this in your hands and lather up.  The only problem is it doesn&#x27;t lather....and it doesn&#x27;t even really exfoliate, but it does leave my face feeling good, like I just put oatmeal on it and washed it off.  It also gets rid of all the excess oil and it&#x27;s good for people with acne.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. If you are looking for something that will rub your skin off, this is not the product. However, if you&#x27;re looking for a light scrub, it&#x27;s amazing. All you need is a pea size amount on wet hands, then rub on your face. It does not always get off all my eye makeup, but then again, I also don&#x27;t want anything too abrasive. This product is awesome!</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping that it would full fill the stated claims of \\&quot;Clinically proven to reveal brighter, smoother, younger-looking skin, reduced fine lines and wrinkles, and remarkably smaller-looking pores\\&quot;.  I gave it 2 weeks of continuous use but I haven&#x27;t seen any differences.  I have normal skin, maybe that&#x27;s my problem.  I enjoy the BM line of make up but I&#x27;m thinking that the BE line isn&#x27;t made for normal skin types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy this again and giving away the remainder that I have.</li>
            <li> Average product, average quality.  Unique design in that you squeeze out the powder and add water.  My skin is generally normal, with dry cheeks and forehead. I was using this cleanser with the rich moisturizer for dry skin, and my dry areas were too dry with this routine. This would be good for someone with normal skin. Definitely not dry, and wouldn&#x27;t think oily.   I tried BE&#x27;s skincare b/c the ingredients sounded good. Like new technology and good quality...After using, I just don&#x27;t think that is the case.   I want to take the best care of my skin now (I&#x27;m 30 yrs old)before I get too old :/ So I am looking for the best that I can afford. So I have moved on to a diff. skincare line that I can definitely tell uses better quality ingredients, and moisturizes my dry skin.  Bottom line: Good for normal, budget concerned women, not concerned about wrinkles yet.</li>
            <li> I suffer from extreme sensitivity, as well as rosacea. This cleanser might just be my HG. I&#x27;ve never tried Bare Minerals skincare before, but bought this with the cell renewal serum and am loving the results. I&#x27;ve tried sooo many other cleansers, and none of them are as ideal for sensitive skin as this one. The only thing that compares is Lush&#x27;s Angels on Bare Skin, but even that&#x27;s not quite as good because my skin doesn&#x27;t literally drink it up like it does this one. I use it twice a day, morning and night, and at night  I let it stay on while I&#x27;m in the shower. It feels soo good, and the smell is nice and relaxing, like oats (smells like a less-delicious version of Lush&#x27;s Oatafix).  I don&#x27;t understand how people are having trouble with the water-to-product ratio. Follow the directions. It says to simply wet your face and hands and blend them together with the product. Do not add more water than that. The only problem you could be having is if you&#x27;re dispensing too much product in the first place. I use about a quarter-sized amount and it blends perfectly.</li>
            <li> This cleanser lathers up so creamy and leaves my skin so soft. I love it. You must make sure that it&#x27;s fresh; it goes rancid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this Bare Escentuals cleanser since it came out, &amp; I LOVE it!!! I like to use this in the morning &amp; I use a different cleanser in the evening. This cleanser is different from any other I&#x27;ve ever used, works well, wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years.  First time I ran across it was at a mall in Pheonix in 2005.  I have been using it ever since., as has my whole family, I am 55 and my skin looks great</li>
            <li> this stuff is awesome. my face is so soft now.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin with roseacea.  This cleanser cleans well without over-stimulating my skin.  It is very gentle cleansing without drying.</li>
            <li> My face seems to crave this product... love it!</li>
            <li> My husband and I both love this product.  It can get a little tricky to pour, so make sure your hands aren&#x27;t too wet when you&#x27;re holding it.  Also, remember to shake the bottle from time to time, because the product settles and not every part of the mix is the same size.  For an extra treat, add a drop of lavender essential oil before applying.  It smells wonderful and is good for your skin too!</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Bare Minerals, but I think this product falls short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a great as a face wash, though a little weird. It comes in a powder form, which stresses me out cause don&#x27;t want to keep it near water to get it inside!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I think as an exfoliator, it completely falls short. It does not feel like it exfoliates my skin at all, which is frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want something that exfoliates, you will not find it in this product!</li>
            <li> This is a light exfoliating powdery cleanser.  If you prefer deep exfoliating then this is not for you.  Smell is also a factor for me and I hate the small.  I am so glad I got this free with a gift card because I hate this product.  I expected more from the reviews.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;Regular use keeps my skin fresh and blemish free without the harsh drying of other products.&lt;br /&gt;Great price, and one bottle lasts me quite awhile.</li>
            <li> This has been my go-to cleanser for years. The water-activated powder is so unique, and I love the feel of it. The ingredients are natural and great for the skin. Although it doesn&#x27;t feel abrasive like many exfoliators, it definitely keeps my skin soft and healthy. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but the bottle lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li> Good for cleanser for the face. No additives. I think it is sad that Leslie no longer sell her products that customers love so well. Thus people selling the products on Amazon.com are now charging an arm and a leg for the products. Shame</li>
            <li> My favorite part of this product is that it comes in a powder form that creates a paste when you get it wet with water. I like to mix this paste with other facial cleansers or I use it as a mask on its own. It has an &#x27;oatmeal&#x27; smell but that is not so much of a problem that it prevents me from using it. This size bottle has lasted me a LONG time as I have only used small amounts at one time. I would most likely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> The powder gets all gummed up and clogs the applicator. So now I have to remove the top in order to apply the product. And it&#x27;s not an effective product - I see no difference in my skin. I do not recommend this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a powder and I do not feel anything in it that is exfoliating. I am disappointed in this product especially for what I paid. I purchased something else.</li>
            <li> The product is interesting..it is a powder that seems to dissolve almost instantly when put on a wet face. For that reason is doesn&#x27;t seem like it exfoliates as much as I want but at least it doesn&#x27;t work too hard and take off a top layer of skin. Could be better, could be worse.</li>
            <li> I love Bare Minerals products, almost without exception.  This product is the ONE exception!    This product is a powder that you are supposed to mix with water in your hand and then apply to your face.  It felt clumpy, and was hard to blend with water.  I didn&#x27;t like the way it went on my face.  It never really felt like it was doing anything for my skin, and I also didn&#x27;t really care for the scent.    I had really high hopes for this product.  Unfortunately, it will not become a part of my beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect cleanser!  My skin is sensitive, but it also gets oily.....  This is the only cleanser I&#x27;ve found that cleans thoroughly without irritating.  I did a massive search at &amp;#34;high-end&amp;#34; stores some years ago.... I looked for a good skin-care line, but even the gentle ones left me red.  I&#x27;ll never use anything else on my face but Bare!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice cleanser especially if you do a lot of travel since it is powdered. I don&#x27;t think the smell is unpleasant at all, it just kinda smells a bit like rice paper or something.</li>
            <li> My favorite cleanser ever! Buying two, so that I can reorder after one runs out so I don&#x27;t have to do without.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 3 years now, and I will never use anything else. It&#x27;s a very gentle exfoliant, and works perfectly for once or twice a day cleansing. My skin is very clear regardless of washing, but this works wonders for keeping it soft, clean, and touchable. You should definitely follow up with a moisturizer after using to keep the face extra soft and smooth - I recommend using Bare Escentuals Purely Nourishing moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I only use it every other day, or it will clean my skin too much and I get breakouts. But I like it nonetheless, it does it&#x27;s job. :)</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin.  Exfoliation is always a very, very tricky matter for me. I have to exfoliate, or I end up with those little bumps over time; but exfoliating has always caused a reaction, sometimes even a full on rash, depending on the product. This stuff WORKS, and without causing a reaction--not even any redness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very different exfoliating action--you don&#x27;t feel any of the &#x27;scrub&#x27; against your skin that&#x27;s very apparent with most exfo-cleansers or with sponges, the Mia or other face cleaning brushes. It feels very creamy, almost silky, sliding over your skin--except that after you rinse off, your face has an every so slightly squeaky feeling, it doesn&#x27;t even feel like you&#x27;ve done anything.  The effect isn&#x27;t immediate at all--but over time?  It&#x27;s amazing..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first started using it, I didn&#x27;t think it was working either. I was used to feeling the &#x27;scrub&#x27; as that first layer of cells was forcibly stripped off my skin--this doesn&#x27;t feel that way, except for the first second or two between your hands before it melts into the water you&#x27;re using. I had a hugely difficult time at first, with how much water to put on my hands, how much to have on my face, did I need a washcloth or a sponge....I hated it at first, to be honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided that I had to use it, though, because it&#x27;s really not a bit cheap; so since it was a dry powder, I decided to use it in the morning in the shower, instead of the moisturizing glycerin product I&#x27;ve used morning and night for years.  And this is where I discovered my mistake, by accident.  Because in the shower, my hands and my face/neck were all wet already--so I just sprinkled it across the palm of my hands WITHOUT adding any more water than was already on them, and rubbed them together to distribute the powder, and then washed my face/neck with it as if it were the my cleanser I&#x27;d been using.  (I thought I&#x27;d use it up in about a month, but it&#x27;s been nearly 4, and it&#x27;s not closeto empty; a little goes a long way.)  After about two weeks of using it every morning, I realized that my pores were smaller, and did not have that look of incipient clogging that has always meant I had to give up and exfoliate; in fact, my face was significantly less reactive than it had been in a while.  I gave it another week--and my pores looked even smaller, and my skin was less reactive; and the real proof was that when I went in for my monthly facial, my facialist asked me what I&#x27;d changed since I&#x27;d seen her last--because I didn&#x27;t need the product that&#x27;s been my &#x27;deep clean&#x27; for several years now, and there was no need for even one extraction.  And using this stuff once a day is the only thing I had changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key is not using any additional water at all--wet face, wet hands, and that&#x27;s IT.  And it&#x27;s actually really easy to use in the shower, because the top slides back and forth really tightly--it doesn&#x27;t get damp and clump up or clog or anything--you just slide the lid over with one finger, sprinkle it, and slide the lid back before putting it back on the shower shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big fan of this stuff.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected.  I thought I was getting a liquid exfoliating cleanser and it was a powder that you add water to.  Kind of weird but I am using it, seems to be okay but not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser with light exfoliation. Plus, great for one&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Product is same as if I had picked it up in store. Good price and new, just like if I had bought it local.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried (and spent way too much money on) countless face cleansers, but my picky skin just seems to get irritated with most of them. I&#x27;ve been wearing Bare Escentuals makeup for two years now, and finally decided to try their cleansing products. This is a VERY gentle exfoliator, but it gets the job done. I often have a hard time getting rid of the dry skin (especially on either side of my nose) without irritating the rest of my face and this cleanser strikes the perfect balance. I had read the mixed reviews before purchasing, but am thrilled with this product. If you like a rough exfoliator (like apricot scrub) skip this, but if you want something gentle enough to use every day, give it a try. You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> One customer had said that it got wet in the shower because she didn&#x27;t know if it was open or closed. It doesn&#x27;t have a lift top, it has a slat that slides forward or back, and there is a big hole you can see through to see that it is open. That being said, I still wouldn&#x27;t keep this in the shower...it&#x27;s a powder that becomes a paste when it touches water...why would you think that is a good idea? I love this. It leaves my skin glowing, I can use it as a mask, and I love it for make-up removal at night. I use this at night, follow it up with a serum, then I use the purifying wash in the morning in the shower.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser. I&#x27;ve always had sensitive skin and this product has worked wonders for me. I have used it for many years and I felt comfortable using it while pregnant. It does a good job balancing my combination skin. I do not get dried out and it does not burn my skin unlike other products.</li>
            <li> Ok, I love this product. Yes, it does not lather.  It&#x27;s not supposed to.  For best results, use a cloth like cleansing pad.  I find Salon Plus Cotton Ovals work best.  I got them from Rite Aid.  The others seem to fall apart.  There are two sides to the pad, use the side for skin care (it shows it on the front of the package).  Put about a nickel to quarter size amount on the pad.  Put drops of water on it until the powder becomes a paste.  Then apply cleanser to your face.  I try to spread it out first to get more even coverage.  You will feel exfoliation.  A lot of people don&#x27;t feel it exfoliate because they use to much water.  The cleanser sort of melts away (becomes less gritty) when you add more water.  I guess so it rinses off with no residue.  Talk with a sales lady, or call the BE customer service number (found on BE&#x27;s website) if it still does not work for you.  I don&#x27;t normally call customer service, but if you spend $20 on a cleanser, you should try everything before you throw it away.  I think they have email support to if you don&#x27;t have time for a call.  Of course, you can ask me questions too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have problems with adult acne.  I have used anything from drugstore products to department store products to salon products.  I&#x27;ve tried normal and sensitive skin products.  My dermatologist suggested Clinique, but it did not help.  Everything dried out my skin (even with moisturizer and toners).  It&#x27;s embarrassing to go to work with flakes of skin falling off your face and still have break outs. This product has made these problems go away.  I use it twice a day, and in the evening follow it up with Pure Transformation Night Treatment and my pores are smaller, skin smoother, and more even toned.  Hint:  QVC sells Pure Transformation Night Treatment and the wrinkle treatment for the same price of just the Pure Transformation Night Treatment ($60).  That stuff lasts about three months for me.  The facial cleanser lasts about two months.  The only problem I have is if I go a day or two without using it, I start to break out.  Here&#x27;s the best part though, if I wash my face at night, the next morning, the pimple is visibly reduced.  I know I sound like a sales lady, but this is the only product I have found that works for my skin.  If you see my other reviews, you&#x27;ll see I have reviewed a lot more than just BE products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps, and good luck!</li>
            <li> I really like the way my skin feels after I have used this cleanser. It does a great job of cleaning, too. I have large pores and this cleanser seems to make them less noticeable. I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Works well with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This cleanser works perfectly well when used correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet your face first to prepare for the cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;Puff the powder onto your open hand -two or three motions of the bottle will do.&lt;br /&gt;Follow up by adding a very gentle dribble of water with a your finger.&lt;br /&gt;This will allow you to control the moisture and not add too much water too quickly which will lead to a watery nothing in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;Then you&#x27;ll have to start over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll want to work up the consistency into a frothy paste.&lt;br /&gt;Once you have it at this stage you can start to exfoliate/cleanse your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally like to add a bit of gentle face cleanser to this one.&lt;br /&gt;I mix them together with water and use the mixture on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Many will ask, \\&quot;Well isn&#x27;t this a cleanser?  Why do you need an ADDitional cleanser?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;As some have said, the smell isn&#x27;t amazing, not awful, but just smells kind of like ... dust.&lt;br /&gt;So I like to add a cleanser that smells pretty.&lt;br /&gt;There I said it.  Silly I know, but what are you gonna do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO.&lt;br /&gt;Once a week or so I like to leave this on my face for 10-15 minutes after having massaged it into my face.&lt;br /&gt;It makes a great masque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four stars because it&#x27;s a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> I like the regular cleanser with the pump way better. This is a little too mesy and it goes fast plus with this one i also needed to buy an eye make up remover.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t breathe in around the powder! It cleans well, but not a very good exfoliating treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Not irritating, not exfoliating. Doesn&#x27;t make me &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; or any adjective to that nature. However, it does clean your face and will be great for a plane ride.</li>
            <li> Have been using this a couple of years. I combine it with their creamy cleanser and they work really well.</li>
            <li> I have spent years looking for an exfoliating wash that wouldn&#x27;t leave my skin all blotchy and red.  This stuff is amazing!  Bare Minerals originally sold it as their only facial cleanser and eventually changed it to their exfoliating cleanser, I now use both products and mix it up through the week.</li>
            <li> This combined with the deep foaming cleanser and a face brush do wonders for the skin. I follow it up with bareMinerals moisturizer. I break out with almost all skin care products, but these work beautifully for me. I use it daily and have finally stopped getting oily patches and flaky patches. Don&#x27;t change or discontinue them!!</li>
            <li> I have used several different exfoliators. This one is natural ... Doesn&#x27;t burn the eyes and cleanses and exfoliates together so you don&#x27;t need another product. It is very mild ... I use it once to twice daily and I can see a noticeable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Love, love this product</li>
