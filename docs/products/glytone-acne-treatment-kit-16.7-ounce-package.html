            <li>Best stuff i have ever used and believe me i have tried alot of products!</li>
            <li>This is one of the best products I have EVER purchased.</li>
            <li>And if you do not want to receive counterfeit products filled with “who knows what” then do your research before you order!!!!</li>
            <li>Glytone is an incredible product.  </li>
            <li>The acne gel works great as a spot treatment as well.</li>
            <li>Everyone comments on how great my skin looks</li>

            <li>It has worked great for my daughter</li>
            <li>I works great.</li>
            <li>The product smells lovely and best of all</li>
            <li>Despite my best efforts to prevent it from getting in my eye area, some did get on my top eyelids.</li>
            <li>i will be trying all the latest acne kits to see which best suits</li>
            <li>non comedogenic and fragrance free is best)</li>
            <li>Good price, timely shipping.</li>
            <li>I was impressed with how quickly this 3 piece skin care kit started working on my son&#x27;s acne.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Great Seller, great price and fast shipping...5 Stars all the way!</li>
            <li>What can I say the 10% acne gel is amazing .</li>
            <li>The cleanser is nice as is the toner.</li>
            <li>It was nicely packaged and arrived on time.</li>
            <li>I honestly think I got ripped off because I believe the company I ordered it from, iDerma, sent me counterfeit products.</li>
            <li>Awesome skin care at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>They say its hazardous, but isn&#x27;t it hazardous when they ship it?</li>
            <li>The toner is very strong smelling.  </li>
            <li>In a week of double treatment (morning &amp; night) her face looked great!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Like magic</li>
            <li>but soon after I noticed that my face became drier and I had even more breakouts.</li>
            <li>am going to have to stop using this and hope I find something better.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of acne treatments, some worked better than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it as a kit.</li>
            <li>The face wash is just ok...</li>
            <li>Works okay, a bit drying even for oily skin.</li>
            <li>This works very well for acne (the toner is AMAZING!)</li>
            <li>the Juice Beauty, my face never felt clean and my acne never got better</li>
            <li>If you have acne and have never tried Glytone I strongly urge you to try.</li>
            <li>Its amazing, and has really boosted my confidence.</li>
            <li>One has to remove the many layers of sun damage and exposure to find fresh cells.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>I was really excited when it arrived.</li>
            <li>I find that when I forget the product at home or forget to use it my face doesn&#x27;t quite seem clean and I will begin to have breakouts.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>The treatment gel took me by surprise a bit because of the texture, its grainy feeling, but have quickly gotten used to it.</li>
            <li>Within three weeks the scars and blackheads had faded tremendously.</li>
            <li>I am 31 and have always been prone to breaking out (basically mild acne).</li>
            <li>For those who say this stuff is mild - you guys must have skin made of steel.</li>
            <li>this is the first product that helped with my acne!</li>
            <li>Using this in conjunction with annual facial peels can help keep the fine lines and spots under control and keep your skin appearing healthy.</li>
            <li>and I rarely get pimples now.</li>
            <li>I honestly would not go back to using anything else.  </li>
            <li>but it is so worth it</li>
            <li>just started using the Obagi Therapeutic Moisturizer with this Glytone kit and feel its a pretty good combo as the toner and benzoyl peroxide cream can dry my skin</li>
            <li>But Glytone worked great for my african american skin.</li>
            <li>but now my skin is breakout free and soo soft.  </li>
            <li>my botox doc gave me glytone for free to try and after one week my face was clear for the first time in years!&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li>The first 48 hours of using it, my face burned.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the first wash, my face felt better/cleaner.</li>
            <li>I use Philosophy&#x27;s oilr free Oxygen moisturizer and I have clear skin.</li>
            <li>There would be a higher percentage of use compliance with teenagers, if there were fewer steps involved.</li>
            <li>If I had actually received the REAL products I would probably have rated it better.</li>
            <li>but you&#x27;ve got to be careful and not go overboard...very fast and effective .</li>
            <li>After reading all of the positive reviews this product had, I decided to order.  </li>
            <li>Much like all the other reviews, the product is drying yet effective.</li>
            <li>I was already happy that my face at least felt clean (with the other product i never felt), but the true test is to see if my acne clears up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Most things I have tried started off with some dry skin and peeling around my mouth/nose area.</li>
            <li>This product really does work</li>
            <li>Really helped take care of and prevent my acne.</li>
            <li>It has worked very well at reducing breakouts and smoothing her skin.  </li>
            <li>The acne gel didn&#x27;t do much for my face either.</li>
            <li>Glytone products really do work.</li>
            <li>I continue to use the product for a few more months, but it&#x27;s pretty evident that the product has stopped working.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have never broken out there before.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think i will be buying this product again, The discomfort is too much.</li>
            <li>but none really did much, or kept my acne</li>
            <li>still looking for the acne kit that well clear up my face totally, but its good to know this kit actually does better then others for less.</li>
            <li>The main reason I use this is for acne, and it really does wonders.</li>
            <li>This is the first product that has completely cleared my skin.</li>
            <li>When I first started using it, it did make my skin sensitive but after about two weeks my skin adapted and cleared up.</li>
            <li>I had a mild case of cystic acne on both cheeks as well as occasional whiteheads and blackheads.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel too harsh on your face like most acne products.</li>
            <li>its been a few weeks, and my face is much better than before i started.</li>
            <li>part of the kit should last a few months which is good, considering most other acne kits last</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>So far, my son says he will continue to use it!</li>
            <li>I purchased this product due to the good reviews, i have been using this product as directed  for the past 6 days.</li>
            <li>I have hormonal acne on my chin and this has helped clear it.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Glytone line because my dermatologist recommended it and although it does mildly to moderately clear up acne, it doesn&#x27;t completely clear it</li>
            <li>It did start to help clear up my skin</li>
            <li>I had run out of the bottle in the shower and tried to use some old drugstore benzoil peroxide cleansers I had until I re-ordered another bottle from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>My pores are smaller and although i still get acne, i have fewer pimples and they a gone much faster.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first day that I used this product my face was really dry.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate that it works all over your body because I live at the beach and your entire body is always on display (especially the problem parts).  </li>
            <li>I am now on my second kit, the first lasted me 4-5 months using it once daily.</li>
            <li>I applied the toner (a little burning) and used what was left of the Juice Beauty Oil Free Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I was looking for the original black opal that worked well on my face when I was a teen.</li>
            <li>This stuff has made my face feel so clean, my skin no longer gets excessively oily throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Leaves face looking clear almost instantly</li>
            <li>But I guess adult acne is different.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions exactly and noticed an improvement in less pimples and scarring by 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>The cleanser is mediocre, the toner is very strong and burns.</li>
            <li>I seem to not use as much toner as the other two products, therefore I&#x27;m left with bunch of it.</li>
            <li>It stings at first and it took a few weeks to work up to using it twice a day</li>

            <li> It stings at first and it took a few weeks to work up to using it twice a day</li>
            <li> Now we only use the acne gel for the occasional spot treatments, which ha e been far and few between.</li>
            <li> I have slightly oily skin, but it&#x27;s really sensitive</li>
            <li> not sure what the point is to treat acne scars if it makes all brand new ones as a result of the treatment, especially at a cost of $2,500.00?!!  </li>
            <li> Once I used these products they BURNED my skin and left it very dry.</li>
            <li> It was just way to harsh on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Have suffered from acne due to a medical treatment I&#x27;m on</li>
            <li> extremely so i have to use an extra moisturizer afterwards</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended Glytone face wash several years ago due to cystic acne.</li>
            <li> After the bar soap I was using (Panoxyl) went off the market, I was reading Amazon reviews of other similar products and decided to try Glytone.</li>
            <li> In addition to the regimen, I used moisturizer which helps when my skin is peeling or dry.</li>
            <li> I also used a moisturizer and my face was still dry.</li>
            <li> does dry out the skin</li>
            <li> but I will recommend getting the balancing lotion because this will dry your skin</li>
            <li> I have used it for two years now and will not live wirhout it.</li>
            <li> I have battled acne since junior high and I am now in my late 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I started using it 2x daily but cut down to once a day because of dryness.</li>
            <li> I would say if you are looking for something that wont dry your skin out like proactive then you should use this!</li>
            <li> have oily skin and would not recommend this kit to people with dry skin as it may be to harsh, or maybe use less frequently than the 2 times a day</li>
            <li> My skin clears up really well for a few weeks, the dryness goes away, and then the product loses it&#x27;s effectiveness and my skin starts breaking out again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product as i have few breakouts and bought this to control the breakouts and diminish acne scars i currently have.</li>
            <li> The only time I have a few breakouts is when it is that time of month.</li>
            <li> My whole face was extremely tight (not good feeling, and no it looked nothing like a face lift).</li>
            <li> There is no magical facial moisturizer that is going to remove wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m experimenting with other products now.</li>
            <li> It slowly peels down the layers of dead skin allowing new cells to rejuvenate.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it, like other products, involves cleaning, toning, and treatment.</li>
            <li> My dark marks are fading.</li>
            <li> not worth the money.</li>
            <li> So thank you to other Amazon reviewers for taking the time to write a review!</li>
            <li> It does dry out your face so slowly ease into using the product.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous to try another acne regimen.</li>
            <li> The flaking did not go away like with other products I&#x27;ve used in the past...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who is having trouble with her skin.  </li>
            <li> But after using these products for a little over two weeks I finally realized that something was wrong with this “acne kit”.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To say this dried me out is a understatement!</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m starting to get these weird break outs on my jaw line.</li>
            <li> im tired of the doctors and rising prescription costs with no real</li>
            <li> I mean the “toner” smelled like acetone.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t so bad the next time.</li>
            <li> My skin did start to clear up, but the pain was so annoying.</li>
            <li> Putting on makeup to cover it made it worse.</li>
            <li> but they conveniently forget to tell you that the Fraxel is going to make you break out worse than ever before...</li>
            <li> It got me very horrible looks from people as my skin looks very unattractive with the peeling.</li>
            <li> its just standard cleanser, toner, and treatment with a crap load of alcohol which is the &amp;#34;gratifying&amp;#34; ingredient, made my oily skin worse.</li>
            <li> and it was really to expensive to buy from her office.  </li>
            <li> The next day I woke up with horribly swollen eyes (like an allergic reaction!).</li>
            <li> I accidentally ordered the wrong kit and it can&#x27;t be returned because it will supposedly burst into flames or something.</li>
            <li> maybe not THAT bad, but it hurts.</li>
            <li> Like horribly!</li>
            <li> THEN it started flaking horribly!</li>

            <li> I have hormonal acne on my chin and this has helped clear it. My face is not as oily and that helps. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness I found this. At 22, I started to struggle with acne. Putting on makeup to cover it made it worse. This product cleared me up entirely. I still can&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> This product really does work and I have moderate pimple skin. I would say if you are looking for something that wont dry your skin out like proactive then you should use this!</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous to try another acne regimen. But Glytone worked great for my african american skin. I had a mild case of cystic acne on both cheeks as well as occasional whiteheads and blackheads. I followed the instructions exactly and noticed an improvement in less pimples and scarring by 3 weeks. The acne gel works great as a spot treatment as well. In addition to the regimen, I used moisturizer which helps when my skin is peeling or dry. It&#x27;s been 2 months since I started Glytone and I no longer have cystic acne! My scars are almost gone and I rarely get pimples now.</li>
            <li> All I can say is... WOW!  My dermatologist kept pushing me and pushing me to buy this product and it was really to expensive to buy from her office.  I finally caved this summer when my skin was really acting up and I can&#x27;t believe the difference this has made.  I use the face wash morning and night, and I also use it as a body wash for some problem areas on my body (chest and back).  I really appreciate that it works all over your body because I live at the beach and your entire body is always on display (especially the problem parts).  Everyone comments on how great my skin looks and it&#x27;s improvement.  I have slightly oily skin, but it&#x27;s really sensitive so I appreciate that this doesn&#x27;t make my skin red and blotchy.  The main reason I use this is for acne, and it really does wonders. I&#x27;ve been using it for about five months now and it&#x27;s a noticeable difference when I stop using it.  I honestly would not go back to using anything else.  You may want to use a lotion with this at night (non comedogenic and fragrance free is best) but it&#x27;s definitely worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> I have had acne for 35yrs and had two rounds of Accutane and it still came back.  I have used every product out there but my face tends to get too used to the product after 6 months and I break out again.  When I finally had a gap in breakouts, I decided to get the Fraxel laser series to treat brown spots and acne scars but they conveniently forget to tell you that the Fraxel is going to make you break out worse than ever before...not sure what the point is to treat acne scars if it makes all brand new ones as a result of the treatment, especially at a cost of $2,500.00?!!  Absolutley nothing worked to quell the acne after the Fraxel.  I read reviews of the Glytone and decided to try it.  It stings at first and it took a few weeks to work up to using it twice a day but now my skin is breakout free and soo soft.  I had run out of the bottle in the shower and tried to use some old drugstore benzoil peroxide cleansers I had until I re-ordered another bottle from Amazon.  I noticed within 5 days that my skin got oilier again and my pores started to sludge up again with gunk.  I was still using the Glytone at night but it just wasn&#x27;t enough...I ended up with a zit on my chin.  I&#x27;m back to twice a day with the Glytone and I won&#x27;t ever let myself run out again.</li>
            <li> I have battled acne since junior high and I am now in my late 30&#x27;s. This is the first product that has completely cleared my skin. Its amazing, and has really boosted my confidence. My dermatologist sells it but I found it cheaper here on Amazon. I am now on my second kit, the first lasted me 4-5 months using it once daily. When I first started using it, it did make my skin sensitive but after about two weeks my skin adapted and cleared up. The cleanser is nice as is the toner. I seem to not use as much toner as the other two products, therefore I&#x27;m left with bunch of it. The treatment gel took me by surprise a bit because of the texture, its grainy feeling, but have quickly gotten used to it. I can definitely tell a difference when I don&#x27;t use it, my acne starts popping up again. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working.  The toner is very strong smelling.  It does dry out your face so slowly ease into using the product.</li>
            <li> After reading all of the positive reviews this product had, I decided to order.  I was really excited when it arrived. It was nicely packaged and arrived on time. After removing the products from the package I noticed that the products seemed “used”. The protective cap on one of the bottles was falling off. I was going to return but decided to give it a try. BIG MISTAKE! Once I used these products they BURNED my skin and left it very dry. I thought it was just my skins way of adapting to the product. But after using these products for a little over two weeks I finally realized that something was wrong with this “acne kit”. I mean the “toner” smelled like acetone. I kid you not this kit was definitely not meant for skin care. I honestly think I got ripped off because I believe the company I ordered it from, iDerma, sent me counterfeit products. That’s why I am giving this product a one star rating. If I had actually received the REAL products I would probably have rated it better. I suggestion anyone ordering this kit to check and do research on the company. And if you do not want to receive counterfeit products filled with “who knows what” then do your research before you order!!!!</li>
            <li> Best stuff i have ever used and believe me i have tried alot of products! A++++ i will order this again and again</li>
            <li> Found this product by chance. I was looking for the original black opal that worked well on my face when I was a teen. But I guess adult acne is different. So I tried this kit, bought one for myself and one for my daughter. Much like all the other reviews, the product is drying yet effective. It worked wonders for my teenage daughter&#x27;s acne n scars. In a week of double treatment (morning &amp; night) her face looked great! Within three weeks the scars and blackheads had faded tremendously. My face looks great too. Now we only use the acne gel for the occasional spot treatments, which ha e been far and few between.</li>
            <li> I have been in search for a product which would help with my acne prone/oily skin since the discontinuing of Plexion. My search has ended! This stuff has made my face feel so clean, my skin no longer gets excessively oily throughout the day. My dark marks are fading.</li>
            <li> There is no magical facial moisturizer that is going to remove wrinkles.  Glytone is an incredible product.  It slowly peels down the layers of dead skin allowing new cells to rejuvenate.  One has to remove the many layers of sun damage and exposure to find fresh cells.  Using this in conjunction with annual facial peels can help keep the fine lines and spots under control and keep your skin appearing healthy.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Have suffered from acne due to a medical treatment I&#x27;m on but this has definitely kept it at bay.</li>
            <li> Awesome skin care at a reasonable price. Really helped take care of and prevent my acne. Doesn&#x27;t feel too harsh on your face like most acne products.</li>
            <li> It has worked great for my daughter</li>
            <li> I purchased the Glytone line because my dermatologist recommended it and although it does mildly to moderately clear up acne, it doesn&#x27;t completely clear it and it also dries the skin. I&#x27;m experimenting with other products now.</li>
            <li> What can I say the 10% acne gel is amazing . I put it on and the pimple is gone. Like magic but you&#x27;ve got to be careful and not go overboard...very fast and effective .</li>
            <li> Good price, timely shipping.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who is having trouble with her skin.  It has worked very well at reducing breakouts and smoothing her skin.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The first day that I used this product my face was really dry. It did start to help clear up my skin but soon after I noticed that my face became drier and I had even more breakouts. I don&#x27;t know which is the culprit. The cleanser is mediocre, the toner is very strong and burns. It smells like nail polish remover. The acne gel didn&#x27;t do much for my face either. I started using it 2x daily but cut down to once a day because of dryness. I also used a moisturizer and my face was still dry. I would not recommend this product and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it from Amazon. You cannot return this product for safety reasons. They say its hazardous, but isn&#x27;t it hazardous when they ship it? So what&#x27;s the difference if it&#x27;s returned? Anyway, I didn&#x27;t like this product and I definitely wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> this is the first product that helped with my acne! ive used proactiv and neutrogena before. my botox doc gave me glytone for free to try and after one week my face was clear for the first time in years!&lt;br /&gt;it does dry out the skin extremely so i have to use an extra moisturizer afterwards but it is so worth it i wont ever use anything else ever again!</li>
            <li> Great Seller, great price and fast shipping...5 Stars all the way!</li>
            <li> not worth the money. its just standard cleanser, toner, and treatment with a crap load of alcohol which is the &amp;#34;gratifying&amp;#34; ingredient, made my oily skin worse. It was just way to harsh on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended Glytone face wash several years ago due to cystic acne. My skin did not react well with traditional face washes. Since switching I have had a brighter complexion. My acne scars have faded. I find that when I forget the product at home or forget to use it my face doesn&#x27;t quite seem clean and I will begin to have breakouts. Glytone products really do work. I buy two kits at a time so that I can have one face wash in the shower and another at my sink to remind me to wash my face in the morning and in the evening. The product smells lovely and best of all it doesn&#x27;t hamper my use of any makeup. If you have acne and have never tried Glytone I strongly urge you to try. I switched from proactiv brand and have never looked back.</li>
            <li> Not for me at all. I am 31 and have always been prone to breaking out (basically mild acne). I&#x27;ve used Clinique Acne line, AcneFree and now this. Most things I have tried started off with some dry skin and peeling around my mouth/nose area. My skin clears up really well for a few weeks, the dryness goes away, and then the product loses it&#x27;s effectiveness and my skin starts breaking out again. I continue to use the product for a few more months, but it&#x27;s pretty evident that the product has stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;To say this dried me out is a understatement! The first 48 hours of using it, my face burned. Like horribly! Like a chemical burn! Despite my best efforts to prevent it from getting in my eye area, some did get on my top eyelids. The next day I woke up with horribly swollen eyes (like an allergic reaction!). My whole face was extremely tight (not good feeling, and no it looked nothing like a face lift). THEN it started flaking horribly! I skipped a day of using it and tried again. It wasn&#x27;t so bad the next time. I kept on with it, but my face always stung after using it. My skin did start to clear up, but the pain was so annoying. The flaking did not go away like with other products I&#x27;ve used in the past... and now I&#x27;m starting to get these weird break outs on my jaw line. I have never broken out there before.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to have to stop using this and hope I find something better. For those who say this stuff is mild - you guys must have skin made of steel. Because this junk is like putting acid on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok maybe not THAT bad, but it hurts.</li>
            <li> Leaves face looking clear almost instantly but I will recommend getting the balancing lotion because this will dry your skin</li>
            <li> I purchased this product due to the good reviews, i have been using this product as directed  for the past 6 days. My skin burns and  its currently peeling. It got me very horrible looks from people as my skin looks very unattractive with the peeling. I bought this product as i have few breakouts and bought this to control the breakouts and diminish acne scars i currently have. I don&#x27;t think i will be buying this product again, The discomfort is too much.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of acne treatments, some worked better than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just finished using the Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Kit for 60 days, didnt see any results and searched for another kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Juice Beauty, my face never felt clean and my acne never got better, it might have been worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used orals, proactive, aczone, differin, retin-a 1%, clindamycin, etc. but none really did much, or kept my acne away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also im tired of the doctors and rising prescription costs with no real results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So i will be trying all the latest acne kits to see which best suits me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read reviews of the Glytone Acne Kit and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first wash, my face felt better/cleaner. I applied the toner (a little burning) and used what was left of the Juice Beauty Oil Free Moisturizer. I was already happy that my face at least felt clean (with the other product i never felt), but the true test is to see if my acne clears up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well its been a few weeks, and my face is much better than before i started. My pores are smaller and although i still get acne, i have fewer pimples and they a gone much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just started using the Obagi Therapeutic Moisturizer with this Glytone kit and feel its a pretty good combo as the toner and benzoyl peroxide cream can dry my skin out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each part of the kit should last a few months which is good, considering most other acne kits last about 30-45 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin and would not recommend this kit to people with dry skin as it may be to harsh, or maybe use less frequently than the 2 times a day regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im still looking for the acne kit that well clear up my face totally, but its good to know this kit actually does better then others for less.</li>
            <li> After the bar soap I was using (Panoxyl) went off the market, I was reading Amazon reviews of other similar products and decided to try Glytone. This is one of the best products I have EVER purchased. Glad I bought it as a kit. It literally cleared my face up within one week of using it. So thank you to other Amazon reviewers for taking the time to write a review!</li>
            <li> This works very well for acne (the toner is AMAZING!) The face wash is just ok... doesn&#x27;t quite exfoliate the way i&#x27;d like. But yea, def a must for anyone with acne!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have used it for two years now and will not live wirhout it. I works great. It can be somewhat drying but. I use Philosophy&#x27;s oilr free Oxygen moisturizer and I have clear skin. The only time I have a few breakouts is when it is that time of month.</li>
            <li> Works okay, a bit drying even for oily skin. But no acne issues since using.</li>
            <li> I accidentally ordered the wrong kit and it can&#x27;t be returned because it will supposedly burst into flames or something.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with how quickly this 3 piece skin care kit started working on my son&#x27;s acne. Although his acne is not gone, I would estimate a 70% improvement. My only complaint is that it, like other products, involves cleaning, toning, and treatment. There would be a higher percentage of use compliance with teenagers, if there were fewer steps involved. So far, my son says he will continue to use it! Wish us luck!</li>
