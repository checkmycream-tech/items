    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I bought this product because I&#x27;m not the best eyeliner person during the makeup process.</li>
            <li>I used it to perfect my eyeliner or eyeshadow to a cat look</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it with pencil eyeliner, gel eyeliner, as well as liquid eyeliner -- works great with all!</li>
            <li>Best waterproof mascara remover ever !!!!!</li>
            <li>This product was amazing!!</li>
            <li>Very good purchase.</li>
            <li>A very handy tool to keep in your make up for cleaning up eyeliner or mascara smudges upon application or throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Good to change it every 6 months for sanitary reasons.</li>
            <li>and I loved it.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be as good as the Revlon version</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it and loved it</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure that wouldn&#x27;t be good to get in your eye.  </li>
            <li>I received very good and fast service on this order.</li>
            <li>It was very precise to remove the smallest mistake without any residue.</li>
            <li>You had to wipe with tissue and it took more off because the oil spread.</li>
            <li>So glad I checked amazon...</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using q - tips and baby oil instead, works better.</li>
            <li>It also has more liquid that is released when you use it (than Revlon)</li>
            <li>I recently tried this product because I am not the greatest eyeliner person.</li>
            <li>I ended up finding the Almay Makeup Eraser Sticks at a local drug store and they work perfectly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>I had one from Revlon that was much better.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a better brand I bought years ago but can&#x27;t find it now.</li>
            <li>Clean Artiste is very good product for touching up eyeliner mistakes and smudges later in the day.  </li>
            <li>I never seem to have it turned the right way to be effective.</li>
            <li>After using this fantastic pen I can correct very easy and quickly, without damaging the rest of my makeup.</li>
            <li>It is a perfect little touch up for those smudges.</li>
            <li>These little pens are awesome!</li>
            <li>Too &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; and the point was too blunt to accurately remove mascara smudges.  </li>
            <li>I have tried similar products and have not been happy with the results.</li>
            <li>They really are nice to have for mistakes, smudging aside.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to admit, the ease in removing precisely what it is you want to remove with the corrector pen won me over.</li>
            <li>This worked pretty well, but the Revlon brand is better.  </li>
            <li>Clean.</li>
            <li>Clean eye makeup remover</li>
            <li>whoever thought this up was smart as it&#x27;s a make-up product every woman should have....will never go without a correcting pen again as it removes smudges and mascara from under bottom lashes without messing up all your eyemake-up....just love it</li>
            <li>It seemed like I was able to get a much cleaner line with my eyeliner with the Revlon pen.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this because I had a Revlon makeup remover pen for several years and loved it but couldn&#x27;t find it in stores</li>
            <li>Nice to have for extra liner or mascara.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really think it works very good, at least I haven&#x27;t had much success with it</li>
            <li>See my review for the similar Revlon product, and my recommendation of a similar, great product for $1 from E.L.F.</li>
            <li>Like many people, I was a big fan of the now-discontinued Revlon makeup eraser pen.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no longer willing to shell out extortionist money for the discontinued Revlon pens!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li>I had used the Revlon eraser pen for quite some time and was unable to find it this time as it is discontinued, but I came across this on Amazon and thought it was a great deal!</li>
            <li>The pen can be used to remove this--but actual eye makeup remover on a q-tip works so much better</li>
            <li>I used this in the past and it does a good job of removing make up bloopers around the eyes.  </li>
            <li>It also seems like the remover isn&#x27;t as potent as I would have expected, and it really just smudges the liner rather than removing it like the Revlon version.</li>
            <li>The pen does fit nicely in my small makeup bag for emergencies and quick clean-ups!</li>
            <li>I lost my other corrector pen and found this one online seems to be working fine.</li>
            <li>For the first few times, this works excellently to clean up untidy makeup residue and smears.</li>
            <li>and it did not cause irritation or break outs on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Feels a little greasy upon immediate application but that feeling goes away quickly once the product dries</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This pen probably works well for others who don&#x27;t use waterproof makeup and make minor mistakes infrequently, although I find the tip a bit too dry imo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I just received an old, dried out pen, but the tip dried out the first time I tried to use it.</li>
            <li> When the applicator gets dirty, it works poorly and make more of a mess than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> but I found it to be too dry and not very helpful at all.</li>
            <li> Ussually I used Q-tips or wet towels to remove my mistakes, but didn&#x27;t obtain what I needed.</li>
            <li> This product is rough when I run it under my eyes to remove makeup during the day.</li>
            <li> It does work after a couple of tries.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really a fan of the chisel tip despite the fact that I use it to tweak my liquid eyeliner application.</li>
            <li> Will try this and see if I like it as much as my other one..</li>
            <li> like I have with other ones like this.  </li>
            <li> &quot; So I decided to revert back to my amateur moistened Q-tip with one eye and used the L&#x27;Oreal Corrector Pen w/ my other eye.</li>
            <li> They were oily and messy.</li>
            <li> My advice: if this is something that you use everyday, I would opt for the Revlon makeup remover pen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now about a month later, and I was shocked when the entire tip of this pen broke off, down to the plastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if you dot it or swipe it</li>
            <li> it always comes thru for hard to find items.</li>
            <li> It requires a lot of rubbing to remove little mistakes and eventually the tip broke off :(</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s horrible, feels like sandpaper with a little bit of oil.</li>
            <li> Almost impossible to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I so looked forward to using this pen but am somewhat disappointed.</li>

            <li> Works as advertised. A very handy tool to keep in your make up for cleaning up eyeliner or mascara smudges upon application or throughout the day. Feels a little greasy upon immediate application but that feeling goes away quickly once the product dries and it did not cause irritation or break outs on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried similar products and have not been happy with the results. They were oily and messy. You had to wipe with tissue and it took more off because the oil spread. This product was amazing!! It was not oily. It was very precise to remove the smallest mistake without any residue. I would never use anything different.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for anyone that wears mascara.  It is a perfect little touch up for those smudges. And it DOES work well with waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> Like many people, I was a big fan of the now-discontinued Revlon makeup eraser pen.  This L&#x27;Oreal pen does the job well enough, but not quite as well as the Revlon pen.  It seemed like I was able to get a much cleaner line with my eyeliner with the Revlon pen.  But beggars can&#x27;t be choosy--I&#x27;m no longer willing to shell out extortionist money for the discontinued Revlon pens!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  It&#x27;s now about a month later, and I was shocked when the entire tip of this pen broke off, down to the plastic. So it&#x27;s basically unusable.  I won&#x27;t be buying another one.</li>
            <li> I used this in the past and it does a good job of removing make up bloopers around the eyes.  Good to change it every 6 months for sanitary reasons.</li>
            <li> Clean Artiste is very good product for touching up eyeliner mistakes and smudges later in the day.  I&#x27;d buy it again!</li>
            <li> I lost my other corrector pen and found this one online seems to be working fine. Will try this and see if I like it as much as my other one..</li>
            <li> Too &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; and the point was too blunt to accurately remove mascara smudges.  See my review for the similar Revlon product, and my recommendation of a similar, great product for $1 from E.L.F.</li>
            <li> whoever thought this up was smart as it&#x27;s a make-up product every woman should have....will never go without a correcting pen again as it removes smudges and mascara from under bottom lashes without messing up all your eyemake-up....just love it</li>
            <li> These little pens are awesome! I had used the Revlon eraser pen for quite some time and was unable to find it this time as it is discontinued, but I came across this on Amazon and thought it was a great deal! My eyeliner seems to bleed out on the outer corner of my eyes throughout the day, so this product is a lifesaver!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I&#x27;m not the best eyeliner person during the makeup process. Ussually I used Q-tips or wet towels to remove my mistakes, but didn&#x27;t obtain what I needed. After using this fantastic pen I can correct very easy and quickly, without damaging the rest of my makeup. Very good purchase.</li>
            <li> Nice to have for extra liner or mascara. Clean.</li>
            <li> These correctors are God sends. Almost impossible to find in stores. So glad I checked amazon...it always comes thru for hard to find items.</li>
            <li> Works okay but about the same as using a damp cotton swab. It does get up any make-up mistakes but I wouldn&#x27;t say that it always leaves your makeup undisturbed in the process.</li>
            <li> It works!  The only thing is it didn&#x27;t come with directions.  I&#x27;m not sure if you dot it or swipe it</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had the Revlon version and I loved it. I thought it would be as good as the Revlon version but it isn&#x27;t. I used it to perfect my eyeliner or eyeshadow to a cat look but I found it to be too dry and not very helpful at all. I&#x27;ve been using q - tips and baby oil instead, works better. P.S. I also tried the e.l.f pen and it&#x27;s horrible, feels like sandpaper with a little bit of oil.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really think it works very good, at least I haven&#x27;t had much success with it like I have with other ones like this.  I received very good and fast service on this order.</li>
            <li> This worked pretty well, but the Revlon brand is better.  I use it for mistakes with mascara on my upper eyelid and it smears a lot and the Revlon brand didn&#x27;t do that.  It also has more liquid that is released when you use it (than Revlon) and I&#x27;m sure that wouldn&#x27;t be good to get in your eye.  I will go back to Revlon, but if that is ever discontinued, will use this again.  They really are nice to have for mistakes, smudging aside.</li>
            <li> I recently tried this product because I am not the greatest eyeliner person. I&#x27;ve used it with pencil eyeliner, gel eyeliner, as well as liquid eyeliner -- works great with all! Initially I was like, \\&quot;Hmmm how is this any different from a moistened Q-tip?\\&quot; So I decided to revert back to my amateur moistened Q-tip with one eye and used the L&#x27;Oreal Corrector Pen w/ my other eye. I&#x27;ll have to admit, the ease in removing precisely what it is you want to remove with the corrector pen won me over. Plus, the corrector pen doesn&#x27;t cause smudges like Q-tips do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I just received an old, dried out pen, but the tip dried out the first time I tried to use it. I ended up finding the Almay Makeup Eraser Sticks at a local drug store and they work perfectly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  I had one from Revlon that was much better.  Wished I had gotten it instead.  Oh well. Next time</li>
            <li> This pen doesn&#x27;t work well for me because I use waterproof eye makeup. It requires a lot of rubbing to remove little mistakes and eventually the tip broke off :( Ooops. Oh well. This pen probably works well for others who don&#x27;t use waterproof makeup and make minor mistakes infrequently, although I find the tip a bit too dry imo.</li>
            <li> Clean eye makeup remover this is my second one</li>
            <li> This product is rough when I run it under my eyes to remove makeup during the day. It does work after a couple of tries.  Will not buy again. There&#x27;s a better brand I bought years ago but can&#x27;t find it now.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I had a Revlon makeup remover pen for several years and loved it but couldn&#x27;t find it in stores and it was a lot more expensive online. I&#x27;m not really a fan of the chisel tip despite the fact that I use it to tweak my liquid eyeliner application. I never seem to have it turned the right way to be effective. It also seems like the remover isn&#x27;t as potent as I would have expected, and it really just smudges the liner rather than removing it like the Revlon version. My advice: if this is something that you use everyday, I would opt for the Revlon makeup remover pen. I&#x27;ve used it and loved it and once this one runs out, I will be buying it myself.</li>
            <li> For the first few times, this works excellently to clean up untidy makeup residue and smears. When the applicator gets dirty, it works poorly and make more of a mess than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Best waterproof mascara remover ever !!!!!</li>
            <li> I so looked forward to using this pen but am somewhat disappointed. With deep set eyes, my mascara often leaves residue below my eyes (racoon eyes!).  The pen can be used to remove this--but actual eye makeup remover on a q-tip works so much better that I seldom use the Corrector Pen.  The pen does fit nicely in my small makeup bag for emergencies and quick clean-ups!</li>
