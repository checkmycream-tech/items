            <li>Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Excellent seller.</li>
            <li>It is a beautiful object and dresses up the shower.</li>
            <li>Great quality, bristles are perfect firmness, good product.</li>
            <li>just wish the handle was made of a good plastic.</li>
            <li>These are good brushes.  </li>
            <li>It is kind of scratchy and it will get skin good and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this brush every day - love it!</li>
            <li>The wood handle is nice</li>
            <li>The reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is that the handle get pretty slippery with soap on your hande and would benefit greatly by some texturing.</li>
            <li>Love this brush...</li>
            <li>OK.  </li>
            <li>Also be sure and tap the water out of the brush when your bath is over.  </li>
            <li>It&#x60;s ok, nothing too fancy.</li>
            <li>I love the bristles on it</li>
            <li>just ok.  </li>
            <li>This one is better--</li>
            <li>I LOVE this brush.</li>
            <li>--you want a good exfoliation, right?  </li>
            <li>Best dry skin brush made.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for dry brushing skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also a great brush to exfoliate with because the bristles apply just enough pressure to get your skin nice and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It starts off very rough, but softens with age and is then perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Beautifully constructed single piece of hardwood, pleasing to the eye, but most importantly, it works.  </li>
            <li>Bristles feel great washing back and feet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>I have had this brush for a year now and it WILL get you clean, no matter if its grass stuck to your legs, dirt on your arms.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not soft like most of these types of brushes and that&#x27;s why I love it!</li>
            <li>Your skin will get used to it quickly and you will miss it if you stop using it.  </li>
            <li>I had a synthetic brush and the bristles bent over and wore out quickly.  </li>
            <li>Good brush, took a little getting used to on my skin at first, but now it feels much better to brush.</li>
            <li>It is more like wire than natural bristles.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are harder than I thought they would be, but your back gets use to it and feels very good.</li>
            <li>This brush does exactly what it is described as doing.</li>
            <li>I just wore out my first brush when just ONE hole of bristles fell out.</li>
            <li>Has a nice, scruffy feel on my back - not too soft.  </li>
            <li>Even if you don&#x27;t have shower doors, it will last and stay in good shape if you take this simple precaution.  </li>
            <li>This is a decent brush, and if you love firm bristles that wont give in too easy</li>
            <li>Good brush, nice firm bristles, but overall just too short.</li>
            <li>After many purchases looking for a brush that would actually exfoliate/scrub instead of being so soft that bristles just layed sideways against your skin when lightly pressed against, here FINALLY is a brush that will do a brush&#x27;s job!</li>
            <li>Nice stiff bristles, and a hanging loop.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if the handle was longer; it&#x27;s shorter than most of the other brushes I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>So far I really like it!</li>
            <li>Back shower brush ideal for anyone and especially elderly and/or disabled who require assistance reaching hard-to-reach areas.</li>
            <li>It is a little intense at first, but easy to get used to.</li>
            <li>Yes, the bristles are stiff, but only stiff enough to give a good scrubbing, and the bristles on my brush are still just as good as when it was new.  </li>
            <li>My skin does feel smoother and I think my cellulite does look a little better.</li>
            <li>Every other shower brush I&#x27;ve used is great as long as it stays dry.</li>
            <li>After all this time the back is starting to warp a little (it is made of wood, and the varnish or whatever that helps protect it has worn away), so I bought a couple more to last me for another good long time.  </li>
            <li>It was packaged brand new.</li>
            <li>This back brush is great - as long as you like stiff bristles.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice stiff brush which I use on my back.  </li>
            <li>This is my second one since after about a year, the first one started to mildew.</li>
            <li>The wood is actually quite pretty.</li>
            <li>mentioned, I use the brush daily, wetting it, applying a good amount of body wash to it, scrubbing down, then rinsing the brush thoroughly before hanging it up to dry.  </li>
            <li>My product arrived early.</li>
            <li>With this scrubber, the power is back in your hands as to how much light or heavy &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; you want to do.</li>
            <li>The handle isn&#x27;t super long, as someone mentioned, but it&#x27;s long enough to do the job.  </li>
            <li>These are natural Tampico bristles, the real thing and they will get dark with mildew if you keep it inside the tub area.  </li>
            <li>Treat it properly (keep it clean and let it dry), and it should last you as long as mine has lasted me.  </li>
            <li>It is very scratchy even after the bristles are wet.</li>
            <li>and it was ok, not great</li>
            <li>Those soft brushes just don&#x27;t do when trying to rub out the sweat from a long day of hiking or biking.</li>
            <li>Soft bristles and a knot to hang brush up in shower to drip dry.</li>
            <li>And yes, the wood and bristles will discolor near where the bristles are affixed to the wood, probably because it takes longer to dry there.  </li>
            <li>the bristles are stiffer and the handle is longer, so you can reach your whole back with less effort.</li>

            <li> The stiff bristles on this brush work wonders after a long day at work and were exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The handle is long enough to get my back but not so long that it gets in my way.</li>
            <li> Not only has dry brushing done wonders for my skin</li>
            <li> It stands up to repeated use and doesn&#x27;t go soft after a few uses</li>
            <li> It seems like the glue they use to hold the different pieces of wood together isn&#x27;t designed to be used in wet conditions.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller than I thought and the bristles are ROUGH!  </li>
            <li> Purchased this and one other body brush by the same brand that was shorter with an opposing massage surface.</li>
            <li> I use it to dry brush my skin.</li>
            <li> The dry brushing is suppose to increase circulation and help decrease cellulite.</li>
            <li> i dry brush 5-10 minutes every morning before showering.</li>
            <li> Tired of those brushes that flatten right out as soon as get wet and just swirl the soap around?</li>
            <li> I tried to find this item in several stores with no success.</li>
            <li> The product description says for dry brushing but the pamphlet that comes with it says it can be used for both dry and wet.</li>
            <li> A very stiff brush, will take some getting used to for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The bristles are a little stiffer than I would prefer, but that&#x27;s a personal preference.</li>
            <li> My kids won&#x27;t use it, too rough for their city skins.</li>
            <li> Way too stiff for daily use.</li>
            <li> This brush is stiff, dries well (no mold for me), I dry it hanging from its string in the handle in a dry spot in the tub, no lost bristles.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Put it on a hook outside of the tub, like a shower curtain hook on the dry side at least.  </li>
            <li> This back scrubber is made to be used in a shower, but just after a few months the wood on it is turning black from mold.</li>
            <li> This is a total failure and cannot be recommended.</li>
            <li> until its wet then forget holding it, it is beyond slick.</li>
            <li> I hung in the shower before using, my wife got it wet for the first time and the smell was so bad she threw it out.  </li>
            <li> To make matter worse, dark mold started growing between the bristles after a couple weeks - haven&#x27;t had a back brush</li>
            <li> We like the structure of the brush and the stiffness of the bristles, but it develops mold at the base of the bristles very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Seeing how I want to scrub my back in the shower, it is difficult to keep it dry.</li>
            <li> I got it out of the garbage and soaked it in soapy water a few times.  </li>
            <li> Yes, this is the one with the firm bristles that lasts (if you take care of it).  </li>
            <li> This bristles on this brush are extremely stiff.  </li>
            <li> A little too hard.</li>
            <li> Tried it today and the bristles are really stiff and the brush seems to be made well but not very pleasant to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , sorry, I do not recall the date I bought it) and use it daily .  </li>
            <li> This brush is very stiff and hard.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use bar soap, as that leaves residue (i.e. soap scum), whereas the detergent based body washes do not (that I have noticed).</li>
            <li> At least it hasn&#x27;t broken (yet),,,&lt;br</li>
            <li> This thing is quite painful to use.  </li>

            <li> This is a nice stiff brush which I use on my back.  It starts off very rough, but softens with age and is then perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I hung in the shower before using, my wife got it wet for the first time and the smell was so bad she threw it out.  I got it out of the garbage and soaked it in soapy water a few times.  The smell is now gone and my wife lets me hang it in the shower but refuses to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Handle is about two inches too short.  Bristles feel great washing back and feet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller than I thought and the bristles are ROUGH!  Ouch!</li>
            <li> Good brush, took a little getting used to on my skin at first, but now it feels much better to brush.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my boyfriend, but I stole it back. The bristles are harder than I thought they would be, but your back gets use to it and feels very good.</li>
            <li> Has a nice, scruffy feel on my back - not too soft.  I tap out the excess water after a shower as someone recommended so the brush doesn&#x27;t get mildewed.  The handle isn&#x27;t super long, as someone mentioned, but it&#x27;s long enough to do the job.  So far I really like it!</li>
            <li> Love this brush... It&#x27;s not soft like most of these types of brushes and that&#x27;s why I love it!</li>
            <li> This brush is very stiff and hard. Even after soaking it for 5 minutes it is still to coarse to use on my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this brush every day - love it!</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Nice stiff bristles, and a hanging loop.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of use, I thought the brissles might soften, but no chance.  This thing is quite painful to use.  At least it hasn&#x27;t broken (yet),,,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid.</li>
            <li> This back brush is great - as long as you like stiff bristles.  I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if the handle was longer; it&#x27;s shorter than most of the other brushes I&#x27;ve owned.  But if you have been looking for a back brush that doesn&#x27;t have flimsy bristles, this is it.  This is my second one since after about a year, the first one started to mildew.</li>
            <li> Good brush, nice firm bristles, but overall just too short.</li>
            <li> Back shower brush ideal for anyone and especially elderly and/or disabled who require assistance reaching hard-to-reach areas. Soft bristles and a knot to hang brush up in shower to drip dry.</li>
            <li> After many purchases looking for a brush that would actually exfoliate/scrub instead of being so soft that bristles just layed sideways against your skin when lightly pressed against, here FINALLY is a brush that will do a brush&#x27;s job! With this scrubber, the power is back in your hands as to how much light or heavy &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; you want to do.</li>
            <li> Best dry skin brush made. It stands up to repeated use and doesn&#x27;t go soft after a few uses</li>
            <li> OK.  The handle is too short for a guy 6&#x27;1&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is a decent brush, and if you love firm bristles that wont give in too easy then this is the brush for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is well made and quite sturdy for it&#x27;s size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a great brush to exfoliate with because the bristles apply just enough pressure to get your skin nice and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only  giving it 4-stars because I wish it was about 2-inches longer.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for dry brushing skin.  The handle is long enough to get my back but not so long that it gets in my way.</li>
            <li> This bristles on this brush are extremely stiff.  It hurts to use, even with the slightest pressure.  To make matter worse, dark mold started growing between the bristles after a couple weeks - haven&#x27;t had a back brush do that before.  This is a total failure and cannot be recommended.</li>
            <li> Yes, this is the one with the firm bristles that lasts (if you take care of it).  Two points:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Your skin will get used to it quickly and you will miss it if you stop using it.  It is kind of scratchy and it will get skin good and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Do not store it inside a shower enclosure.  Put it on a hook outside of the tub, like a shower curtain hook on the dry side at least.  Also be sure and tap the water out of the brush when your bath is over.  These are natural Tampico bristles, the real thing and they will get dark with mildew if you keep it inside the tub area.  Even if you don&#x27;t have shower doors, it will last and stay in good shape if you take this simple precaution.  It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> It&#x60;s ok, nothing too fancy. A little too hard.</li>
            <li> This brush does exactly what it is described as doing. Yes, the bristles are &amp;#34;not soft&amp;#34;, but that&#x27;s not why you buy something like this--you want a good exfoliation, right?  This brush does that!  Beautifully constructed single piece of hardwood, pleasing to the eye, but most importantly, it works.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This back scrubber is made to be used in a shower, but just after a few months the wood on it is turning black from mold. I love the bristles on it just wish the handle was made of a good plastic.</li>
            <li> The bristles are a little stiffer than I would prefer, but that&#x27;s a personal preference.It is a beautiful object and dresses up the shower. The reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is that the handle get pretty slippery with soap on your hande and would benefit greatly by some texturing.</li>
            <li> I thought the handled and the brush were a bit smaller than pictured.  The brush and handle I was using was about 30% larger.</li>
            <li> Great quality, bristles are perfect firmness, good product.</li>
            <li> These are good brushes.  I&#x27;ve had one for several years (it has to be close to five years now, sorry, I do not recall the date I bought it) and use it daily .  After all this time the back is starting to warp a little (it is made of wood, and the varnish or whatever that helps protect it has worn away), so I bought a couple more to last me for another good long time.  Yes, the bristles are stiff, but only stiff enough to give a good scrubbing, and the bristles on my brush are still just as good as when it was new.  And yes, the wood and bristles will discolor near where the bristles are affixed to the wood, probably because it takes longer to dry there.  The discoloration does not bother me, and I have looked to see if there is mildew or something growing there and there is none.  And the fact that it is not made from synthetics appeals to me.  I had a synthetic brush and the bristles bent over and wore out quickly.  This brush has lasted admirably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned, I use the brush daily, wetting it, applying a good amount of body wash to it, scrubbing down, then rinsing the brush thoroughly before hanging it up to dry.  Treat it properly (keep it clean and let it dry), and it should last you as long as mine has lasted me.  I don&#x27;t use bar soap, as that leaves residue (i.e. soap scum), whereas the detergent based body washes do not (that I have noticed).</li>
            <li> I used the brush once and it was ok, not great just ok.  Then the second time I tried to use it the bristles started falling out.  I looked at the brush and the wood strips were splitting apart.  It seems like the glue they use to hold the different pieces of wood together isn&#x27;t designed to be used in wet conditions.</li>
            <li> I use this brush so I can reach my back.  Not only has dry brushing done wonders for my skin but now, when my back itches, I can scratch it!</li>
            <li> Tried it today and the bristles are really stiff and the brush seems to be made well but not very pleasant to use.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping these bristles soften up a bit as I&#x27;m not into pain!</li>
            <li> Tired of those brushes that flatten right out as soon as get wet and just swirl the soap around? Look no more!&lt;br /&gt;  I have had this brush for a year now and it WILL get you clean, no matter if its grass stuck to your legs, dirt on your arms. My kids won&#x27;t use it, too rough for their city skins. This brush is stiff, dries well (no mold for me), I dry it hanging from its string in the handle in a dry spot in the tub, no lost bristles.&lt;br /&gt;  Finally, a man&#x27;s brush!&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Years later... I just wore out my first brush when just ONE hole of bristles fell out. 5 years on one brush! The product description says for dry brushing but the pamphlet that comes with it says it can be used for both dry and wet. I have a spare but I want another one to back up.</li>
            <li> Purchased this and one other body brush by the same brand that was shorter with an opposing massage surface. This one is better-- the bristles are stiffer and the handle is longer, so you can reach your whole back with less effort. The wood is actually quite pretty.</li>
            <li> Every other shower brush I&#x27;ve used is great as long as it stays dry. Seeing how I want to scrub my back in the shower, it is difficult to keep it dry. Not this brush! It is very scratchy even after the bristles are wet. It is a little intense at first, but easy to get used to. I LOVE this brush.</li>
            <li> The stiff bristles on this brush work wonders after a long day at work and were exactly what I was looking for. Those soft brushes just don&#x27;t do when trying to rub out the sweat from a long day of hiking or biking.</li>
            <li> Might work if you are looking to exfoliate steel-wool style. But I couldn&#x27;t take it. Way too stiff for daily use.</li>
            <li> Well made, doesn&#x27;t shed bristles. A very stiff brush, will take some getting used to for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like anything about this brush.  It is more like wire than natural bristles.  The wood handle is nice until its wet then forget holding it, it is beyond slick. No I would not buy this brush again.</li>
            <li> Excellent seller. My product arrived early. I tried to find this item in several stores with no success. It was packaged brand new. I use it to dry brush my skin. The dry brushing is suppose to increase circulation and help decrease cellulite. i dry brush 5-10 minutes every morning before showering. I actually like. My skin does feel smoother and I think my cellulite does look a little better. Will purchase another brush for a back-up and one for my brother.</li>
            <li> We like the structure of the brush and the stiffness of the bristles, but it develops mold at the base of the bristles very quickly.  We shake it and tap it to get the water off after use, but it grows mold nonetheless.  Sigh . . . .</li>
