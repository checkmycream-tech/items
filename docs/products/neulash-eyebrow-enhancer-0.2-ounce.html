            <li>Amazing product for face, thoroughly recommended, long and bushy eyebrows for a better look and presentation, excellent product neulash neubrow.</li>
            <li>I actually like Neulash (for lashes) better for a great product, but this is good as well.</li>

            <li>Thank you soo much!!</li>
            <li>The only NEU brow growth I&#x27;ve experienced is the NEW brow growth we tend to get over time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;it&#x27;s exactly as effective or you will be hearing back from me!</li>
            <li>I have tried other products over the years without success, but was very pleased with Neubrow.</li>
            <li>Nothing new &amp; exciting going on with my BROWS!  </li>
            <li>Ok ... So this was a last resort</li>
            <li>For the first time in many years I can actually go without eyebrow pencil and not be embarrassed  </li>
            <li>I purchased my first serum from Neiman Marcus</li>
            <li>You must use the product twice a day at first.</li>
            <li>For years, I have had one nice eyebrow and one barely there with areas that just wouldn&#x27;t grow from over-plucking in my younger years.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This product did absolutely nothing for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>and neuBrow about 4-5 weeks ago, and both have worked very well for me.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much for a while</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>Yes, the products are expensive, but with such great results, I don&#x27;t mind!  </li>
            <li>I used the cheaper brand for a few months but, not only did it not work, I lost the good results I got from neuLash.  </li>
            <li>While the reviews leaned more towards favorable results; I can&#x27;t support those claims - as mine was TOTALLY the opposite.  </li>
            <li>so I had them tinted and all I can say is WOW!!</li>
            <li>I will definitely stick with neuLash since it&#x27;s worth the price in terms of the results it gives.  </li>
            <li>and it actually worked very well.  </li>
            <li>By the 3rd week, signs of some growth; however can&#x27;t really attribute that fully to the product because that&#x27;s about how long it takes my brows to grow; REALLY!  </li>
            <li>Hey, maybe I didn&#x27;t hold the applicator brush straight enough; who</li>
            <li>It takes quite a while--at least a month or more to start working--so don&#x27;t give up prematurely.</li>
            <li>I got great results from the first but because of the price decided to try a less expensive brand which has the same ingredient responsible for stimulating brow growth.  </li>
            <li>But the eyebrows really do fill in again and darken a bit as well, so long as you keep using it 2x per day.</li>
            <li>Yes you have to continue to use long term but for the first three months i used twice daily</li>
            <li>I barely need eye brow pencil now.  </li>
            <li>After the first 3 months I went down to once a day</li>
            <li>I had very thin brows due to over-plucking, along with a few areas that were somewhat bare, and they have all filled in nicely.  </li>
            <li>her eyebrows barely came back.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and it is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Although the price was GREAT in comparison to others, regrettably I say that&#x27;s the ONLY positive that I can give; very disappointed with the results, how about NONE!  </li>

            <li> Ok ... So this was a last resort and I was really skeptical.  For years, I have had one nice eyebrow and one barely there with areas that just wouldn&#x27;t grow from over-plucking in my younger years. I couldn&#x27;t go anywhere without eyebrow pencil ... including the beach ... and my esthetician had suggested tattooing to fill it in.  I figured I had nothing to lose by trying neuBrow so why not give it a last ditch effort.  I was shocked and amazed, as was my esthetician ... it worked!  My eyebrow filled in so beautifully, that it is now thicker than the one that was fine.  This is my second bottle and I am now using it every few days.  For the first time in many years I can actually go without eyebrow pencil and not be embarrassed  A little goes a long way and it is worth every penny.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing for my eyebrows. I followed the instructions precisely. I&#x27;m super disappointed considering how much I spent.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first serum from Neiman Marcus and it actually worked very well.  The serum I purchased on line did not preform the same... or at all....I don&#x27;t believe it is the same serum. I will purchase the serum again but from Neiman&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really good for having longer, darker thicker eyebrows.  I actually like Neulash (for lashes) better for a great product, but this is good as well.</li>
            <li> I started using neuLash and neuBrow about 4-5 weeks ago, and both have worked very well for me.  Yes, the products are expensive, but with such great results, I don&#x27;t mind!  I had very thin brows due to over-plucking, along with a few areas that were somewhat bare, and they have all filled in nicely.  Be warned: you have to be patient.  I didn&#x27;t see much for a while and then they noticeably started to grow.  My lashes have gotten much better.  I&#x27;m very happy with the results for both these products, and I recommend trying them if you have thinning brows/lashes.  Both products are easy to use.  I plan to keep using them indefinitely.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but, after four weeks, my brows are thicker and longer.  I barely need eye brow pencil now.  It is amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second tube of neuLash  Brow Enhancing Serum.  I got great results from the first but because of the price decided to try a less expensive brand which has the same ingredient responsible for stimulating brow growth.  I used the cheaper brand for a few months but, not only did it not work, I lost the good results I got from neuLash.  I will definitely stick with neuLash since it&#x27;s worth the price in terms of the results it gives.  Also it takes ages to finish the tube with 2x a day application.</li>
            <li> Amazing product for face, thoroughly recommended, long and bushy eyebrows for a better look and presentation, excellent product neulash neubrow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper than Neiman&#x27;s and I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but I&#x27;m assuming&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s exactly as effective or you will be hearing back from me!</li>
            <li> Product very successful for encouraging the brows to grow, slowly.  I do want to see the long term results, but so far very good.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom, after going through several rounds of chemo her eyebrows barely came back. I tried this on whim when it was on sale from Groupon. It might be expensive but it works! Her eyebrows returned fuller then they had ever been. I would recommend this to anyone. The only downside is you must continue to use it, but once they grow back you don&#x27;t have to use it everyday. She uses it every 3 days and they have still remained just as full. Thank you for making an amazing product that helps my mom feel beautiful again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I hoped, my eyebrows do seem a tad longer but not thicker - not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Cannot believe how my eyelashes are proliferating!  Am tempted to use it on my scalp!</li>
            <li> best eyebrow serum I have tried hands down- over anythinh at sephora or librow or other online/foreign brands- my eyebrows look great</li>
            <li> It came super fast, great price &amp; wonderful product. It works great!!! I feel better about my eyebrows now!! I accidentally tweezed a little too munch one time a few years ago and it never grew back and this stuff has definitely helped!! Thank you soo much!!</li>
            <li> I used this and it produced fairly good results. It didn&#x27;t fill in my missing brow area from a childhood accident, but helped the other hairs grow. I thought it was fine until I read you have to keep using it in order to keep the results. Too expensive for that! So I did some research and the active ingredient in this stuff is used because it produces the same effect as minoxidil. PROBLEM SOLVED! go buy some topical 2% minoxidil for eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Although the price was GREAT in comparison to others, regrettably I say that&#x27;s the ONLY positive that I can give; very disappointed with the results, how about NONE!  The only NEU brow growth I&#x27;ve experienced is the NEW brow growth we tend to get over time.  Nothing new &amp; exciting going on with my BROWS!  While the reviews leaned more towards favorable results; I can&#x27;t support those claims - as mine was TOTALLY the opposite.  Used the product as instructed with NO results in the 1st OR 2nd week.  By the 3rd week, signs of some growth; however can&#x27;t really attribute that fully to the product because that&#x27;s about how long it takes my brows to grow; REALLY!  I&#x27;m beginning to understand the adage &amp;#34;With  Age Sometimes Comes Wisdom&amp;#34;  and the wisdom here (for me that is) would simply be:  STOP searching for PRODUCTS to do or give to you what truly ONLY Mother Nature can.  If she didn&#x27;t bless us with it - ACCEPT it!  Live with what I don&#x27;t have &amp; save myself a little $$$ in the process.  And because of MY long, long quest for what I consider to be the ultimate brows (full &amp; thick) I feel confident in writing if you ain&#x27;t gotta um DO NOT; I repeat DO NOT look to this product to give um to ya! Buyer BEWARE; buy at YOUR OWN RISK is all I&#x27;m sayin!  And this is truly MY opinion based off of MY results solely!  Hey, maybe I didn&#x27;t hold the applicator brush straight enough; who knows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;): STILL SPARSE BUT ACCEPTING IT!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Yes you have to continue to use long term but for the first three months i used twice daily and I had people comment on my brows and I had not told anyone I was using in case it did not work.  After the first 3 months I went down to once a day and now I use once a day in the evening 4 times a week and they still look great.  I have a lot of grey in my brows so I had them tinted and all I can say is WOW!!</li>
            <li> It takes quite a while--at least a month or more to start working--so don&#x27;t give up prematurely. But the eyebrows really do fill in again and darken a bit as well, so long as you keep using it 2x per day. And not very much product is needed at each application. I have tried other products over the years without success, but was very pleased with Neubrow.</li>
            <li> Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I am 61 years young and had only 2 small patches of hair over each brow.  After 4 weeks both brows started to filled in nicely with healthy hair.  Thank you neuBrow Lab-Rats!!!  Your product is wonderful.</li>
            <li> After chemo therapy treatments, my eyebrows returned, but they were extremely sparse.&lt;br /&gt;Someone recommended this product, I ordered it, and after a few days, I am seeing new growth!&lt;br /&gt;I already ordered another tube!</li>
            <li> I began to lose my eyebrows due to over plucking in my youth. I heard about this product from my hair stylist. It really works. I now have fuller, thicker, darker eyebrows where there were NONE! You must use the product twice a day at first. Once the hair starts to grow, you can back off to even three times a week. I love this product.</li>
            <li> This was a complete waste of money.  There has been no sign of any sort of eyebrow growth.  If I could have, I would have given this product 0 stars.  It feels like the company is preying on women who have lost their eyebrows due to age or to chemotherapy and are desperate for some sort of fix.  Very disappointing!</li>
