            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE the repairing treatment!  </li>
            <li>It truly is a magical product!</li>
            <li>i still cannot stop using it because it is so effective...</li>
            <li>Kind of made me wonder about the seller and its source.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that I can purchase this product on it&#x27;s own and NOT in the kit.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin flawless and actually feels good when I put it on.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and it is nice to be able to order the different products you need at a good price!  </li>
            <li>Best acne treatment, so far.</li>
            <li>The Proactiv system as a whole is very good, so if you can, make sure to use all three.  </li>
            <li>Very smooth feeling.</li>
            <li>I give this 4 stars because it is a great deal for 4 oz, and I love the way the mico BP feels smooth and penetrates quickly.</li>
            <li>Since I know better, I&#x27;ll try another seller.  </li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You need to make sure to use it DAY and NIGHT.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>Although it does work, I wonder if it&#x27;s ok to use considering what it had done to my sheets.</li>
            <li>I love the product.  </li>
            <li>Thank you!  :)</li>
            <li>do not use this in the morning since your skin gets brown spots and you will not be able to get rid of the brown sun spots forever.</li>
            <li>I suspect you will not be able to make something like this without a chemical smell.</li>
            <li>Its ok til it started to burn and irritate my face</li>
            <li>LOVE it.</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for 3 days and my skin already looks better.</li>
            <li>I tried the Proactiv + system and it worked better for me</li>
            <li>:) I would surely reccomend it to a friend..</li>
            <li>I do find it works better in conjunction with the face wash...</li>
            <li>I began getting acne at the age of 30 mostly around my cheeks and chin.</li>
            <li>and between mary kay and proactiv, I do not have a wrinkle.ya gotta love it.</li>
            <li>The quality of product was ok.</li>
            <li>I Love Amazon</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product, it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li>Love this product and will continue to buy it from amazon.</li>
            <li>Better than at the maker&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li>love it love it</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love how it make my face feel</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it does keep acne under control and does manage to control it as good as only getting maybe one whitehead once in a while, which is good.</li>
            <li>my experience over many years of trying and stopping other products, this is the best I&#x27;ve found for preventing acne, and I prefer to prevent it rather than wait for blemishes and spot treat them.</li>
            <li>Proactiv works great, but buying directly through them is a scam.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over 15 years, good and real product.</li>
            <li>Great product, super fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>I use it every night and not with any of the other practiv products and it is perfect as it clears my skin while I sleep!</li>
            <li>You do not need to buy the other proactiv products because this one alone works great!</li>
            <li>At the mall they easily cost triple the price.</li>
            <li>- I strongly recommend to anyone who has blemish problems or oily skin.</li>
            <li>than that, proactive is a fine product.</li>
            <li>I love that I can buy it on Amazon and with prime, get it quickly once she runs out.</li>
            <li>Proactive makes great products; their facewash and repair lotion especially.  </li>
            <li>I use it under make-up and just use a light powder.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my teenage grandson who is having great issues with acne.  </li>
            <li>the face while my neck and body was light skinned.</li>
            <li>I use the oil free moisturizer from proactiv.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying this product for my son for several years now, product works great</li>
            <li>I have been using the Proactiv system for years and it does a fair job of keeping my skin clear.  </li>
            <li>I am so thankful for this amazing product and feel that my skin will be normal soon thanks to Proavtive!!!</li>
            <li>I keep my face clean</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find anything that special about it.</li>
            <li>its good enough.  </li>
            <li>So glad we didn&#x27;t have to purchase the whole kit just to get step 3.</li>
            <li>The system worked but the true star of the system was this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it at 9.95 which is a much more reasonable.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it really clears up my skin, I use it under makeup and each night and morning.</li>
            <li>Might be better for the face but definitely wash hands after using and before touching fabric.</li>
            <li>You sent me 2 bottles expired in October , I can&#x27; t not use that quick...</li>
            <li>If you do, I guess, count yourself lucky.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, this product arrived quickly and reliably from this seller.</li>
            <li>Overall I have used Proactive for many years and like the product, but I cannot give this more stars because it arrived in september (on time)</li>
            <li>This step is good for broken skin areas, repairing zits, or smoothing over the T-zone or just your nose after a good exfoliation.</li>
            <li>strongly recomended,  it is very strong and mild at the same time</li>
            <li>It seems to calm redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Currently using the Oil Cleanse Method and its working amazingly.</li>
            <li>Mr pimples are rare now.</li>
            <li>but you can&#x27;t expect it to work when you rarely apply it.  </li>
            <li>I think it is still worth a try for those with acne.</li>
            <li>it is worth every Penney</li>
            <li>for this price this was well worth it though I wish they carry the 4 oz</li>
            <li>the Olay Professional ProX Facial Cleansing Brush really makes a huge difference, and SKIN79&#x27;s BB cream really seems to make my skin happy.</li>
            <li>The only problem with this product is that if you put it on your neck, it can very easily stain the neckline on your clothes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using proactiv for over 10 years, and it usually works great.</li>
            <li>and it keeps my breakouts from becoming a frequent visitor.  </li>
            <li>Super fast.</li>
            <li>I was a fair skinned person n ended up black n</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really bad, but I am super sensitive to smells, so I don&#x27;t think I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li>On-line statements clearly state that proactiv causes wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
            <li>It works really really well!</li>
            <li>But if it&#x27;s too expensive, I would say that the Repairing Treatment is the best product of the three if you&#x27;re planning on just buying one.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>You will save yourself time and a whole lot of money buying it on Amazon!</li>
            <li>so no bacteria spreads, and put this on, within a day or two, at most, any potential zit is gone!  </li>
            <li>It definitely did, making my complexion a lot more manageable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did more damage than actual healing...</li>
            <li>My entire family uses proactive and we all love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>The product obviously works great, its just not worth buying it through proactiv.com.</li>
            <li>and I can certainly state</li>
            <li>This product is now priced very high at $14.95.  </li>
            <li>On it&#x27;s own it has little or no smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that Proactiv plays a large, but certainly not singlehanded, part in the recipe.</li>
            <li>Its over priced and very drying.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable on this product which is a plus.</li>
            <li>Thanks a bunch.</li>
            <li>I used the whole range of the proactive line n was getting results after three months.  </li>
            <li>Its the real thing</li>
            <li>this product really gets into the pimples a reduce them after some hrs.  </li>
            <li>Need time to really give an opinion on this product</li>
            <li>I like to buy the cleanser and repairing lotion off Amazon because of the reasonable prices.  </li>
            <li>it really works, but you need to purchase the whole kit</li>
            <li>really really works</li>
            <li>Used this years ago and had forgotten I really did like it.  </li>
            <li>I buy replacement  products through Amazon because Proactiv wants to put me on an auto-ship schedule</li>
            <li>It really worked for me.</li>
            <li>I have extremely oily skin and although it doesn&#x27;t do much in the way of controlling it, I am still satisfied in it&#x27;s ability to control my acne.  </li>
            <li>I switched to other methods and got much better results.</li>
            <li>If you use the mask and scrub daily, your face will be come very sensitive to light, wind, and temperature.</li>
            <li>As long as the prices stay cheap like this I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li>I did not see much effect after a few weeks of use, but the overall quality of Proactiv products are good.</li>
            <li>Glad I don&#x27;t have to go hunt down a kiosk now</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this lotion!</li>
            <li>if you want something to help combat acne but not break your bank on here - go for step one and find a decent toner to go with that fits your face.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that is acne prone to certain foods.  </li>
            <li>So thankful to finally find something that really works!!</li>
            <li>Anyways, my friend introduced me to this little magic bottle and</li>
            <li>However, it didn&#x27;t help much to control my adult acne.</li>
            <li>At 50 some years old I really did not think zits would be a problem</li>
            <li>I am nearly 50 and have had skin troubles my whole life.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist has encouraged me to continue this product and prescribed an antibiotic topical gel for the rare pimples I now get.</li>
            <li>only drawback is that this product does bleach fabrics, whether it be pillowcases, towels or clothing, but I&#x27;ve become so used to managing that (with using only white pillowcases and towels, and I even bring my own when I&#x27;m going to someone&#x27;s house</li>
            <li>I liked this because no sooner then i used it within a few days i could see a difference!!</li>
            <li>so you know it&#x27;s new.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>Nothing else works for me - and I am almost 50 years old!  </li>
            <li>Another minor thing- the print of the bottle started coming off right away.</li>
            <li>I notice that when i forget to use it I will break out, but my skin goes back to normal once I start up again!!</li>
            <li>And when I do have a breakout it is a minimal amount and goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>If your acne is in more than one location, you should be smearing this on your whole face under a moisturizer at least once a day to stop current break outs and prevent new ones.  </li>
            <li>If a blemish does start to appear, I just dab a little extra on that spot without rubbing it in all the way and most of the time it stops it from getting any bigger.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using for some time now and it does help clear my face.</li>
            <li>Proactiv does what its supposed to, clear ur spots.</li>
            <li>Keeps my face clear with continuous use.</li>
            <li>Been using it for years and my face is really clear.</li>
            <li>Between Proactiv, Olay and SKIN79, my skin stays clear the majority of the time--</li>
            <li>even though i am a mary kay consultant, i still have to rely on the proactiv to keep my face clear.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest however, if you are prone to acne on your neck, use on your neck at NIGHT, with an old shirt.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone experiencing adult acne.</li>
            <li>prescription stuff didn&#x27;t work, this does and didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It smells like old lady perfume to me,</li>
            <li>So now I smell like an old lady when I roll into bed.</li>
            <li>The ad really shows mostly white people on it</li>
            <li>Either way, the only product that has really worked for me has been proactiv.</li>
            <li>No dried peeling skin either.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the whole line of wash, toner and lotion since I found it too drying overall.  </li>
            <li>The benefits of the product by far outweigh that for me.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>i use the complete proactiv system.  </li>
            <li>Completely dislike.</li>
            <li>I first noticed Proactiv infomercials as long ago as 1997.  </li>
            <li>After discovering that the repair lotion was the product that actually kept my acne under control, I stopped buying the whole package and just bought the repair lotion by itself.  </li>
            <li>It might be more expensive but it is DEFINITELY worth it.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this products or any part of it for black people or people of color who live n very hot climate.</li>
            <li>the 3rd step is nothing but benzol peroxide pretty much and doesn&#x27;t do much of anything for black heads or pimples that haven&#x27;t been &amp;#34;popped&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I was using the whole Proactive 3 step program for a while, but when my dermatologist told me that the repairing treatment is all I really need from the line, I stopped using their other products and stuck to this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I got a bum bottle (I checked the expiration date and that was fine), but it went in the trash.</li>
            <li>Only negative is that I thought it would be a lot more.</li>
            <li>There were major improvements to his skin within two weeks.</li>
            <li>Clears up the skin really really well and takes away redness and bumps and helps preveant new break outs and black heads</li>
            <li>This is the only product that keeps my skin clear of pimples.</li>
            <li>He has reported and I have seen that this product is definitely working to clear up is acne.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product that keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li>I am a 47 yr old woman who still has occasional acne breakouts.  </li>
            <li>Use caution and only put it directly on the pimple with a Q-tip..</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and minimal breakouts but since appying this in the morning and when I go to bed after washing my face, I haven&#x27;t had one breakout.</li>
            <li>A little drying at first and</li>
            <li>We use the Repairing lotion only on trouble areas every morning, for me, or night, for my wife, (right after the shower).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that ordering this through Amazon is much easier...and less expensive...than paying for shipping just to get 1 extra bottle.</li>

            <li> I LOVE the repairing treatment!  </li>
            <li> It truly is a magical product!</li>
            <li> i still cannot stop using it because it is so effective...</li>
            <li> Kind of made me wonder about the seller and its source.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that I can purchase this product on it&#x27;s own and NOT in the kit.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin flawless and actually feels good when I put it on.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and it is nice to be able to order the different products you need at a good price!  </li>
            <li> Best acne treatment, so far.</li>
            <li> The Proactiv system as a whole is very good, so if you can, make sure to use all three.  </li>
            <li> Very smooth feeling.</li>
            <li> I give this 4 stars because it is a great deal for 4 oz, and I love the way the mico BP feels smooth and penetrates quickly.</li>
            <li> Since I know better, I&#x27;ll try another seller.  </li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You need to make sure to use it DAY and NIGHT.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Although it does work, I wonder if it&#x27;s ok to use considering what it had done to my sheets.</li>
            <li> I love the product.  </li>
            <li> Thank you!  :)</li>
            <li> do not use this in the morning since your skin gets brown spots and you will not be able to get rid of the brown sun spots forever.</li>
            <li> I suspect you will not be able to make something like this without a chemical smell.</li>
            <li> Its ok til it started to burn and irritate my face</li>
            <li> LOVE it.</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for 3 days and my skin already looks better.</li>
            <li> I tried the Proactiv + system and it worked better for me</li>
            <li> :) I would surely reccomend it to a friend..</li>
            <li> I do find it works better in conjunction with the face wash...</li>
            <li> I began getting acne at the age of 30 mostly around my cheeks and chin.</li>
            <li> and between mary kay and proactiv, I do not have a wrinkle.ya gotta love it.</li>
            <li> The quality of product was ok.</li>
            <li> I Love Amazon</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product, it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> Love this product and will continue to buy it from amazon.</li>
            <li> Better than at the maker&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li> love it love it</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love how it make my face feel</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it does keep acne under control and does manage to control it as good as only getting maybe one whitehead once in a while, which is good.</li>
            <li> my experience over many years of trying and stopping other products, this is the best I&#x27;ve found for preventing acne, and I prefer to prevent it rather than wait for blemishes and spot treat them.</li>
            <li> Proactiv works great, but buying directly through them is a scam.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 15 years, good and real product.</li>
            <li> Great product, super fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> I use it every night and not with any of the other practiv products and it is perfect as it clears my skin while I sleep!</li>
            <li> You do not need to buy the other proactiv products because this one alone works great!</li>
            <li> At the mall they easily cost triple the price.</li>
            <li> - I strongly recommend to anyone who has blemish problems or oily skin.</li>
            <li> than that, proactive is a fine product.</li>
            <li> I love that I can buy it on Amazon and with prime, get it quickly once she runs out.</li>
            <li> Proactive makes great products; their facewash and repair lotion especially.  </li>
            <li> I use it under make-up and just use a light powder.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my teenage grandson who is having great issues with acne.  </li>
            <li> the face while my neck and body was light skinned.</li>
            <li> I use the oil free moisturizer from proactiv.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for my son for several years now, product works great</li>
            <li> I have been using the Proactiv system for years and it does a fair job of keeping my skin clear.  </li>
            <li> I am so thankful for this amazing product and feel that my skin will be normal soon thanks to Proavtive!!!</li>
            <li> I keep my face clean</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find anything that special about it.</li>
            <li> its good enough.  </li>
            <li> So glad we didn&#x27;t have to purchase the whole kit just to get step 3.</li>
            <li> The system worked but the true star of the system was this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it at 9.95 which is a much more reasonable.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it really clears up my skin, I use it under makeup and each night and morning.</li>
            <li> Might be better for the face but definitely wash hands after using and before touching fabric.</li>
            <li> You sent me 2 bottles expired in October , I can&#x27; t not use that quick...</li>
            <li> If you do, I guess, count yourself lucky.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, this product arrived quickly and reliably from this seller.</li>
            <li> Overall I have used Proactive for many years and like the product, but I cannot give this more stars because it arrived in september (on time)</li>
            <li> This step is good for broken skin areas, repairing zits, or smoothing over the T-zone or just your nose after a good exfoliation.</li>
            <li> strongly recomended,  it is very strong and mild at the same time</li>
            <li> It seems to calm redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Currently using the Oil Cleanse Method and its working amazingly.</li>
            <li> Mr pimples are rare now.</li>
            <li> but you can&#x27;t expect it to work when you rarely apply it.  </li>
            <li> I think it is still worth a try for those with acne.</li>
            <li> it is worth every Penney</li>
            <li> for this price this was well worth it though I wish they carry the 4 oz</li>
            <li> the Olay Professional ProX Facial Cleansing Brush really makes a huge difference, and SKIN79&#x27;s BB cream really seems to make my skin happy.</li>
            <li> The only problem with this product is that if you put it on your neck, it can very easily stain the neckline on your clothes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using proactiv for over 10 years, and it usually works great.</li>
            <li> and it keeps my breakouts from becoming a frequent visitor.  </li>
            <li> Super fast.</li>
            <li> I was a fair skinned person n ended up black n</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really bad, but I am super sensitive to smells, so I don&#x27;t think I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> On-line statements clearly state that proactiv causes wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
            <li> It works really really well!</li>
            <li> But if it&#x27;s too expensive, I would say that the Repairing Treatment is the best product of the three if you&#x27;re planning on just buying one.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> You will save yourself time and a whole lot of money buying it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> so no bacteria spreads, and put this on, within a day or two, at most, any potential zit is gone!  </li>
            <li> It definitely did, making my complexion a lot more manageable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did more damage than actual healing...</li>
            <li> My entire family uses proactive and we all love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> The product obviously works great, its just not worth buying it through proactiv.com.</li>
            <li> and I can certainly state</li>
            <li> This product is now priced very high at $14.95.  </li>
            <li> On it&#x27;s own it has little or no smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that Proactiv plays a large, but certainly not singlehanded, part in the recipe.</li>
            <li> Its over priced and very drying.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable on this product which is a plus.</li>
            <li> Thanks a bunch.</li>
            <li> I used the whole range of the proactive line n was getting results after three months.  </li>
            <li> Its the real thing</li>
            <li> this product really gets into the pimples a reduce them after some hrs.  </li>
            <li> Need time to really give an opinion on this product</li>
            <li> I like to buy the cleanser and repairing lotion off Amazon because of the reasonable prices.  </li>
            <li> it really works, but you need to purchase the whole kit</li>
            <li> really really works</li>
            <li> Used this years ago and had forgotten I really did like it.  </li>
            <li> I buy replacement  products through Amazon because Proactiv wants to put me on an auto-ship schedule</li>
            <li> It really worked for me.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin and although it doesn&#x27;t do much in the way of controlling it, I am still satisfied in it&#x27;s ability to control my acne.  </li>
            <li> I switched to other methods and got much better results.</li>
            <li> If you use the mask and scrub daily, your face will be come very sensitive to light, wind, and temperature.</li>
            <li> As long as the prices stay cheap like this I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I did not see much effect after a few weeks of use, but the overall quality of Proactiv products are good.</li>
            <li> Glad I don&#x27;t have to go hunt down a kiosk now</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this lotion!</li>
            <li> if you want something to help combat acne but not break your bank on here - go for step one and find a decent toner to go with that fits your face.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that is acne prone to certain foods.  </li>
            <li> So thankful to finally find something that really works!!</li>
            <li> Anyways, my friend introduced me to this little magic bottle and</li>
            <li> However, it didn&#x27;t help much to control my adult acne.</li>
            <li> At 50 some years old I really did not think zits would be a problem</li>
            <li> I am nearly 50 and have had skin troubles my whole life.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist has encouraged me to continue this product and prescribed an antibiotic topical gel for the rare pimples I now get.</li>
            <li> only drawback is that this product does bleach fabrics, whether it be pillowcases, towels or clothing, but I&#x27;ve become so used to managing that (with using only white pillowcases and towels, and I even bring my own when I&#x27;m going to someone&#x27;s house</li>
            <li> I liked this because no sooner then i used it within a few days i could see a difference!!</li>
            <li> so you know it&#x27;s new.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> Nothing else works for me - and I am almost 50 years old!  </li>
            <li> Another minor thing- the print of the bottle started coming off right away.</li>
            <li> I notice that when i forget to use it I will break out, but my skin goes back to normal once I start up again!!</li>
            <li> And when I do have a breakout it is a minimal amount and goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> If your acne is in more than one location, you should be smearing this on your whole face under a moisturizer at least once a day to stop current break outs and prevent new ones.  </li>
            <li> If a blemish does start to appear, I just dab a little extra on that spot without rubbing it in all the way and most of the time it stops it from getting any bigger.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for some time now and it does help clear my face.</li>
            <li> Proactiv does what its supposed to, clear ur spots.</li>
            <li> Keeps my face clear with continuous use.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years and my face is really clear.</li>
            <li> Between Proactiv, Olay and SKIN79, my skin stays clear the majority of the time--</li>
            <li> even though i am a mary kay consultant, i still have to rely on the proactiv to keep my face clear.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest however, if you are prone to acne on your neck, use on your neck at NIGHT, with an old shirt.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone experiencing adult acne.</li>
            <li> prescription stuff didn&#x27;t work, this does and didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It smells like old lady perfume to me,</li>
            <li> So now I smell like an old lady when I roll into bed.</li>
            <li> The ad really shows mostly white people on it</li>
            <li> Either way, the only product that has really worked for me has been proactiv.</li>
            <li> No dried peeling skin either.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the whole line of wash, toner and lotion since I found it too drying overall.  </li>
            <li> The benefits of the product by far outweigh that for me.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> i use the complete proactiv system.  </li>
            <li> Completely dislike.</li>
            <li> I first noticed Proactiv infomercials as long ago as 1997.  </li>
            <li> After discovering that the repair lotion was the product that actually kept my acne under control, I stopped buying the whole package and just bought the repair lotion by itself.  </li>
            <li> It might be more expensive but it is DEFINITELY worth it.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this products or any part of it for black people or people of color who live n very hot climate.</li>
            <li> the 3rd step is nothing but benzol peroxide pretty much and doesn&#x27;t do much of anything for black heads or pimples that haven&#x27;t been &amp;#34;popped&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was using the whole Proactive 3 step program for a while, but when my dermatologist told me that the repairing treatment is all I really need from the line, I stopped using their other products and stuck to this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I got a bum bottle (I checked the expiration date and that was fine), but it went in the trash.</li>
            <li> Only negative is that I thought it would be a lot more.</li>
            <li> There were major improvements to his skin within two weeks.</li>
            <li> Clears up the skin really really well and takes away redness and bumps and helps preveant new break outs and black heads</li>
            <li> This is the only product that keeps my skin clear of pimples.</li>
            <li> He has reported and I have seen that this product is definitely working to clear up is acne.  </li>
            <li> This is the only product that keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li> I am a 47 yr old woman who still has occasional acne breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Use caution and only put it directly on the pimple with a Q-tip..</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and minimal breakouts but since appying this in the morning and when I go to bed after washing my face, I haven&#x27;t had one breakout.</li>
            <li> A little drying at first and</li>
            <li> We use the Repairing lotion only on trouble areas every morning, for me, or night, for my wife, (right after the shower).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that ordering this through Amazon is much easier...and less expensive...than paying for shipping just to get 1 extra bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had times where I completely stop using it and go for other alternatives, such as cheaper drug store ones like Neutrogena or Clarassil.</li>
            <li> Yeah, our skin looked young but it was very uncomfortable and easily sunburned.</li>
            <li> I tried a couple other moisturizers and lotions only to keep coming back to this.</li>
            <li> Helps skin a lot especially in hot, muggy weather.</li>
            <li> I have used Proactiv products for a long time, purchasing from the mall kiosk.  </li>
            <li> a long time (if you use it as a spot treatment)</li>
            <li> Bigger bottle than I expected for price.</li>
            <li> I sometimes switch back and forth between it and AcneFree, noticing no real difference in the efficacy.</li>
            <li> it was very tough on my sensitive skin and did nothing to clear up my face BUUUUUUUUT a lady at Origins (now my sole provider of face care)secretly told me to ONLY use step 3 of proactive under my origins moisturizer to help fight and prevent acne and KNOCK ON WOOD</li>
            <li> I do have a minor complaint with this particular purchase.  </li>
            <li> But other than that, this only flaw is well-worth it because your zits will drastically improve.</li>
            <li> And the other 2 expire next year..?</li>
            <li> I only use this lotion and do not use the other products.  </li>
            <li> Change to my acne isn&#x27;t as dramatic as I would like to be, but when I use it on my forehead it helps calm my breakouts.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my body, it seemed to dry zits out</li>
            <li> but it stained my clothes and sheets even once it&#x27;s dry.  </li>
            <li> When my face gets dry</li>
            <li> so it only ruins those items.</li>
            <li> I developed small bumps which did not go away for three days.  </li>
            <li> Only down side is it dries my skin out.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and got the Proactiv trial kit from the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I go for some that are a little more expensive due to the &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; stamp on them.</li>
            <li> In fact, if you use all 4, you will find your skin very dry.  </li>
            <li> Every once in a while I stop using it and it doesn&#x27;t take long before my skin reminds me why I don&#x27;t bother with other products.</li>
            <li> It works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful because it WILL bleach clothes and sheets.</li>
            <li> This has not really been an issue with me, yet.</li>
            <li> This is just what i expected to receive.</li>
            <li> After a short break from either acne treatment, I started getting a few pimples, so I ordered this repair lotion.</li>
            <li> Again, made me think this is not real proactiv.</li>
            <li> it was delivered sooner than I expected also</li>
            <li> I started fighting some pretty frustrating acne a few years ago, and switched to Proactiv to see if it would help.</li>
            <li> I think I could go to the drug store and buy any ordinary blemish medication with the same results.</li>
            <li> I received it in a timely manner but it seems like it is just body lotion and does not work like the other Proactive products I have purchased for years.</li>
            <li> I order from Proactive, however I always seem to run out of step 3 faster than the other 2 steps.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the other parts of the cleansing system.</li>
            <li> I do use another face wash and an astringent first, then I apply this product all over my face and neck every night before I got to bed without fail.</li>
            <li> Not such a small bottle of it</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the past several years...</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I have a couple of other products that help in conjunction with the Proactiv</li>
            <li> but I received a small bottle of only 2.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Also be very careful of your clothing.</li>
            <li> The smell disappears after a few minutes of air dry.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> and you can really see improvement in 5 days however it is expensive</li>
            <li> I ended up with  dark skin with black patches on my face.</li>
            <li> I have been doing this for about a year and a half now</li>
            <li> Its the product I ordered and nothing less.</li>
            <li> They trick you to buy the whole monthly or three month package but it was useless and I wasted my money on it.&lt;br /&gt;Stay</li>
            <li> It is quite pricey and I will continue to search for the item at a less cost.</li>
            <li> I have heard some people say its not worked for them, but all i can say is a little patience is all you need.</li>
            <li> This is DEFINITELY NOT worth the money!  </li>
            <li> I have always used Proactive since i was little</li>
            <li> my green towel is now spotty with pink/white bleached areas so as my sage green sheets.  </li>
            <li> When I was a teenager, I used the lotion on just the trouble areas twice to three times a day, depending on the severity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product off and on for a few years.  </li>
            <li> A few malls in my area have vending machines that allow you to buy just the repair lotion.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and it is one of the few products that keeps my acne under control without drying my skin out.</li>
            <li> Three stars for the product, minus two for price increase and slow shopping.</li>
            <li> This is not my usual reaction when I use this lotion.</li>
            <li> I went to the drug store and picked up the AcneFree version and noticed the usual immediate improvements.</li>
            <li> This is just one small bottle of lotion.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was the seller or what, but this bottle wasn&#x27;t expired but didn&#x27;t work even close to as well as the repairing lotion usually works.  </li>
            <li> been using this prouct for the past 5 years</li>
            <li> However, it was difficult to dose the product on the skin because of a very small, tiny outlet in the lid.</li>
            <li> At least both of ours did.</li>
            <li> not nice.</li>
            <li> I hate using the whole line of proactive...</li>
            <li> The shipping was slow.  </li>
            <li> The benzoyl peroxide burns your skin even when used n very small amounts.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d take the less expensive road and buy Proactive</li>
            <li> This product works within days AND it works so well that even if I forget to use it on a regular basis my acne still never gets that bad anymore.</li>
            <li> The product works well, but the formula has changed a bit, a bit thick, but still works!</li>
            <li> and I recall buying a different one from another vendor and when they sent it it was already on its way to expire which was really stupid.</li>
            <li> I hate when companies add extra smell and colors for no reason!</li>
            <li> A pimple I had just seemed to get worse</li>
            <li> The item is falsely advertised.</li>
            <li> Not Happy Sorry</li>
            <li> I had gone to expensive derms &amp; NOTHING worked.  </li>
            <li> sadly at the age of 61, i still require the product.  </li>
            <li> (wrong turn!)  </li>
            <li> My son has very bad acne and this product is not for him.</li>
            <li> It was terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just like ordering from Proactiv.</li>
            <li> A wonderful product to help prevent pimples. I&#x27;ve been using for some time now and it does help clear my face.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion! It works really really well! I use it every night and not with any of the other practiv products and it is perfect as it clears my skin while I sleep!</li>
            <li> Proactive makes great products; their facewash and repair lotion especially.  Glad I don&#x27;t have to go hunt down a kiosk now and I can just order as needed.</li>
            <li> I have used Proactiv products for a long time, purchasing from the mall kiosk.  I decided to try buying the repair lotion from Amazon, and bought mine from R &amp; M Shop.  It is not the same stuff.  It doesn&#x27;t work the same, doesn&#x27;t feel the same, just isn&#x27;t the same!  I questioned the seller about this, and they assured me that it is.  Since I know better, I&#x27;ll try another seller.  So, watch out for this seller.</li>
            <li> works well. don&#x27;t like the bottle though</li>
            <li> Change to my acne isn&#x27;t as dramatic as I would like to be, but when I use it on my forehead it helps calm my breakouts. I don&#x27;t know about if it will help scarring heal, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt if. It seems to calm redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;Only for acne, not scars or pigmentation caused by acne. Doesn&#x27;t do anything for those.</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;works quickly&lt;br /&gt;fairly inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;nice scent&lt;br /&gt;lasts a long time (if you use it as a spot treatment)</li>
            <li> I hate using the whole line of proactive... it was very tough on my sensitive skin and did nothing to clear up my face BUUUUUUUUT a lady at Origins (now my sole provider of face care)secretly told me to ONLY use step 3 of proactive under my origins moisturizer to help fight and prevent acne and KNOCK ON WOOD my face has never looked BETTER!  I have been doing this for about a year and a half now and I can count on one (maybe two) hands of how many pimples I have gotten since!  I am religious about using step 3 proactive now!  THE BEST!</li>
            <li> Wifey loves this product and has been using it for years. I love that I can buy it on Amazon and with prime, get it quickly once she runs out. Really great product and will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> Its over priced and very drying. I switched to other methods and got much better results. Currently using the Oil Cleanse Method and its working amazingly.</li>
            <li> I am a 47 yr old woman who still has occasional acne breakouts.  This is the only product that keeps my skin clear of pimples.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my body, it seemed to dry zits out but it stained my clothes and sheets even once it&#x27;s dry.  Might be better for the face but definitely wash hands after using and before touching fabric.</li>
            <li> Proactiv does what its supposed to, clear ur spots. I have used it for a while now and just wanted to replace my repairing treatment lotion (i ran out). I have heard some people say its not worked for them, but all i can say is a little patience is all you need. Oh and d miracle worker for me is the step 3, the repairing treatment lotion. Great product!</li>
            <li> The Proactiv system as a whole is very good, so if you can, make sure to use all three.  But if it&#x27;s too expensive, I would say that the Repairing Treatment is the best product of the three if you&#x27;re planning on just buying one.  You need to make sure to use it DAY and NIGHT. I would suggest however, if you are prone to acne on your neck, use on your neck at NIGHT, with an old shirt.  The only problem with this product is that if you put it on your neck, it can very easily stain the neckline on your clothes.  But other than that, this only flaw is well-worth it because your zits will drastically improve.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Bigger bottle than I expected for price. I will definitely be ordering another!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> It works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful because it WILL bleach clothes and sheets.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the way it makes my skin feel. A good lotion without making your skin feel oily.</li>
            <li> I only use this during the day now, as I have bleach stains on all my sheets and pillow cases. Although it does work, I wonder if it&#x27;s ok to use considering what it had done to my sheets. Also be very careful of your clothing. Wash your hands after applying.</li>
            <li> This is DEFINITELY NOT worth the money!  I thought I&#x27;d take the less expensive road and buy Proactive (wrong turn!)  I&#x27;m going back to the Clinique acne treatment.  It might be more expensive but it is DEFINITELY worth it.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable on this product which is a plus. However, it didn&#x27;t help much to control my adult acne. I think I could go to the drug store and buy any ordinary blemish medication with the same results. I couldn&#x27;t find anything that special about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv for years.  I love the product.  I have had consistently good results and notice a difference if I stop using it.</li>
            <li> I get hormonal breakouts and this acne med works overnight!  I would recommend this product to anyone experiencing adult acne.</li>
            <li> prescription stuff didn&#x27;t work, this does and didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  try  it - I  should  have  years  ago!  enough  said</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 15 years, good and real product. It does work for me. Love it!</li>
            <li> Great Product, with awesome results, at a more reasonable price! Anyone who buys this product from the Manufacturer needs to stop! You will save yourself time and a whole lot of money buying it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I give this 4 stars because it is a great deal for 4 oz, and I love the way the mico BP feels smooth and penetrates quickly. But one star taken away for the perfume smell. Why Dr. Rhodan and FIelds, why? Why add a scent to benzoyl peroxide? I don&#x27;t get it. On it&#x27;s own it has little or no smell. I hate when companies add extra smell and colors for no reason! It smells like old lady perfume to me, So now I smell like an old lady when I roll into bed. It&#x27;s not really bad, but I am super sensitive to smells, so I don&#x27;t think I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Whenever I have had to use this product, I have gotten very good results with it.&lt;br /&gt;If I keep my face clean so no bacteria spreads, and put this on, within a day or two, at most, any potential zit is gone!  If my review helped you, could you please click \\&quot;helpful\\&quot; button below. Thank you!  :)</li>
            <li> It seems to work good. Only started using it. I do like how it feels on my skin. Very smooth feeling. I use it under make-up and just use a light powder.</li>
            <li> This was the best deal I could find for the product at the give size. And it came in a couple of days! Super fast. Thanks a bunch.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my teenage grandson who is having great issues with acne.  He has reported and I have seen that this product is definitely working to clear up is acne.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> The item comes wrapped in plastic so you know it&#x27;s new.  I LOVE the repairing treatment!  Been using it for over a decade and I can certainly state it&#x27;s helped my complexion.</li>
            <li> I received it in a timely manner but it seems like it is just body lotion and does not work like the other Proactive products I have purchased for years.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because I came off my birth control pills after ten years being on it n needed something to help with the acne break out. I used the whole range of the proactive line n was getting results after three months.  I would not recommend this products or any part of it for black people or people of color who live n very hot climate. The benzoyl peroxide burns your skin even when used n very small amounts. I ended up with  dark skin with black patches on my face. I was a fair skinned person n ended up black n the face while my neck and body was light skinned. The ad really shows mostly white people on it so I should have been warned.</li>
            <li> I order from Proactive, however I always seem to run out of step 3 faster than the other 2 steps.  I&#x27;ve found that ordering this through Amazon is much easier...and less expensive...than paying for shipping just to get 1 extra bottle.</li>
            <li> Its the product I ordered and nothing less. Very happy. I have been using this product for years. Its the real thing</li>
            <li> You sent me 2 bottles expired in October , I can&#x27; t not use that quick... And the other 2 expire next year..?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using proactiv solution for almost 8 years. I&#x27;ve had times where I completely stop using it and go for other alternatives, such as cheaper drug store ones like Neutrogena or Clarassil. Sometimes I go for some that are a little more expensive due to the &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; stamp on them. Either way, the only product that has really worked for me has been proactiv. It&#x27;s a bittersweet feeling because although it does work on my skin and does keep it under control, the chemicals are supposedly damaging my skin. On-line statements clearly state that proactiv causes wrinkles and fine lines. This has not really been an issue with me, yet. Therefore, I continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it does keep acne under control and does manage to control it as good as only getting maybe one whitehead once in a while, which is good. When I stop using it, my acne explodes out. So I kinda have to keep using it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> this is a VERY EFFECTIVE pimple reducer.  Stops the growth and goes away in 5 days.  but doesnt get rid of blackheads.  blackheads will stay forever unless you prick and take it out.  I still like it.  do not use this in the morning since your skin gets brown spots and you will not be able to get rid of the brown sun spots forever. use it at night.. its good enough.  BUT my sheets are totally ruined.  benzoyl peroxide bleaches any colored materials.  my green towel is now spotty with pink/white bleached areas so as my sage green sheets.  pillow cases are patchy bleached and my blanket is patchy bleached.  anything that touches your face with this solution will get bleached.  i still cannot stop using it because it is so effective... so just keep on using the same bleached sheets/pillowcases and towels so it only ruins those items.</li>
            <li> We have used this stuff for years. We do not use the face scrub and mask and all that jazz. We use the Repairing lotion only on trouble areas every morning, for me, or night, for my wife, (right after the shower).  We have found this works great. It does not burn but does have a chemical smell. I suspect you will not be able to make something like this without a chemical smell. If you use the mask and scrub daily, your face will be come very sensitive to light, wind, and temperature. At least both of ours did. Yeah, our skin looked young but it was very uncomfortable and easily sunburned. We switched to just using the lotion and have had none of those side effects since then. When I was a teenager, I used the lotion on just the trouble areas twice to three times a day, depending on the severity. Adults should not require it that often. If you do, I guess, count yourself lucky. I recommend this product despite the smell. The smell disappears after a few minutes of air dry.</li>
            <li> I buys this product a couple times a year.  The product works well, but the formula has changed a bit, a bit thick, but still works!</li>
            <li> Its ok til it started to burn and irritate my face that&#x27;s why I gave it 3 stars. Not Happy Sorry</li>
            <li> Been using the repairing lotion since 2004. I tried a couple other moisturizers and lotions only to keep coming back to this. Since 2008, I&#x27;ve been faithful to Proactiv repairing lotion. I don&#x27;t use the other parts of the cleansing system. I have oily skin, acne prone. My dermatologist has encouraged me to continue this product and prescribed an antibiotic topical gel for the rare pimples I now get. With this repairing lotion. Mr pimples are rare now. They use to flare up twice a month.</li>
            <li> The product works in drying up pimples, but it broke me out when I put it all over my face.  I developed small bumps which did not go away for three days.  Use caution and only put it directly on the pimple with a Q-tip..</li>
            <li> They trick you to buy the whole monthly or three month package but it was useless and I wasted my money on it.&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from it</li>
            <li> This is the only proactiv product that I buy and it woks wonders. I have very oily skin and minimal breakouts but since appying this in the morning and when I go to bed after washing my face, I haven&#x27;t had one breakout. Makes my skin flawless and actually feels good when I put it on. It&#x27;s not greasy like a lot of lotions. LOVE it. Part of my daily routine EVERY day.</li>
            <li> I have used the this product for years. I only use it when I need it. Only apply it to the blemish . It works every time. It reduces redness and heals the blemish. I apply in the morning and evening.</li>
            <li> At 50 some years old I really did not think zits would be a problem but.. As soon as one starts I put this on and it dries them up before it erupts. No dried peeling skin either. I got a sample of this and have sworn by it since.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product off and on for a few years.  I don&#x27;t use the whole line of wash, toner and lotion since I found it too drying overall.  I prefer to just use this when I have a breakout or for spot treatments.  It helps my skin to recover faster.  The rest of the time I use coconut oil, castor or argan oil as lotion and wash with my home made soaps which 95% of the time keeps my skin fab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, this product arrived quickly and reliably from this seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Proactive Solution Repairing treatment for probably about 15 years. Every once in a while I stop using it and it doesn&#x27;t take long before my skin reminds me why I don&#x27;t bother with other products. I&#x27;ve battled acne since my earliest teen years and now at age 40, I&#x27;m still fighting the same battle. I was using the whole Proactive 3 step program for a while, but when my dermatologist told me that the repairing treatment is all I really need from the line, I stopped using their other products and stuck to this one. I do use another face wash and an astringent first, then I apply this product all over my face and neck every night before I got to bed without fail. If a blemish does start to appear, I just dab a little extra on that spot without rubbing it in all the way and most of the time it stops it from getting any bigger.&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is that this product does bleach fabrics, whether it be pillowcases, towels or clothing, but I&#x27;ve become so used to managing that (with using only white pillowcases and towels, and I even bring my own when I&#x27;m going to someone&#x27;s house so I don&#x27;t bleach theirs) that it&#x27;s a non-issue for me. The benefits of the product by far outweigh that for me.&lt;br /&gt;In my experience over many years of trying and stopping other products, this is the best I&#x27;ve found for preventing acne, and I prefer to prevent it rather than wait for blemishes and spot treat them.</li>
            <li> this product really gets into the pimples a reduce them after some hrs.  strongly recomended,  it is very strong and mild at the same time</li>
            <li> Only wish it wasn&#x27;t an add on item!</li>
            <li> I bought this in addition to the 4 piece Proactiv set so that I would have extra.  I like it, and it seems to be working well.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! I have always loved proactive and it has always worked for me. Keeps my face clear with continuous use.</li>
            <li> I did not see much effect after a few weeks of use, but the overall quality of Proactiv products are good. I am using a Proactiv Plus product suit now.</li>
            <li> This is just what i expected to receive. I have always used Proactive since i was little and it has always worked great for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using proactiv for over 10 years, and it usually works great. I sometimes switch back and forth between it and AcneFree, noticing no real difference in the efficacy. After a short break from either acne treatment, I started getting a few pimples, so I ordered this repair lotion. However, after a week, it simply wasn&#x27;t working. A pimple I had just seemed to get worse and I got another big pimple after I&#x27;d started using it. This is not my usual reaction when I use this lotion. I&#x27;m not sure if I got a bum bottle (I checked the expiration date and that was fine), but it went in the trash. I went to the drug store and picked up the AcneFree version and noticed the usual immediate improvements. Kind of made me wonder about the seller and its source. Another minor thing- the print of the bottle started coming off right away. Again, made me think this is not real proactiv.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that I can purchase this product on it&#x27;s own and NOT in the kit.  I only use this lotion and do not use the other products.  It is quite pricey and I will continue to search for the item at a less cost.</li>
            <li> Need time to really give an opinion on this product</li>
            <li> Proactive has always been the best on treating my acne</li>
            <li> So glad we didn&#x27;t have to purchase the whole kit just to get step 3. Works great for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I have been using Proactiv for years and it works.  My teenager says it doesn&#x27;t but you can&#x27;t expect it to work when you rarely apply it.  If you are having a breakout...I use it until it goes away and anytime I feel something coming up...until it stays away...</li>
            <li> I have been using the Proactiv system for years and it does a fair job of keeping my skin clear.  I have extremely oily skin and although it doesn&#x27;t do much in the way of controlling it, I am still satisfied in it&#x27;s ability to control my acne.  I like to buy the cleanser and repairing lotion off Amazon because of the reasonable prices.  My product arrived on time and in great shape.  I will definitely order from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> Exceptional price and service</li>
            <li> This is just one small bottle of lotion.  This is not 3 bottles.  Works well, wish it was 3 bottles</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about 3 years and i love it. I notice that when i forget to use it I will break out, but my skin goes back to normal once I start up again!! When my face gets dry I use the oil free moisturizer from proactiv. Also they do not test on animals which is wonderful!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was the seller or what, but this bottle wasn&#x27;t expired but didn&#x27;t work even close to as well as the repairing lotion usually works.  I think I&#x27;ll stick with buying on proactiv&#x27;s website from now on.</li>
            <li> I like it and it was delivered on time. I&#x27;ve used it for 3 days and my skin already looks better. Only negative is that I thought it would be a lot more. Not such a small bottle of it</li>
            <li> it really works, but you need to purchase the whole kit</li>
            <li> This use to be my go-to product for acne. For some reason this just didnt work as well as I remembered it. I think it is still worth a try for those with acne. I tried the Proactiv + system and it worked better for me</li>
            <li> AWESOME!! works great! Best acne treatment, so far.</li>
            <li> Proactiv is excellent very very good.....</li>
            <li> Seems legitimate, but I received it on June 13 and it expires September 17. If you order, beware of the shelf life.</li>
            <li> Have used this for a yr. or so. So thankful to finally find something that really works!! This was also a deal on the price.:) I would surely reccomend it to a friend..thanks,Wendy</li>
            <li> Overall I have used Proactive for many years and like the product, but I cannot give this more stars because it arrived in september (on time) but it expires this month in October.  So I basically got a product that expired 1 month after it arrived.  I had the same issue with the cleanser but the vendor refunded my money which I thougth was good customer service. So I have to give credit for that.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and it works great.  There were major improvements to his skin within two weeks.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the past several years... it works great - I strongly recommend to anyone who has blemish problems or oily skin.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use all 4 steps to get the benefits of this product.  In fact, if you use all 4, you will find your skin very dry.  This step is good for broken skin areas, repairing zits, or smoothing over the T-zone or just your nose after a good exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I liked this because no sooner then i used it within a few days i could see a difference!! My skin even tingles thats how i know its workin!!</li>
            <li> Great product. Works like described .</li>
            <li> Been using it for years and my face is really clear. Only down side is it dries my skin out.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Best acne product I have ever tried. This is the only product that keeps my skin clear. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this lotion! And amazon is the best and cheapest place to buy it! I do find it works better in conjunction with the face wash... But I like that I can order them separately - only when I need each item vs having to buy them as a set. I recommend this to all people with oily, acne prone skin. It truly is a magical product!</li>
            <li> You do not need to buy the other proactiv products because this one alone works great! I began getting acne at the age of 30 mostly around my cheeks and chin. This product works within days AND it works so well that even if I forget to use it on a regular basis my acne still never gets that bad anymore. Use a tiny amount and it will do the trick! I will continue buying from this seller and will continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> MONOLUXURY shipped lotion that will expire soon.  The product will work just know that you may received product that&#x27;s been sitting on the shelf for a while.</li>
            <li> I started fighting some pretty frustrating acne a few years ago, and switched to Proactiv to see if it would help. It definitely did, making my complexion a lot more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;However, I have a couple of other products that help in conjunction with the Proactiv line-- the Olay Professional ProX Facial Cleansing Brush really makes a huge difference, and SKIN79&#x27;s BB cream really seems to make my skin happy. Between Proactiv, Olay and SKIN79, my skin stays clear the majority of the time-- I&#x27;m sure that Proactiv plays a large, but certainly not singlehanded, part in the recipe.</li>
            <li> Does not work as well as advertised.  My son has very bad acne and this product is not for him.</li>
            <li> Incredible healing agent; THIS WORKS LITERALLY OVERNIGHT!  I had gone to expensive derms &amp; NOTHING worked.  I saw the tv ads &amp; decided to give this wonderful product a try.  I am so thankful for this amazing product and feel that my skin will be normal soon thanks to Proavtive!!!</li>
            <li> Have been a proactiv customer for over 20 years. sadly at the age of 61, i still require the product.  i use the complete proactiv system.  if i go two days without repair lotion, then i get a breakout, one every day. not nice. even though i am a mary kay consultant, i still have to rely on the proactiv to keep my face clear.  and between mary kay and proactiv, I do not have a wrinkle.ya gotta love it.</li>
            <li> This is advertised as 4 ounces but I received a small bottle of only 2. The item is falsely advertised.</li>
            <li> The quality of product was ok. However, it was difficult to dose the product on the skin because of a very small, tiny outlet in the lid. Eventually, I found the way how to deal with it. So, I would still recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. Completely dislike.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and you can really see improvement in 5 days however it is expensive but you get what you pay for I love it and to have a perfect smooth face it is worth every Penney I Love Amazon</li>
            <li> This product all the time and it keeps my breakouts from becoming a frequent visitor.  And when I do have a breakout it is a minimal amount and goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> I tried using the proactiv line for my acne... It was terrible. It did more damage than actual healing... Anyways, my friend introduced me to this little magic bottle and OH MY GOD!! I love it!! Ever since I started using this lotion it has cleared all my stubborn zits, leaves my skin beautiful! I am so exicited that I found this! I definitely recommend this product, it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> I first noticed Proactiv infomercials as long ago as 1997.  I went ahead and bought into it by 2002.  The system worked but the true star of the system was this lotion.  After discovering that the repair lotion was the product that actually kept my acne under control, I stopped buying the whole package and just bought the repair lotion by itself.  A few malls in my area have vending machines that allow you to buy just the repair lotion.  After awhile though the vending machine was always sold out of this product. I then had to resort to buying it on the web.  Great price and still works like it always did.</li>
            <li> If your acne is in more than one location, you should be smearing this on your whole face under a moisturizer at least once a day to stop current break outs and prevent new ones.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Bought for my brother. At the mall they easily cost triple the price. Very satisfied. As long as the prices stay cheap like this I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and it is nice to be able to order the different products you need at a good price!  Love this product and will continue to buy it from amazon.</li>
            <li> Great product, super fast delivery.  Better than at the maker&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and it is one of the few products that keeps my acne under control without drying my skin out.</li>
            <li> love it love it love it really really works and I recall buying a different one from another vendor and when they sent it it was already on its way to expire which was really stupid. But I gotta say with this vendor and for this price this was well worth it though I wish they carry the 4 oz I will buy again</li>
            <li> This product is now priced very high at $14.95.  I purchased it at 9.95 which is a much more reasonable. The shipping was slow.  It took 14 days to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, proactive is a fine product. It does what it says.  My entire family uses proactive and we all love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Three stars for the product, minus two for price increase and slow shopping.</li>
            <li> I have been using the proactiv system for several years and I love it.  I would recommend everybody to try it.</li>
            <li> Used this years ago and had forgotten I really did like it.  Helps skin a lot especially in hot, muggy weather.</li>
            <li> I am nearly 50 and have had skin troubles my whole life.  I finally broke down and got the Proactiv trial kit from the manufacturer.  A little drying at first and initially it brought all my acne to the surface, but after that my skin was noticeably clearer.  I buy replacement  products through Amazon because Proactiv wants to put me on an auto-ship schedule and I don&#x27;t like that.</li>
            <li> I do not use anything else in the Proactiv line except for the Repairing Treatment.  I use this twice a day.  I also want to add that I do not consume a lot of refined sugar, I drink a ton of water, and I watch what I eat.  I have sensitive skin that is acne prone to certain foods.  I also use the Proactiv Repairing Treatment and my pimples are MAYBE once in awhile.</li>
            <li> My son now only uses step1,2 &amp;3. We order them one at a time as needed since they don&#x27;t get used up all at the same time. Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.  Nothing else works for me - and I am almost 50 years old!  Will never use anything else!</li>
            <li> if you want something to help combat acne but not break your bank on here - go for step one and find a decent toner to go with that fits your face. the 3rd step is nothing but benzol peroxide pretty much and doesn&#x27;t do much of anything for black heads or pimples that haven&#x27;t been &amp;#34;popped&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have been using Proactiv for years and have always been very pleased with the results.  I do have a minor complaint with this particular purchase.  It is January, 2013 and the expiration on the bottle I just received yesterday has an expiration date of March, 2013.  PLEASE check the expiration dates on your products, folks.  Other than that, I am very pleased with the turn-around time on this purchase.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Some people had issues with the Proactiv products from Amazon vs. ordering from Proactiv itself.  This was just the same. I&#x27;ve been a Proactiv user for years and I recommend it to anyone who has acne.</li>
            <li> It really worked for me.</li>
            <li> I love how it make my face feel</li>
            <li> Proactiv works great, but buying directly through them is a scam. So if you buy proactiv I recommend buying it through amazon. The product obviously works great, its just not worth buying it through proactiv.com.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for my son for several years now, product works great, he&#x27;s very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Clears up the skin really really well and takes away redness and bumps and helps preveant new break outs and black heads</li>
            <li> Product works well with my oily/dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I been using this prouct for the past 5 years&lt;br /&gt;yes i would recommend this product</li>
            <li> I love this product, it really clears up my skin, I use it under makeup and each night and morning. it was delivered sooner than I expected also</li>
