    <ol>
            <li>3 coats were perfect.</li>
            <li>Awesome color!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Super awesome color.</li>
            <li>Great color good product I like it!!</li>
            <li>ELECTRIFY is a beautiful combination of copper and gold glitters.</li>
            <li>This is a good brand of nail polish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s THE perfect hot August shade!  </li>
            <li>Love the color!</li>
            <li>Well it&#x27;s just seriously awesome, except it comes of pretty easily</li>
            <li>I tend to like interesting nail polishes, mostly because my career doesn&#x27;t allow me to dress flamboyantly, but I can get very creative with nail color.</li>
            <li>The color is gorgeous, very autumn-y!!</li>
            <li>but instead i got a top coat of sparkles.</li>
            <li>One of the better glitter polishes.</li>
            <li>So many people complimented me on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But for a gorgeous manicure that last for weeks, this is a great polish.</li>
            <li>I get soooo many compliments.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I wore it over a yellow nailpolish and received a lot of compliments on how awesome it looked.</li>
            <li>This one ranks on a level of a 6/7 (on a scale of 1- 10)depending on how many coats you use.</li>
            <li>Your sure to get noticed wearing this color.</li>
            <li>It went on relatively well and was great for a summer pedicure.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty when painted on.</li>
            <li>This color is very pretty though.</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>I love this brand, the enamel is very chip resistant and the pain drys super fast!</li>
            <li>Instead of using many coats, to completely cover the nail.</li>
            <li>i really wish it had been a full on polish</li>
            <li>The red are slighter larger disc glitter than the gold, but it looks great.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really pretty, every time I wear it</li>
            <li>aware</li>
            <li>Just a couple coats gets you pretty much all over glitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Imagine this: You&#x27;re getting ready to have an interview with Caesar Flickerman, and you can see the sparkles from a distance, &amp;#34;hmmm</li>
            <li>but China Glaze holds up very well</li>
            <li>Brand goes on very well.</li>
            <li>Personally, I think using glitter nail polish is worth the hassle if you know up front</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>so maybe put like a clear nail polish on before you put &#x27;The Girl On Fire&#x27; on.</li>
            <li>An orange or yellow wouldn&#x27;t add too much because those colors are already there in the glitter.</li>

            <li> The density of the glitter isn&#x27;t high, so for a subtle look, use only one, maybe two coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used about 5 coats on my toes and they almost glowed with copper lights.</li>
            <li> so she could see it was a limited addition.</li>
            <li> i expected a polish</li>
            <li> only complaint is that, as with pretty much all glitter polishes, it is VERY difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> Be warned, as with any other glitter polish, you WILL have to work out the particulars with removal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very rough to my hands and nails because of my job</li>
            <li> For my fingernails, I painted the nails with a pale cream, and used ELECTRIFY as the &amp;#34;french manicure&amp;#34; tips.</li>
            <li> (if you don&#x27;t often use glitter polish) it is VERY DIFFICULT TO REMOVE.</li>

            <li> i expected a polish but instead i got a top coat of sparkles. i really wish it had been a full on polish but i made it that way. i did seven coats but it took forever and you could tell i did mutiple coats and it took forever to get off.</li>
            <li> I bought this polish for a beach trip.  It&#x27;s THE perfect hot August shade!  One of the better glitter polishes.</li>

            <li> Imagine this: You&#x27;re getting ready to have an interview with Caesar Flickerman, and you can see the sparkles from a distance, &amp;#34;hmmm what&#x27;s that I wonder?&amp;#34;  He takes your hand  and raises your arm, &amp;#34;Katniss Everdeen the girl on FIRE!&amp;#34; You blush from all the people looking at you, your hand shimmering.&lt;br /&gt;  Well it&#x27;s just seriously awesome, except it comes of pretty easily so maybe put like a clear nail polish on before you put &#x27;The Girl On Fire&#x27; on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really pretty, every time I wear it I get soooo many compliments.</li>
            <li> Love the color! Got lots of compliments!</li>
            <li> Very pretty when painted on. This is a good brand of nail polish.</li>
            <li> The color is gorgeous, very autumn-y!! I love this brand, the enamel is very chip resistant and the pain drys super fast!</li>
            <li> Great color good product I like it!! Came in on time I would recommend this to the people who like a reddish gold sparkle color polish!</li>
            <li> I tried The Hunger Games collection by China Glaze on a whim and I&#x27;m glad I did. Electrify is a mix of gold and red glitter. The red are slighter larger disc glitter than the gold, but it looks great. I wore it over a yellow nailpolish and received a lot of compliments on how awesome it looked. I&#x27;m very rough to my hands and nails because of my job but China Glaze holds up very well and I only have to retouch the three days it lasts for me.</li>
            <li> Awesome color! And as always China Glaze delivers. Got it for my daughter she is a fan of the Hunger Games, so I kept the delivery slip so she could see it was a limited addition.</li>
            <li> My kids are a fan of the movie and the book series, I dig the color!  It went on relatively well and was great for a summer pedicure.  Be warned, as with any other glitter polish, you WILL have to work out the particulars with removal.  Personally, I think using glitter nail polish is worth the hassle if you know up front what level of torture you will face in trying to get it off.  This one ranks on a level of a 6/7 (on a scale of 1- 10)depending on how many coats you use. Remember, information is power!</li>
            <li> I have a thing for nail polish that shimmers or has glitter.  It&#x27;s just a pain in the butt to remove unless you soak your nails.  This color is very pretty though.</li>
            <li> Very pretty. Brand goes on very well.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping. Came well packaged, wrapped in bubble wrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super awesome color. It is orange and yellow glitter. Just a couple coats gets you pretty much all over glitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware (if you don&#x27;t often use glitter polish) it is VERY DIFFICULT TO REMOVE. That&#x27;s normal. It isn&#x27;t a flaw with the polish it&#x27;s just how glitters work. It may help to put a coat of color underneath it. An orange or yellow wouldn&#x27;t add too much because those colors are already there in the glitter.</li>
            <li> Your sure to get noticed wearing this color. Instead of using many coats, to completely cover the nail. Try painting the nail a solid color underneath. It will make removing the sparkles easier.</li>
