            <li>Love these nails!</li>
            <li>Kidding, she&#x27;s amazing...</li>
            <li>I got these nails for my self and the nail glue is amazing.</li>
            <li>These are nice though if you like the square acrylic look.</li>
            <li>but over all I had a nice experience</li>
            <li>Very strong and takes paint well</li>
            <li>so easy to file also!</li>
            <li>I love that they let you paint them</li>
            <li>Love the length but not the thinness</li>
            <li>i added WAY more glue</li>
            <li>These are okay.</li>
            <li>Will purchase more for my girlfriends.</li>
            <li>They curve more then I would like</li>
            <li>the manicure lasted me about 3 weeks with one of those weeks involving being in a pool most days.</li>
            <li>They seem to pop off more easily than the Oval ones.</li>
            <li>they are pretty good the first time i used them they popped off very easily them</li>
            <li>However, the glue doesn&#x27;t seem all that strong.</li>
            <li>You just have to make sure they&#x27;re super sterile before gluing them on.</li>
            <li>My wife looks super sexy with these, and it feels great when she scratches my back, etc...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s was nice but the glue stuck way too fast</li>
            <li>So I think they would fit easier</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re going to be nice for most of my nails or as soon as I use enough glue &amp; time.</li>
            <li>Nails seem durable for the most part, but then she never does any real work anyway, and if she did, she might break a nail.</li>
            <li>I use a gel super glue even though you&#x27;re not supposed to.</li>
            <li>Other than that, they look very nice</li>
            <li>They were very durable and they lasted for a long time (about two weeks) which was great.</li>
            <li>Came earlier than expected which is great!</li>
            <li>THat way, I had enough nail space to do cool designs and a great French.</li>
            <li>I was able to keep them on for about 2 days but that was with me constantly carrying around the glue and reapplying them when needed.</li>
            <li>I did have a slight problem upon applying with the nails splitting with too much pressure, but they look nice, paint well, and are very durable.</li>
            <li>Absolutely unacceptable.</li>
            <li>Kiss 100 Full Cover Square Short nails, in blunt terms, suck.  </li>
            <li>so I could quickly get my bail back on.</li>
            <li>Oh and she said she likes the new design of the glue bottle as it doesn&#x27;t get plugged up.</li>
            <li>I can keep most nails on for at least 2 weeks without worrying.</li>
            <li>There tough and don&#x27;t break easy , and I&#x27;m always cleaning and lifting things and they&#x27;ve been perfectly fine, but Id also by an extra glue cause the ones not enough for 100  </li>
            <li>They could be a little too hard to bend easy to fit the shape of the nail bed.</li>
            <li>I really love the shape of these nails and they look hard enough so they shouldn&#x27;t crack like most of the other nails I&#x27;ve gotten from other countries...</li>
            <li>I really like them not too long not too short.</li>
            <li>It dries too fast and doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>

            <li> My wife looks super sexy with these, and it feels great when she scratches my back, etc... Oh and she said she likes the new design of the glue bottle as it doesn&#x27;t get plugged up.

            <li> Ok. The nails are a little too curved so often times water will seep through and dissolve the glue a little. Package says it&#x27;s should last for a week but often the glue only lasts for 3 days</li>
            <li> They were very durable and they lasted for a long time (about two weeks) which was great. I love that they let you paint them they way you wanted. THat way, I had enough nail space to do cool designs and a great French.</li>
            <li> Love the length but not the thinness</li>
            <li> I just love these artificial nails. They will last 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> they are pretty good the first time i used them they popped off very easily them i added WAY more glue and they stayed for about 1 week and im not even that rough</li>
            <li> These are okay. They seem to pop off more easily than the Oval ones. These are nice though if you like the square acrylic look.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s was nice but the glue stuck way too fast and it&#x27;s was so small but over all I had a nice experience</li>
            <li> Kiss 100 Full Cover Square Short nails, in blunt terms, suck.  I applied them abut 5 hours ago.  I am retired and am not doing any heavy work; I only loaded the washer and then the dryer.  Two nails have fallen off already, which I will admit could have been my fault.  However, two of the remaining have bent and chipped.  Absolutely unacceptable.</li>
            <li> They came a day before the earliest estimated time! I really like them not too long not too short.</li>
            <li> Very strong and takes paint well</li>
            <li> Really nice quality item! Will purchase more for my girlfriends.</li>
            <li> works good and nice variety</li>
            <li> Came earlier than expected which is great! However, the glue doesn&#x27;t seem all that strong. I was able to keep them on for about 2 days but that was with me constantly carrying around the glue and reapplying them when needed. Other than that, they look very nice and I would order them again, just possibly with a different glue.</li>
            <li> I got these nails for my self and the nail glue is amazing. You should try themüòÑ</li>
            <li> They curve more then I would like</li>
            <li> The nails are too curved. When you add pressure to make them stick, they crack!</li>
            <li> keeps poping off no matter what glue I used</li>
            <li> I really love the shape of these nails and they look hard enough so they shouldn&#x27;t crack like most of the other nails I&#x27;ve gotten from other countries...There&#x27;s only one slight problem. They could be a little too hard to bend easy to fit the shape of the nail bed. I got one thumbnail to stay on but I&#x27;m having trouble keeping the other thumbnail on. I have flat nail beds...especially the thumbs. So I think they would fit easier if you &#x27;don&#x27;t&#x27; have flat nail beds. I&#x27;m going to keep trying to keep them on regardless because I know I didn&#x27;t waste my money. They&#x27;re going to be nice for most of my nails or as soon as I use enough glue &amp; time. I use a gel super glue even though you&#x27;re not supposed to. I can keep most nails on for at least 2 weeks without worrying. You just have to make sure they&#x27;re super sterile before gluing them on.</li>
            <li> These nails were PERFECT. the manicure lasted me about 3 weeks with one of those weeks involving being in a pool most days. i didn&#x27;t even have to file them down. planning on reordering.</li>
            <li> product as described; fair price.</li>

            <li> These are one of the best.  However, this batch was a bit weaker than they usually are.  Had to replace a few before their time due to splitting and cracking.</li>
            <li> PERFECT üòç so easy to file also!</li>
            <li> The nails are great.&lt;br /&gt;The glue is temperamental. It dries too fast and doesn&#x27;t last very long. I had to take it with me everywhere so I could quickly get my bail back on.</li>
