            <li>I like the unscented best because I don&#x27;t care much for a multitude of fragrances, but the scented version is nice too.</li>
            <li>Was thrilled I found it on Amazon - who always comes through.  </li>
            <li>Not quite sure why roll-on deodorants are more popular with men</li>

            <li>Very plesVery pleased</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>It also lasts a pretty long time so you&#x27;re getting a pretty good value for the price.  </li>
            <li>Good size for travel because it is less than 3 oz.</li>

            <li>had a mastectomy ten years ago, and my right arm and underarm lost all feeling for a year while the nerves regenerated.</li>
            <li>now live at the beach</li>
            <li>My husband thinks he can&#x27;t live without this</li>
            <li>I have used more deodorants on the market than I care to remember because of my excessive perspiration.</li>
            <li>I started using this many years ago when I lived down in New orleans because its so hot and sweaty down there.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am completely at ease about my personal hygiene because Mitchum Anti-Perspirant works.</li>
            <li>The soft solid Michum is the ONLY one that works for me.  </li>
            <li>Recently, the Mitchum Advanced has become so runny that it will run down my side and arms and stain my clothes if I do not wait for a long time for it to dry.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> good deodorant, helps control wetness use after showers</li>
            <li> In the summer this is the only deodorant that works for me. I just wish I had noticed when I ordered that it was only for one. The picture showed two and I didn&#x27;t read the description. The price wasn&#x27;t good for one. Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through many, many deodorant brands and this is what I have ended up using consistently.  Not quite sure why roll-on deodorants are more popular with men but this NEVER clumps or leaves white marks anywhere.  It also keeps me from perspiring and I sweat A LOT, especially at the gym.  It also lasts a pretty long time so you&#x27;re getting a pretty good value for the price.  I&#x27;d recommend trying it and you&#x27;ll be hooked.</li>
            <li> It works. No added scent is a bonus for those who enjoy some natural odors. It works for over 24 hours.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Sorry I don&#x27;t know about the roll-on. But the ladies Mitchum soft solid is the greatest thing ever.  I&#x27;ve tried all different kinds of deodrants over the years.  The soft solid Michum is the ONLY one that works for me.  The PROBLEM is it is so hard to find a retailer that sells this specific type of Ladies Mitchum Deodrant! If you know where I can purchase this deodrant PLEASE inform me!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently in surgery rehab and am unable to shower daily. I am completely at ease about my personal hygiene because Mitchum Anti-Perspirant works.</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant.  Have used it for years.</li>
            <li> I started using this many years ago when I lived down in New orleans because its so hot and sweaty down there.&lt;br /&gt;I now live at the beach and I still use it. I apply this roll on after a shower and when it drys I put on a scented spray deod too.</li>
            <li> I have used more deodorants on the market than I care to remember because of my excessive perspiration. My doctor even wrote a prescription for my pharmacist to compound a deodorant/antiperspirant saying that was the best solution available.

            <li> I have used Mitchum for years.  Recently, the Mitchum Advanced has become so runny that it will run down my side and arms and stain my clothes if I do not wait for a long time for it to dry.  I will be switching brands of deodorant.</li>

            <li> Ant-perspirant &amp; Deodorant Roll On is simply the best I have ever used. I have tried every deodorant known to man and woman, and I keep,coming back to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a mastectomy ten years ago, and my right arm and underarm lost all feeling for a year while the nerves regenerated. I also list any sweat glands on that side, but every once in awhile I will note a slight odor if I do. to use my anti-perspirant and deodorant on that side. It seems that Mitchum is the only one that works well for me. I realize this is a strange tale, but aren&#x27;t we all?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 10-11-15</li>
