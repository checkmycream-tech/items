            <li>/&gt;Neosporin may be generally good, but my ex was allergic to sulfa based drugs, and a pharmacist told her Neosporin causes problems for people who are allergic to sulfa based drugs (even though there is nothing on the packaging which would tell a lay-person that Neosporin is a problem for people with sulfa allergies).  </li>
            <li>My ex uses Bacitracin Zink with good results:</li>
            <li>At a post-op checkup with the surgeon, he said to me, \\&quot;That&#x27;s Good</li>
            <li>THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT TO PREVENT AND HEAL EXISTING BED SORES.....</li>
            <li>Good service.</li>

            <li>This is a good product.  </li>
            <li>I experienced no pain or infections and im simply impressed with how fast everything has healed.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with results.</li>
            <li>Love This Stuff, Great Wound Dressing, Foot Surgeon Put Me on to it after my surgery, no chance for infection to form, surgeon has tubs of the stuff at his clinic, every household should have it.  </li>

            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing wound healer.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing  but don&#x27;t take my word for it  if you need it you know</li>
            <li>It is amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li>Nice not to have to do the soaking so</li>
            <li>After I read the ingredients, I was sceptical that it would be effective.</li>
            <li>benefit is that it has a nice</li>
            <li>Keep a tube handy at all times.  </li>
            <li>Many good qualities, so skip the Neosporins, hydrogen peroxides, triple antibiotics etc.</li>
            <li>This is really the best stuff for a ulcer ..</li>
            <li>Recommend to anyone trying to heal an ulcer of any kind.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff, better than neosporin, good stuff to add to the first aid kit.  </li>
            <li>Ever since then, which was four years ago, I have had it at my house and have used it with great success.  </li>
            <li>Delighted to discover that it was available from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I found  that it is the best product i have ever used, and it&#x27;s all natural plant extracts.  </li>
            <li>I use it on any type of cut that is more than superficial and have had great success with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;AmeriGel is a great product that is more powerful than Neosporin.</li>
            <li>Well, I purchased this gel in November and, as it is now April, I am happy to report that I avoided long-term sores on my feet by avidly using this gel and covering the bunions with bandaids.</li>
            <li>First got this at the doctors office was so happy that I could get it elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>The first tube I bought was at the suggestion of my podiatrist, after I had a great toenail removed.  </li>
            <li>Its more like a cream than anything.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased.</li>
            <li>I have also used the product on blisters, and the results have been excellent, much better than topical antibiotic gels.    </li>
            <li>I had to go the the doctor to get more medication to counter-act it.</li>
            <li>I just purchased two more tubes - one for me and one to share.  </li>
            <li>Better than others we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>very happy, came recommended from a nurse for some moles I had removed and they were deep wounds..</li>
            <li>my podiatrist calls this her voo-doo magic sauve.  </li>
            <li>Was so glad to find it at Amazon.</li>
            <li>He said that this is what is best until the nail grows back in.</li>
            <li>Okay, I must disclose that it HURT</li>
            <li>I now swear by this stuff and have told many about it - just be prepared for the pain, meaning, take a pain reliever an hour before you change your dressing and apply the Amerigel.</li>
            <li>Ordering more today.</li>
            <li>Much better than anything else on the market.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this because it healed his wounds up in about 4 days.  </li>
            <li>Need I say more?</li>
            <li>This is the best product for healing a deep wound.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and ease of applying.  </li>
            <li>I plan to keep this in my medicine cabinet and will order more when needed</li>
            <li>...glad to be able to get it here.</li>
            <li>Best topical wound antimicrobial.</li>
            <li>safe for cut and wounds</li>
            <li>They disappear like magic.</li>
            <li>im glad i found this product...</li>
            <li>Great diabetic wound care dressing and much cheaper than you can get from a podiatrist.</li>
            <li>I love using this product helps to shorten the healing time of my wounds.</li>
            <li>Because hubby is prone to pressure sores, I always make sure to have a spare tube.</li>
            <li>Excellent for deep wounds.</li>
            <li>I do not find it aids in the healing of wounds any better than without using this product.</li>
            <li>Suppose to be able to use AWD &#x3D;</li>
            <li>I notice a better improvement the cells are healing</li>
            <li>but I am on top of it</li>
            <li>But consider how many Amerigel Wound Dressing you would need if you have to change a wound every 10 hours 2x a day until the would heals up back!nt the cells are healing</li>
            <li>but I am on top of it</li>
            <li>Without the AmerGel I know for sure he would have lost his foot before.</li>
            <li>Check with your physician if ok to use for whatever your condition might be.</li>
            <li>My doctor provided it to me to help the surgical site heal better.</li>
            <li>It exceeds Neosporin by a mile, or more.</li>
            <li>Try it - you will love it.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that promotes fast healing.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>i was so glad i was able to purchase it for them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s great to be able to get it a a much lower price than a DR.s office.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like many others I was referred after getting an ingrown toe nail out.</li>
            <li>My toe got better in about the time frame</li>
            <li>hopefully better with the price tag.</li>
            <li>Put it right on the wound after a good soap cleaning.  </li>
            <li>It really has healing properties!!!!</li>
            <li>I put some on a burn my girlfriend got on the woodstove and it healed so fast it was amazing!</li>
            <li>So glad it was available.</li>
            <li>This gel really does a good job treating them.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how good this stuff really is.</li>
            <li>For those with open sores this is an excellent product, very effective for nodes on hands, elbow, feet that break open and need to be watched for infection</li>
            <li>this healed them up quick (7 days total, NO Scab) , also put on my dogs tummy where she had itchy/hotspots and it worked wonderfully where others (neosporin, BagBalm, Animax) did not.</li>
            <li>This stuff heals things very quickly.</li>
            <li>This product heals wounds very quickly and I am diabetic</li>
            <li>Doctor recommended this for a diabetic ulcer on my husband&#x27;s foot and it healed very quickly.</li>
            <li>Your reward is very quick healing and no risk of infection.</li>
            <li>I have had wounds that did not heal for months, but after applying this ointment they healed up very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I went to the doctor to make sure everything was okay and said I was doing all the right things until I used this product.  </li>
            <li>Pretty amazing if you ask me.</li>
            <li>I have used this product previously and it is wonderful.</li>
            <li>I used it and my toe healed fine</li>
            <li>and whenever I get a cut or scrape, I dab this on and it heals my wound quickly!</li>
            <li>This is soooooo much better than neosporin - it doesn&#x27;t make the skin mooshy - you can leave it on the wound for days (reapplying a new coat when need be) or even weeks - and it makes the skin nicely supple so easier to heal.  </li>
            <li>What a huge difference in healing time, cost and pain.  </li>
            <li>3 OZ tube huge and</li>
            <li>number of people have left glowing reviews for this product, and if it works for them that&#x27;s great, and I don&#x27;t want to knock it for them.</li>
            <li>If you order 3 items they ship priority mail for free.  </li>
            <li>I paid 21.95 per tube and free shipping because I ordered 3 items.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a much stronger and effective neosporin.</li>
            <li>Great product helps healing of open wound quite well.</li>
            <li>and utilize this indispensable healing tool.</li>
            <li>Told my daughter to get some for her husband and their pharmacy didn&#x27;t have any available.  </li>
            <li>Finest wound care product available.</li>
            <li>Amazing how fast it works..</li>
            <li>I have Rheumatoid.. got a ulcer on bottom of left great toe..</li>
            <li>My mother cured an advanced leg ulcer using this cream and taking serrapeptase.  </li>
            <li>(it isn&#x27;t cheap).  </li>
            <li>It will however, with good wound-care nearly remove the threat of infection and promote healing.</li>
            <li>Seems like very useful product.  </li>
            <li>It has never disappointed.</li>
            <li>It contains a unique &amp;#34;oak extract&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Also suggest getting the wound wash to clean the wound before applying the gel.</li>
            <li>Works so well with their optional Amerx Amerigel Wound Wash which blast the wound clean.</li>
            <li>My doctor gave me a tube after partial foot amputation and it did a great job of healing.</li>
            <li>Helps really well on bedsores and burns, used  in many hospitals .</li>
            <li>Seems to be a good product for helping to heal an open sore on foot caused from swelling.  </li>
            <li>It is good for deep wounds.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product not expecting much, but it has helped more than anything else yet</li>
            <li>Of course, I am only about 30 miles from the manufacturer, but just the fact that they shipped the same day I ordered it impressed me.  </li>
            <li>It clears up a wound quickly.  </li>
            <li>The doctors could not believe how quickly the skin was growing over the stitches.</li>
            <li>It makes sores heal so quickly.  </li>
            <li>so you&#x27;ll need to wrap up the wound quickly before it runs off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used extra 4 x 4 inch Guaze pad and over that is 5 x 9 inch extra guaze pad tape up with cloth tape works the best.</li>
            <li>I run out of it quickly because everyone in my family uses it--visitors, too.  </li>
            <li>I also have a surgery wound, two months didn&#x27;t recover, after use this tube only 5 days, much more better, skin got covered and pain release.</li>
            <li>It is a wonderful topical cream for leg ulcers and diabetic open sores.</li>
            <li>Great product highly recommended to us and works better then previous products we have tried</li>
            <li>Great Product, had a sore for months and its half healed in three days...</li>
            <li>I first got this stuff after a foot surgery and have been using it ever since!</li>
            <li>Apparently many people may be sensitive and not realize it.</li>
            <li>We use triple paste now and it works far better.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money for it.</li>
            <li>It is worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years and is manufactured near where I reside but ordering it on line is way cheaper .</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since then, I ordered a fresh tube on Amazon and have used it anywhere I would have used Neosporin...</li>
            <li>Works wells and is worth every penny of the cost....Used it to dress my mom wounds after surgery!!&lt;br /&gt;Go</li>
            <li>Purchased Amerigel right there in their office - they charged me $33.00.  </li>
            <li>I am right now sending a couple of tubes to my neice</li>
            <li>Right after I received this my husband had a severe head injury with lots of stitches.</li>
            <li>Never used because right after I purchased it, a FDA warning came out warning not to use the product.</li>
            <li>THIS RIGHT AWAY</li>
            <li>It says right on the front of the tube, that it is for diabetic&#x27;s foot problems.  </li>
            <li>It is very helpful in healing cuts &amp; wounds quickly.  </li>
            <li>The most recent tube I received was runny oil and not at all useful.  </li>
            <li>I had a deep wound that healed with a very smooth surface.</li>
            <li>I got it originally from my doctor in New York City.  </li>
            <li>I first purchased this product from my podiatrist after having an ingrown toenail removed.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used the protocol given to me by my podiatrist at that time.  </li>
            <li>My husband first used Amerigel Wound Dressing after his Podiatrist provided it to him for a toe infection.</li>
            <li>It truly is the first line of defense when you have a wound.</li>
            <li>Simple and elegant, high-quality.&lt;br /&gt;Value for money.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Another</li>
            <li>Much more aesthetically pleasing than the petroleum based antibiotic ointments I&#x27;ve used historically.</li>
            <li>My first tube was given to me by a surgeon.  </li>
            <li>Everyone needs this in their first aid kit.</li>
            <li>medical honey worked much better</li>
            <li>A  doctor first recommended I use this product about 4 years ago.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well on boos boos.</li>
            <li>The first tube of Amerigel Wound Dressing we bought was at the doctors office.</li>
            <li>I am diabetic and this medicine helps so much!  </li>
            <li>It has worked better than anything for me, for nearly ten years.</li>
            <li>I first got  AmeriGel  Wound Care from my podiatrist ..</li>
            <li>I purchased this product to use for a dog that I adopted who had an infected hot spot on his leg.</li>
            <li>It now is first to use on scrapes and cuts.</li>
            <li>I first used this when I had an ingrown toe nail removed.</li>
            <li>This one works better for the larger wounds that are 4th level</li>
            <li>But consider how many Amerigel Wound Dressing you would need if you have to change a wound every 10 hours 2x a day until the would heals up back!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not shy about recommending it.  </li>
            <li>I first used this cream after I had foot surgery.</li>
            <li>I was using Neosporin at first</li>
            <li>bit by a dog - this dressing ointment healed my leg so fast!</li>
            <li>We first used this when our doctor did a foot operation.  </li>
            <li>It turned bright red and then almost white and was blistering and seeping.  </li>
            <li>THIS STUFF IS MEDICAL MAGIC, SERIOUSLY, REALLY HELPS SURGICAL WOUNDS HEAL.</li>
            <li>Proof is I&#x27;ve seen it work, and the 93% positive reviews add validity to my experience.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I bought this because of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I had taken a gamble on this one and it really paid off very well!</li>
            <li>Good stuff for a small ulcers on a diabetic.</li>
            <li>This is a good ointment for small nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry the ulcers out like most creams do........</li>
            <li>Using 4 x 4 inch Guaze pads to keep dry before applying the Amerigel Would Dressing in a 3x circle pattern to non-stick 2 x 2 inch pads before place that on top of pressure ulcer wound.</li>
            <li>We use it daily and the healing is proceeding just fine.</li>
            <li>Amazing and just need a little bit.</li>
            <li>A good reliable source--AmeriGel can be hard to find.  </li>
            <li>Over priced and does not work very well for pain relief or wound care.</li>
            <li>Really like this sauve.  </li>
            <li>Wounds heal really fast.  </li>
            <li>My toe healed so well and so fast, i couldn&#x27;t believe it.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li>I was also very fascinated watching each stage of the healing process of my wounds.</li>
            <li>didnt really like this.  </li>
            <li>so it really covers and protects.</li>
            <li>Works fast and helps alleviate scaring.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed to see how fast everything has healed after 3 days of use.</li>
            <li>Really works on venous ulcers.  </li>
            <li>Wounds heal much faster than any antibiotic salve I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It seems to make a cut  or pin prick (diabetic )  heal much faster.</li>
            <li>Wound healing process really working.</li>
            <li>If you believe everyone relies on antibiotic creams too much</li>
            <li>If I was not on my foot so much, it would be healed by now.  </li>
            <li>; I didn&#x27;t give it much thought.  </li>
            <li>It definitely sped up the healing and the wound was smooth and healed in about a week.  </li>
            <li>I can really tell that it helps the wounds heal faster.  </li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>Felt immediate relief when applying Amerigel Wound dressing and within 2 days was much improved.  </li>
            <li>and it was very infected as they do get.</li>
            <li>Wounds heal fast and don&#x27;t get infected.</li>
            <li>High recommended!</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t think much of it and went to sleep with the gel on the burn under a bandage.  </li>
            <li>Also, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s job at least as good as competitors...</li>
            <li>Heals wounds better than any other product, including burns.</li>
            <li>Used three tubes over last five years and excellent product even for slow( eg: Diabetic ) healers, only a thin layer is best, always keep wound protected and with a clean gauze dressing, well worth the expense if you are taking wound healing seriously</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what the ingredient is that helps heal---but it&#x27;s AMAZING....</li>
            <li>so I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>By the next day any pain is gone, and it heals quickly.  </li>
            <li>the sores healed steadily.</li>
            <li>once bleeding stops  scab appears later quick healing</li>
            <li>Podiatrist kept trying different things, I finally did some research on my own and found I needed to take more extreme measures to offload the pressure from toe wound and used the Amerigel only.</li>
            <li>This was a great price for a product we have used frequently in the past but purchased from a local pharmacy.</li>
            <li>Would highly  recommend .</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it..</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It works like a charm and has been a great help to my husband who had a difficult skin rash on his leg that was not healing until this product was applied.</li>
            <li>I bought this to treat skin problems, and it really did clear up everything.  </li>
            <li>Spotting on the gauze dressing was also a normal part of the healing process.</li>
            <li>Kills resistant bacteria, eats up dead tissue, and has activity against most, yeast, molds and fungus.</li>
            <li>and then I found the tube of Amerigel in my medicine cabinet, saw it was for open wounds, and thought \\&quot;What the heck, it&#x27;s worth a try.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>Once they break down they really need to be clean the wound again and refresh the product along with new</li>
            <li>My mom recently used it, with the doctor&#x27;s approval, on a surgical wound she had and it really healed the area fast.</li>
            <li>I used Amerigel Wound Dressing on two with great results and used a generic triple antibiotic ointment on two with poor results.  </li>
            <li>Very surprised</li>
            <li>When I woke up the burn hurt more than it had been and it had several new tiny red lesions on it.  </li>
            <li>other person left a comment talking about how much better Amerigel worked than neosporin and hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>The only first aid stuff I had in the house was AmeriGel, which I used for some sores on my dog.</li>
            <li>I bought my first tube of this in December 2013, and just purchased my second.  </li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>I ordered this gel after scalding myself with hot coffee and receiving a 2nd degree burn.  </li>
            <li>still give Amerigel Wound Dressing 5x Stars since the product does heal wounds with the two active ingredients, but if you have larger wound I do recommend getting Medline Silvasorb 3 oz or better yet</li>
            <li>still give Amerigel Wound Dressing 5x Stars since the product does heal wounds with the two active ingredients, but if you have larger wound I do recommend getting Medline Silvasorb 3 oz or better yet</li>
            <li>I may have expected too much too fast!</li>
            <li>Then he an unexpected,unrelated medical problem with the foot itself, which required surgery, leaving a large surgical wound.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There was a slight difference with this purchase, as the cream is now a lot thinner than the original tube I bought when I had my foot surgery.  </li>
            <li>This is a great way to treat open wounds, it heals from the inside out, debriding away dead skin and waste in the process.</li>
            <li>and it works as well with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I shopped around and found the cheapest way is to buy it directly from the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>It has been one week and almost completely healed.</li>
            <li>I use it on everything that involves open skin or a bug bite and it heals amazingly fast.</li>
            <li>Amerigel uses natural ingredients from oak tree acorns to draw the healing properties of your body to heal wounds and sores.</li>
            <li>I know someone I purchased this for who is diabetic approx 70 years old.</li>
            <li>Promotes natural healing.</li>
            <li>My daughter tore a finger nail nearly off.</li>
            <li>has really helped to make them smaller and heal.</li>
            <li>Protects and covers open wound very well</li>
            <li>I also use this with Eras Natural Sciences Wound Honey -80g tube (optional</li>
            <li>It really covers the open wound with the silver (blue/clear) gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 10 hours of change the wound</li>
            <li>she&#x27;s 100 years old.</li>
            <li>she&#x27;s 100 years old.</li>
            <li>All are surprised at the results.  </li>
            <li>Then the supermarket near the doctor&#x27;s office began carrying it.  </li>
            <li>and you would like something natural, try AmeriGel.  </li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>Natural products are the way to go.</li>
            <li>Within a week the sores were nearly gone.</li>
            <li>Nothing was seeming to budge it much once I managed to kill the staph infection with various herbs, bentonite clay, activated charcoal and whatever else I was trying, including Manuka honey and ozonated olive oil.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this with little hope that it would work but after a week, I saw significant improvement.  </li>
            <li>On a couple of occasions, when I did develop small sores, they were very quickly healed using this product.</li>
            <li>Would recommend this to anyone for cuts, scrapes or more serious skin infections.</li>
            <li>I have purchased several tubes and highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it to everyone who has open wounds from those two problems.</li>
            <li>The product was delivered when expected and was exactly as it was described.  </li>
            <li>I followed the dermatologist&#x27;s orders, daily cleaning, use 100% pure white petroleum to keep wound moist to promote healing, cover.</li>
            <li>She had an allergic reaction to it and was left with a large stage 2 bedsore on her back for months!  </li>
            <li>stuff works like no other to rapidly heal wounds A++++</li>
            <li>It is no longer an open wound and well on its way to being completely healed!  </li>
            <li>It heals wounds, and helps prevent scarring like no other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This is a little spendy---but--well worth your investment.  </li>
            <li>I first found out about this topical wound dressing from a local doctor after I had minor surgery.</li>
            <li>She said the pain was gone in 20 minutes and in 3 days there was barely any evidence of it at all.</li>
            <li>Plus I&#x27;ve found occasional follow up with the Amerigel keeps the callous from reforming and the skin stays soft.</li>
            <li>It has completely removed the eschar and is starting to close the wound.</li>
            <li>When I flexed my hand the wound would tear open, Amerigel softened the skin around the wound and helped it to completely heal.</li>
            <li>and I use it on her and the next day, it is completely gone.</li>
            <li>It was supposed to be the same &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; gel I got from my podiatrist few years ago, but for some reason it is 50% less effective on my recent burn.</li>
            <li>Their service - you can actually communicate directly with their product specialist who is also a nurse, and they will be very specific to your wound in their responses...</li>
            <li>It is much stronger than other topical antibiotics I had tried.  </li>
            <li>This product came highly recommended, from other professionals so we use it.</li>
            <li>It was incredibly expensive compared to diaper creams and worked far less effectively.</li>
            <li>Hard to find this stuff, but worth getting it when you can.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Neosporin may be generally good, but my ex was allergic to sulfa based drugs, and a pharmacist told her Neosporin causes problems for people who are allergic to sulfa based drugs (even though there is nothing on the packaging which would tell a lay-person that Neosporin is a problem for people with sulfa allergies).  </li>
            <li> My ex uses Bacitracin Zink with good results:</li>
            <li> At a post-op checkup with the surgeon, he said to me, \\&quot;That&#x27;s Good</li>

            <li> Amazing wound healer.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing  but don&#x27;t take my word for it  if you need it you know</li>
            <li> It is amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li> Nice not to have to do the soaking so</li>
            <li> After I read the ingredients, I was sceptical that it would be effective.</li>
            <li> benefit is that it has a nice</li>
            <li> Keep a tube handy at all times.  </li>
            <li> Many good qualities, so skip the Neosporins, hydrogen peroxides, triple antibiotics etc.</li>
            <li> This is really the best stuff for a ulcer ..</li>
            <li> Recommend to anyone trying to heal an ulcer of any kind.  </li>
            <li> Great stuff, better than neosporin, good stuff to add to the first aid kit.  </li>
            <li> Ever since then, which was four years ago, I have had it at my house and have used it with great success.  </li>
            <li> Delighted to discover that it was available from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I found  that it is the best product i have ever used, and it&#x27;s all natural plant extracts.  </li>
            <li> I use it on any type of cut that is more than superficial and have had great success with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;AmeriGel is a great product that is more powerful than Neosporin.</li>
            <li> Well, I purchased this gel in November and, as it is now April, I am happy to report that I avoided long-term sores on my feet by avidly using this gel and covering the bunions with bandaids.</li>
            <li> First got this at the doctors office was so happy that I could get it elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> The first tube I bought was at the suggestion of my podiatrist, after I had a great toenail removed.  </li>
            <li> Its more like a cream than anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased.</li>
            <li> I have also used the product on blisters, and the results have been excellent, much better than topical antibiotic gels.    </li>
            <li> I had to go the the doctor to get more medication to counter-act it.</li>
            <li> I just purchased two more tubes - one for me and one to share.  </li>
            <li> Better than others we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> very happy, came recommended from a nurse for some moles I had removed and they were deep wounds..</li>
            <li> my podiatrist calls this her voo-doo magic sauve.  </li>
            <li> Was so glad to find it at Amazon.</li>
            <li> He said that this is what is best until the nail grows back in.</li>
            <li> Okay, I must disclose that it HURT</li>
            <li> I now swear by this stuff and have told many about it - just be prepared for the pain, meaning, take a pain reliever an hour before you change your dressing and apply the Amerigel.</li>
            <li> Ordering more today.</li>
            <li> Much better than anything else on the market.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this because it healed his wounds up in about 4 days.  </li>
            <li> Need I say more?</li>
            <li> This is the best product for healing a deep wound.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell and ease of applying.  </li>
            <li> I plan to keep this in my medicine cabinet and will order more when needed</li>
            <li> ...glad to be able to get it here.</li>
            <li> Best topical wound antimicrobial.</li>
            <li> safe for cut and wounds</li>
            <li> They disappear like magic.</li>
            <li> im glad i found this product...</li>
            <li> Great diabetic wound care dressing and much cheaper than you can get from a podiatrist.</li>
            <li> I love using this product helps to shorten the healing time of my wounds.</li>
            <li> Because hubby is prone to pressure sores, I always make sure to have a spare tube.</li>
            <li> Excellent for deep wounds.</li>
            <li> I do not find it aids in the healing of wounds any better than without using this product.</li>
            <li> Suppose to be able to use AWD &#x3D;</li>
            <li> I notice a better improvement the cells are healing</li>
            <li> but I am on top of it</li>
            <li> But consider how many Amerigel Wound Dressing you would need if you have to change a wound every 10 hours 2x a day until the would heals up back!nt the cells are healing</li>
            <li> but I am on top of it</li>
            <li> Without the AmerGel I know for sure he would have lost his foot before.</li>
            <li> Check with your physician if ok to use for whatever your condition might be.</li>
            <li> My doctor provided it to me to help the surgical site heal better.</li>
            <li> It exceeds Neosporin by a mile, or more.</li>
            <li> Try it - you will love it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that promotes fast healing.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> i was so glad i was able to purchase it for them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s great to be able to get it a a much lower price than a DR.s office.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like many others I was referred after getting an ingrown toe nail out.</li>
            <li> My toe got better in about the time frame</li>
            <li> hopefully better with the price tag.</li>
            <li> Put it right on the wound after a good soap cleaning.  </li>
            <li> It really has healing properties!!!!</li>
            <li> I put some on a burn my girlfriend got on the woodstove and it healed so fast it was amazing!</li>
            <li> So glad it was available.</li>
            <li> This gel really does a good job treating them.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how good this stuff really is.</li>
            <li> For those with open sores this is an excellent product, very effective for nodes on hands, elbow, feet that break open and need to be watched for infection</li>
            <li> this healed them up quick (7 days total, NO Scab) , also put on my dogs tummy where she had itchy/hotspots and it worked wonderfully where others (neosporin, BagBalm, Animax) did not.</li>
            <li> This stuff heals things very quickly.</li>
            <li> This product heals wounds very quickly and I am diabetic</li>
            <li> Doctor recommended this for a diabetic ulcer on my husband&#x27;s foot and it healed very quickly.</li>
            <li> Your reward is very quick healing and no risk of infection.</li>
            <li> I have had wounds that did not heal for months, but after applying this ointment they healed up very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I went to the doctor to make sure everything was okay and said I was doing all the right things until I used this product.  </li>
            <li> Pretty amazing if you ask me.</li>
            <li> I have used this product previously and it is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I used it and my toe healed fine</li>
            <li> and whenever I get a cut or scrape, I dab this on and it heals my wound quickly!</li>
            <li> This is soooooo much better than neosporin - it doesn&#x27;t make the skin mooshy - you can leave it on the wound for days (reapplying a new coat when need be) or even weeks - and it makes the skin nicely supple so easier to heal.  </li>
            <li> What a huge difference in healing time, cost and pain.  </li>
            <li> 3 OZ tube huge and</li>
            <li> number of people have left glowing reviews for this product, and if it works for them that&#x27;s great, and I don&#x27;t want to knock it for them.</li>
            <li> If you order 3 items they ship priority mail for free.  </li>
            <li> I paid 21.95 per tube and free shipping because I ordered 3 items.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a much stronger and effective neosporin.</li>
            <li> Great product helps healing of open wound quite well.</li>
            <li> and utilize this indispensable healing tool.</li>
            <li> Told my daughter to get some for her husband and their pharmacy didn&#x27;t have any available.  </li>
            <li> Finest wound care product available.</li>
            <li> Amazing how fast it works..</li>
            <li> I have Rheumatoid.. got a ulcer on bottom of left great toe..</li>
            <li> My mother cured an advanced leg ulcer using this cream and taking serrapeptase.  </li>
            <li> (it isn&#x27;t cheap).  </li>
            <li> It will however, with good wound-care nearly remove the threat of infection and promote healing.</li>
            <li> Seems like very useful product.  </li>
            <li> It has never disappointed.</li>
            <li> It contains a unique &amp;#34;oak extract&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Also suggest getting the wound wash to clean the wound before applying the gel.</li>
            <li> Works so well with their optional Amerx Amerigel Wound Wash which blast the wound clean.</li>
            <li> My doctor gave me a tube after partial foot amputation and it did a great job of healing.</li>
            <li> Helps really well on bedsores and burns, used  in many hospitals .</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good product for helping to heal an open sore on foot caused from swelling.  </li>
            <li> It is good for deep wounds.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product not expecting much, but it has helped more than anything else yet</li>
            <li> Of course, I am only about 30 miles from the manufacturer, but just the fact that they shipped the same day I ordered it impressed me.  </li>
            <li> It clears up a wound quickly.  </li>
            <li> The doctors could not believe how quickly the skin was growing over the stitches.</li>
            <li> It makes sores heal so quickly.  </li>
            <li> so you&#x27;ll need to wrap up the wound quickly before it runs off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used extra 4 x 4 inch Guaze pad and over that is 5 x 9 inch extra guaze pad tape up with cloth tape works the best.</li>
            <li> I run out of it quickly because everyone in my family uses it--visitors, too.  </li>
            <li> I also have a surgery wound, two months didn&#x27;t recover, after use this tube only 5 days, much more better, skin got covered and pain release.</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful topical cream for leg ulcers and diabetic open sores.</li>
            <li> Great product highly recommended to us and works better then previous products we have tried</li>
            <li> Great Product, had a sore for months and its half healed in three days...</li>
            <li> I first got this stuff after a foot surgery and have been using it ever since!</li>
            <li> Apparently many people may be sensitive and not realize it.</li>
            <li> We use triple paste now and it works far better.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money for it.</li>
            <li> It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and is manufactured near where I reside but ordering it on line is way cheaper .</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since then, I ordered a fresh tube on Amazon and have used it anywhere I would have used Neosporin...</li>
            <li> Works wells and is worth every penny of the cost....Used it to dress my mom wounds after surgery!!&lt;br /&gt;Go</li>
            <li> Purchased Amerigel right there in their office - they charged me $33.00.  </li>
            <li> I am right now sending a couple of tubes to my neice</li>
            <li> Right after I received this my husband had a severe head injury with lots of stitches.</li>
            <li> Never used because right after I purchased it, a FDA warning came out warning not to use the product.</li>
            <li> THIS RIGHT AWAY</li>
            <li> It says right on the front of the tube, that it is for diabetic&#x27;s foot problems.  </li>
            <li> It is very helpful in healing cuts &amp; wounds quickly.  </li>
            <li> The most recent tube I received was runny oil and not at all useful.  </li>
            <li> I had a deep wound that healed with a very smooth surface.</li>
            <li> I got it originally from my doctor in New York City.  </li>
            <li> I first purchased this product from my podiatrist after having an ingrown toenail removed.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used the protocol given to me by my podiatrist at that time.  </li>
            <li> My husband first used Amerigel Wound Dressing after his Podiatrist provided it to him for a toe infection.</li>
            <li> It truly is the first line of defense when you have a wound.</li>
            <li> Simple and elegant, high-quality.&lt;br /&gt;Value for money.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Another</li>
            <li> Much more aesthetically pleasing than the petroleum based antibiotic ointments I&#x27;ve used historically.</li>
            <li> My first tube was given to me by a surgeon.  </li>
            <li> Everyone needs this in their first aid kit.</li>
            <li> medical honey worked much better</li>
            <li> A  doctor first recommended I use this product about 4 years ago.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well on boos boos.</li>
            <li> The first tube of Amerigel Wound Dressing we bought was at the doctors office.</li>
            <li> I am diabetic and this medicine helps so much!  </li>
            <li> It has worked better than anything for me, for nearly ten years.</li>
            <li> I first got  AmeriGel  Wound Care from my podiatrist ..</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to use for a dog that I adopted who had an infected hot spot on his leg.</li>
            <li> It now is first to use on scrapes and cuts.</li>
            <li> I first used this when I had an ingrown toe nail removed.</li>
            <li> This one works better for the larger wounds that are 4th level</li>
            <li> But consider how many Amerigel Wound Dressing you would need if you have to change a wound every 10 hours 2x a day until the would heals up back!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not shy about recommending it.  </li>
            <li> I first used this cream after I had foot surgery.</li>
            <li> I was using Neosporin at first</li>
            <li> bit by a dog - this dressing ointment healed my leg so fast!</li>
            <li> We first used this when our doctor did a foot operation.  </li>
            <li> It turned bright red and then almost white and was blistering and seeping.  </li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS MEDICAL MAGIC, SERIOUSLY, REALLY HELPS SURGICAL WOUNDS HEAL.</li>
            <li> Proof is I&#x27;ve seen it work, and the 93% positive reviews add validity to my experience.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I had taken a gamble on this one and it really paid off very well!</li>
            <li> Good stuff for a small ulcers on a diabetic.</li>
            <li> This is a good ointment for small nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry the ulcers out like most creams do........</li>
            <li> Using 4 x 4 inch Guaze pads to keep dry before applying the Amerigel Would Dressing in a 3x circle pattern to non-stick 2 x 2 inch pads before place that on top of pressure ulcer wound.</li>
            <li> We use it daily and the healing is proceeding just fine.</li>
            <li> Amazing and just need a little bit.</li>
            <li> A good reliable source--AmeriGel can be hard to find.  </li>
            <li> Over priced and does not work very well for pain relief or wound care.</li>
            <li> Really like this sauve.  </li>
            <li> Wounds heal really fast.  </li>
            <li> My toe healed so well and so fast, i couldn&#x27;t believe it.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li> I was also very fascinated watching each stage of the healing process of my wounds.</li>
            <li> didnt really like this.  </li>
            <li> so it really covers and protects.</li>
            <li> Works fast and helps alleviate scaring.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed to see how fast everything has healed after 3 days of use.</li>
            <li> Really works on venous ulcers.  </li>
            <li> Wounds heal much faster than any antibiotic salve I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It seems to make a cut  or pin prick (diabetic )  heal much faster.</li>
            <li> Wound healing process really working.</li>
            <li> If you believe everyone relies on antibiotic creams too much</li>
            <li> If I was not on my foot so much, it would be healed by now.  </li>
            <li> ; I didn&#x27;t give it much thought.  </li>
            <li> It definitely sped up the healing and the wound was smooth and healed in about a week.  </li>
            <li> I can really tell that it helps the wounds heal faster.  </li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> Felt immediate relief when applying Amerigel Wound dressing and within 2 days was much improved.  </li>
            <li> and it was very infected as they do get.</li>
            <li> Wounds heal fast and don&#x27;t get infected.</li>
            <li> High recommended!</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t think much of it and went to sleep with the gel on the burn under a bandage.  </li>
            <li> Also, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s job at least as good as competitors...</li>
            <li> Heals wounds better than any other product, including burns.</li>
            <li> Used three tubes over last five years and excellent product even for slow( eg: Diabetic ) healers, only a thin layer is best, always keep wound protected and with a clean gauze dressing, well worth the expense if you are taking wound healing seriously</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the ingredient is that helps heal---but it&#x27;s AMAZING....</li>
            <li> so I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> By the next day any pain is gone, and it heals quickly.  </li>
            <li> the sores healed steadily.</li>
            <li> once bleeding stops  scab appears later quick healing</li>
            <li> Podiatrist kept trying different things, I finally did some research on my own and found I needed to take more extreme measures to offload the pressure from toe wound and used the Amerigel only.</li>
            <li> This was a great price for a product we have used frequently in the past but purchased from a local pharmacy.</li>
            <li> Would highly  recommend .</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it..</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It works like a charm and has been a great help to my husband who had a difficult skin rash on his leg that was not healing until this product was applied.</li>
            <li> I bought this to treat skin problems, and it really did clear up everything.  </li>
            <li> Spotting on the gauze dressing was also a normal part of the healing process.</li>
            <li> Kills resistant bacteria, eats up dead tissue, and has activity against most, yeast, molds and fungus.</li>
            <li> and then I found the tube of Amerigel in my medicine cabinet, saw it was for open wounds, and thought \\&quot;What the heck, it&#x27;s worth a try.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Once they break down they really need to be clean the wound again and refresh the product along with new</li>
            <li> My mom recently used it, with the doctor&#x27;s approval, on a surgical wound she had and it really healed the area fast.</li>
            <li> I used Amerigel Wound Dressing on two with great results and used a generic triple antibiotic ointment on two with poor results.  </li>
            <li> Very surprised</li>
            <li> When I woke up the burn hurt more than it had been and it had several new tiny red lesions on it.  </li>
            <li> other person left a comment talking about how much better Amerigel worked than neosporin and hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> The only first aid stuff I had in the house was AmeriGel, which I used for some sores on my dog.</li>
            <li> I bought my first tube of this in December 2013, and just purchased my second.  </li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> I ordered this gel after scalding myself with hot coffee and receiving a 2nd degree burn.  </li>
            <li> still give Amerigel Wound Dressing 5x Stars since the product does heal wounds with the two active ingredients, but if you have larger wound I do recommend getting Medline Silvasorb 3 oz or better yet</li>
            <li> still give Amerigel Wound Dressing 5x Stars since the product does heal wounds with the two active ingredients, but if you have larger wound I do recommend getting Medline Silvasorb 3 oz or better yet</li>
            <li> I may have expected too much too fast!</li>
            <li> Then he an unexpected,unrelated medical problem with the foot itself, which required surgery, leaving a large surgical wound.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There was a slight difference with this purchase, as the cream is now a lot thinner than the original tube I bought when I had my foot surgery.  </li>
            <li> This is a great way to treat open wounds, it heals from the inside out, debriding away dead skin and waste in the process.</li>
            <li> and it works as well with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I shopped around and found the cheapest way is to buy it directly from the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> It has been one week and almost completely healed.</li>
            <li> I use it on everything that involves open skin or a bug bite and it heals amazingly fast.</li>
            <li> Amerigel uses natural ingredients from oak tree acorns to draw the healing properties of your body to heal wounds and sores.</li>
            <li> I know someone I purchased this for who is diabetic approx 70 years old.</li>
            <li> Promotes natural healing.</li>
            <li> My daughter tore a finger nail nearly off.</li>
            <li> has really helped to make them smaller and heal.</li>
            <li> Protects and covers open wound very well</li>
            <li> I also use this with Eras Natural Sciences Wound Honey -80g tube (optional</li>
            <li> It really covers the open wound with the silver (blue/clear) gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 10 hours of change the wound</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s 100 years old.</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s 100 years old.</li>
            <li> All are surprised at the results.  </li>
            <li> Then the supermarket near the doctor&#x27;s office began carrying it.  </li>
            <li> and you would like something natural, try AmeriGel.  </li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> Natural products are the way to go.</li>
            <li> Within a week the sores were nearly gone.</li>
            <li> Nothing was seeming to budge it much once I managed to kill the staph infection with various herbs, bentonite clay, activated charcoal and whatever else I was trying, including Manuka honey and ozonated olive oil.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this with little hope that it would work but after a week, I saw significant improvement.  </li>
            <li> On a couple of occasions, when I did develop small sores, they were very quickly healed using this product.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this to anyone for cuts, scrapes or more serious skin infections.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several tubes and highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it to everyone who has open wounds from those two problems.</li>
            <li> The product was delivered when expected and was exactly as it was described.  </li>
            <li> I followed the dermatologist&#x27;s orders, daily cleaning, use 100% pure white petroleum to keep wound moist to promote healing, cover.</li>
            <li> She had an allergic reaction to it and was left with a large stage 2 bedsore on her back for months!  </li>
            <li> stuff works like no other to rapidly heal wounds A++++</li>
            <li> It is no longer an open wound and well on its way to being completely healed!  </li>
            <li> It heals wounds, and helps prevent scarring like no other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is a little spendy---but--well worth your investment.  </li>
            <li> I first found out about this topical wound dressing from a local doctor after I had minor surgery.</li>
            <li> She said the pain was gone in 20 minutes and in 3 days there was barely any evidence of it at all.</li>
            <li> Plus I&#x27;ve found occasional follow up with the Amerigel keeps the callous from reforming and the skin stays soft.</li>
            <li> It has completely removed the eschar and is starting to close the wound.</li>
            <li> When I flexed my hand the wound would tear open, Amerigel softened the skin around the wound and helped it to completely heal.</li>
            <li> and I use it on her and the next day, it is completely gone.</li>
            <li> It was supposed to be the same &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; gel I got from my podiatrist few years ago, but for some reason it is 50% less effective on my recent burn.</li>
            <li> Their service - you can actually communicate directly with their product specialist who is also a nurse, and they will be very specific to your wound in their responses...</li>
            <li> It is much stronger than other topical antibiotics I had tried.  </li>
            <li> This product came highly recommended, from other professionals so we use it.</li>
            <li> It was incredibly expensive compared to diaper creams and worked far less effectively.</li>
            <li> Hard to find this stuff, but worth getting it when you can.</li>
            <li> My problem was that the skin didn&#x27;t want to regenerate and it was awfully hard to keep on top of the pain.&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow I have been using this product for maybe a week and its starting to get some skin over the raw areas</li>
            <li> It is a thick gel, so it won&#x27;t get down into a deep puncture wound - you will need to kill germs with peroxide or iodine (something very liquid) first,  then dry and apply the Amerigel ointment.</li>
            <li> but it really works and helps heals even small open wounds like cat scratches.</li>
            <li> It took a long time to heal but after several months it did heal up.  </li>
            <li> I fell onto my knees and took off a pretty thick layer of flesh in the process.</li>
            <li> Recommend it highly to anyone, especially someone with thin, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Although the packaging is different than my other Amerigel, this is the same company and ointment.</li>
            <li> Just some thoughts on that from my decidedly non-medical opinion; Ear-piercing shops tell you to not clean the newly pierced ears with hydrogen peroxide, as it will not only kill the bad bacteria, but will damage the healthy tissue as well, and prevent healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other medical professionals tell me they have flat out</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my doctor for treating a minor wound.  </li>
            <li> It seems to promote healing for scrapes, cuts, and minor injuries.  </li>
            <li> I am avoiding surgery because the bunions really do not hurt - only causing pressure sores when I continuously wear closed-toed shoes, which happens every winter.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s Podiatrist sent her home with Amerigel for a minor surgery.</li>
            <li> As result of an injury a long time ago I spend my time on a three wheeled scooter.  </li>
            <li> I have had a long battle with a venous leg ulcer.  </li>
            <li> Working on clearing up a blister on the back of his leg now that is about 2&amp;#34; long and 1 &amp;#34; wide.</li>
            <li> Even with simple gauze dressings Amerigel healed one and kept the other pressure ulcer under control.</li>
            <li> The nail bed healed at least twice as fast, bleeding was minimal, and pain almost nonexistent.  </li>
            <li> So if you have kiddos that fall down a lot of even yourself and pets, I would definitely suggest this for you and your family.</li>
            <li> I was using several other ointments to try and heal my leg and prevent any infection, nothing worked until purchased this!</li>
            <li> I also use the wash with it for a wet to dry dressing.</li>
            <li> In frustration I took out this gel and carefully applied it to the cut.  </li>
            <li> Must use plenty and keep the wound wet with the Amerigel under the bandage, bandaid.  </li>
            <li> Cant beat the price  , a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little Amerigel goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it was due to shipping in summertime and product melted but was definitely not the consistency I had expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Above link lists the recall reason as &amp;#34;Product may not have been manufactured pursuant to a validated process protocol and CGMP.&amp;#34;  Other recall information I received repeats this, and goes on to state &amp;#34;packaging contained non-approved labeling claims (antimicrobial and autolytic debridement).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (among other things).</li>
            <li> Since then I&#x27;ve started using on other leg wounds which would get infected even with name-brand antibiotic ointment.</li>
            <li> Can be used on small open wounds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product several times over the past couple of years.  </li>
            <li> I have 3 small sores on my left leg that had not healed in over 6 months.  </li>
            <li> only have one small issue is this Amerigel Wound Dressing.</li>
            <li> This product works extremely well on cuts.  </li>
            <li> My  Dad has chronic non healing/slow healing foot ulcers due to diabetes, is cream</li>
            <li> Wound Dressing 1 oz just too small of tube and opening for larger wounds.</li>
            <li> No more buying 4 tubes when we go back home.</li>
            <li> Especially since I usually take all they have on the shelf.</li>
            <li> Like a lot of other reviewers, I received a tube of this gel after ingrown toenail surgery about a two years ago.  </li>
            <li> This may have just been an allergic reaction (I have never had any allergic reaction to any other medication/cream)  </li>
            <li> I was just extremely dissatisfied with the product itself.</li>
            <li> I may have to try their other things.  </li>
            <li> Use it sparingly a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> And a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> I have CMT and wounds below my waist take a long time to heal and usually get infected.</li>
            <li> Blood circulation is very low in my damaged foot so the wound is slow healing.</li>
            <li> Amerigel Wound Dressing having the properties of hydrogel really helped closing and healing a bad abrasion wound on the back of my hand.</li>
            <li> Besides, it was half the price of the previous ointment I had tried.  </li>
            <li> I did sometimes feel a slight sting, as others have mentioned.</li>
            <li> In less then 30 days of using AmeriGel</li>
            <li> This has almost healed my sore in about 3 months or less.  </li>
            <li> Burns a little, but that just means it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, he had to have his stitches removed early!</li>
            <li> This blister opened up a little over a week ago and already scabbing over.</li>
            <li> I still have a little scar but that is to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I expect it to be 100% in a few days.</li>
            <li> I told him to buy and use Amerigel, and in a few days, he was healed.  </li>
            <li> It will not heal wounds that are due to secondary causes like pressure wounds in patients that don&#x27;t posses sensation and repeatedly cause trauma.</li>
            <li> This product did not close my wound, I have been using fro a past few week and no change.</li>
            <li> For me though, I&#x27;ve used it on small cuts and scrapes, and it in my opinion it hasn&#x27;t seemed to help in any way.</li>
            <li> not sure how, but it does.</li>
            <li> Then  I remembered using this gel for a past ulcer on my foot from years ago.</li>
            <li> unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I know it has saved me trips to the doctor by killing small skin infections.</li>
            <li> This product was difficult to find in local drug stores.</li>
            <li> That means that small nicks and cuts</li>
            <li> No more pain.</li>
            <li> Helps with healing all wounds, without excessive antibiotic use</li>
            <li> Unbelievable speed in healing.</li>
            <li> worked no better than OTC antibiotic ointments</li>
            <li> stopped using Neosporin because sulfa sensitivities are so common.</li>
            <li> Fighting an allergic reaction can complicate the healing process, to say the least.</li>
            <li> It prevented  secondary infection on an ulcer.  </li>
            <li> He lasted well into his 80&#x27;s because he knew how to deal with health problems, including slow or no healing wounds.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s thick</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a doctor for a slow healing diabetic wound.</li>
            <li> Using the Amerigel cut the healing time in half, was less expensive than buying the other 3 items and was much less painful to use.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why this stuff is not better known!</li>
            <li> It takes a very small amount to work.  </li>
            <li> It is a little expensive</li>
            <li> Very very slow healing.</li>
            <li> I have poor circulation in my legs and am prone to infection.</li>
            <li> I would recomend it to anyone who has sores that heal poorly.</li>
            <li> You had to ask the pharmacist to fetch it for you from behind the counter</li>
            <li> Would recommend it to anyone with difficult abrasions for healing.</li>
            <li> I knew I couldn&#x27;t afford to provide the expensive foam-pad dressings after I brought the patient home, so I searched for and found Amerigel at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I had a weird rash under my breasts with an oozing sore.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did not work for my condition.</li>
            <li> When I had my cheecks waxed, the technician unfortunately took off a layer of skin in a couple of places.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong by using this product!</li>
            <li> It was also impossible to find at the corner drugstore.</li>
            <li> Then about a month ago I got a really bad sunburn on my cheek where I was using a Hydroquinone product.  </li>
            <li> Once I had a painful cut on the side of my mouth that wouldn&#x27;t heal for days.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed with purchase&lt;br /&gt;Did</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a physician, buy it, you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy.</li>
            <li> twice a day - very painful!  </li>
            <li> A podiatrist turned me on to it years ago when I had terrible blisters on a foot.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Cannot use Neosporin so this is my only option and it works as well with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I first found out about this topical wound dressing from a local doctor after I had minor surgery. Ever since then, which was four years ago, I have had it at my house and have used it with great success.  It is much stronger than other topical antibiotics I had tried.  My mom recently used it, with the doctor&#x27;s approval, on a surgical wound she had and it really healed the area fast. We love this product!</li>
            <li> got this for my father who gets diabetic ulcers on his feet from time to time.  This gel really does a good job treating them.  It doesn&#x27;t dry the ulcers out like most creams do........it gives the wound time to heal on it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li> Over priced and does not work very well for pain relief or wound care. Its more like a cream than anything.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, this product actually did what it claimed to do.  I&#x27;m glad I purchased.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  Quite a bit stronger than Neosporin.  Burns a little, but that just means it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Really like this sauve.  It works well.</li>
            <li> FDA Recall on this product: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfres/res.cfm?id&#x3D;128030&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Above link lists the recall reason as &amp;#34;Product may not have been manufactured pursuant to a validated process protocol and CGMP.&amp;#34;  Other recall information I received repeats this, and goes on to state &amp;#34;packaging contained non-approved labeling claims (antimicrobial and autolytic debridement).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A number of people have left glowing reviews for this product, and if it works for them that&#x27;s great, and I don&#x27;t want to knock it for them. For me though, I&#x27;ve used it on small cuts and scrapes, and it in my opinion it hasn&#x27;t seemed to help in any way. Maybe this isn&#x27;t the intended use of this product; I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other person left a comment talking about how much better Amerigel worked than neosporin and hydrogen peroxide. (among other things). Just some thoughts on that from my decidedly non-medical opinion; Ear-piercing shops tell you to not clean the newly pierced ears with hydrogen peroxide, as it will not only kill the bad bacteria, but will damage the healthy tissue as well, and prevent healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neosporin may be generally good, but my ex was allergic to sulfa based drugs, and a pharmacist told her Neosporin causes problems for people who are allergic to sulfa based drugs (even though there is nothing on the packaging which would tell a lay-person that Neosporin is a problem for people with sulfa allergies).  I&#x27;ve had other medical professionals tell me they have flat out stopped using Neosporin because sulfa sensitivities are so common. Apparently many people may be sensitive and not realize it. Fighting an allergic reaction can complicate the healing process, to say the least. My ex uses Bacitracin Zink with good results: http://www.amazon.com/Dynarex-Bacitracin-Zinc-Ointment-Tube/dp/B004UVX6H4/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1420525854&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;bacitracin</li>
            <li> My podiatrist recommended this product when I had a toenail removed in 2007.  I opted for soaking in water and antibacterial soap.  In 2008 I had another nail removed, and this time used the Amerigel.  Wow!  The nail bed healed at least twice as fast, bleeding was minimal, and pain almost nonexistent.  I have also used the product on blisters, and the results have been excellent, much better than topical antibiotic gels.    Highest recommendation.</li>
            <li> For those with open sores this is an excellent product, very effective for nodes on hands, elbow, feet that break open and need to be watched for infection</li>
            <li> This is a great source for AmeriGel, which is the one thing that I keep in my medicine cabinet at all times.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works like no other to rapidly heal wounds A++++</li>
            <li> It turns out I am allergic to the would dressing and  it burned and my toe&lt;br /&gt;got very red.  I had to go the the doctor to get more medication to counter-act it.</li>
            <li> Helps really well on bedsores and burns, used  in many hospitals . Would highly  recommend . Cant beat the price  , a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is the best &amp;#34;healer&amp;#34; cream there is!  Wounds heal really fast.  I had in-grown toenails removed and the podiatrist&#x27;s office said to soak my foot for five days, but if i used Amerigel as the bandage ointment, then only 2 days would i need to soak it.  Purchased Amerigel right there in their office - they charged me $33.00.  My toe healed so well and so fast, i couldn&#x27;t believe it.  Nice not to have to do the soaking so long!&lt;br /&gt;I found Amerigel through Amazon and it was only around $18.00 and since i have Prime membership, there was no shipping.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is wonderful - i recommend it way over Neosporin or anything else!</li>
            <li> I first purchased this product from my podiatrist after having an ingrown toenail removed.  This was my second time having an ingrown toenail removed.  The first time I used the protocol given to me by my podiatrist at that time.  This included hydrogen peroxide, betadine and neosporin cream as well as manually debriding the wound by rubbing it with a betadine saturated gauze pad twice a day - very painful!  This second time they asked if I wanted to use the Amerigel and I said yes.  What a huge difference in healing time, cost and pain.  Using the Amerigel cut the healing time in half, was less expensive than buying the other 3 items and was much less painful to use.  Plus I only had to use it once a day.  I just purchased two more tubes - one for me and one to share.  I bought the lotion too. I shopped around and found the cheapest way is to buy it directly from the manufacturer.  I ordered it yesterday and it arrived today already!  If you order 3 items they ship priority mail for free.  Of course, I am only about 30 miles from the manufacturer, but just the fact that they shipped the same day I ordered it impressed me.  I paid 21.95 per tube and free shipping because I ordered 3 items.</li>
            <li> I have used this product previously and it is wonderful. It does what is supposed to do, I would definitely purchase it again</li>
            <li> My infant son&#x27;s dermatologist recommended this for his chronic diaper rash. It was incredibly expensive compared to diaper creams and worked far less effectively. We use triple paste now and it works far better. However, we did not use this for the purpose it was advertised for.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS MEDICAL MAGIC, SERIOUSLY, REALLY HELPS SURGICAL WOUNDS HEAL.</li>
            <li> Same price my doctor charges so I don&#x27;t have to go to her office when I am out.</li>
            <li> After trying traditional antibiotic ointment for two months, I gave this a try. It has been one week and almost completely healed. I will never use another antibiotic again.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Very pleased with results.</li>
            <li> I was 1st given this by a Podiatrist after an ingrown toe-nail removal, no Antibiotics. I have poor circulation in my legs and am prone to infection. Healed great! Since then I&#x27;ve started using on other leg wounds which would get infected even with name-brand antibiotic ointment.I have not had an infection since.!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good product for helping to heal an open sore on foot caused from swelling.  Better than others we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> BEST STUFF EVER !! very happy, came recommended from a nurse for some moles I had removed and they were deep wounds..this healed them up quick (7 days total, NO Scab) , also put on my dogs tummy where she had itchy/hotspots and it worked wonderfully where others (neosporin, BagBalm, Animax) did not. I put some on a burn my girlfriend got on the woodstove and it healed so fast it was amazing! She said the pain was gone in 20 minutes and in 3 days there was barely any evidence of it at all. All I can say is ,IT WORKS !! not sure how, but it does. And judging by the reviews I&#x27;ve read here and elsewhere, I&#x27;m not alone. Proof is I&#x27;ve seen it work, and the 93% positive reviews add validity to my experience.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is a winner!</li>
            <li> Been trying to heal an open sore on my ankle that is the result of a skin biopsy. Biopsy showed only scar tissue so it was nothing . Two months, still an open wound. I followed the dermatologist&#x27;s orders, daily cleaning, use 100% pure white petroleum to keep wound moist to promote healing, cover. Very very slow healing.Then  I remembered using this gel for a past ulcer on my foot from years ago. It had been recommended by my podiatrist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6 days of use and the ankle wound is 98% healed. I expect it to be 100% in a few days. Wish I had remembered it earlier! The gel was not runny, as some reviewers state. I found it to be just like the gel I used 12 years ago. Highly recommend. You don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li> This stuff works.  It clears up a wound quickly.  It makes bug bites quit itching.  It takes a very small amount to work.  I use it on everything that involves open skin or a bug bite and it heals amazingly fast.</li>
            <li> my podiatrist calls this her voo-doo magic sauve.  It really has healing properties!!!!</li>
            <li> My husband first used Amerigel Wound Dressing after his Podiatrist provided it to him for a toe infection. After I read the ingredients, I was sceptical that it would be effective. Then he an unexpected,unrelated medical problem with the foot itself, which required surgery, leaving a large surgical wound. I used the Amerigel Wound Dressing and was amazed how well the wound healed. At a post-op checkup with the surgeon, he said to me, \\&quot;That&#x27;s Good Stuff\\&quot;. It is necessary to use the AmeriGel wound Dressing daily, until the wound heals, which can vary from person to person. I have purchased several tubes and highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  I bought some sheepskin bedding for my bedridden mom, trying to prevent bedsores.  She had an allergic reaction to it and was left with a large stage 2 bedsore on her back for months!  I have tried multiple ointments and different dressings, none of it worked.  I finally saw the glowing reviews of this ointment and decided to try it.  Besides, it was half the price of the previous ointment I had tried.  The wound literally started to heal in TWO DAYS!!  It is no longer an open wound and well on its way to being completely healed!  I will always keep this in the house.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this product.  He had toe surgery.   I am very impressed with the healing quality of this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!!!</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT DID NOT CLOSE MY HUSBAND WOUND. IT DID HELP WITH THE ORDER AND SEEPAGE.. I DO NOT KNOW IF I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR FUTURE USE.</li>
            <li> It was supposed to be the same &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; gel I got from my podiatrist few years ago, but for some reason it is 50% less effective on my recent burn.</li>
            <li> It works beautifully..</li>
            <li> This is a great product for healing wounds and burns.  I borrowed my daughters and could not believe the wonderful healing results.  I burnt my upper arm on my gas grill cover suffering 2nd degree and 1st degree burns.  A month later you would not believe the I had received such a severe burn.</li>
            <li> Great product highly recommended to us and works better then previous products we have tried</li>
            <li> Extremely happy with this product. It was suggested that I try it after my in-grown toe surgery by my doctor and it healed my toe in seven days. Well worth the money for it. It&#x27;s like a much stronger and effective neosporin.</li>
            <li> I have over 30 years experience with Amerigel.  It works. It works GREAT!  If you have a wound, use Amerigel to help your body heal it.  My brother had an intractable wound for 6 months until he told me about it. I told him to buy and use Amerigel, and in a few days, he was healed.  Amerigel uses natural ingredients from oak tree acorns to draw the healing properties of your body to heal wounds and sores. It works. My grandfather was a fat, diabetic who told me about it. He lasted well into his 80&#x27;s because he knew how to deal with health problems, including slow or no healing wounds. Amerigel worked for him, for me, for my brother and everyone I know who tried it.</li>
            <li> Used three tubes over last five years and excellent product even for slow( eg: Diabetic ) healers, only a thin layer is best, always keep wound protected and with a clean gauze dressing, well worth the expense if you are taking wound healing seriously</li>
            <li> My dermatoligist suggested Amerigel when I had a spot removed and it worked practically miraculously! I have three dogs and two cats and a big yard and am always getting scratches so I couldn&#x27;t live without it! Was so glad to find it at Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to treat open wounds, it heals from the inside out, debriding away dead skin and waste in the process. I did sometimes feel a slight sting, as others have mentioned. Spotting on the gauze dressing was also a normal part of the healing process. I had a deep wound that healed with a very smooth surface.</li>
            <li> This is a little spendy---but--well worth your investment.  I&#x27;m not sure what the ingredient is that helps heal---but it&#x27;s AMAZING....</li>
            <li> My wife (diabetic) tripped and tore off her big toe nail. The only first aid stuff I had in the house was AmeriGel, which I used for some sores on my dog. I slathered it on (under) the toe nail  until we could get to the doctor. After he removed the toe nail he put AmeriGel on the wound. He said that this is what is best until the nail grows back in. We use it daily and the healing is proceeding just fine. It truly is the first line of defense when you have a wound. If it is infected you may need an antibiotic ointment too, but we are now committed to having AmeriGel around the house at all times.</li>
            <li> I fell onto my knees and took off a pretty thick layer of flesh in the process. I had this in the house from my husband&#x27;s toe surgery and decided to try it. Okay, I must disclose that it HURT LIKE ALL HECK on the open wounds, but both knees have healed beautifully WITHOUT raised scars. One of the best things about Amerigel? Their service - you can actually communicate directly with their product specialist who is also a nurse, and they will be very specific to your wound in their responses... unbelievable. I was also very fascinated watching each stage of the healing process of my wounds. I now swear by this stuff and have told many about it - just be prepared for the pain, meaning, take a pain reliever an hour before you change your dressing and apply the Amerigel.</li>
            <li> This stuff works GREAT! I&#x27;ve had type 1 diabetes for 30 years now and whenever I get a cut or scrape, I dab this on and it heals my wound quickly! Works 10 better than neosporin!</li>
            <li> Podiatrist kept trying different things, I finally did some research on my own and found I needed to take more extreme measures to offload the pressure from toe wound and used the Amerigel only. It finally healed. Plus I&#x27;ve found occasional follow up with the Amerigel keeps the callous from reforming and the skin stays soft.</li>
            <li> Good stuff for a small ulcers on a diabetic.</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff for sores and wounds.  Ordering more today.</li>
            <li> I have been using Amerigel wound cream for over a year and have recommended it to a lot of people. I am right now sending a couple of tubes to my neice who&#x27;s hand get so beat up from rowing on the crew team.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my podiatrist for wound on foot. Much better than anything else on the market.  It prevented  secondary infection on an ulcer.  Would recommend it to anyone with difficult abrasions for healing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a maintenance mechanic and nicks and cuts are always happening. This product was mentioned to me by a friend who is a nurse. I have noticed that I seem to heal faster using AmeirGel!</li>
            <li> Right after I received this my husband had a severe head injury with lots of stitches. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this because it healed his wounds up in about 4 days.  The doctors could not believe how quickly the skin was growing over the stitches. Needless to say, he had to have his stitches removed early! Great product!</li>
            <li> Very beautiful and stylish. Simple and elegant, high-quality.&lt;br /&gt;Value for money.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Another benefit is that it has a nice</li>
            <li> I also received a tube from my podiatrist after ingrown toenail surgery and it worked great.  Once I had a painful cut on the side of my mouth that wouldn&#x27;t heal for days.  In frustration I took out this gel and carefully applied it to the cut.  The next morning I woke up and the cut had disappeared.  It works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> Pressure Ulcers aka bed sores started developing after 24 hours in the hospital. I knew I couldn&#x27;t afford to provide the expensive foam-pad dressings after I brought the patient home, so I searched for and found Amerigel at Amazon. Even with simple gauze dressings Amerigel healed one and kept the other pressure ulcer under control. It has earned a spot in our medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve purchased Anerigel from this Amazon seller.  Need I say more?</li>
            <li> Never used because right after I purchased it, a FDA warning came out warning not to use the product.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff for wounds, burns, and infections.  Have used it for years.  A podiatrist turned me on to it years ago when I had terrible blisters on a foot. Did the trick.</li>
            <li> Neosporin works just as well.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for healing a deep wound.  I got it originally from my doctor in New York City.  Now I won&#x27;t be without it.  Recommend it highly to anyone, especially someone with thin, sensitive skin.  Also suggest getting the wound wash to clean the wound before applying the gel.</li>
            <li> This product works great to fight or to prevent infection on a wound or cut.</li>
            <li> helps speed healing.  Love the smell and ease of applying.  Can be used on small open wounds.</li>
            <li> Specified by my surgeon for post op dressing changes.  Much more aesthetically pleasing than the petroleum based antibiotic ointments I&#x27;ve used historically.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT TO PREVENT AND HEAL EXISTING BED SORES..... ONLY PROBLEM IS IT TOOK ALMOST 13 WAYS TO GET TO ME AND DAD NEEDED THIS RIGHT AWAY...I WOULD OF GIVEN 5 STARS IF THIAS WOULD OF BEEN DELIVEERED SOONER!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product several times over the past couple of years.  My first tube was given to me by a surgeon.  Keep a tube handy at all times.  It&#x27;s a great product to have.</li>
            <li> grea product, exactly as described, arrived on time, great price!</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my doctor for treating a minor wound.  It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Great product helps healing of open wound quite well.</li>
            <li> Amerigel works great! We&#x27;ve bought it before and we will buy it again.Everyone needs this in their first aid kit.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with purchase&lt;br /&gt;Did nothing for me</li>
            <li> Great product. Good service.</li>
            <li> didnt really like this.  medical honey worked much better</li>
            <li> I know someone I purchased this for who is diabetic approx 70 years old. Has used in sores on fingers and a shaving infection of the skin of some sort. It has cleared them all up.  He has has limbs removed to put into perspective his level if diabetes.  His diet is out of control no glucose monitoring and this product still worked. Pretty amazing if you ask me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a physician, buy it, you wont be disappointed. Kills resistant bacteria, eats up dead tissue, and has activity against most, yeast, molds and fungus. Use it sparingly a little goes a very long way. I read a review where someone stated that Amerigel isn&#x27;t a miracle cream,,,no they are correct. It will not heal wounds in a person who does not have the capabilities to heal, i.e circulation or immune system, neuropathy, or malnutrition. It will not heal wounds that are due to secondary causes like pressure wounds in patients that don&#x27;t posses sensation and repeatedly cause trauma. It will however, with good wound-care nearly remove the threat of infection and promote healing. Many good qualities, so skip the Neosporins, hydrogen peroxides, triple antibiotics etc. and utilize this indispensable healing tool.</li>
            <li> A  doctor first recommended I use this product about 4 years ago. I have diabetes and had an ingrown toe nail which was not healing. He gave me a tube of Amerigel and within 3 days my infection was cleared up and I started to heal.</li>
            <li> this cream helped my husband after surgery to remove part of his toenail to protect from infection.  Works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a diabetic friend that had a wound that just wasn&#x27;t healing.  It had finally started making progress by the time we ordered and received the gel, but he has since tried it on a few cuts / wounds and it really speeds up the healing process.  I have also tried it on paper cuts, cuticle cuts, and it works great.  By the next day any pain is gone, and it heals quickly.  I&#x27;m going to order another so that we won&#x27;t be without.  I highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I bought my first tube of this in December 2013, and just purchased my second.  It lasted almost two years.  I love this stuff!  It makes sores heal so quickly.  The pain from a cut or sore usually goes away after the first day of application.  A must have for every household.</li>
            <li> Excellent wound care product. Promotes natural healing.</li>
            <li> This medication should be a staple for every diabetic.  It seems to promote healing for scrapes, cuts, and minor injuries.  I know it has saved me trips to the doctor by killing small skin infections.</li>
            <li> I had a wound that refused to heal for almost two months.  I threw over a dozen different products at it, took antibiotics, antivirals, the who nine yards.  None of them seemed to help.  I purchased this with little hope that it would work but after a week, I saw significant improvement.  In two weeks, I was 90% healed.  I&#x27;m not sure exactly what&#x27;s in this cream but whatever it is, IT WORKS!  I&#x27;ve also used it on a patch of eczema on my daughter&#x27;s arm and it appears to be helping as well.  If you&#x27;ve run out of options, give this cream a try!</li>
            <li> This product was difficult to find in local drug stores. Delighted to discover that it was available from Amazon. It works like a charm and has been a great help to my husband who had a difficult skin rash on his leg that was not healing until this product was applied. He is looking and feeling terrific now. The product was suggested by his doctor and was the only product that worked.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Heals from the inside out.</li>
            <li> I purchased this gel as a wound healing treatment for pressure sores I get every winter on my bunions. I am avoiding surgery because the bunions really do not hurt - only causing pressure sores when I continuously wear closed-toed shoes, which happens every winter. Well, I purchased this gel in November and, as it is now April, I am happy to report that I avoided long-term sores on my feet by avidly using this gel and covering the bunions with bandaids. On a couple of occasions, when I did develop small sores, they were very quickly healed using this product. I have found that within days of regular application, I could begin to see healing skin form and day-by-day the sores healed steadily. So, I just wanted to give Amerigel an A+++ review. I plan to continue using this every winter!</li>
            <li> once bleeding stops  scab appears later quick healing</li>
            <li> One of the best wound/post operative dressings out there.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years now and wouldn&#x27;t use anything but it on surgical wounds.</li>
            <li> There are lots of lengthy review for this product, so I will give you a short one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a type II diabetic. That means that small nicks and cuts I get from yard work (or coffee table corners) take forever to heal. Of all of the antibiotic creams and gels I have bought - AmeriGel is the BEST.  I have 3 small sores on my left leg that had not healed in over 6 months.  In less then 30 days of using AmeriGel the wounds are healed and gone.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a good ointment for small nicks and cuts. The wound scabs easier with this ointment. It was also impossible to find at the corner drugstore.</li>
            <li> I have a pressure wound on the bottom of my left foot and I&#x27;m type 1 diabetic with neuropathy. Blood circulation is very low in my damaged foot so the wound is slow healing. This Amerigel Wound Dressing seems to be helping with my wound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only have one small issue is this Amerigel Wound Dressing. It turns to water when it gets up to body temperature so you&#x27;ll need to wrap up the wound quickly before it runs off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can recommend Amerigel Wound Dressing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on a wound that had a lot of eschar. It has completely removed the eschar and is starting to close the wound. I haven&#x27;t had any redness or infection while using this product. I also use the wash with it for a wet to dry dressing.</li>
            <li> I bought this to treat skin problems, and it really did clear up everything.  Amazing and just need a little bit. I used it on a sore inside my thigh, and it works, removed the infection and healed it up without scaring.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well on boos boos. Haven&#x27;t seen miraculous healing but it&#x27;s thick so it really covers and protects.</li>
            <li> This stuff works!  I plan to keep this in my medicine cabinet and will order more when needed...glad to be able to get it here.</li>
            <li> I first got this stuff after a foot surgery and have been using it ever since! Ive noticed that wounds heal a lot faster that without or just neosporin</li>
            <li> I used this  in the healing of my wound after surgery.  It is good for deep wounds.  Squeeze into incision and cover with dressing.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this cream so I bought a tube from him.  It worked so well that I have recommended it to others and they all have said it worked for them too.  It is a little expensive but I found that the price on Amazon is the best one I have found.</li>
            <li> This stuff heals things very quickly. I bought a second one already. My daughter tore a finger nail nearly off. I gave her  the Amerigel when she came to visit and a couple of days later she said it was almost healed. No more pain.</li>
            <li> Best wound dressing on the market.  Works fast and helps alleviate scaring.  Told my daughter to get some for her husband and their pharmacy didn&#x27;t have any available.  I ordered it from Amazon and they had it in 2 days.  So glad it was available.</li>
            <li> Best topical wound antimicrobial. Organic. Its all I use on skin tears.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t healed my wound on my toe that I have had for almost 2 years.  It isn&#x27;t a miracle healing cream.</li>
            <li> We have been using this product in our home for over 5 years.  Helps with healing all wounds, without excessive antibiotic use</li>
            <li> To expensive...17 dollars for 1oz</li>
            <li> This product works extremely well on cuts.  Especially those with diabetes. I use it as well as my diabetic husband.</li>
            <li> The first tube of Amerigel Wound Dressing we bought was at the doctors office. Then I found it on Amazon for several dollars cheaper. This product is great to use for diabetic sores, blisters, ulcers and burns.</li>
            <li> safe for cut and wounds</li>
            <li> I had a weird rash under my breasts with an oozing sore. I tried triple antibiotic cream and it didn&#x27;t work. My husband suggested Amerigel  and it was gone overnight. My husband is a diabetic and he uses it on sores. They disappear like magic.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful.  I am a Nurse Practitioner.  My son was given it after foot surgery from his physician.  He gave us his remaining tube as I was fighting diabetic leg ulcers on one of my patients.  I saw improvement after 1 application.  Ulcers that I have dealing with for over a month cleared within 4 days!  I am recommending it for all my patients.  (It even works beautifully on our dogs exema !</li>
            <li> The only thing that healed up my husband&#x27;s stasis foot ulcer of 6 months.  It took quite some time, but it did the trick.  I would definitely recommend this for ulcer treatment.</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever used, seems to heal overnight.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used for wounds!  I am diabetic and this medicine helps so much!  Together with an antibiotic, it works. Period!</li>
            <li> First got this at the doctors office was so happy that I could get it elsewhere.  It&#x27;s a great product and speeds up the healing process.</li>
            <li> Great Product, had a sore for months and its half healed in three days... i used it with thera honey similar to medihoney and some cbd hemp oil... im glad i found this product...</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  This was a great price for a product we have used frequently in the past but purchased from a local pharmacy.</li>
            <li> Both tubes were too liquidy.</li>
            <li> Finest wound care product available.Simply stated!</li>
            <li> Any cut, this goes on. It has worked better than anything for me, for nearly ten years.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based off of reviews and I would rate 6 stars if I could. I removed a cyst that left a pea-sized hole on the ball of my foot and used this product, along with a saline wound wash and Hydrogen Peroxide on my wound about 2-3 times a day. I was amazed to see how fast everything has healed after 3 days of use. I experienced no pain or infections and im simply impressed with how fast everything has healed. Cant wait to get back to hiking and camping!</li>
            <li> I first got  AmeriGel  Wound Care from my podiatrist .. Amazing how fast it works.. I highly recommend it.. I have Rheumatoid.. got a ulcer on bottom of left great toe.. This is really the best stuff for a ulcer ..</li>
            <li> My mom used this excellent cream on MRSA she had on her arm. Thankfully the MRSA is now gone. I purchased this product to use for a dog that I adopted who had an infected hot spot on his leg. It is now gone. Would recommend this to anyone for cuts, scrapes or more serious skin infections. Works great!</li>
            <li> Excellent wound dressing</li>
            <li> Years after a doctor gave me a tube years ago, I came to Amazon for &#x27;refill&#x27;.  The gel does seem to noticeably improve healing speed.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s Podiatrist sent her home with Amerigel for a minor surgery. We were amazed at the speed of healing that Amerigel provided. It now is first to use on scrapes and cuts. Great med.</li>
            <li> This product burns, put on wound and couldn&#x27;t wait to get it off.  Have no idea if it works or not.</li>
            <li> Great product for Diabetics.</li>
            <li> Great diabetic wound care dressing and much cheaper than you can get from a podiatrist.</li>
            <li> I love using this product helps to shorten the healing time of my wounds. I would tell the would how wonderful</li>
            <li> If you have any problem with a wound that will not heal, try this. Works wonders!&lt;br /&gt;This is something that I want to keep on hand all the time.</li>
            <li> I now suffer a venous deficiency caused by an car accident. I use  this wound dressing to treat skin sores caused by the deficiency and it does an excellent job. I would recomend it to anyone who has sores that heal poorly.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Really works on venous ulcers.  Great product.</li>
            <li> My  Dad has chronic non healing/slow healing foot ulcers due to diabetes, is cream has really helped to make them smaller and heal. Don&#x27;t know why this stuff is not better known!</li>
            <li> This product did not close my wound, I have been using fro a past few week and no change. It&#x27;s not working.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I would recommend it to anyone.  I was introduced to it by my Doctor and would recommend it to anyone that needs a topical antibiotic.</li>
            <li> We always keep this in our supply cupboard -- it closes wounds and closes scrapes faster than anything I&#x27;ve ever used. Because hubby is prone to pressure sores, I always make sure to have a spare tube. It has never disappointed. We use it in conjunction with the Amerigel wound cleaner -- great pair for skin health!</li>
            <li> I had surgery on my face and it just wouldn&#x27;t finish healing until I started using this wound cream. Finally it got well and healed.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A MIRACLE WORKING OINTMENT. GREAT FOR SCRAPS AND CUTS AND ABRASIONS. I LIKE TO KEEP A TUBE AROUND AT ALL TIMES. SANDRA</li>
            <li> Good product &amp; price.</li>
            <li> A very good wound dressing for diabetics, the dressing promotes rapid healing  which is a great benefit for people with diabetes..</li>
            <li> I first used this when I had an ingrown toe nail removed. Recommended by the doctor. Excellent for deep wounds. I now use it for all cuts, scrapes etc. Wounds heal much faster than any antibiotic salve I have ever used. Trust me, I&#x27;ve tried them all. Unbelievable speed in healing. If you work outside, do woodworking, mend fences, etc., try this!</li>
            <li> The greateast invention for treating leg ulcers. My mother cured an advanced leg ulcer using this cream and taking serrapeptase.  I would describe it a miracle.</li>
            <li> This product is supposed to be the equivlent to Wound-Be-Gone but it is not. I do not find it aids in the healing of wounds any better than without using this product. I bought this because of the positive reviews. The only benefit I have noticed is that it keeps the wound moist and prevents it from sticking to the gauze. I would not buy this again. Simply do not think it works all that well.</li>
            <li> My Dr. used it on my surgery incision and I have continued to use it to keep infection away. It seems to make a cut  or pin prick (diabetic )  heal much faster.</li>
            <li> its perfect &amp; effective.  Was given a sample for my husband when he lost a toe nail--worked great!  And I am a insulin dependent diabetic so this also works for me.</li>
            <li> Protects and covers open wound very well</li>
            <li> This stuff is a miracle.</li>
            <li> I had taken a gamble on this one and it really paid off very well! So well I had Amazon ship out a second one. Works so well with their optional Amerx Amerigel Wound Wash which blast the wound clean. Using 4 x 4 inch Guaze pads to keep dry before applying the Amerigel Would Dressing in a 3x circle pattern to non-stick 2 x 2 inch pads before place that on top of pressure ulcer wound. I also use this with Eras Natural Sciences Wound Honey -80g tube (optional) I had this prior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would go on 4 x 4 non-stick pad with one circle outer pattern around the wound edges. Suppose to be able to use AWD &#x3D; Amerigel Would Dressing that way too. Honey does seem to keep infections away while the AWD does it job. Wound healing process really working. You have to change the bandages every 10 hours around the clock if you want these products to work. Once they break down they really need to be clean the wound again and refresh the product along with new dressing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only way to keep up with this issue with pressure ulcers and you have to watch that area so it doesn&#x27;t happen again. 4th stage but it&#x27;s healing and bleeding has stopped. A lot work. I used extra 4 x 4 inch Guaze pad and over that is 5 x 9 inch extra guaze pad tape up with cloth tape works the best. Paper tape and moisture from the body doesn&#x27;t work so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update my progress as I go..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AS of April, I&#x27;ve stop using this product and gone with the larger Silvasorb, 3 Oz Tube and just ordered the 8 oz tube from Amazon. This one works better for the larger wounds that are 4th level Silvsorb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amerigel Wound Dressing 1 oz just too small of tube and opening for larger wounds. I&#x27;ve used about 4x tubes of this stuff before switching them out for Medline Silvasorb that works different. 3 OZ tube huge and the opening is larger. It really covers the open wound with the silver (blue/clear) gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 10 hours of change the wound I notice a better improvement the cells are healing so I&#x27;ve gone from 4th to 3rd to 2nd almost 1st level pressure ulcer. I can&#x27;t wait for it to heal. This is for aging parent she&#x27;s 100 years old. This wound is still an issue but I am on top of it 100%!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still give Amerigel Wound Dressing 5x Stars since the product does heal wounds with the two active ingredients, but if you have larger wound I do recommend getting Medline Silvasorb 3 oz or better yet 8 oz cost almost  $100 bucks. But consider how many Amerigel Wound Dressing you would need if you have to change a wound every 10 hours 2x a day until the would heals up back!nt the cells are healing so I&#x27;ve gone from 4th to 3rd to 2nd almost 1st level pressure ulcer.

            <li> I have used AmeriGel for over 5 years. My husband is a diabetic and has foot ulcers along with water blisters on his legs, evey day I put some on his open wounds. Within a short time, they are healing. Without the AmerGel I know for sure he would have lost his foot before. Working on clearing up a blister on the back of his leg now that is about 2&amp;#34; long and 1 &amp;#34; wide. This blister opened up a little over a week ago and already scabbing over. We go through 4 tubes a year. Only could find when we went back home to vist, then picked up 4 tubes each time. Never thought of going to Amazon for it. No more buying 4 tubes when we go back home. Especially since I usually take all they have on the shelf. Wonder Gel is what I call this.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my doctor and it works great at speeding up the healing process of a wound.</li>
            <li> good price, quality product, healed wound promptly, it was as described in advertising, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the great reviews.  Unfortunately it did not work for my condition.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I&#x27;m allergic to neosporin but this works great</li>
            <li> My husband had a tube of Amerigel, which I commandeered. It is amazing. When I had my cheecks waxed, the technician unfortunately took off a layer of skin in a couple of places. I used Amerigel, and my skin was healed within 2days. I totally recommend using it for both healing and soothing.</li>
            <li> A good reliable source--AmeriGel can be hard to find.  Amazing wound healer.  Even mosquito bites respond!  I run out of it quickly because everyone in my family uses it--visitors, too.  All are surprised at the results.  I&#x27;m not shy about recommending it.  The first tube I bought was at the suggestion of my podiatrist, after I had a great toenail removed.  I drove all over Durum Co. in NC to find it.  Then the supermarket near the doctor&#x27;s office began carrying it.  You had to ask the pharmacist to fetch it for you from behind the counter (it isn&#x27;t cheap).  If you believe everyone relies on antibiotic creams too much and you would like something natural, try AmeriGel.  It contains a unique &amp;#34;oak extract&amp;#34;.  Put it right on the wound after a good soap cleaning.  It works!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and is manufactured near where I reside but ordering it on line is way cheaper . This product heals wounds very quickly and I am diabetic and I do not know of anything faster in healing wounds and burns .. I do not go without keeping a tube on hand always. Great Product. Check with your physician if ok to use for whatever your condition might be. Thank you.</li>
            <li> We had been using Dermawound but our doctor had her use AmeriGel for a foot pressure wound.  It took a long time to heal but after several months it did heal up.  If Dermawound came in tubes as promised we might have stayed with that as we used that a couple of years ago for a diabetic foot ulcer.</li>
            <li> Great product! I first used this cream after I had foot surgery. My doctor provided it to me to help the surgical site heal better. He told me it would heal the wound from the inside out, unlike topical cremes such as Neosporin which heal from the outside in.  I use it on any type of cut that is more than superficial and have had great success with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a slight difference with this purchase, as the cream is now a lot thinner than the original tube I bought when I had my foot surgery.  But it still seems to work the same.  Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My doctor started using this on my foot where I had a pressure sore for almost 12 years.  I found  that it is the best product i have ever used, and it&#x27;s all natural plant extracts.  It says right on the front of the tube, that it is for diabetic&#x27;s foot problems.  I have a different disease, but have the same problems as do diabetics do with pressure sores on the ball of the foot.  WOW!  This has almost healed my sore in about 3 months or less.  If I was not on my foot so much, it would be healed by now.  You cannot go wrong by using this product!</li>
            <li> It exceeds Neosporin by a mile, or more. My Dr gave this to me when I was healing, post surgery, for the wounds. It is amazing!</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever - seems to heal overnight. Try it - you will love it. I use it on my hands around my nails.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, better than neosporin, good stuff to add to the first aid kit.  Hard to find this stuff, but worth getting it when you can.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that promotes fast healing.  Doctor recommended this for a diabetic ulcer on my husband&#x27;s foot and it healed very quickly.</li>
            <li> I may have expected too much too fast!</li>
            <li> A little Amerigel goes a long way.  It is very helpful in healing cuts &amp; wounds quickly.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> It was supposed to be antifungal, antibiotic and skin protection. What arrived did not contain an antifungal agent nor an antibiotic agent. Very unhappy.</li>
            <li> Like a lot of other reviewers, I received a tube of this gel after ingrown toenail surgery about a two years ago.  I used it and my toe healed fine; I didn&#x27;t give it much thought.  Then about a month ago I got a really bad sunburn on my cheek where I was using a Hydroquinone product.  It turned bright red and then almost white and was blistering and seeping.  I was using Neosporin at first and then I found the tube of Amerigel in my medicine cabinet, saw it was for open wounds, and thought \\&quot;What the heck, it&#x27;s worth a try.\\&quot;  Wow.  It definitely sped up the healing and the wound was smooth and healed in about a week.  I still have a little scar but that is to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I ordered a fresh tube on Amazon and have used it anywhere I would have used Neosporin...bug bites, scratches, shaving nicks.  I can really tell that it helps the wounds heal faster.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Amerigel Wound Dressing having the properties of hydrogel really helped closing and healing a bad abrasion wound on the back of my hand. When I flexed my hand the wound would tear open, Amerigel softened the skin around the wound and helped it to completely heal. Amerigel is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> We operate a senior care home and need help treating bed sores. This product came highly recommended, from other professionals so we use it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Really works.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic! I was bit by a dog - this dressing ointment healed my leg so fast! I was using several other ointments to try and heal my leg and prevent any infection, nothing worked until purchased this! Awesome stuff!</li>
            <li> This is soooooo much better than neosporin - it doesn&#x27;t make the skin mooshy - you can leave it on the wound for days (reapplying a new coat when need be) or even weeks - and it makes the skin nicely supple so easier to heal.  It is a thick gel, so it won&#x27;t get down into a deep puncture wound - you will need to kill germs with peroxide or iodine (something very liquid) first,  then dry and apply the Amerigel ointment.</li>
            <li> Used after ingrown toenail removal.  I had several ingrowns removed on different occasions.  I used Amerigel Wound Dressing on two with great results and used a generic triple antibiotic ointment on two with poor results.  I seemed to have an allergic reaction to the triple antibiotic ointment as well as stinging during the epsom salt baths when using the triple antibiotic ointment.  Felt immediate relief when applying Amerigel Wound dressing and within 2 days was much improved.  I will be keeping Amerigel on hand for cuts and scrapes in addition to post-surgical procedures.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years now, and wouldn&#x27;t be without it. It heals wounds, and helps prevent scarring like no other product I&#x27;ve tried. I used it on my face for a couple of keltoids I had, and it got rid of them. Although the packaging is different than my other Amerigel, this is the same company and ointment.</li>
            <li> The tube that was shipped was not the same as the one in the ad photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AmeriGel is a great product that is more powerful than Neosporin.</li>
            <li> this wound dressing truly helped to heal the staph infection boils that infected several members&lt;br /&gt;of my daughter&#x27;s family.  i was so glad i was able to purchase it for them.&lt;br /&gt;a terrific product</li>
            <li> I use this every day so it&#x27;s great to be able to get it a a much lower price than a DR.s office.&lt;br /&gt;  This stuff is amazing  but don&#x27;t take my word for it  if you need it you know</li>
            <li> This was introduced to me by my foot dr. I had an ingrown nail that had to be surgically removed on the side and it was very infected as they do get. The dr did his thing and suggested that I use this product instead of peroxide and triple antibiotic. He said the just irritate the wounds instead of helping it heal. So I paid $30 for this cream. It is amazing stuff. I now will always keep it in the house. I even use it on my pets. My Chihuahua keeps getting bits on her belly when she is outside playing and I use it on her and the next day, it is completely gone. That&#x27;s how good this stuff really is. And a little goes a very long way. So if you have kiddos that fall down a lot of even yourself and pets, I would definitely suggest this for you and your family.</li>
            <li> I have used 3 tubes of this over the years on a doctors recommendation for ingrown toe nails. It works great to stop infection. I also put on when ingrown toe nails get irritated as a preventative.</li>
            <li> I have CMT and wounds below my waist take a long time to heal and usually get infected. That was until I found this product. Wounds heal fast and don&#x27;t get infected. I have stocked up on this product and it will always be close by.</li>
            <li> I am a diabetic with a foot ulcer This dressing is a must</li>
            <li> This product is AWESOME.  My friend has a husband with Diabetes and is always getting open sores on his feet.  His doctor recommended this and he is a happy camper.  So am I for listening to my friend and her recommendation.  It&#x27;s especially helpful for any sore that does not heal.  Natural products are the way to go.</li>
            <li> Amerigel used to be a good product.  I ordered two tubes per month for 5 years and it was excellent.  The most recent tube I received was runny oil and not at all useful.  If this is the way that Amerigel will be from now on I will not order it again.</li>
            <li> Love This Stuff, Great Wound Dressing, Foot Surgeon Put Me on to it after my surgery, no chance for infection to form, surgeon has tubs of the stuff at his clinic, every household should have it.  Must use plenty and keep the wound wet with the Amerigel under the bandage, bandaid.  Your reward is very quick healing and no risk of infection.</li>
            <li> I purchased the amerigel several years ago and it was a richer ointment. This ointment appeared to be &amp;#34;runny&amp;#34;. Not sure if it was due to shipping in summertime and product melted but was definitely not the consistency I had expected.</li>
            <li> We first used this when our doctor did a foot operation.  The doctor recommended this for home use to protect from infection and promote healing after the bandages were removed.  We had never heard of this before then, but followed the doctor&#x27;s instructions, and this product worked wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since that time, we have always wanted to keep this around.  We looked around for it, and this is the best price by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  It kept my toes from being infected when I had my big  toe nails removed.</li>
            <li> As result of an injury a long time ago I spend my time on a three wheeled scooter.  I finally got into a problem with pressure sores on my backside.  We tried numerous medications but none worked.  While looking for sterile saline solutions, I came across the Amerigel product and purchased it.  Within a week the sores were nearly gone.</li>
            <li> Works wells and is worth every penny of the cost....Used it to dress my mom wounds after surgery!!&lt;br /&gt;Go get u some...</li>
            <li> I used this gel during a time that my big toe was infected from an ingrown toenail. With soakings and use of this gel, it was no time before the healing took place. I would recommend it to anyone w/open wounds and sore feet.</li>
            <li> I also have a surgery wound, two months didn&#x27;t recover, after use this tube only 5 days, much more better, skin got covered and pain release. High recommended!</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful topical cream for leg ulcers and diabetic open sores. Would highly recommend it to everyone who has open wounds from those two problems.</li>
            <li> Very surprised but it really works and helps heals even small open wounds like cat scratches.</li>
            <li> I just have to assume this works well. Like many others I was referred after getting an ingrown toe nail out. My toe got better in about the time frame they said it would. It didn&#x27;t get infected, so this must do it&#x27;s job at least as good as competitors...hopefully better with the price tag.</li>
            <li> I ordered this gel after scalding myself with hot coffee and receiving a 2nd degree burn.  I thought it would help speed up the healing process.  The wound was healing well - I was changing the bandages 1-2 times per day and using antibiotic cream - but I wanted it to heal faster and thought this hydrogel would facilitate a faster healing process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I put it on the burn (about one week into the healing process) it tingled a bit but I didn&#x27;t think much of it and went to sleep with the gel on the burn under a bandage.  When I woke up the burn hurt more than it had been and it had several new tiny red lesions on it.  I went to the doctor to make sure everything was okay and said I was doing all the right things until I used this product.  This may have just been an allergic reaction (I have never had any allergic reaction to any other medication/cream)  but I would stay away from this product and stick with antibiotic creams/gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no issue with the seller.  The product was delivered when expected and was exactly as it was described.  I was just extremely dissatisfied with the product itself.</li>
            <li> Heals wounds better than any other product, including burns. Heard of it from a surgical RN.</li>
            <li> I bought this product not expecting much, but it has helped more than anything else yet, I think.  I have had a long battle with a venous leg ulcer.  Nothing was seeming to budge it much once I managed to kill the staph infection with various herbs, bentonite clay, activated charcoal and whatever else I was trying, including Manuka honey and ozonated olive oil.  My problem was that the skin didn&#x27;t want to regenerate and it was awfully hard to keep on top of the pain.&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow I have been using this product for maybe a week and its starting to get some skin over the raw areas and I can actually touch it without going through the roof. (and I am not a big pain sissy)  Seems like very useful product.  I may have to try their other things.  I think it would help almost anyone with a stubborn wound.</li>
            <li> Worked Well!  Great Product!  Recommend to anyone trying to heal an ulcer of any kind.  Especially, if they are diabetic!</li>
            <li> Excellent Wound dressing.  My doctor gave me a tube after partial foot amputation and it did a great job of healing.</li>
            <li> worked no better than OTC antibiotic ointments</li>
            <li> I have had wounds that did not heal for months, but after applying this ointment they healed up very quickly.  I will always have it on hand.  Also, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a doctor for a slow healing diabetic wound. It keeps the wound moist and has helped it heal.</li>
