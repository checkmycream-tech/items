            <li>but color&#x27;s are so amazing and attractive</li>
            <li>The colors are just as bright as they appear here.</li>
            <li>The colors are bright and varied.  </li>
            <li>Most* of them have great coverage, and they are all really great colors.  </li>
            <li>These colors are bright.  </li>
            <li>The colors are great and look amazing when they are on.  </li>
            <li>The colors are great and the bottles are a nice size.</li>
            <li>and we loved it.  </li>
            <li>Good price</li>
            <li>All the nail polishes are not in good condition.</li>
            <li>but however if you&#x27;re looking for good quality nail polish.</li>
            <li>these arent really good.... and even when i put it on..</li>
            <li>Each of these bottles cost about $1.50 so they are a good deal in comparison.</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>then this is a good set.</li>
            <li>You need 3-4 coats if you want good coverage.</li>
            <li>This set had good reviews</li>
            <li>None of them broke and Polish is good quality.</li>
            <li>These nail polishes are really good.</li>
            <li>Good job.</li>
            <li>this seems like a good buy.</li>
            <li>and I know nail polish isn&#x27;t supposed to smell good</li>
            <li>I think the people who wrote good reviews did so before trying the product; it seems like a good value, but it is in fact a scam.  </li>
            <li>Good consistency.</li>
            <li>25 fantastic beautiful colors!  </li>
            <li>The assortment of colors isn&#x27;t as good as it looks.</li>
            <li>They are good quality, not quite on par with OPI/China Glaze, but for the price they are good.</li>
            <li>so if the nail polish is just as good as buying the ones from the store than i wonder what their make up is like.</li>

            <li>I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with some of the colors in this set.</li>
            <li>This came in a timely manner with nice packaging for storage.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m kind of terrified to try using the rest of them.</li>
            <li>It looks nice and shiny.</li>
            <li>No matter how much fanatical care I take to ensure a perfect pedicure, this happens everytime.</li>
            <li>I bought the set of 24 because it was more affordable and good quality nail polish.</li>
            <li>I like to do my own nails</li>
            <li>They are full size bottles with beautiful colors.</li>
            <li>The bottles come all wrapped up nicely for sale at a store.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the kind of girl that likes to have options and also likes to save money</li>
            <li>I do own some of the Shany polishes</li>
            <li>The product couldnt be returned because it was deemed hazardous material</li>
            <li>The quality is good and I really love the colors.</li>
            <li>She liked the colors</li>
            <li>Some people have said they come out looking kind of matte, but I think they just aren&#x27;t so glittery.</li>
            <li>These are really nice...</li>
            <li>And you cannot return it because it&#x27;s a hazardous material.</li>
            <li>The packaging was nice.  </li>
            <li>This set has some lovely colors, and has received good reviews, so I was expecting to have a winner.</li>
            <li>the it has nice luster no need to apply topcoat on it.</li>
            <li>nice varity of colors</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>Worth it since it&#x27;s a gorgeous color and all of the others are great</li>
            <li>For the price it is good, just be prepared to use more than two coats</li>
            <li>They came in the perfect box to keep them neat and ready.  </li>
            <li>and I find out that you can&#x27;t return this product since it&#x27;s hazardous and I can&#x27;t seem to find a link for a refund.  </li>
            <li>She was thrilled with all the colors.</li>
            <li>I purchased these for my niece who loves to do her own nails</li>
            <li>she liked it.</li>
            <li>Wish it would be all a nice consistency to put on the nails.  </li>
            <li>Even with a good top coat AND using the Shany nail dryer, I have smudges and chips.</li>
            <li>Oh, and it&#x27;s non-returnable because it&#x27;s considered hazardous substance.  </li>
            <li>Great array of colors, I love it, I get to make many designs on myself and my friends.  </li>
            <li>They came with in nice package.</li>
            <li>Other than that the polish is very good quality and are all very good colors!!</li>

            <li>I personally love the bright colors :)</li>
            <li>The quality was great, the application was smooth, and the users were extremely pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>The bottles are the perfect size so you get a good amount of product, but theybarent so big that they clutter your vanity.</li>
            <li>It peels up and comes off very easily.  </li>
            <li>the odor was very strong and some had leaked in the box.  </li>
            <li>Love Love!</li>

            <li>But since then, I&#x27;ve tried 2 more bottles of color and they were just what I was expecting --</li>
            <li>My recommendation would be to better describe the colors in each of these sets of polish.  </li>
            <li>I am  completely satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li>This is it :)</li>
            <li>I love all the colors...</li>
            <li>, I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They are really cute.</li>
            <li>Nothing a top coat won&#x27;t correct.</li>
            <li>Too many to choose but cannot use glitter coz it looks like more glue glitter.</li>
            <li>Better than nothing.</li>
            <li>Many colors come with plastic tray that can be used to store them.</li>
            <li>There are just too many better polishes out there to choose from.</li>
            <li>There are so many nail colors these days</li>
            <li>so we could pick from many colors.  </li>
            <li>A better deal than buying all colors separate.  </li>
            <li>that this is a lovely gift.</li>
            <li>I love the variety of colors and glitters.</li>
            <li>I love to paint my nails</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s okay-</li>
            <li>so time isn&#x27;t a factor to deter myself from enjoying this playful color set.</li>
            <li>I really love the colors of the nail polish.</li>
            <li>Ichose 5 star ,love the nail polish color and shine.</li>
            <li>I have not tried many of the colors yet as I don&#x27;t get to wear nail polish that often.</li>
            <li>But now I can say I&#x27;ve learned my lesson and wont be buying any more of their products.</li>
            <li>Save your money and buy something that is better quality.</li>
            <li>These may be better as an accent on top of another color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you just want something to use to play with your nails a bit, sure, try this brand.</li>
            <li>As soon as i run out I will order more.</li>
            <li>Love the holder too.</li>
            <li>I love this set.  </li>
            <li>I love the variety of colors and glitters.</li>
            <li>I love this set.</li>
            <li>I so love it.</li>
            <li>I love the color selection in this set and when you consider how many you get in one box, you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>.Absolutely love it</li>
            <li>Purchased to use for a spa party and were pleased with the assortment of colors.</li>
            <li>I am just getting into nail art, but I have been painting my nails for the better part of 25 years.  </li>
            <li>I love most of these polishes.  </li>
            <li>Some polishes might take more than one coat</li>
            <li>The bottles were all intact, no leaking or breaking, and came in a cute box that I may continue to use.  </li>
            <li>The color selection is as shown, and I love most of them.  </li>
            <li>The seller needs to do a much better job managing shipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting my business, and this is the perfect addition to my polishes.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughters because they love for me to paint their nails.</li>
            <li>I guess i was satisfied with this purchase...</li>
            <li>Color selection was better then I thought.</li>
            <li>I love nail polish.</li>
            <li>The colors are BEAUTIFUL.I love using these nail polishes on my nails.</li>
            <li>I love the color varieties.</li>
            <li>I could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li>They came in a separate box, which I love because now I do not have to find a container to store them in.</li>
            <li>but I would recommend it to anyone who would listen :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely satisfied with all of the products i have purchased before</li>
            <li>It was one of the prettier purple colors, which happens to be her favorite color.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love about a kaleidoscope of color for this price?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>Guess I need to paint my nails more often.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased with the nail color.  </li>
            <li>Everyone was satisfied. :)</li>
            <li>My daughters love these.</li>
            <li>However, it is wonderful for personal use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It painted on streaky and took many coats to get it to look like the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not, its just ok.</li>
            <li>There are so many colors to choose from :)</li>
            <li>The display is simply stunning.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THEM.</li>
            <li>I love that.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This polish is fantastic for stamping!</li>
            <li>Received this for Christmas and absolutely love the selection of colors, the number of bottles and the size.  </li>
            <li>OK for the price though.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better value for my money</li>
            <li>Maybe a couple too many pinks, but that could be a preference</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>Hope that shany cosmetics comes with peach colors for this set, that will be the cherry on the top.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: I found that it was better to use acetone nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>I love painting my nails</li>
            <li>Most must-have colours are in this set, including reds and pinks.</li>
            <li>Love the colours.</li>
            <li>EXCELLENT PROTECTION A+ WILL BUY AGAIN IN FUTURE</li>
            <li>I just wish there weren&#x27;t so many colors that I will never use.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li>Really really lovely Shany nail polish</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I love painting my nails and do my sister and cousins&#x27; nails all the time.</li>
            <li>I really love this polish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a great variety of colors!</li>
            <li>Many didn&#x27;t mix together, some looked like they had been used before.  </li>
            <li>, they were unopened in the original Shany box and they come in a plastic nail polish holder (like the kind you see at the stores) which I thought was cute and it makes storing them a lot</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and everything was packaged very nicely.</li>
            <li>Definitely will purchase more things from shany!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very rich color and consistency.</li>
            <li>Pretty good value for the money, although I don&#x27;t know that I love all of the colors.  </li>
            <li>; ) grand daughter loved it</li>
            <li>Great vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be specific: the application brush isn&#x27;t the best, to achieve a perfect coverage you have to use a lot of product, the polishes aren&#x27;t shiny once they dry.</li>
            <li>I was happy to find that the colors were vibrant.</li>
            <li>It does not apply smoothly and chips off very easily.</li>
            <li>Granted, if you don&#x27;t use a top coat, it chips easily, but you can use any $6.00 top coat.</li>
            <li>Full size bottles of amazing colors.</li>
            <li>Based on her information, the variety of colors is amazing and they are full size.  </li>
            <li>personal favorite nail polish brand (and what I feel is the best available) is China Glaze.</li>
            <li>variety is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a nice product!!</li>
            <li>But they are definitely worth the price!!</li>
            <li>I had so much fun with these polishes!!  </li>
            <li>I just received my package today, and I am really excited!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the cheaper brands like Sinful Colors because I find they chip so easily even with a top coat.</li>
            <li>smooth, covered well with only one coat, and great color!!  </li>
            <li>and they last her 3 weeks good product so good money spend</li>
            <li>Good quality for such a good price.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have a single problem with any one of the 24 colors, each one was in excellent condition and there are no duplicate colors.</li>
            <li>The dotter tools and the colorful tape work magically!</li>
            <li>For the price, I feel you get your moneys worth plus more!  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I found such great quality polishes for such a great price!</li>
            <li>It should be a good value, but it certainly wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>The colors are very true to what they look like in the bottle</li>
            <li>Very cool.</li>
            <li>Shany goes on smoothly, stays on longer, and comes off better with polish remover than Essie or OPI for $8 a bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m incredibly bummed that I cannot get my money back, and I will not be buying Shany products anymore.</li>
            <li>Theyre cheap that i cannot have these nail color stays for more than 4 days.</li>
            <li>Some don&#x27;t need as many layers for full color...for those that you need more layers, some colors will build up on the nail causing that puffy look and others won&#x27;t...</li>
            <li>Not eve kind of worth it.</li>
            <li>She loved them so much.  </li>
            <li>they also work really well for stamping plates!!!:)</li>
            <li>I should also add that when I received these in the mail, it was a pretty hot day, so when I opened the package the bottles of polish were very warm to the touch - which I&#x27;m sure can probably diminish the quality of the polish.</li>
            <li>I love nail polish and this has quickly become a favorite brand.</li>
            <li>In fact I am so impressed I will be trying out some of their other products.....</li>
            <li>Excited to start purchasing more stuff by them.</li>
            <li>SO COOL!</li>
            <li>They are full size!  </li>
            <li>Other than that, they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li>It also comes in a tray that holds all nail polishes which makes it look very organized; however, i have my own nail polish rack &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have these personally, but I have heard so many great things about them.</li>
            <li>Bright and Vibrant.</li>
            <li>This nail polish set is great for someone who wants to have fun with colors and experiment.</li>
            <li>Easy to paint.</li>
            <li>The product applys easily and stays on for a while.</li>
            <li>Chips and peels off easily.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item on August 10, 2014 and got it August 12,2014 very quick delivery.</li>
            <li>They go on your nails easily and stay on.  </li>
            <li>Easy to remove with a nail polish remover and doesn&#x27;t leave stains.</li>
            <li>The polish came in a box that hold all the polish in place that makes it easy to store.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The polish doesn&#x27;t spread easily onto the nails.</li>
            <li>I received my nail polish very quick.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The nail polish peels and chips easily.</li>
            <li>Polish went on easily and has lasted over a week.</li>
            <li>The smell was so strong it made my eyes sting and burn.</li>
            <li>Smells really strong</li>
            <li>I will not order again because of the strong stench.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t smell as strong as the nail polishes I have</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful and are great for those who love to experiment with with different designs in all different colors.</li>
            <li>She liked the variety of neons and hot colors.</li>
            <li>What a great value for the amount of vibrant and fun colors that you get.</li>
            <li>It goes on nice and smooth, and dries very fast.</li>
            <li>but when you figure it out it&#x27;s only $1.25 per bottle, which is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>When I use it to paint my toes, if you don&#x27;t look at them too closely they look fine.</li>
            <li>If you want some fun colors and a bunch of variety to add to your collection without costing a fortune, though, it&#x27;s a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>You will be fine.</li>
            <li>I use these with the Butter London Patent Gel set and it works fine for me.</li>
            <li>Impressive color collection, but paint chips in three days or less.</li>
            <li>super cute colors.</li>
            <li>The colors are just as bright and vivid as shown.</li>
            <li>I like this set when it comes to colours - they are really vivid and bright.</li>
            <li>Loved everyone that I tried so far!</li>
            <li>The products doesn&#x27;t seem old as some may have experienced, or maybe i just got lucky.  </li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s awesome to match up when doing cool designs on other fingers and toes.</li>
            <li>I was sooo excited when I unwrapped the present and saw all the beautiful colors.</li>
            <li>The nail polish was a great consistency and dried fairly quickly(not really quick).</li>
            <li>Finish: Not gloopy and fine smooth finish.</li>
            <li>These nail polishes are cheap and have extraordinary colour!</li>
            <li>The color were great from bold to more traditional.</li>
            <li>So, make SURE you want it first!  </li>
            <li>So Many pretty colors!</li>
            <li>the colors are beautiful, highly pigmented and stamp very well.</li>
            <li>I can tell you this much: you don&#x27;t need both, but it&#x27;s nice to have them.  </li>
            <li>Nothing really light.  </li>
            <li>Clean up easily with nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>The polish applies smoothly and covers well with one coat, although I chose to put on two coats.  </li>
            <li>Yes I love them because I am a teenager who loves anything sparkly or colorful.</li>
            <li>The ones I did like were fantastic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, great buy-will definitely buy again if needed!  </li>
            <li>This nail polish is perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I read the comments before buying because I couldn&#x27;t believe how cheap they are</li>
            <li>I love all these fun colors.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy the set from this seller, I got mine off of ebay because the shipping was free</li>
            <li>remover(I didn&#x27;t even know there was such a thing lol).  </li>
            <li>Some of the colors not all seem to clump or streak - doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>The variety of colors in this is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I bought this on Amazon&#x27;s Christmas blowout sale for $20 with free shipping.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve chosen different colors and we have been happy with the result.  </li>
            <li>We just added a top coat and it seems to have helped keep the color fresh.</li>
            <li>Both are available here on amazon</li>
            <li>The Polish is cheap like you could buy at Claire&#x27;s it has no gloss and</li>
            <li>shape and the others colors are fantastic .</li>
            <li>I kept the light colors and my kid got the darks we shared  </li>
            <li>All the different colors its great.</li>
            <li>I will buy this item again if its still available by the time we run out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>24 piece nail polish set for such a great price.</li>
            <li>enjoy the prompt shipment</li>
            <li>and I also enjoy the colors that were sent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also versy cheap.</li>
            <li>Overall I was really happy with the color selection.  </li>
            <li>So I was apprehensive about these nail polishes as they were so cheap</li>
            <li>Tried one color and it was gloppy, did not brush on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I also got a gel uv light</li>
            <li>It went on smoothly and lasted quite awhile.</li>
            <li>This will make an impressive gift for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I like the idea that I have all the colors that I want ,it&#x27;s pretty cool and nice to have ...</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a bit of hit and miss with the consistency of the product, but overall I still stand by the purchase as the price for this many colors is just too good to beat.</li>
            <li>the product arrived nicely packaged and colors are really nice however the nail polish starts to chip the next day.</li>
            <li>Hope you enjoy as much as I am!!!</li>
            <li>To reiterate: Very nice choice for nail art, but not necessarily the best choice if you&#x27;re interested in painting your entire nail (unless it had something to do with the very hot weather when I ordered).</li>
            <li>I researched through amazon for a set of nail polish that had very good feedback from other customers.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll be back for more!!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>Colors look nice, however they are not thick, nail technician had to put something in it to give it a little body, however, they are not returnable, so will make the best of them.</li>
            <li>My daughter took me to a friend of hers that does nails who showed me how to use these colors properly to get very nice effects.  </li>
            <li>But overall , it is a very nice set.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This would make a great gift for a younger teen with more adventurous tastes than I!</li>
            <li>This is a really fun set of nail polishes, and I loved the idea of getting so many different colors at such a great price.</li>
            <li>I love my new nail polishes!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready for a new color by then, lol.  </li>
            <li>All of these colors are great, of course I still have my favorites over others, but knowing the new patterns and styles really helped.  </li>
            <li>Also there isn&#x27;t a very good light purple or light green.  </li>
            <li>The neon colors are fun too!</li>
            <li>I love the nail polishes they are so pretty and affordable</li>
            <li>Reading the reviews of the people who have already tried out this product sparked my curiosity, and made me interested in getting this product when I am able to.  </li>
            <li>These colors are so cute and not expensive at all.</li>
            <li>They were just as excited as I was, and  we are planning a get-together soon to look at nail ideas and try them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used any of the polish yet, but am excited to see how they look on the nails.</li>
            <li>So, layering can give you even more colors that are really pretty, just FYI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>would definitely recommend this and many more SHANY products to anyone!</li>
            <li>I love having nice nails, but I really don&#x27;t like waiting much longer than 15 minutes max.</li>
            <li>It is well worth it!</li>
            <li>Love it so much!</li>
            <li>, people always ask where I go , I always smile and say Shany Polish and Shany Nail Art!</li>
            <li>I love how it dries really fast!</li>
            <li>but it is totally worth it!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to give this gift to my daughter for her birthday.  </li>
            <li>, well worth the price!</li>
            <li>I love these nails polishes for the first 3 days after applying a color but after that is peels off in strips.</li>
            <li>There are many colors to choose from, not only more style and the color is more bright-coloured.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t familiar with this brand of polish, as OPI, Essie &amp; China Glaze are my go to polishes.  </li>
            <li>I was excited when I purchased this.  </li>
            <li>lots of great colors, some strange colors are included of course.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to find such a great range of colors and hoped the quality would be as good as some other reviews...</li>
            <li>Love how many colors their is and isn&#x27;t to expensive for all of them great nail polish all the amazing colors doesn&#x27;t chip to fast love it</li>
            <li>The polish was the perfect thickness and dried fast!!</li>
            <li>the cap that holds the wand just came clean off and the bottle flew across the bathroom, hit the tile and shattered everywhere.</li>
            <li>But apparently the price WAS infact too good to be true.</li>
            <li>Polishes sold in drug stores, even the most inexpensive brands were far better quality than these.</li>
            <li>my favorite is when she paints stripes of different colors on a makeup sponge &amp; sponges a nice fade on the nail.</li>
            <li>The polish came in a nice black box separated nicely in a plastic tray and plastic lid providing easy viewing of the colors and accessibility.</li>
            <li>Very strong and vibrant colors</li>
            <li>They are true to the bottle and rich.</li>
            <li>It was delivered to me pretty quickly and comes with a cute packaging.</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t anything special.</li>
            <li>Have you ever wanted to do a special design on your fingers but never knew how?</li>
            <li>I would add it to your cart right now!</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that this is the exact same quality you would get from the drugstore that you would pay $5 or more for each, easily.  </li>
            <li>know I&#x27;m about to sound like a huge nerd, but I was so excited when I first opened this</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly and I was so excited to receive them,  </li>
            <li>and I was super excited about it.</li>
            <li>the bright colors need a white underneath to ever show up.</li>
            <li>Arrived way before expected shipping arrival, which is great.</li>
            <li>It looks like its professional status and I have already heard from the person I bought this for that she loves it and its amazing quality.  </li>
            <li>OK I HAVE CHANGED MY MIND, thanks to being thought how to use the colors I thought weren&#x27;t for me.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited because the colors are very pretty.</li>
            <li>Buy overall it seemed like a good purchase.</li>
            <li>It covers well with one coat and is true to color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for overall color as well as nail art.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love these.</li>
            <li>the bottles are full size and true to color.</li>
            <li>Good buy all in all when starting a collection!</li>
            <li>I would pay full price for this</li>
            <li>but these are full size bottles.</li>
            <li>They are full size bottles.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use nail polish often, but bought these as individual gifts for a women&#x27;s spa day and everyone loved them.</li>
            <li>The quality of the polish is not bad at all for the price either.</li>
            <li>The most amazing thing is that I start with my left hand and continue with the right</li>
            <li>Lots of glitter colors (is glitter very popular suddenly?), lots of colors that are alike, but kind of different.  </li>
            <li>As my subject line suggests, some colors are awesome, some not so much.</li>
            <li>the nail polish itself tends to clump and chips pretty easy.</li>
            <li>i buy other polishes that are like $5-$10 for each bottle because the quality of the polish is great.</li>
            <li>But like everyone has said it is great for other kinds of nail art.</li>
            <li>Once I got my set, It was packaged nicely and came with it&#x27;s own little case.</li>
            <li>WIth a top coat I expect more durable finish (obviously) but have not found the need to use as these hold up well for 4-5 days.  </li>
            <li>Also it dries way to quickly.</li>
            <li>Got here quickly without any problems.</li>
            <li>Would have received 5 stars, but it seems that the polish peels off of our nails quickly.</li>
            <li>It dries fairly quick.</li>
            <li>but they do chip quickly.</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t sure is this would be worth it.</li>
            <li>It also shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>It solidifies really quickly</li>
            <li>if you do decide to purchase these, try to wait for a mild weather period.</li>
            <li>The packaged arrive quickly.</li>
            <li>Mine arrived quick and intact.</li>
            <li>Quickly did me and my daughters nails.</li>
            <li>Quality nail polishes and colors to match everything, dries quickly</li>
            <li>There is such a variety of color to choose from and the white works PERFECTLY for nail stamping.</li>
            <li>They came in super quick.</li>
            <li>The polish dries fairly quick, so that&#x27;s a plus in my book.</li>
            <li>so be prepared to use a glossy top coat and buff to get that high gloss shine,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone looking to buy polishes &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel that it was fantastic for full color coating (unless its for the kiddos or a 1-2day design without chipping) but for full plate stamping is gets the absolute full 5stars.</li>
            <li>Longer than my normal polish does, and it costs at lot more that these do.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re still very pretty.</li>
            <li>Very pleased and would buy future products from again.</li>
            <li>Basically, I can admit, I was being a bit cheap because I didn&#x27;t want to buy nail art polish for something I was just trying for the first time.</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty and the price was cheap, after 30 minutes of drying, you could scrape it off your nails, because it never harden.</li>
            <li>colors are pretty true to the color on the bottle with the exception of the bright yellow.</li>
            <li>Great for ombre effects on your nails since you get so many different shades of blue and reds/pink.</li>
            <li>I can do pretty much any design I want!!!</li>
            <li>The price is also very reasonable for such a good products.</li>
            <li>These colors are beautiful, last long, and are easy to clean up.</li>
            <li>My clients love my new colors.</li>
            <li>:) I may have found my new cosmetics supplier.</li>
            <li>The girls loved the colors and they did dry quicky.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty good deal for a lot of different colors of nail polish.</li>
            <li>and she loved them , she told me 2 of them were a bit dry</li>
            <li>So many of the reviews for this product are really great, so I have to wonder if Shany is &amp;#34;paying&amp;#34; for their reviews or if there are major inconsistencies in their production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the variety of colors and it comes in a handy tray, will recommend this to other people!</li>
            <li>And I am pretty picky when it comes to nail polish, but I LOVEEEEEEEE THIS!</li>
            <li>My most favorite product I have ordered in a long time!</li>
            <li>Lightning fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li>What I received is exactly what I was hoping for though!</li>
            <li>Over my new polishes, great quality for low price.</li>
            <li>It dries pretty quickly and is true to color.</li>
            <li>Dark, rich and bright would be how I would describe them.  </li>
            <li>Very vibrant colors - goes on smooth not chunky.</li>
            <li>My nails look great for about a week and then start looking a little raggedy.  </li>
            <li>These were great little gifts at my baby shower.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially great for mommies who only have the length of nap time to paint their nails and allow for them to dry and still get errands done!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s usually hard to find a really good nail polish set for such a great price</li>
            <li>This polish goes on smooth, covers well, does not bleed or streak when colors are layered &amp; dries fast.</li>
            <li>24 different polishes for the price is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Yes - for the price its really a great deal - even if 1-2 nail polishes had been dried out.</li>
            <li>Still totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Big bottles and nice colors.</li>
            <li>Bought thus for my 11year old daughter, she and her friends love it.</li>
            <li>I love the assortment of colors from soft pinks, purples, greens, and blues.</li>
            <li>Again, from far away ok, but just don&#x27;t look at my feet close up.</li>
            <li>The colors are nice (although, what&#x27;s with the NEON yellow one?</li>
            <li>Premium quick dry colors are perfect for women that want to be polished, but don&#x27;t have all day to go to the salon or sit around and wait for their manicures to dry.</li>
            <li>It does not come with a clear top coat, which is a bummer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it for a fun night out, but not for a weeklong mani.</li>
            <li>THIS IS BY FAR my favorite brand.</li>
            <li>24 polishes in cool colors, some glitter, for 25 is an absolute steal!</li>
            <li>They are worth your money.</li>
            <li>Fun to have for girls to paint nails for team colors or for holidays.</li>
            <li>Most of the solid colors provide smooth coverage in just one coat.</li>
            <li>It came in a nice sturdy box that can be left in for storage.</li>
            <li>i love the colors and the fast shipping i will buy more products from this company in the future.</li>
            <li>I love it, my 12 year old daughter does also.</li>
            <li>Most of the solid colors provide smooth coverage in just one coat.</li>
            <li>I love all the different colors and my kids enjoy painting their nails.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I will have a lot of fun with these.</li>
            <li>but this is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>it is fun to have lots of colors to use and they do chip after a couple of days</li>
            <li>This product arrived in Perfect condition with no bottles broken or spilled.</li>
            <li>The variety of colors is very great, and they all add up to the product images, except for the orange polish next to the red and mustard yellow, which looks more brown.</li>
            <li>cuz quality n will be broken or something but love it!!!!</li>
            <li>Have started my Christmas shopping early this year and thought this would be a great gift for my teenage niece.</li>
            <li>To ensure that my polish last longer I used a good top coat such as Seche Vite.</li>
            <li>WEEKS FUN FOR A RETIRED WOMAN WHO LIKES TO KEEP UP HER LOOKS</li>
            <li>Colors are fun.</li>
            <li>That said, I do think these would be excellent polishes for nail art (which I&#x27;m getting into lately), and good for your whole nail if you&#x27;re patient and willing to wait for dry time if you want a pretty bold color.</li>
            <li>Excellent coverage - the black and white, which is where most brands show their weak spots, are great quality.</li>
            <li>I like the colors and how it dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>properly(I don&#x27;t understand why they would have been opened in the first place) and also were drying out luckily</li>
            <li>Not even a single nail polish was out of place, and I was very pleased with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipping was super, super fast.</li>
            <li>The colors are so vibrant and you don&#x27;t really need to do two coats like you do with most nail polishes.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, my daughter loves it, She says it doesn&#x27;t chip like her other polishes, so that is a good sign.  </li>
            <li>My reason for ordering it was the good reviews I read about it from other customers...</li>
            <li>There is a good variety of colors and glitters and there are alot of pink!</li>
            <li>I have used them on my nails and they peel right off....</li>
            <li>but right now I wish I had saved my money.</li>
            <li>course, I had to try the polish right away.</li>
            <li>Theyre just right.</li>
            <li>If the person using this changes colors often this is right up thier ally</li>
            <li>Had to play right away.</li>
            <li>Arrived to me right on time.</li>
            <li>this came right on time and was everything I needed.  </li>
            <li>also tried these with the Shany nail stamps, and they were just not the right consistency.</li>
            <li>In my sock I found the whole nail polish piece that came off cleanly from one toe.</li>
            <li>I love how all the colors go on in their true color with only one coat!</li>
            <li>When I initially opened the box the smell of polish was very strong, but the scent faded a bit.</li>
            <li>SO many different colors to keep you looking good all year long!!</li>
            <li>I have been working on different nail designs lately (thanks to the wonders of Pinterest...) and was looking for a set of nail colors with a large variety that were actually of good quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I originally wrote two reviews based on how amazing they were packaged and after using the red regular color (which is fine)</li>
            <li>Thought they&#x27;d be smaller, but were a good size &amp; I like how it comes in its own little container/nail holder.</li>
            <li>Most nail polishes that I purchase chip off so quickly but the polishes from my cosmopolitan set never disappoints.</li>
            <li>Shipping was wonderful and nothing was spilled or broken which I think is because it was shipped in three different cardboard boxes then it was packed in a plastic box, shrink wrapped and it had a plastic tray with a plastic top.</li>
            <li>The polish is not top quality, but for the price, it is a great buy.</li>
            <li>One coat goes on smoothly, and dries in the normal amount of wait time.  </li>
            <li>great for all year round!</li>
            <li>The colors are great and the polish is as good as any other of the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>shipped fast, true to image, 24 colors.</li>
            <li>At first I was a bit worried that the nail polish would be a bit watery and chip easily, but it was there totally better than expected.</li>
            <li>The colors are rich and vibrant.</li>
            <li>The colors are rich and vibrant.</li>
            <li>It takes longer to dry then some nail polish, but other then that it seems like a great brand!</li>
            <li>Right when I shook it the... (I don&#x27;t even know how to explain what exactly happened)...</li>
            <li>Goes on Smooth, shines like crazy, and best of all Dries super fast.</li>
            <li>very similar, but some very different) and all of my artistic talents (or lack thereof depending on who you ask) can definitely be displayed proudly on my fingers!  </li>
            <li>These are so worth it, so I definitely recommend buying them :).</li>
            <li>I have long been looking for an assortment of nail polish that covers smoothly and is easy to work with.</li>
            <li>I am really happy with this purchase - and never would have done it if I didn&#x27;t have a gift certificate, I just wouldn&#x27;t plunk down the cash for an unknown brand of this many polishes-</li>
            <li>The shipment was very fast and all my bottles are in tack.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>AS DESCRIBED AND ARRIVED VERY FAST</li>
            <li>VERY FAST shipping.</li>
            <li>I was worried that the bottles would be small because you get so many for such a good price, but they are full sized.</li>
            <li>Other than what I&#x27;ve said so far, the packaging was great; the plastic tray prevents the bottles from breaking during their trip and also stops any leakage from occurring.</li>
            <li>They are all quick dry which makes them even better if you will paint kids nails.</li>
            <li>But of course, 24 great colors for $30 is hard to pass up.  </li>
            <li>A little clean up with acetone and all are good as new.</li>
            <li>the colors are really pretty, but the polish doesnt stay on</li>
            <li>I really love this nail polish set, I like to paint my nails a solid color and then use the glitter nail polish to put on the tips of my nails.</li>
            <li>I am still amazed that such beautiful polish was available at such a low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon</li>
            <li>The price at first was off putting because you see $30 for nail polish</li>
            <li>i love the different colors and the glittery ones also.</li>
            <li>We are pretty close friends, and often hang out and do our nails together.  </li>
            <li>My teenage granddaughter would just love this, I suspect.</li>
            <li>and I am hoping to try more of their products in the future.</li>
            <li>would really recommend you get these!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with the higher grade polishes form now on.</li>
            <li>These colors are pretty, But if you do any type of water marble design, These won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>So many colors and for such an affordable price.</li>
            <li>colors are exactly what is shown in the picture except for the oranges.</li>
            <li>be aware of that.</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>colors are as crisp as they look in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nothing at all was damaged and after using this product I&#x27;ve concluded that I&#x27;ll definitely be shopping for more SHANY products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely going to try out some more shany products.</li>
            <li>It does chip if you don&#x27;t put a clear coat on top however, which is pretty normal for nail polish.  </li>
            <li>To contrast, the second color I tried (the awesome 80&#x27;s teal) has lasted six days and is only now starting to chip.</li>
            <li>these colors are so pretty....</li>
            <li>This set is a lot like Shany&#x27;s nail art set - but for your whole nail!</li>
            <li>The lighter the color the more coats you&#x27;ll end up needing to get the same color on the bottle (that&#x27;s with every polish).</li>
            <li>When I first started applying the nail polish it was streaky and didnt cover well.</li>
            <li>The only problem that I did have with it was that there were too many boxes.</li>
            <li>The first coat of this polish is pretty rich/thick</li>
            <li>but for now the seller doesn&#x27;t deserve a higher rating.</li>
            <li>Other than that I love the colors and this product!</li>
            <li>Ok, so I&#x27;m typing this having literally just screwed the cap on the last bottle and here are the facts:&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus, point 2 from the first review is still true--quickest drying polish I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with this product line.</li>
            <li>n dries fast!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>My first polish lasted over a week and didn&#x27;t chip or fade.</li>
            <li>I really feel like I got my moneyâ€™s worth.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a bright green nail polish and ran across this.</li>
            <li>I have searched all of amazon for a stamping polish without the expensive price and this one was perfect for me.</li>
            <li>the colors are so pretty and opec.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more shany polishes.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t really know if they&#x27;re worth the money or not.</li>
            <li>Although each coloris darker than the picture, they are still pretty colors.</li>
            <li>, none were dried out and everyone loved it....</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that you get so much polish (all 24 bottles are full sized) at such a reasonable price considering chain drug stores charge $5 - $8 for one bottle here in NYC.</li>
            <li>Quick drying, high quality.</li>
            <li>Kind of thick and peels off easily, have already had to add polish thinner to some of the bottles.</li>
            <li>The polish is not too harsh for nails, or drying, therefore my nails are still growing strong and healthy.</li>
            <li>This is a must buy for anyone who wants an abundance of colors of good quality for less money.</li>
            <li>I will order this brand again and am waiting for the full set of new colors from the shany to be released in this size also.</li>
            <li>Flakes off far more easily than any other polish I&#x27;ve ever used, but the colors are fun for kids.</li>
            <li>only thing is they send to me 2 same color I prefere for sure to have&lt;br /&gt;one of each one colors for have more options but is fast delivery , in</li>
            <li>I was very surprised when I saw this full size</li>
            <li>It came in a little box with a neat little display case.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for this perfect product and quick shipping.</li>
            <li>The colors are very vibrant and fun and it goes on and covers very well.  </li>
            <li>Nonetheless, not disappointed so far.</li>
            <li>One of the bottles had no bristles on the brush, I had to clean an old one off and use it instead-</li>
            <li>And judging by the reviews it was a decent set and worth the money.  </li>
            <li>The polish is thick and only needs one coat and the colors are great!  </li>
            <li>How is it possible to have all of them in such a good price?</li>
            <li>It came in perfect packaging, I was worried that it would have been a little more fragile with so many containers of glass nail polish, but it arrived with each nail polish  snuggled neatly in it&#x27;s own little hole, a clear plastic box, a brown box, some of those big &amp;#34;bubble&amp;#34; fillers, and another big box.  </li>
            <li>I never buy any cheap polish like that again, delivery very fast, but some color never dry.</li>
            <li>The pigmentation of the colors are very true and all you need is the standard two coats.</li>
            <li>wish i could say simething positive, but can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>would definitely order from the company again, as the customer services was friendly, fast, and i received my package of nail polishes unbroken and relatively quickly.  </li>
            <li>They go on very smooth and dried pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Stays on really long love it</li>
            <li>Bought this for the gf as a bday present to go with the bundle monster 20 pc brush set, hit a home run, thought it would b expensive cuz the stores charge so much for polish, great product and better price, arrived in nice packaging that holds and organizes them, wish the gf would put them back in their tho, haha women, gotta luv em</li>
            <li>O.P.I makes a fantastic base coat and Seche makes a great top coat.</li>
            <li>this collection has pretty much every color I&#x27;m looking for in one kit.  </li>
            <li>Would really recommend it to my friends and family.nails are so pretty</li>
            <li>The arrival date was the first of my \\&quot;estimated delivery days\\&quot; and I was very pleased!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used a couple colors so far but the colors are fantastic and smooth.</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised these are full size nail polish bottles and lots of colors.</li>
            <li>i love the all the different vibrant colors to choose from.</li>
            <li>Great colors and price the only problem I had with this product is some of the lighter colors and pretty much all the dark colors gooey</li>
            <li>The variety of colors &amp; glitters mean we can all have our own favorites!</li>
            <li>I love that this kit has a wide verity of color and it all drys fast!</li>
            <li>And they were a nice variety of all colors, not just your typical pinks and reds.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure one coat would dry quickly, but the color wouldn&#x27;t be nearly as noticeable that way.</li>
            <li>The size of the application brush affords ease of use and the variety of colors are certain to please everyone.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t matter how good the packing is when the quality of the product is so bad, the smell is too strong, made me have a strong headache all day</li>
            <li>but I can live with that!!</li>
            <li>The color goes on smoothly and seems like it will last a long time with top coat.</li>
            <li>Also they dry fast which I love.</li>
            <li>Nice colors, but the product was probably too old because some of the colors were dry out when it got here</li>
            <li>however some of the colors kind of repeat, such as there are two yellow and two light pinks which look like they are almost exactly the same colors.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m going to buy the other sets.</li>
            <li>The selection of colors in this set are varied &amp; vibrant!</li>
            <li>No broken bottles, a nice try to keep all the little bottles neat.</li>
            <li>First of all, the colors are so fabulous and vibrant and secondly, the company shipped everything so fast and ensured that the package had no chance of being damaged.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the colors (even the neon yellow, as it can still be used for nail art, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it on my whole nail), but the quality of the actual polish is why I&#x27;m a little up in the air about the star rating.</li>
            <li>I really like this nail polish.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the timely delivery.</li>
            <li>Figured orange wasnt really my color anyway.</li>
            <li>I like the box so much</li>
            <li>very well packaged for shipping and giving as a gift.  </li>
            <li>My daughter absolutely loves the variety of colors</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend This set!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s real.</li>
            <li>I really like the pinks and reds</li>
            <li>This polish looks cheap, smells cheaper, and some of the bottles don&#x27;t even open.</li>
            <li>Very watery polish.</li>
            <li>I must say that i am blown away by how fast my order came,the way it was packaged, and the quality of my polish.</li>
            <li>I now don&#x27;t have to spend so much money on nail polish meant specifically for stamp art.</li>
            <li>The polish was very clumpy.  </li>
            <li>Fast drying is always desirable however this polish is too fast drying for</li>
            <li>that I didn&#x27;t really like</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t read the description very well, and thought these were mini bottles.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It dries fast.</li>
            <li>The polish was very clumpy...</li>
            <li>more than I expected  </li>
            <li>the quality is good,,,i really like getting a whole bunch AT ONCE....</li>
            <li>Thanks..</li>
            <li>I chose a five star rating because this set really stunned me.</li>
            <li>Regular size bottle of fabulous colors for summer.</li>
            <li>Those are some i can&#x27;t really use anymore.</li>
            <li>She and my daughter headed straight for the bedroom to put on.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this nail polish collection (SHANY Cosmetics</li>
            <li>Very upset.</li>
            <li>These go on smoothly and last for days.</li>
            <li>I would try them and see if you like them as much as i do.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>Package arrived on time and packaged very well.</li>
            <li>Colors are very Spring and Summer</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant about buying this set.</li>
            <li>The package came protected and sealed very well.  </li>
            <li>I was very upset.</li>
            <li>All the polishes are high quality!</li>
            <li>I tried out those 4 colors and all are very gloppy.  </li>
            <li>and I enjoy every second of it!!</li>
            <li>Now I just need some remover haha</li>
            <li>That made me really nervous -</li>
            <li>They are not thin and see through at all.</li>
            <li>but you really get the bang for you buck.</li>
            <li>Very disappointing!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Will be purchasing more in the near future.</li>
            <li>I bought this set since I recently started back doing my own pedicures.</li>
            <li>I can actually say that this may be my favorite brand of nail polish I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>But this nail polish did NOT &amp;#34;bubble&amp;#34; and all of it dried nicely, rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The paint goes on smooth and thick so once is enough for a good coat.  </li>
            <li>In order for the neon colors to show true, I had to coat my daughter&#x27;s nails with white polish first and then use the neon color over it.</li>
            <li>Other than this, the product seems okay and the rest of the bottles are filled completely and not dried out.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the first polish I opened the brush went flying off the end and landed on my NEW jeans</li>
            <li>I had a return issue with this product but after figuring out use chat, they are sending me a new set, first one was damaged.</li>
            <li>the bottle)&lt;br /&gt;dry fast on nails and last about 3 weeks cause my mom clean houses</li>
            <li>Colors are true to the bottle, however the polish itself seems a little cheap.</li>
            <li>The quality is great too and seem to last as long as those big name polishes.</li>
            <li>Compared to paying $5 a bottle for most other polishes.</li>
            <li>I love the nail stamps, but I have to use them with other polish.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and it dries fast too.  </li>
            <li>As long as you allow it to set you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>For the price I really didn&#x27;t expect the quality or the vibrant colors.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun for a first time set for younger people</li>
            <li>They dry very quickly</li>
            <li>These nail polishes go on very well and the colors are vibrant.</li>
            <li>nail polish does NOT dry quickly.</li>
            <li>I learned after trying this out for a few months that I rather spend a little bit more on other more popular nail polish to avoid this problem cause&#x27;</li>
            <li>Its so much fun, I really like being able to change the colors and having such a wide variety of colors to use.</li>
            <li>I regularly use polish, from top brands like china glaze and opi to cheap brands like wet n wild.</li>
            <li>until I used it!&lt;br /&gt;All of the bottles in the set were fresh, new, and definitely NOT dried out/</li>
            <li>The lighter orange, in real life is more of a tannish color that I don&#x27;t particularly care for &amp; the darker orange is VERY close to the same color as the red.</li>
            <li>I have to wear a cleaning mask when I use them, may just be only me since I am sensitive to strong chemical smells.</li>
            <li>They are normal size bottles, easy to open and such fun colors.  </li>
            <li>The polishes were bigger than what I expected and The colors look even better in person!</li>
            <li>It was packaged pretty but seems to be old polish cause</li>
            <li>its not bad enough to where i dont use it.</li>
            <li>More that I expected!!</li>
            <li>I was very excited to get 24 flashy nail colors for such a good price.</li>
            <li>The neon yellow looking color is exactly like a highlighter yellow, after 2 coats it looks sweet!</li>
            <li>great nail polishes took 3 days and they last a long time and nail polishes don&#x27;t dry out.(in</li>
            <li>It went on my nails smoothly without any clumps and lasted a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Vibrant colors that are resistant to wear and tear.</li>
            <li>These are decent colors, and decent quality.  </li>
            <li>These were full-sized bottles of vibrant colors.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more shany products in the future.</li>
            <li>I paint my nails twice a week (because I love doing different colors and such.)</li>
            <li>* (after further use, and from 5 to 4 stars)&lt;br /&gt;So after using the product for a while, I find it interesting that each color seems to act differently.</li>
            <li>It dries fast, but is vivid in color.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had some issues with the bristles on the brushes coming loose, but the polish goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>The polish was still clumpy and even with 2 coats, it didn&#x27;t look good and had a very dull finish.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it for someone looking for a gift set.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I highly recomend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Have been wearing the true red color on my nails forr nearly a week now with no chipping at all!</li>
            <li>some of the colors chip off pretty easy and others are long lasting.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She says they dry super fast</li>
            <li>But as a plus, the polish comes off easily with nail polish remover unlike some other brands.</li>
            <li>it isnt the greatest quality because when i put the polish on, it&#x27;s so HARD to get off with ordinary nail polish remover...</li>
            <li>I guess a slightly older woman can learn new things.</li>
            <li>The polish goes on smooth, chipping is minimal, about what you&#x27;d expect.  </li>
            <li>I recieved the nailpolish in a sealed package but when I opened it and tried to use the light purple, it was empty.</li>
            <li>It has mostly fun pedicure colors as well as some basic manicure colors.  </li>
            <li>My only issue is they do chip pretty fast</li>
            <li>Colors are pretty, but most of the polishes are thick, stringy, and unusable.</li>
            <li>Normal sized bottles.</li>
            <li>I like many of the colors, although there are a few I don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I discovered that MOST of them are dried.</li>
            <li>I ordered this set of 24 nail polishes specifically because they had the normal nail polish brush with them.  </li>
            <li>nice thick polish....</li>
            <li>It goes on nice, even and thick.</li>
            <li>So in general the colors are gorgeous but most are impossible to use.</li>
            <li>some of the polish goes on really great and others are a little clumpy and look like a mess on the nail.</li>
            <li>Some of them go on smooth and others are super thick.</li>
            <li>The quality of these shany nail polish aren&#x27;t the best and not the worst they smell extremely strong</li>
            <li>It has a very strong smell after is dry, takes forever to dry</li>
            <li>I seriously think this is my new favorite nail polish!</li>
            <li>Great selection of colors but the nail polish is a very thin liquid</li>
            <li>Some polishes (the bright blue) dry very fast and others (yellow) take hours to dry so</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t go on as smooth as other brands.  </li>
            <li>There are a lot of colors and they all seem like they&#x27;re new...</li>
            <li>(It seems like every evening she&#x27;s wiping off her nail polish to try a new color.)</li>
            <li>I have been looking in drugstores and makeup stores for a new nail polish when I came across these on amazon.</li>
            <li>Even being very careful, I could never achieve a smooth layer.</li>
            <li>I have nail drops by OPI to quick dry them and also a nail drier</li>
            <li>The colors are vivid and dry fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>The Cosmopolitan Nail Polish Set 24 Colors) since it comes with all sorts of colors and is very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>The actual dollar store nail polishes are very watery, these are pretty thick which makes one coat of color a sufficient amount most of the time.</li>
            <li>My little cousin&#x27;s absolutely have all the fun when they come over because they always want to paint their nails!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried 2 colors so far (red and gold sparkle) and they glide on the nail just fine.</li>
            <li>Although the price is right and the colors are beautiful, the polish itself is like old nail polish, hard to use and thick as glue.  </li>
            <li>The girls had fun and by having such a large assortment they all could be different.</li>
            <li>It takes awhile to dry and the matte colors are really flat, but that&#x27;s easily fixed with a top coat.</li>
            <li>The nail polish is old any clumpy!  </li>
            <li>It held up well and the colors are so vivid.</li>
            <li>it may not be as shiny as other brands, but using  a top coat definitely helps.  </li>
            <li>Such pretty colors, i just wish they had lived up to my expectations.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this seller ships it exactly the same</li>
            <li>This nail polish is long lasting, dries quickly, and has very vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>Same exact colors</li>
            <li>I participated in a secret santa and my person seemed very pleased with this gift</li>
            <li>I have yet to be disappointed by Shany Cosmetics, this set came packaged perfectly with no issues.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>She is a regular customer of Shany cosmetics and bought many other items from them.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to use them and will come back and add to my review after my first application.&lt;br</li>
            <li>also, without topcoat nail polish chips off... not the best polish for nail art and stamping :(</li>
            <li>The matte finish polishes that were not dried up worked well, but they do chip easily and don&#x27;t last long before the chips</li>
            <li>A base coat protects your natural nail but importantly with these polishes it allows the coat to go on more smoothly.</li>
            <li>the polish is cheap and needs at least 2 coats and chips with in first day.</li>
            <li>I knocked some over on my boyfriend&#x27;s laptop stand and quickly cleaned it up with a wet cloth then with a dab of polish remover.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried 5 colors so far and am anxious to try more.  </li>
            <li>Dark green color is applied smoothly but color itself looks cheap.</li>
            <li>Also the colors are very cute, the only ones that I probably wouldn&#x27;t use are the dark grey and the sort of brown color</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;ve tried quite a few colors today their true to the color in the bottle not watery at all &amp; their nice &amp; thick.</li>
            <li>this very vibrant yellow color.  </li>
            <li>Very very pretty and vibrant colors, just a little stringy and</li>
            <li>HUGE WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, I sampled a few colors which went on smoothly without any lumps.  </li>
            <li>The description given for them did not make it clear what colors I was getting.  </li>
            <li>i recommend putting a clear coat on it because some of them turn out matte.</li>
            <li>When it arrived I was pleasently surprised with its durability.</li>
            <li>Two coats of paint covers it with all the colors I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>to your local drugstore and buy the cheap Wet and Wild if you want a variety of colors for bargain prices.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my 10 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>I bought this nail polish gift set as a birthday gift for my 15 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>Makes me feel like this time, the set was old and they sent it to me.</li>
            <li>One negative is the color does not stay on for more than a day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought nail polishes for a fourth of the cost of this product for one 2oz bottle and it ended up being really crappy polish, but Shany Cosmetics has me blown out of the water.</li>
            <li>This nail polish looks professional when applied.  </li>
            <li>so far all the ones i have tried</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much because each polishes are $1 only.</li>
            <li>They seemed old upon arrival.</li>
            <li>So for the cost I like it so far.</li>
            <li>After one day of wear it looked like I had month old polish on.  </li>
            <li>Meaning the polish was old.  </li>
            <li>out\\&quot; or \\&quot;wild and crazy\\</li>
            <li>Classy packaging and a quality product.</li>
            <li>I purchased the polish in order to use it in a professional setting.</li>
            <li>but she fixed them with her nail polish thinner</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m glad I bought these but be prepared to need to replace a few shades</li>
            <li>The array of colors is wide and fun to mix and match.</li>
            <li>I am dissapointed because the nail polish dont last more than few days.</li>
            <li>Not terrible , not amazing.</li>
            <li>The darker matte colors go on more thickly than the frosts</li>
            <li>I love the colors and the quality but its really thick.</li>
            <li>There are soooo many colors, and they are thick and not messy.</li>
            <li>This packet of nail polish have lots of colors and it dry very fast.</li>
            <li>The first thing I did was open one up to see how thick it would be, if it had a strong odor, and what the brushes looked like.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure my daughter has used them everyday since receiving them!!</li>
            <li>I.e. the LIGHT blue shade and some other shades.</li>
            <li>They came packed tightly in a pretty (and protective) box, and not one is spilled or dry.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat 24 full size nail polishes for less than $30.</li>
            <li>The hottest colors that dry quickly and cover well with only one coat.</li>
            <li>and I even though I love the colors and the prices of the Shany, the quality is seriously lacking in comparison with Sally Hansen and the like.</li>
            <li>They dry quickly, which is a huge plus for me as I have trouble sitting still for long periods.  </li>
            <li>I painted my toes using the white and it took two coats which is pretty standard.</li>
            <li>The colors are as vibrant in person as they look on the site; however, I haven&#x27;t used any of them and won&#x27;t do so until 45 days for my teen birthday party.  </li>
            <li>The dark colors only required one coat, the light colors required two.</li>
            <li>and when I am finishing the right hand the left is already dry, as a new mom I don&#x27;t have to much of me time to wait it to be dry .</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this set for anyone building or adding to their current collection.</li>
            <li>This was major chipping!</li>
            <li>major issue that I have with this, is that the product never dries!</li>
            <li>This seemed like a great deal but this is really poorly made nail polish, it chips after less than a day the colors are not glossy at all</li>
            <li>A lot of colors good for the price but the color goes off on less than five days and it feels thick also</li>
            <li>The only ones that I have to do three coats on are the lighter colors: Yellow, light pink etc.</li>
            <li>/&gt;9 out of the 24 are hot pink color #04.  </li>
            <li>Very quick to resolve my issues so please disregard any negative complaints I had.</li>
            <li>They also dry incredibly fast.</li>
            <li>The Cosmopolitan Nail Polish Set (24 Colors Premium Quality and Quick Dry), 40 Fluid Ounce]]</li>
            <li>For the money, I&#x27;d much rather buy wet n wild polish or sinful colors.</li>
            <li>I was looking for some cheap and variety of nail polish colors that I could use to test out designs and wear for only a few days.</li>
            <li>These colors are opague on the first coat, and last a long time.</li>
            <li>The polish dries fast as others said, and it is a tad matte if you only use one coat, but I found adding a second coat helps.  </li>
            <li>The Cosmopolitan Nail Polish Set (24 Colors Premium Quality and Quick Dry), 40 Fluid Ounce]]</li>
            <li>its all thick, and its SO EASY to peel off after it dries</li>
            <li>I thought maybe the issue was that I was not using a base or top coat, so I purchased premium quality base/ top coats &amp; tried applying the nail polish that way-</li>
            <li>They are thick, gloppy, show brush lines, wear off and chip easily</li>
            <li>I bought this as a christmas present for my 13 yr old - she loves it!  </li>
            <li>After 12 hours, my daughters nails are nearly completely bare of polish!  </li>
            <li>All in all, this was an okay purchase especially for the small price you have to pay!</li>
            <li>I got this set because it was inexpensive, and my daughter goes through nail polish like no other.</li>
            <li>so I got exactly what I expected packaging and color-wise, but my expectations were exceeded in value!</li>
            <li>/&gt;In general</li>
            <li>I received this set last week and have given myself and my daughter two manicures so far.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed when I received it &amp; started trying the different colors out, that the product was professional grade.</li>
            <li>barely got my set in</li>
            <li>not closed</li>
            <li>I wanted to return it, but apparently I can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Normal sized bottles if not on the bit larger size with 24 different colors.</li>
            <li>So I was pleased I didn&#x27;t receive any broken bottles.</li>
            <li>Either way it&#x27;s cool if u just want a variety of color and only plan on having the color on for a few days.</li>
            <li>Sorry to say this but buy this product at your own risk.  </li>
            <li>However, upon opening the package, we noticed that there was a bottle that was only 1/3 full and dried out.</li>
            <li>Less expensive than purchasing from a retail store and has a great case that it comes with.</li>
            <li>All in all, decent product for the price, but definitely not high quality polishes.</li>
            <li>The black polish in this kit works a million times better then the Konad stamp art black polish!</li>
            <li>The first time i used this polish it chipped after a day and a half</li>
            <li>Unlike other nail polishes this one actually stays on and will not chip off the first week.</li>
            <li>If other people don&#x27;t have streaking issues, mine could simply be because of the hot weather, so</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used all of the colors yet, but some of the polishes I did apply to my entire nail went on a little streaky (thinner in some parts, thicker in others), and absolutely require more than one coat - which cuts down on the dry time, which is a big bummer for me.</li>
            <li>Some of the polishes have a little iridescence, there are a few sparkly ones, bright colors, dark colors...</li>
            <li>I will at least try some of the more unusual shades here, but I really can&#x27;t see myself ever wearing the yellowy-yellow or neon green or black (on any day that isn&#x27;t Halloween).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only negative is the strong smell, which is apparent before you even open the box.</li>
            <li>My only complaint, which isn&#x27;t really the suppliers fault, is that since I ordered this in May(?), June(?) and live in the Arizona desert, one of the bottle caps was melting!!</li>
            <li>They dried quickly and lasted a long time.</li>
            <li>The nail polish had some great colors but a few of the colors were half empty and dried up.</li>
            <li>They are even viscosity, dry very consistently, (one bottle dries same speed as another or one color dries same as other).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great quality and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li>I eagerly awaited the arrival of these with great expectations-Was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, the polish arrived today (Sept 5) and the first thing I did was check every polish to see if any were dried</li>
            <li>The green glitter (15) and burnt sienna (23) were gooped around the rim and a good bit seemed to be missing from the glitter green.</li>
            <li>but many of them were dried out due to the caps being loose or just being old!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was having to paint my nails every other day, I finally just threw the whole set away &amp; bought a different brand.</li>
            <li>Many other are too thick and goopy to apply properly.</li>
            <li>But even then,doing a coat of silver on the black looked very nice(I thought).</li>
            <li>I used hot pink on my toes and Barbie pink on my nails.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using them for about two weeks now, and though it seems to chip a little faster than more expensive polishes, they seem to hold up pretty well.</li>
            <li>Some chipped a little after a few days but you can fix that easily.  </li>
            <li>thing about this polish that is an absolute necessity is using a high quality base coat and top coat.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve tried layering neon green with the hot pink</li>
            <li>These took far longer than that simply because I put two coats on, pretty thick, in order to avoid streaking.</li>
            <li>Packaging was solid and all polishes seemed fine until i took off the plastic wrapping and realized that my #6 color \\&quot;fuscia pink\\&quot; was left partially open somehow and is extremely goopy, might be able to fix with a little polish remover to thin it out but still kind of disappointing because it was my favorite color in the whole set :(</li>
            <li>Nice rich colors, glides on easily, not clumpy or thick and gluey.  </li>
            <li>Dried fine for me does take a little longer than others maybe 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>I was very skeptical about purchasing this products due to some of the reviews that it has received in the pass, but I ended up purchasing the product anyway because figured it&#x27; was a great deal.</li>
            <li>My daughter said the brushes were fine - not too thin.  </li>
            <li>Brushes were good, no pieces of the brush coming loose or anything crazy like that.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and not watered down at all.</li>
            <li>This polish is very thick and cheap.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if it is the quality of the lacquer itself or the \\&quot;quick dry time\\&quot; but the polish doesn&#x27;t spread out AT ALL in the water, just staying as drops in the middle or eventually sinking to the bottom.</li>
            <li>The purple is a little too blue and the only light green is metallic.</li>
            <li>some polishes thick, some good, some very very thin and dry too fast to get nail covered properly.</li>
            <li>I had some good and some bad issues with this order.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not all bad, but they&#x27;re not all good.</li>
            <li>But ultimately the good outweighed the bad</li>

            <li> but color&#x27;s are so amazing and attractive</li>
            <li> The colors are just as bright as they appear here.</li>
            <li> The colors are bright and varied.  </li>
            <li> Most* of them have great coverage, and they are all really great colors.  </li>
            <li> These colors are bright.  </li>
            <li> The colors are great and look amazing when they are on.  </li>
            <li> The colors are great and the bottles are a nice size.</li>
            <li> and we loved it.  </li>
            <li> Good price</li>
            <li> All the nail polishes are not in good condition.</li>
            <li> but however if you&#x27;re looking for good quality nail polish.</li>
            <li> these arent really good.... and even when i put it on..</li>
            <li> Each of these bottles cost about $1.50 so they are a good deal in comparison.</li>
            <li> Good value.</li>
            <li> then this is a good set.</li>
            <li> You need 3-4 coats if you want good coverage.</li>
            <li> This set had good reviews</li>
            <li> None of them broke and Polish is good quality.</li>
            <li> These nail polishes are really good.</li>
            <li> Good job.</li>
            <li> this seems like a good buy.</li>
            <li> and I know nail polish isn&#x27;t supposed to smell good</li>
            <li> I think the people who wrote good reviews did so before trying the product; it seems like a good value, but it is in fact a scam.  </li>
            <li> Good consistency.</li>
            <li> 25 fantastic beautiful colors!  </li>
            <li> The assortment of colors isn&#x27;t as good as it looks.</li>
            <li> They are good quality, not quite on par with OPI/China Glaze, but for the price they are good.</li>
            <li> so if the nail polish is just as good as buying the ones from the store than i wonder what their make up is like.</li>
            <li> This might be a good buy for someone who likes to do nail art or changes their nail color often.</li>
            <li> however, as one might expect from the price, the quality is fairly patchy.</li>
            <li> This was a nice variety of colors for the price and made a great gift.</li>
            <li> the quality is good</li>
            <li> My daughter likes it so its all good.</li>

            <li> goes on good.</li>

            <li> Fair value for the price.</li>

            <li> thanks for the great service!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with some of the colors in this set.</li>
            <li> This came in a timely manner with nice packaging for storage.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m kind of terrified to try using the rest of them.</li>
            <li> It looks nice and shiny.</li>
            <li> No matter how much fanatical care I take to ensure a perfect pedicure, this happens everytime.</li>
            <li> I bought the set of 24 because it was more affordable and good quality nail polish.</li>
            <li> I like to do my own nails</li>
            <li> They are full size bottles with beautiful colors.</li>
            <li> The bottles come all wrapped up nicely for sale at a store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the kind of girl that likes to have options and also likes to save money</li>
            <li> I do own some of the Shany polishes</li>
            <li> The product couldnt be returned because it was deemed hazardous material</li>
            <li> The quality is good and I really love the colors.</li>
            <li> She liked the colors</li>
            <li> Some people have said they come out looking kind of matte, but I think they just aren&#x27;t so glittery.</li>
            <li> These are really nice...</li>
            <li> And you cannot return it because it&#x27;s a hazardous material.</li>
            <li> The packaging was nice.  </li>
            <li> This set has some lovely colors, and has received good reviews, so I was expecting to have a winner.</li>
            <li> the it has nice luster no need to apply topcoat on it.</li>
            <li> nice varity of colors</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> Worth it since it&#x27;s a gorgeous color and all of the others are great</li>
            <li> For the price it is good, just be prepared to use more than two coats</li>
            <li> They came in the perfect box to keep them neat and ready.  </li>
            <li> and I find out that you can&#x27;t return this product since it&#x27;s hazardous and I can&#x27;t seem to find a link for a refund.  </li>
            <li> She was thrilled with all the colors.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my niece who loves to do her own nails</li>
            <li> she liked it.</li>
            <li> Wish it would be all a nice consistency to put on the nails.  </li>
            <li> Even with a good top coat AND using the Shany nail dryer, I have smudges and chips.</li>
            <li> Oh, and it&#x27;s non-returnable because it&#x27;s considered hazardous substance.  </li>
            <li> Great array of colors, I love it, I get to make many designs on myself and my friends.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m completely in love with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so in love.</li>
            <li> nail polish chips after a day even with top coat..</li>
            <li> but for a dollar a piece is a good deal for fun polishing for teens</li>
            <li> Overall, really very happy with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> love--</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> If your looking for more bang for your $$buck</li>
            <li> I tried out most of the colors on sample designs I&#x27;ve made.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t written many reviews, but I wanted to this time.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really glad I ordered it.  </li>
            <li> But since then, I&#x27;ve tried 2 more bottles of color and they were just what I was expecting --</li>
            <li> My recommendation would be to better describe the colors in each of these sets of polish.  </li>
            <li> I am  completely satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> This is it :)</li>
            <li> I love all the colors...</li>
            <li> , I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They are really cute.</li>
            <li> Nothing a top coat won&#x27;t correct.</li>
            <li> Too many to choose but cannot use glitter coz it looks like more glue glitter.</li>
            <li> Better than nothing.</li>
            <li> Many colors come with plastic tray that can be used to store them.</li>
            <li> There are just too many better polishes out there to choose from.</li>
            <li> There are so many nail colors these days</li>
            <li> so we could pick from many colors.  </li>
            <li> A better deal than buying all colors separate.  </li>
            <li> that this is a lovely gift.</li>
            <li> I love the variety of colors and glitters.</li>
            <li> I love to paint my nails</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s okay-</li>
            <li> so time isn&#x27;t a factor to deter myself from enjoying this playful color set.</li>
            <li> I really love the colors of the nail polish.</li>
            <li> Ichose 5 star ,love the nail polish color and shine.</li>
            <li> I have not tried many of the colors yet as I don&#x27;t get to wear nail polish that often.</li>
            <li> But now I can say I&#x27;ve learned my lesson and wont be buying any more of their products.</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy something that is better quality.</li>
            <li> These may be better as an accent on top of another color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you just want something to use to play with your nails a bit, sure, try this brand.</li>
            <li> As soon as i run out I will order more.</li>
            <li> Love the holder too.</li>
            <li> I love this set.  </li>
            <li> I love the variety of colors and glitters.</li>
            <li> I love this set.</li>
            <li> I so love it.</li>
            <li> I love the color selection in this set and when you consider how many you get in one box, you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> .Absolutely love it</li>
            <li> Purchased to use for a spa party and were pleased with the assortment of colors.</li>
            <li> I am just getting into nail art, but I have been painting my nails for the better part of 25 years.  </li>
            <li> I love most of these polishes.  </li>
            <li> Some polishes might take more than one coat</li>
            <li> The bottles were all intact, no leaking or breaking, and came in a cute box that I may continue to use.  </li>
            <li> The color selection is as shown, and I love most of them.  </li>
            <li> The seller needs to do a much better job managing shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting my business, and this is the perfect addition to my polishes.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughters because they love for me to paint their nails.</li>
            <li> I guess i was satisfied with this purchase...</li>
            <li> Color selection was better then I thought.</li>
            <li> I love nail polish.</li>
            <li> The colors are BEAUTIFUL.I love using these nail polishes on my nails.</li>
            <li> I love the color varieties.</li>
            <li> I could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li> They came in a separate box, which I love because now I do not have to find a container to store them in.</li>
            <li> but I would recommend it to anyone who would listen :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely satisfied with all of the products i have purchased before</li>
            <li> It was one of the prettier purple colors, which happens to be her favorite color.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love about a kaleidoscope of color for this price?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> Guess I need to paint my nails more often.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased with the nail color.  </li>
            <li> Everyone was satisfied. :)</li>
            <li> My daughters love these.</li>
            <li> However, it is wonderful for personal use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It painted on streaky and took many coats to get it to look like the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not, its just ok.</li>
            <li> There are so many colors to choose from :)</li>
            <li> The display is simply stunning.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THEM.</li>
            <li> I love that.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This polish is fantastic for stamping!</li>
            <li> Received this for Christmas and absolutely love the selection of colors, the number of bottles and the size.  </li>
            <li> OK for the price though.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better value for my money</li>
            <li> Maybe a couple too many pinks, but that could be a preference</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> Hope that shany cosmetics comes with peach colors for this set, that will be the cherry on the top.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: I found that it was better to use acetone nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> I love painting my nails</li>
            <li> Most must-have colours are in this set, including reds and pinks.</li>
            <li> Love the colours.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PROTECTION A+ WILL BUY AGAIN IN FUTURE</li>
            <li> I just wish there weren&#x27;t so many colors that I will never use.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Really really lovely Shany nail polish</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I love painting my nails and do my sister and cousins&#x27; nails all the time.</li>
            <li> I really love this polish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a great variety of colors!</li>
            <li> Many didn&#x27;t mix together, some looked like they had been used before.  </li>
            <li> , they were unopened in the original Shany box and they come in a plastic nail polish holder (like the kind you see at the stores) which I thought was cute and it makes storing them a lot</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and everything was packaged very nicely.</li>
            <li> Definitely will purchase more things from shany!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very rich color and consistency.</li>
            <li> Pretty good value for the money, although I don&#x27;t know that I love all of the colors.  </li>
            <li> ; ) grand daughter loved it</li>
            <li> Great vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be specific: the application brush isn&#x27;t the best, to achieve a perfect coverage you have to use a lot of product, the polishes aren&#x27;t shiny once they dry.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find that the colors were vibrant.</li>
            <li> It does not apply smoothly and chips off very easily.</li>
            <li> Granted, if you don&#x27;t use a top coat, it chips easily, but you can use any $6.00 top coat.</li>
            <li> Full size bottles of amazing colors.</li>
            <li> Based on her information, the variety of colors is amazing and they are full size.  </li>
            <li> personal favorite nail polish brand (and what I feel is the best available) is China Glaze.</li>
            <li> variety is pretty good.</li>
            <li> Thank you for such a nice product!!</li>
            <li> But they are definitely worth the price!!</li>
            <li> I had so much fun with these polishes!!  </li>
            <li> I just received my package today, and I am really excited!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the cheaper brands like Sinful Colors because I find they chip so easily even with a top coat.</li>
            <li> smooth, covered well with only one coat, and great color!!  </li>
            <li> and they last her 3 weeks good product so good money spend</li>
            <li> Good quality for such a good price.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a single problem with any one of the 24 colors, each one was in excellent condition and there are no duplicate colors.</li>
            <li> The dotter tools and the colorful tape work magically!</li>
            <li> For the price, I feel you get your moneys worth plus more!  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I found such great quality polishes for such a great price!</li>
            <li> It should be a good value, but it certainly wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> The colors are very true to what they look like in the bottle</li>
            <li> Very cool.</li>
            <li> Shany goes on smoothly, stays on longer, and comes off better with polish remover than Essie or OPI for $8 a bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m incredibly bummed that I cannot get my money back, and I will not be buying Shany products anymore.</li>
            <li> Theyre cheap that i cannot have these nail color stays for more than 4 days.</li>
            <li> Some don&#x27;t need as many layers for full color...for those that you need more layers, some colors will build up on the nail causing that puffy look and others won&#x27;t...</li>
            <li> Not eve kind of worth it.</li>
            <li> She loved them so much.  </li>
            <li> they also work really well for stamping plates!!!:)</li>
            <li> I should also add that when I received these in the mail, it was a pretty hot day, so when I opened the package the bottles of polish were very warm to the touch - which I&#x27;m sure can probably diminish the quality of the polish.</li>
            <li> I love nail polish and this has quickly become a favorite brand.</li>
            <li> In fact I am so impressed I will be trying out some of their other products.....</li>
            <li> Excited to start purchasing more stuff by them.</li>
            <li> SO COOL!</li>
            <li> They are full size!  </li>
            <li> Other than that, they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li> It also comes in a tray that holds all nail polishes which makes it look very organized; however, i have my own nail polish rack &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have these personally, but I have heard so many great things about them.</li>
            <li> Bright and Vibrant.</li>
            <li> This nail polish set is great for someone who wants to have fun with colors and experiment.</li>
            <li> Easy to paint.</li>
            <li> The product applys easily and stays on for a while.</li>
            <li> Chips and peels off easily.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item on August 10, 2014 and got it August 12,2014 very quick delivery.</li>
            <li> They go on your nails easily and stay on.  </li>
            <li> Easy to remove with a nail polish remover and doesn&#x27;t leave stains.</li>
            <li> The polish came in a box that hold all the polish in place that makes it easy to store.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The polish doesn&#x27;t spread easily onto the nails.</li>
            <li> I received my nail polish very quick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The nail polish peels and chips easily.</li>
            <li> Polish went on easily and has lasted over a week.</li>
            <li> The smell was so strong it made my eyes sting and burn.</li>
            <li> Smells really strong</li>
            <li> I will not order again because of the strong stench.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t smell as strong as the nail polishes I have</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful and are great for those who love to experiment with with different designs in all different colors.</li>
            <li> She liked the variety of neons and hot colors.</li>
            <li> What a great value for the amount of vibrant and fun colors that you get.</li>
            <li> It goes on nice and smooth, and dries very fast.</li>
            <li> but when you figure it out it&#x27;s only $1.25 per bottle, which is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> When I use it to paint my toes, if you don&#x27;t look at them too closely they look fine.</li>
            <li> If you want some fun colors and a bunch of variety to add to your collection without costing a fortune, though, it&#x27;s a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> You will be fine.</li>
            <li> I use these with the Butter London Patent Gel set and it works fine for me.</li>
            <li> Impressive color collection, but paint chips in three days or less.</li>
            <li> super cute colors.</li>
            <li> The colors are just as bright and vivid as shown.</li>
            <li> I like this set when it comes to colours - they are really vivid and bright.</li>
            <li> Loved everyone that I tried so far!</li>
            <li> The products doesn&#x27;t seem old as some may have experienced, or maybe i just got lucky.  </li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s awesome to match up when doing cool designs on other fingers and toes.</li>
            <li> I was sooo excited when I unwrapped the present and saw all the beautiful colors.</li>
            <li> The nail polish was a great consistency and dried fairly quickly(not really quick).</li>
            <li> Finish: Not gloopy and fine smooth finish.</li>
            <li> These nail polishes are cheap and have extraordinary colour!</li>
            <li> The color were great from bold to more traditional.</li>
            <li> So, make SURE you want it first!  </li>
            <li> So Many pretty colors!</li>
            <li> the colors are beautiful, highly pigmented and stamp very well.</li>
            <li> I can tell you this much: you don&#x27;t need both, but it&#x27;s nice to have them.  </li>
            <li> Nothing really light.  </li>
            <li> Clean up easily with nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> The polish applies smoothly and covers well with one coat, although I chose to put on two coats.  </li>
            <li> Yes I love them because I am a teenager who loves anything sparkly or colorful.</li>
            <li> The ones I did like were fantastic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, great buy-will definitely buy again if needed!  </li>
            <li> This nail polish is perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I read the comments before buying because I couldn&#x27;t believe how cheap they are</li>
            <li> I love all these fun colors.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy the set from this seller, I got mine off of ebay because the shipping was free</li>
            <li> remover(I didn&#x27;t even know there was such a thing lol).  </li>
            <li> Some of the colors not all seem to clump or streak - doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> The variety of colors in this is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I bought this on Amazon&#x27;s Christmas blowout sale for $20 with free shipping.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve chosen different colors and we have been happy with the result.  </li>
            <li> We just added a top coat and it seems to have helped keep the color fresh.</li>
            <li> Both are available here on amazon</li>
            <li> The Polish is cheap like you could buy at Claire&#x27;s it has no gloss and</li>
            <li> shape and the others colors are fantastic .</li>
            <li> I kept the light colors and my kid got the darks we shared  </li>
            <li> All the different colors its great.</li>
            <li> I will buy this item again if its still available by the time we run out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> 24 piece nail polish set for such a great price.</li>
            <li> enjoy the prompt shipment</li>
            <li> and I also enjoy the colors that were sent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also versy cheap.</li>
            <li> Overall I was really happy with the color selection.  </li>
            <li> So I was apprehensive about these nail polishes as they were so cheap</li>
            <li> Tried one color and it was gloppy, did not brush on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> I also got a gel uv light</li>
            <li> It went on smoothly and lasted quite awhile.</li>
            <li> This will make an impressive gift for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I like the idea that I have all the colors that I want ,it&#x27;s pretty cool and nice to have ...</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a bit of hit and miss with the consistency of the product, but overall I still stand by the purchase as the price for this many colors is just too good to beat.</li>
            <li> the product arrived nicely packaged and colors are really nice however the nail polish starts to chip the next day.</li>
            <li> Hope you enjoy as much as I am!!!</li>
            <li> To reiterate: Very nice choice for nail art, but not necessarily the best choice if you&#x27;re interested in painting your entire nail (unless it had something to do with the very hot weather when I ordered).</li>
            <li> I researched through amazon for a set of nail polish that had very good feedback from other customers.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll be back for more!!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Colors look nice, however they are not thick, nail technician had to put something in it to give it a little body, however, they are not returnable, so will make the best of them.</li>
            <li> My daughter took me to a friend of hers that does nails who showed me how to use these colors properly to get very nice effects.  </li>
            <li> But overall , it is a very nice set.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This would make a great gift for a younger teen with more adventurous tastes than I!</li>
            <li> This is a really fun set of nail polishes, and I loved the idea of getting so many different colors at such a great price.</li>
            <li> I love my new nail polishes!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready for a new color by then, lol.  </li>
            <li> All of these colors are great, of course I still have my favorites over others, but knowing the new patterns and styles really helped.  </li>
            <li> Also there isn&#x27;t a very good light purple or light green.  </li>
            <li> The neon colors are fun too!</li>
            <li> I love the nail polishes they are so pretty and affordable</li>
            <li> Reading the reviews of the people who have already tried out this product sparked my curiosity, and made me interested in getting this product when I am able to.  </li>
            <li> These colors are so cute and not expensive at all.</li>
            <li> They were just as excited as I was, and  we are planning a get-together soon to look at nail ideas and try them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any of the polish yet, but am excited to see how they look on the nails.</li>
            <li> So, layering can give you even more colors that are really pretty, just FYI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this and many more SHANY products to anyone!</li>
            <li> I love having nice nails, but I really don&#x27;t like waiting much longer than 15 minutes max.</li>
            <li> It is well worth it!</li>
            <li> Love it so much!</li>
            <li> , people always ask where I go , I always smile and say Shany Polish and Shany Nail Art!</li>
            <li> I love how it dries really fast!</li>
            <li> but it is totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to give this gift to my daughter for her birthday.  </li>
            <li> , well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I love these nails polishes for the first 3 days after applying a color but after that is peels off in strips.</li>
            <li> There are many colors to choose from, not only more style and the color is more bright-coloured.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t familiar with this brand of polish, as OPI, Essie &amp; China Glaze are my go to polishes.  </li>
            <li> I was excited when I purchased this.  </li>
            <li> lots of great colors, some strange colors are included of course.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to find such a great range of colors and hoped the quality would be as good as some other reviews...</li>
            <li> Love how many colors their is and isn&#x27;t to expensive for all of them great nail polish all the amazing colors doesn&#x27;t chip to fast love it</li>
            <li> The polish was the perfect thickness and dried fast!!</li>
            <li> the cap that holds the wand just came clean off and the bottle flew across the bathroom, hit the tile and shattered everywhere.</li>
            <li> But apparently the price WAS infact too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Polishes sold in drug stores, even the most inexpensive brands were far better quality than these.</li>
            <li> my favorite is when she paints stripes of different colors on a makeup sponge &amp; sponges a nice fade on the nail.</li>
            <li> The polish came in a nice black box separated nicely in a plastic tray and plastic lid providing easy viewing of the colors and accessibility.</li>
            <li> Very strong and vibrant colors</li>
            <li> They are true to the bottle and rich.</li>
            <li> It was delivered to me pretty quickly and comes with a cute packaging.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t anything special.</li>
            <li> Have you ever wanted to do a special design on your fingers but never knew how?</li>
            <li> I would add it to your cart right now!</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that this is the exact same quality you would get from the drugstore that you would pay $5 or more for each, easily.  </li>
            <li> know I&#x27;m about to sound like a huge nerd, but I was so excited when I first opened this</li>
            <li> They arrived quickly and I was so excited to receive them,  </li>
            <li> and I was super excited about it.</li>
            <li> the bright colors need a white underneath to ever show up.</li>
            <li> Arrived way before expected shipping arrival, which is great.</li>
            <li> It looks like its professional status and I have already heard from the person I bought this for that she loves it and its amazing quality.  </li>
            <li> OK I HAVE CHANGED MY MIND, thanks to being thought how to use the colors I thought weren&#x27;t for me.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited because the colors are very pretty.</li>
            <li> Buy overall it seemed like a good purchase.</li>
            <li> It covers well with one coat and is true to color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for overall color as well as nail art.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love these.</li>
            <li> the bottles are full size and true to color.</li>
            <li> Good buy all in all when starting a collection!</li>
            <li> I would pay full price for this</li>
            <li> but these are full size bottles.</li>
            <li> They are full size bottles.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use nail polish often, but bought these as individual gifts for a women&#x27;s spa day and everyone loved them.</li>
            <li> The quality of the polish is not bad at all for the price either.</li>
            <li> The most amazing thing is that I start with my left hand and continue with the right</li>
            <li> Lots of glitter colors (is glitter very popular suddenly?), lots of colors that are alike, but kind of different.  </li>
            <li> As my subject line suggests, some colors are awesome, some not so much.</li>
            <li> the nail polish itself tends to clump and chips pretty easy.</li>
            <li> i buy other polishes that are like $5-$10 for each bottle because the quality of the polish is great.</li>
            <li> But like everyone has said it is great for other kinds of nail art.</li>
            <li> Once I got my set, It was packaged nicely and came with it&#x27;s own little case.</li>
            <li> WIth a top coat I expect more durable finish (obviously) but have not found the need to use as these hold up well for 4-5 days.  </li>
            <li> Also it dries way to quickly.</li>
            <li> Got here quickly without any problems.</li>
            <li> Would have received 5 stars, but it seems that the polish peels off of our nails quickly.</li>
            <li> It dries fairly quick.</li>
            <li> but they do chip quickly.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t sure is this would be worth it.</li>
            <li> It also shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> It solidifies really quickly</li>
            <li> if you do decide to purchase these, try to wait for a mild weather period.</li>
            <li> The packaged arrive quickly.</li>
            <li> Mine arrived quick and intact.</li>
            <li> Quickly did me and my daughters nails.</li>
            <li> Quality nail polishes and colors to match everything, dries quickly</li>
            <li> There is such a variety of color to choose from and the white works PERFECTLY for nail stamping.</li>
            <li> They came in super quick.</li>
            <li> The polish dries fairly quick, so that&#x27;s a plus in my book.</li>
            <li> so be prepared to use a glossy top coat and buff to get that high gloss shine,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone looking to buy polishes &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel that it was fantastic for full color coating (unless its for the kiddos or a 1-2day design without chipping) but for full plate stamping is gets the absolute full 5stars.</li>
            <li> Longer than my normal polish does, and it costs at lot more that these do.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re still very pretty.</li>
            <li> Very pleased and would buy future products from again.</li>
            <li> Basically, I can admit, I was being a bit cheap because I didn&#x27;t want to buy nail art polish for something I was just trying for the first time.</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty and the price was cheap, after 30 minutes of drying, you could scrape it off your nails, because it never harden.</li>
            <li> colors are pretty true to the color on the bottle with the exception of the bright yellow.</li>
            <li> Great for ombre effects on your nails since you get so many different shades of blue and reds/pink.</li>
            <li> I can do pretty much any design I want!!!</li>
            <li> The price is also very reasonable for such a good products.</li>
            <li> These colors are beautiful, last long, and are easy to clean up.</li>
            <li> My clients love my new colors.</li>
            <li> :) I may have found my new cosmetics supplier.</li>
            <li> The girls loved the colors and they did dry quicky.  </li>
            <li> This is a pretty good deal for a lot of different colors of nail polish.</li>
            <li> and she loved them , she told me 2 of them were a bit dry</li>
            <li> So many of the reviews for this product are really great, so I have to wonder if Shany is &amp;#34;paying&amp;#34; for their reviews or if there are major inconsistencies in their production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the variety of colors and it comes in a handy tray, will recommend this to other people!</li>
            <li> And I am pretty picky when it comes to nail polish, but I LOVEEEEEEEE THIS!</li>
            <li> My most favorite product I have ordered in a long time!</li>
            <li> Lightning fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li> What I received is exactly what I was hoping for though!</li>
            <li> Over my new polishes, great quality for low price.</li>
            <li> It dries pretty quickly and is true to color.</li>
            <li> Dark, rich and bright would be how I would describe them.  </li>
            <li> Very vibrant colors - goes on smooth not chunky.</li>
            <li> My nails look great for about a week and then start looking a little raggedy.  </li>
            <li> These were great little gifts at my baby shower.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially great for mommies who only have the length of nap time to paint their nails and allow for them to dry and still get errands done!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usually hard to find a really good nail polish set for such a great price</li>
            <li> This polish goes on smooth, covers well, does not bleed or streak when colors are layered &amp; dries fast.</li>
            <li> 24 different polishes for the price is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Yes - for the price its really a great deal - even if 1-2 nail polishes had been dried out.</li>
            <li> Still totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Big bottles and nice colors.</li>
            <li> Bought thus for my 11year old daughter, she and her friends love it.</li>
            <li> I love the assortment of colors from soft pinks, purples, greens, and blues.</li>
            <li> Again, from far away ok, but just don&#x27;t look at my feet close up.</li>
            <li> The colors are nice (although, what&#x27;s with the NEON yellow one?</li>
            <li> Premium quick dry colors are perfect for women that want to be polished, but don&#x27;t have all day to go to the salon or sit around and wait for their manicures to dry.</li>
            <li> It does not come with a clear top coat, which is a bummer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it for a fun night out, but not for a weeklong mani.</li>
            <li> THIS IS BY FAR my favorite brand.</li>
            <li> 24 polishes in cool colors, some glitter, for 25 is an absolute steal!</li>
            <li> They are worth your money.</li>
            <li> Fun to have for girls to paint nails for team colors or for holidays.</li>
            <li> Most of the solid colors provide smooth coverage in just one coat.</li>
            <li> It came in a nice sturdy box that can be left in for storage.</li>
            <li> i love the colors and the fast shipping i will buy more products from this company in the future.</li>
            <li> I love it, my 12 year old daughter does also.</li>
            <li> Most of the solid colors provide smooth coverage in just one coat.</li>
            <li> I love all the different colors and my kids enjoy painting their nails.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I will have a lot of fun with these.</li>
            <li> but this is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> it is fun to have lots of colors to use and they do chip after a couple of days</li>
            <li> This product arrived in Perfect condition with no bottles broken or spilled.</li>
            <li> The variety of colors is very great, and they all add up to the product images, except for the orange polish next to the red and mustard yellow, which looks more brown.</li>
            <li> cuz quality n will be broken or something but love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Have started my Christmas shopping early this year and thought this would be a great gift for my teenage niece.</li>
            <li> To ensure that my polish last longer I used a good top coat such as Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> WEEKS FUN FOR A RETIRED WOMAN WHO LIKES TO KEEP UP HER LOOKS</li>
            <li> Colors are fun.</li>
            <li> That said, I do think these would be excellent polishes for nail art (which I&#x27;m getting into lately), and good for your whole nail if you&#x27;re patient and willing to wait for dry time if you want a pretty bold color.</li>
            <li> Excellent coverage - the black and white, which is where most brands show their weak spots, are great quality.</li>
            <li> I like the colors and how it dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> properly(I don&#x27;t understand why they would have been opened in the first place) and also were drying out luckily</li>
            <li> Not even a single nail polish was out of place, and I was very pleased with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipping was super, super fast.</li>
            <li> The colors are so vibrant and you don&#x27;t really need to do two coats like you do with most nail polishes.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, my daughter loves it, She says it doesn&#x27;t chip like her other polishes, so that is a good sign.  </li>
            <li> My reason for ordering it was the good reviews I read about it from other customers...</li>
            <li> There is a good variety of colors and glitters and there are alot of pink!</li>
            <li> I have used them on my nails and they peel right off....</li>
            <li> but right now I wish I had saved my money.</li>
            <li> course, I had to try the polish right away.</li>
            <li> Theyre just right.</li>
            <li> If the person using this changes colors often this is right up thier ally</li>
            <li> Had to play right away.</li>
            <li> Arrived to me right on time.</li>
            <li> this came right on time and was everything I needed.  </li>
            <li> also tried these with the Shany nail stamps, and they were just not the right consistency.</li>
            <li> In my sock I found the whole nail polish piece that came off cleanly from one toe.</li>
            <li> I love how all the colors go on in their true color with only one coat!</li>
            <li> When I initially opened the box the smell of polish was very strong, but the scent faded a bit.</li>
            <li> SO many different colors to keep you looking good all year long!!</li>
            <li> I have been working on different nail designs lately (thanks to the wonders of Pinterest...) and was looking for a set of nail colors with a large variety that were actually of good quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I originally wrote two reviews based on how amazing they were packaged and after using the red regular color (which is fine)</li>
            <li> Thought they&#x27;d be smaller, but were a good size &amp; I like how it comes in its own little container/nail holder.</li>
            <li> Most nail polishes that I purchase chip off so quickly but the polishes from my cosmopolitan set never disappoints.</li>
            <li> Shipping was wonderful and nothing was spilled or broken which I think is because it was shipped in three different cardboard boxes then it was packed in a plastic box, shrink wrapped and it had a plastic tray with a plastic top.</li>
            <li> The polish is not top quality, but for the price, it is a great buy.</li>
            <li> One coat goes on smoothly, and dries in the normal amount of wait time.  </li>
            <li> great for all year round!</li>
            <li> The colors are great and the polish is as good as any other of the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> shipped fast, true to image, 24 colors.</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit worried that the nail polish would be a bit watery and chip easily, but it was there totally better than expected.</li>
            <li> The colors are rich and vibrant.</li>
            <li> The colors are rich and vibrant.</li>
            <li> It takes longer to dry then some nail polish, but other then that it seems like a great brand!</li>
            <li> Right when I shook it the... (I don&#x27;t even know how to explain what exactly happened)...</li>
            <li> Goes on Smooth, shines like crazy, and best of all Dries super fast.</li>
            <li> very similar, but some very different) and all of my artistic talents (or lack thereof depending on who you ask) can definitely be displayed proudly on my fingers!  </li>
            <li> These are so worth it, so I definitely recommend buying them :).</li>
            <li> I have long been looking for an assortment of nail polish that covers smoothly and is easy to work with.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this purchase - and never would have done it if I didn&#x27;t have a gift certificate, I just wouldn&#x27;t plunk down the cash for an unknown brand of this many polishes-</li>
            <li> The shipment was very fast and all my bottles are in tack.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> AS DESCRIBED AND ARRIVED VERY FAST</li>
            <li> VERY FAST shipping.</li>
            <li> I was worried that the bottles would be small because you get so many for such a good price, but they are full sized.</li>
            <li> Other than what I&#x27;ve said so far, the packaging was great; the plastic tray prevents the bottles from breaking during their trip and also stops any leakage from occurring.</li>
            <li> They are all quick dry which makes them even better if you will paint kids nails.</li>
            <li> But of course, 24 great colors for $30 is hard to pass up.  </li>
            <li> A little clean up with acetone and all are good as new.</li>
            <li> the colors are really pretty, but the polish doesnt stay on</li>
            <li> I really love this nail polish set, I like to paint my nails a solid color and then use the glitter nail polish to put on the tips of my nails.</li>
            <li> I am still amazed that such beautiful polish was available at such a low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon</li>
            <li> The price at first was off putting because you see $30 for nail polish</li>
            <li> i love the different colors and the glittery ones also.</li>
            <li> We are pretty close friends, and often hang out and do our nails together.  </li>
            <li> My teenage granddaughter would just love this, I suspect.</li>
            <li> and I am hoping to try more of their products in the future.</li>
            <li> would really recommend you get these!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with the higher grade polishes form now on.</li>
            <li> These colors are pretty, But if you do any type of water marble design, These won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> So many colors and for such an affordable price.</li>
            <li> colors are exactly what is shown in the picture except for the oranges.</li>
            <li> be aware of that.</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> colors are as crisp as they look in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nothing at all was damaged and after using this product I&#x27;ve concluded that I&#x27;ll definitely be shopping for more SHANY products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely going to try out some more shany products.</li>
            <li> It does chip if you don&#x27;t put a clear coat on top however, which is pretty normal for nail polish.  </li>
            <li> To contrast, the second color I tried (the awesome 80&#x27;s teal) has lasted six days and is only now starting to chip.</li>
            <li> these colors are so pretty....</li>
            <li> This set is a lot like Shany&#x27;s nail art set - but for your whole nail!</li>
            <li> The lighter the color the more coats you&#x27;ll end up needing to get the same color on the bottle (that&#x27;s with every polish).</li>
            <li> When I first started applying the nail polish it was streaky and didnt cover well.</li>
            <li> The only problem that I did have with it was that there were too many boxes.</li>
            <li> The first coat of this polish is pretty rich/thick</li>
            <li> but for now the seller doesn&#x27;t deserve a higher rating.</li>
            <li> Other than that I love the colors and this product!</li>
            <li> Ok, so I&#x27;m typing this having literally just screwed the cap on the last bottle and here are the facts:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus, point 2 from the first review is still true--quickest drying polish I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with this product line.</li>
            <li> n dries fast!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> My first polish lasted over a week and didn&#x27;t chip or fade.</li>
            <li> I really feel like I got my moneyâ€™s worth.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a bright green nail polish and ran across this.</li>
            <li> I have searched all of amazon for a stamping polish without the expensive price and this one was perfect for me.</li>
            <li> the colors are so pretty and opec.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more shany polishes.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t really know if they&#x27;re worth the money or not.</li>
            <li> Although each coloris darker than the picture, they are still pretty colors.</li>
            <li> , none were dried out and everyone loved it....</li>
            <li> and I love the fact that you get so much polish (all 24 bottles are full sized) at such a reasonable price considering chain drug stores charge $5 - $8 for one bottle here in NYC.</li>
            <li> Quick drying, high quality.</li>
            <li> Kind of thick and peels off easily, have already had to add polish thinner to some of the bottles.</li>
            <li> The polish is not too harsh for nails, or drying, therefore my nails are still growing strong and healthy.</li>
            <li> This is a must buy for anyone who wants an abundance of colors of good quality for less money.</li>
            <li> I will order this brand again and am waiting for the full set of new colors from the shany to be released in this size also.</li>
            <li> Flakes off far more easily than any other polish I&#x27;ve ever used, but the colors are fun for kids.</li>
            <li> only thing is they send to me 2 same color I prefere for sure to have&lt;br /&gt;one of each one colors for have more options but is fast delivery , in</li>
            <li> I was very surprised when I saw this full size</li>
            <li> It came in a little box with a neat little display case.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for this perfect product and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> The colors are very vibrant and fun and it goes on and covers very well.  </li>
            <li> Nonetheless, not disappointed so far.</li>
            <li> One of the bottles had no bristles on the brush, I had to clean an old one off and use it instead-</li>
            <li> And judging by the reviews it was a decent set and worth the money.  </li>
            <li> The polish is thick and only needs one coat and the colors are great!  </li>
            <li> How is it possible to have all of them in such a good price?</li>
            <li> It came in perfect packaging, I was worried that it would have been a little more fragile with so many containers of glass nail polish, but it arrived with each nail polish  snuggled neatly in it&#x27;s own little hole, a clear plastic box, a brown box, some of those big &amp;#34;bubble&amp;#34; fillers, and another big box.  </li>
            <li> I never buy any cheap polish like that again, delivery very fast, but some color never dry.</li>
            <li> The pigmentation of the colors are very true and all you need is the standard two coats.</li>
            <li> wish i could say simething positive, but can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> would definitely order from the company again, as the customer services was friendly, fast, and i received my package of nail polishes unbroken and relatively quickly.  </li>
            <li> They go on very smooth and dried pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Stays on really long love it</li>
            <li> Bought this for the gf as a bday present to go with the bundle monster 20 pc brush set, hit a home run, thought it would b expensive cuz the stores charge so much for polish, great product and better price, arrived in nice packaging that holds and organizes them, wish the gf would put them back in their tho, haha women, gotta luv em</li>
            <li> O.P.I makes a fantastic base coat and Seche makes a great top coat.</li>
            <li> this collection has pretty much every color I&#x27;m looking for in one kit.  </li>
            <li> Would really recommend it to my friends and family.nails are so pretty</li>
            <li> The arrival date was the first of my \\&quot;estimated delivery days\\&quot; and I was very pleased!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used a couple colors so far but the colors are fantastic and smooth.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised these are full size nail polish bottles and lots of colors.</li>
            <li> i love the all the different vibrant colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> Great colors and price the only problem I had with this product is some of the lighter colors and pretty much all the dark colors gooey</li>
            <li> The variety of colors &amp; glitters mean we can all have our own favorites!</li>
            <li> I love that this kit has a wide verity of color and it all drys fast!</li>
            <li> And they were a nice variety of all colors, not just your typical pinks and reds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure one coat would dry quickly, but the color wouldn&#x27;t be nearly as noticeable that way.</li>
            <li> The size of the application brush affords ease of use and the variety of colors are certain to please everyone.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t matter how good the packing is when the quality of the product is so bad, the smell is too strong, made me have a strong headache all day</li>
            <li> but I can live with that!!</li>
            <li> The color goes on smoothly and seems like it will last a long time with top coat.</li>
            <li> Also they dry fast which I love.</li>
            <li> Nice colors, but the product was probably too old because some of the colors were dry out when it got here</li>
            <li> however some of the colors kind of repeat, such as there are two yellow and two light pinks which look like they are almost exactly the same colors.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m going to buy the other sets.</li>
            <li> The selection of colors in this set are varied &amp; vibrant!</li>
            <li> No broken bottles, a nice try to keep all the little bottles neat.</li>
            <li> First of all, the colors are so fabulous and vibrant and secondly, the company shipped everything so fast and ensured that the package had no chance of being damaged.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the colors (even the neon yellow, as it can still be used for nail art, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it on my whole nail), but the quality of the actual polish is why I&#x27;m a little up in the air about the star rating.</li>
            <li> I really like this nail polish.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the timely delivery.</li>
            <li> Figured orange wasnt really my color anyway.</li>
            <li> I like the box so much</li>
            <li> very well packaged for shipping and giving as a gift.  </li>
            <li> My daughter absolutely loves the variety of colors</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend This set!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s real.</li>
            <li> I really like the pinks and reds</li>
            <li> This polish looks cheap, smells cheaper, and some of the bottles don&#x27;t even open.</li>
            <li> Very watery polish.</li>
            <li> I must say that i am blown away by how fast my order came,the way it was packaged, and the quality of my polish.</li>
            <li> I now don&#x27;t have to spend so much money on nail polish meant specifically for stamp art.</li>
            <li> The polish was very clumpy.  </li>
            <li> Fast drying is always desirable however this polish is too fast drying for</li>
            <li> that I didn&#x27;t really like</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the description very well, and thought these were mini bottles.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It dries fast.</li>
            <li> The polish was very clumpy...</li>
            <li> more than I expected  </li>
            <li> the quality is good,,,i really like getting a whole bunch AT ONCE....</li>
            <li> Thanks..</li>
            <li> I chose a five star rating because this set really stunned me.</li>
            <li> Regular size bottle of fabulous colors for summer.</li>
            <li> Those are some i can&#x27;t really use anymore.</li>
            <li> She and my daughter headed straight for the bedroom to put on.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this nail polish collection (SHANY Cosmetics</li>
            <li> Very upset.</li>
            <li> These go on smoothly and last for days.</li>
            <li> I would try them and see if you like them as much as i do.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Package arrived on time and packaged very well.</li>
            <li> Colors are very Spring and Summer</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant about buying this set.</li>
            <li> The package came protected and sealed very well.  </li>
            <li> I was very upset.</li>
            <li> All the polishes are high quality!</li>
            <li> I tried out those 4 colors and all are very gloppy.  </li>
            <li> and I enjoy every second of it!!</li>
            <li> Now I just need some remover haha</li>
            <li> That made me really nervous -</li>
            <li> They are not thin and see through at all.</li>
            <li> but you really get the bang for you buck.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will be purchasing more in the near future.</li>
            <li> I bought this set since I recently started back doing my own pedicures.</li>
            <li> I can actually say that this may be my favorite brand of nail polish I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> But this nail polish did NOT &amp;#34;bubble&amp;#34; and all of it dried nicely, rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The paint goes on smooth and thick so once is enough for a good coat.  </li>
            <li> In order for the neon colors to show true, I had to coat my daughter&#x27;s nails with white polish first and then use the neon color over it.</li>
            <li> Other than this, the product seems okay and the rest of the bottles are filled completely and not dried out.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;That being said, the first polish I opened the brush went flying off the end and landed on my NEW jeans</li>
            <li> I had a return issue with this product but after figuring out use chat, they are sending me a new set, first one was damaged.</li>
            <li> the bottle)&lt;br /&gt;dry fast on nails and last about 3 weeks cause my mom clean houses</li>
            <li> Colors are true to the bottle, however the polish itself seems a little cheap.</li>
            <li> The quality is great too and seem to last as long as those big name polishes.</li>
            <li> Compared to paying $5 a bottle for most other polishes.</li>
            <li> I love the nail stamps, but I have to use them with other polish.</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant and it dries fast too.  </li>
            <li> As long as you allow it to set you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> For the price I really didn&#x27;t expect the quality or the vibrant colors.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun for a first time set for younger people</li>
            <li> They dry very quickly</li>
            <li> These nail polishes go on very well and the colors are vibrant.</li>
            <li> nail polish does NOT dry quickly.</li>
            <li> I learned after trying this out for a few months that I rather spend a little bit more on other more popular nail polish to avoid this problem cause&#x27;</li>
            <li> Its so much fun, I really like being able to change the colors and having such a wide variety of colors to use.</li>
            <li> I regularly use polish, from top brands like china glaze and opi to cheap brands like wet n wild.</li>
            <li> until I used it!&lt;br /&gt;All of the bottles in the set were fresh, new, and definitely NOT dried out/</li>
            <li> The lighter orange, in real life is more of a tannish color that I don&#x27;t particularly care for &amp; the darker orange is VERY close to the same color as the red.</li>
            <li> I have to wear a cleaning mask when I use them, may just be only me since I am sensitive to strong chemical smells.</li>
            <li> They are normal size bottles, easy to open and such fun colors.  </li>
            <li> The polishes were bigger than what I expected and The colors look even better in person!</li>
            <li> It was packaged pretty but seems to be old polish cause</li>
            <li> its not bad enough to where i dont use it.</li>
            <li> More that I expected!!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get 24 flashy nail colors for such a good price.</li>
            <li> The neon yellow looking color is exactly like a highlighter yellow, after 2 coats it looks sweet!</li>
            <li> great nail polishes took 3 days and they last a long time and nail polishes don&#x27;t dry out.(in</li>
            <li> It went on my nails smoothly without any clumps and lasted a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Vibrant colors that are resistant to wear and tear.</li>
            <li> These are decent colors, and decent quality.  </li>
            <li> These were full-sized bottles of vibrant colors.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more shany products in the future.</li>
            <li> I paint my nails twice a week (because I love doing different colors and such.)</li>
            <li> * (after further use, and from 5 to 4 stars)&lt;br /&gt;So after using the product for a while, I find it interesting that each color seems to act differently.</li>
            <li> It dries fast, but is vivid in color.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some issues with the bristles on the brushes coming loose, but the polish goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> The polish was still clumpy and even with 2 coats, it didn&#x27;t look good and had a very dull finish.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it for someone looking for a gift set.  </li>

            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Have been wearing the true red color on my nails forr nearly a week now with no chipping at all!</li>
            <li> some of the colors chip off pretty easy and others are long lasting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She says they dry super fast</li>
            <li> But as a plus, the polish comes off easily with nail polish remover unlike some other brands.</li>
            <li> it isnt the greatest quality because when i put the polish on, it&#x27;s so HARD to get off with ordinary nail polish remover...</li>
            <li> I guess a slightly older woman can learn new things.</li>
            <li> The polish goes on smooth, chipping is minimal, about what you&#x27;d expect.  </li>
            <li> I recieved the nailpolish in a sealed package but when I opened it and tried to use the light purple, it was empty.</li>
            <li> It has mostly fun pedicure colors as well as some basic manicure colors.  </li>
            <li> My only issue is they do chip pretty fast</li>
            <li> Colors are pretty, but most of the polishes are thick, stringy, and unusable.</li>
            <li> Normal sized bottles.</li>
            <li> I like many of the colors, although there are a few I don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I discovered that MOST of them are dried.</li>
            <li> I ordered this set of 24 nail polishes specifically because they had the normal nail polish brush with them.  </li>
            <li> nice thick polish....</li>
            <li> It goes on nice, even and thick.</li>
            <li> So in general the colors are gorgeous but most are impossible to use.</li>
            <li> some of the polish goes on really great and others are a little clumpy and look like a mess on the nail.</li>
            <li> Some of them go on smooth and others are super thick.</li>
            <li> The quality of these shany nail polish aren&#x27;t the best and not the worst they smell extremely strong</li>
            <li> It has a very strong smell after is dry, takes forever to dry</li>
            <li> I seriously think this is my new favorite nail polish!</li>
            <li> Great selection of colors but the nail polish is a very thin liquid</li>
            <li> Some polishes (the bright blue) dry very fast and others (yellow) take hours to dry so</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t go on as smooth as other brands.  </li>
            <li> There are a lot of colors and they all seem like they&#x27;re new...</li>
            <li> (It seems like every evening she&#x27;s wiping off her nail polish to try a new color.)</li>
            <li> I have been looking in drugstores and makeup stores for a new nail polish when I came across these on amazon.</li>
            <li> Even being very careful, I could never achieve a smooth layer.</li>
            <li> I have nail drops by OPI to quick dry them and also a nail drier</li>
            <li> The colors are vivid and dry fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> The Cosmopolitan Nail Polish Set 24 Colors) since it comes with all sorts of colors and is very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> The actual dollar store nail polishes are very watery, these are pretty thick which makes one coat of color a sufficient amount most of the time.</li>
            <li> My little cousin&#x27;s absolutely have all the fun when they come over because they always want to paint their nails!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried 2 colors so far (red and gold sparkle) and they glide on the nail just fine.</li>
            <li> Although the price is right and the colors are beautiful, the polish itself is like old nail polish, hard to use and thick as glue.  </li>
            <li> The girls had fun and by having such a large assortment they all could be different.</li>
            <li> It takes awhile to dry and the matte colors are really flat, but that&#x27;s easily fixed with a top coat.</li>
            <li> The nail polish is old any clumpy!  </li>
            <li> It held up well and the colors are so vivid.</li>
            <li> it may not be as shiny as other brands, but using  a top coat definitely helps.  </li>
            <li> Such pretty colors, i just wish they had lived up to my expectations.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this seller ships it exactly the same</li>
            <li> This nail polish is long lasting, dries quickly, and has very vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> Same exact colors</li>
            <li> I participated in a secret santa and my person seemed very pleased with this gift</li>
            <li> I have yet to be disappointed by Shany Cosmetics, this set came packaged perfectly with no issues.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> She is a regular customer of Shany cosmetics and bought many other items from them.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use them and will come back and add to my review after my first application.&lt;br</li>
            <li> also, without topcoat nail polish chips off... not the best polish for nail art and stamping :(</li>
            <li> The matte finish polishes that were not dried up worked well, but they do chip easily and don&#x27;t last long before the chips</li>
            <li> A base coat protects your natural nail but importantly with these polishes it allows the coat to go on more smoothly.</li>
            <li> the polish is cheap and needs at least 2 coats and chips with in first day.</li>
            <li> I knocked some over on my boyfriend&#x27;s laptop stand and quickly cleaned it up with a wet cloth then with a dab of polish remover.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 5 colors so far and am anxious to try more.  </li>
            <li> Dark green color is applied smoothly but color itself looks cheap.</li>
            <li> Also the colors are very cute, the only ones that I probably wouldn&#x27;t use are the dark grey and the sort of brown color</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;ve tried quite a few colors today their true to the color in the bottle not watery at all &amp; their nice &amp; thick.</li>
            <li> this very vibrant yellow color.  </li>
            <li> Very very pretty and vibrant colors, just a little stringy and</li>
            <li> HUGE WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far, I sampled a few colors which went on smoothly without any lumps.  </li>
            <li> The description given for them did not make it clear what colors I was getting.  </li>
            <li> i recommend putting a clear coat on it because some of them turn out matte.</li>
            <li> When it arrived I was pleasently surprised with its durability.</li>
            <li> Two coats of paint covers it with all the colors I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> to your local drugstore and buy the cheap Wet and Wild if you want a variety of colors for bargain prices.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 10 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> I bought this nail polish gift set as a birthday gift for my 15 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> Makes me feel like this time, the set was old and they sent it to me.</li>
            <li> One negative is the color does not stay on for more than a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought nail polishes for a fourth of the cost of this product for one 2oz bottle and it ended up being really crappy polish, but Shany Cosmetics has me blown out of the water.</li>
            <li> This nail polish looks professional when applied.  </li>
            <li> so far all the ones i have tried</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much because each polishes are $1 only.</li>
            <li> They seemed old upon arrival.</li>
            <li> So for the cost I like it so far.</li>
            <li> After one day of wear it looked like I had month old polish on.  </li>
            <li> Meaning the polish was old.  </li>
            <li> out\\&quot; or \\&quot;wild and crazy\\</li>
            <li> Classy packaging and a quality product.</li>
            <li> I purchased the polish in order to use it in a professional setting.</li>
            <li> but she fixed them with her nail polish thinner</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m glad I bought these but be prepared to need to replace a few shades</li>
            <li> The array of colors is wide and fun to mix and match.</li>
            <li> I am dissapointed because the nail polish dont last more than few days.</li>
            <li> Not terrible , not amazing.</li>
            <li> The darker matte colors go on more thickly than the frosts</li>
            <li> I love the colors and the quality but its really thick.</li>
            <li> There are soooo many colors, and they are thick and not messy.</li>
            <li> This packet of nail polish have lots of colors and it dry very fast.</li>
            <li> The first thing I did was open one up to see how thick it would be, if it had a strong odor, and what the brushes looked like.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure my daughter has used them everyday since receiving them!!</li>
            <li> I.e. the LIGHT blue shade and some other shades.</li>
            <li> They came packed tightly in a pretty (and protective) box, and not one is spilled or dry.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat 24 full size nail polishes for less than $30.</li>
            <li> The hottest colors that dry quickly and cover well with only one coat.</li>
            <li> and I even though I love the colors and the prices of the Shany, the quality is seriously lacking in comparison with Sally Hansen and the like.</li>
            <li> They dry quickly, which is a huge plus for me as I have trouble sitting still for long periods.  </li>
            <li> I painted my toes using the white and it took two coats which is pretty standard.</li>
            <li> The colors are as vibrant in person as they look on the site; however, I haven&#x27;t used any of them and won&#x27;t do so until 45 days for my teen birthday party.  </li>
            <li> The dark colors only required one coat, the light colors required two.</li>
            <li> and when I am finishing the right hand the left is already dry, as a new mom I don&#x27;t have to much of me time to wait it to be dry .</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this set for anyone building or adding to their current collection.</li>
            <li> This was major chipping!</li>
            <li> major issue that I have with this, is that the product never dries!</li>
            <li> This seemed like a great deal but this is really poorly made nail polish, it chips after less than a day the colors are not glossy at all</li>
            <li> A lot of colors good for the price but the color goes off on less than five days and it feels thick also</li>
            <li> The only ones that I have to do three coats on are the lighter colors: Yellow, light pink etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;9 out of the 24 are hot pink color #04.  </li>
            <li> Very quick to resolve my issues so please disregard any negative complaints I had.</li>
            <li> They also dry incredibly fast.</li>
            <li> The Cosmopolitan Nail Polish Set (24 Colors Premium Quality and Quick Dry), 40 Fluid Ounce]]</li>
            <li> For the money, I&#x27;d much rather buy wet n wild polish or sinful colors.</li>
            <li> I was looking for some cheap and variety of nail polish colors that I could use to test out designs and wear for only a few days.</li>
            <li> These colors are opague on the first coat, and last a long time.</li>
            <li> The polish dries fast as others said, and it is a tad matte if you only use one coat, but I found adding a second coat helps.  </li>
            <li> The Cosmopolitan Nail Polish Set (24 Colors Premium Quality and Quick Dry), 40 Fluid Ounce]]</li>
            <li> its all thick, and its SO EASY to peel off after it dries</li>
            <li> I thought maybe the issue was that I was not using a base or top coat, so I purchased premium quality base/ top coats &amp; tried applying the nail polish that way-</li>
            <li> They are thick, gloppy, show brush lines, wear off and chip easily</li>
            <li> I bought this as a christmas present for my 13 yr old - she loves it!  </li>
            <li> After 12 hours, my daughters nails are nearly completely bare of polish!  </li>
            <li> All in all, this was an okay purchase especially for the small price you have to pay!</li>
            <li> I got this set because it was inexpensive, and my daughter goes through nail polish like no other.</li>
            <li> so I got exactly what I expected packaging and color-wise, but my expectations were exceeded in value!</li>
            <li> /&gt;In general</li>
            <li> I received this set last week and have given myself and my daughter two manicures so far.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed when I received it &amp; started trying the different colors out, that the product was professional grade.</li>
            <li> barely got my set in</li>
            <li> not closed</li>
            <li> I wanted to return it, but apparently I can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Normal sized bottles if not on the bit larger size with 24 different colors.</li>
            <li> So I was pleased I didn&#x27;t receive any broken bottles.</li>
            <li> Either way it&#x27;s cool if u just want a variety of color and only plan on having the color on for a few days.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say this but buy this product at your own risk.  </li>
            <li> However, upon opening the package, we noticed that there was a bottle that was only 1/3 full and dried out.</li>
            <li> Less expensive than purchasing from a retail store and has a great case that it comes with.</li>
            <li> All in all, decent product for the price, but definitely not high quality polishes.</li>
            <li> The black polish in this kit works a million times better then the Konad stamp art black polish!</li>
            <li> The first time i used this polish it chipped after a day and a half</li>
            <li> Unlike other nail polishes this one actually stays on and will not chip off the first week.</li>
            <li> If other people don&#x27;t have streaking issues, mine could simply be because of the hot weather, so</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used all of the colors yet, but some of the polishes I did apply to my entire nail went on a little streaky (thinner in some parts, thicker in others), and absolutely require more than one coat - which cuts down on the dry time, which is a big bummer for me.</li>
            <li> Some of the polishes have a little iridescence, there are a few sparkly ones, bright colors, dark colors...</li>
            <li> I will at least try some of the more unusual shades here, but I really can&#x27;t see myself ever wearing the yellowy-yellow or neon green or black (on any day that isn&#x27;t Halloween).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only negative is the strong smell, which is apparent before you even open the box.</li>
            <li> My only complaint, which isn&#x27;t really the suppliers fault, is that since I ordered this in May(?), June(?) and live in the Arizona desert, one of the bottle caps was melting!!</li>
            <li> They dried quickly and lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> The nail polish had some great colors but a few of the colors were half empty and dried up.</li>
            <li> They are even viscosity, dry very consistently, (one bottle dries same speed as another or one color dries same as other).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great quality and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I eagerly awaited the arrival of these with great expectations-Was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, the polish arrived today (Sept 5) and the first thing I did was check every polish to see if any were dried</li>
            <li> The green glitter (15) and burnt sienna (23) were gooped around the rim and a good bit seemed to be missing from the glitter green.</li>
            <li> but many of them were dried out due to the caps being loose or just being old!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was having to paint my nails every other day, I finally just threw the whole set away &amp; bought a different brand.</li>
            <li> Many other are too thick and goopy to apply properly.</li>
            <li> But even then,doing a coat of silver on the black looked very nice(I thought).</li>
            <li> I used hot pink on my toes and Barbie pink on my nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for about two weeks now, and though it seems to chip a little faster than more expensive polishes, they seem to hold up pretty well.</li>
            <li> Some chipped a little after a few days but you can fix that easily.  </li>
            <li> thing about this polish that is an absolute necessity is using a high quality base coat and top coat.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve tried layering neon green with the hot pink</li>
            <li> These took far longer than that simply because I put two coats on, pretty thick, in order to avoid streaking.</li>
            <li> Packaging was solid and all polishes seemed fine until i took off the plastic wrapping and realized that my #6 color \\&quot;fuscia pink\\&quot; was left partially open somehow and is extremely goopy, might be able to fix with a little polish remover to thin it out but still kind of disappointing because it was my favorite color in the whole set :(</li>
            <li> Nice rich colors, glides on easily, not clumpy or thick and gluey.  </li>
            <li> Dried fine for me does take a little longer than others maybe 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about purchasing this products due to some of the reviews that it has received in the pass, but I ended up purchasing the product anyway because figured it&#x27; was a great deal.</li>
            <li> My daughter said the brushes were fine - not too thin.  </li>
            <li> Brushes were good, no pieces of the brush coming loose or anything crazy like that.</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant and not watered down at all.</li>
            <li> This polish is very thick and cheap.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is the quality of the lacquer itself or the \\&quot;quick dry time\\&quot; but the polish doesn&#x27;t spread out AT ALL in the water, just staying as drops in the middle or eventually sinking to the bottom.</li>
            <li> The purple is a little too blue and the only light green is metallic.</li>
            <li> some polishes thick, some good, some very very thin and dry too fast to get nail covered properly.</li>
            <li> I had some good and some bad issues with this order.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not all bad, but they&#x27;re not all good.</li>
            <li> But ultimately the good outweighed the bad</li>
            <li> I do not recomend this polishes as full on nail colors because they can run on a bit thick and will take ages to dry.</li>
            <li> But of the 6 Colors I&#x27;ve  used 3 were way too thick and all pealed off right away.</li>
            <li> A few of the polishes, such as both of the yellow ones are a little think and require 2-4 coats to get a full opacity.</li>
            <li> I am a first time nail decorator, so I&#x27;m not very good at it yet.</li>
            <li> You cant expect much being its not an expensive high quality brand compared to OPI for example, but my three year old loves it.</li>
            <li> Some of the colors go on nicer and thicker than others where are some go on very thin, either way you need two coats as you do for most nail polishes.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stand up to other professional polish brands.</li>
            <li> Got it early then expected!</li>
            <li> I would never purchase this item again, and I can&#x27;t even get my money back, at least I can re-gift it to someone that I don&#x27;t like very much.</li>
            <li> If you are serious about nail art, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product unless you have kids and want to have fun.</li>
            <li> I waited I did read into the reviews a bit more than before I ordered and saw that a lot of people complained about dried out polishes!</li>
            <li> the polish doesnt last long, sometimes chipping off in the same day and even peels off with topcoat.</li>
            <li> , polish does not last long it starts to fall the next day</li>
            <li> The picture I included was after the initial clean up and you can still see the polish on my tile and my cupboards are in pretty bad shape.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is that it takes a while to dry so don&#x27;t get your hands into anything for about five to ten minutes.</li>
            <li> I was worried about ordering this at first because I did read some of the negative reviews but as soon as I got it and put it on my worries just went away.</li>
            <li> it doesnt look flat at all...</li>
            <li> well and last long.  </li>
            <li> A few colors look very similar but are marked differently on the bottom of the bottles and if you look close they are</li>
            <li> last long time.</li>
            <li> this will last me for a long time .....</li>
            <li> the blue glitter color was a bit thick but with a little of solution it will fix it right up!</li>
            <li> waste of my money.. sad because when you look at the product it looks amazing</li>
            <li> and you can see lines and cracks as if I didn&#x27;t wait enough time to let it dry even though I do.</li>
            <li> It takes forever to dry and chipped before the next morning.</li>
            <li> One coat isn&#x27;t quite enough for your nail but two coats takes hours to dry.</li>
            <li> I am a middle aged woman and mother of a mid 20s daughter.</li>
            <li> I have recently started to organize my nail polishes and realized I didn&#x27;t have a few vital colors.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with this product is that it takes the polish a long time to dry.</li>
            <li> They take very long to dry (sometimes 10+ minutes for a coat), chip after a day (even with a base/top coat), and a few of the bottles dried up really quickly.</li>
            <li> One color came bad, but I loved the other ones.</li>
            <li> one other thing I&#x27;m not a huge fan of with these nail polishes is the fast drying aspect.</li>
            <li> Polish appears to be a little old.</li>
            <li> I also tried layering the dark yellow with the darkest pink/purple and got a color similar to Cajun Shrimp by OPI.</li>
            <li> A lot of these polishes are old and dried out.</li>
            <li> As far as nail polish, even premium brands that are not supposed to chip, end up doing so because I work with my hands everyday in art projects.  </li>
            <li> This set came earlier than expected</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for polish you can apply and leave on for long periods of time without applying a topcoat, this probably isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> It just turns out that there&#x27;s a reason I always buy red or pink...</li>
            <li> I tried to fix French lines with a wet brush using polish remover.</li>
            <li> I will say that it takes a long time to try and it stays tacky for a long while.</li>
            <li> The nail polishes are a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> As far as how long they last, I&#x27;m not sure yet because I just put the polishes on this morning.</li>
            <li> so amazon gave me a small discount that more than paid for the broken bottle.</li>
            <li> I decided to open them all today and many were inconsistent in texture - some too thin, some too thick.  </li>
            <li> A few months back I ordered a similar set of polishes from another seller and was not impressed, the polishes in this set are true to color!</li>
            <li> For cosmetics, I typically buy high-end brands, but I&#x27;m always open to try different products.</li>
            <li> And regular colors, black, orange, and white were also delightful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ,it just take to long to dry</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re pretty much paying just a little over $1 for each; can&#x27;t go wrong with that here.</li>
            <li> The reason i took away one star is because when i first got these i opened each bottle to just check them out, and some of them had chunks of nail polish dried up on the side, making the bottle a bit hard to open.</li>
            <li> I definitely want to try and find the other sets from SHANY.</li>
            <li> I love them, but sadly my daughter will have to wait till after the holidays, because they are now out of stock, and I&#x27;m not giving these up!</li>
            <li> I put the brush back on and haven&#x27;t had an issue with any of the other ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although the darker color like the dark green and dark purple aren&#x27;t super dark like it looks but</li>
            <li> Other nail polishes are easily $7-$10 per bottle but this set is a mere fraction of that price</li>
            <li> I was waiting for this nail polish set for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Some of my were so dry</li>
            <li> One polish came really really dry.</li>
            <li> My biggest issue is that they take forever to dry.</li>
            <li> I advise you not to buy this nail polish, and to spend the money on quality nail polish that is thinner and easier to use and quicker to dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a girl who just can&#x27;t sit still to wait for her nails to dry.</li>
            <li> The nail polish I received this time was gloopy, slightly dry, and not useable.</li>
            <li> When trying to apply the nail polish sometimes it will dry somewhat while your applying it making it lumpy and</li>
            <li> I did notice that the colors takes a while to air dry</li>
            <li> you are a nut for rapid dry, one coat quality, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> The polish seems to dry like a film.</li>
            <li> for the polish to be completely dry.</li>
            <li> Also, the colors dry to a matte finish, so unless you like matte, or intend to use a gloosy topcoat, these are not the polishes for you.</li>
            <li> When I painted her toenails tonight, the polish wasn&#x27;t dry after 20 min.</li>
            <li> take for ever to dry</li>
            <li> they dry quick!&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li> Much of what I found in sets was smaller bottles and often with poor reviews from customers who had used the products.  </li>
            <li> the only problem is that the polish tends of chip off after only a few days.</li>
            <li> Several of the bottles were not tightened properly, so the polish had partially dried and was unusable.</li>
            <li> They delivered very fast, but one of them is broken and almost emply.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have a choice but to paint your pain your nails every single day with this polish.</li>
            <li> Like hardly a difference at all, I actually thought they were the same color until I tested them out on a white sheet of paper.</li>
            <li> I applied the dark blue as soon as I received the set</li>
            <li> And the polishes didnt need extra coats except for the really dark colors, which is normal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have natural nails and usually do them myself.  </li>
            <li> normally not a Shany nail polish user,</li>
            <li> pretty colors.. poor quality.</li>
            <li> but some of the colors came thick or got thicker faster than normal.  </li>
            <li> I was very surprised to find that the white polish is thick and opaque!</li>
            <li> Your white and black.</li>
            <li> my favorites are baby blue, blue purple, and metallic green!</li>
            <li> They are beautiful but the polish applies on too thick for a base coat.</li>
            <li> But, the nail polish is too thick and does not dry properly.</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointing after liking that the plain colors and the sparklies had so much promise.  </li>
            <li> all of the layers of wet nail polish I apply on my nails, the polish always seems to bubble up on me and take hours and hours to really dry!  </li>
            <li> the only little problem is the pinks are a bit too watery</li>
            <li> Each polish is regular polished sized and comes off with little or no streaks.</li>
            <li> I bought this last year so a little delayed on writing the review.</li>
            <li> Other then the dry time I would advise you to buy.</li>
            <li> I also use them on my four year old because you know haow they can get a little  impatient sometimes.</li>
            <li> Neon Yellow and White were a little dried, but not to a point where you can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> have totally changed my review after using this product for 6 months and at least 8 different colors.  </li>
            <li> THe irony is only a few colors always get used.  </li>
            <li> There is no way to return this even though one of the polish didn&#x27;t closed well, so it spilled</li>
            <li> The quality of these polishes was WAY beyond what I expected for the price.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Never heard of this brand before, and getting it by mail was not really impressing me...</li>
            <li> Just as we expected.</li>
            <li> Solid everyday colors.</li>
            <li> All the colors expected came.</li>
            <li> I like the wide variety of colors</li>
            <li> Still the brush is not straight.</li>
            <li> Package came in as expected and the presentation was well preserved to prevent cracking/damage.</li>
            <li> so i got what i expected.</li>
            <li> red few of the reviews</li>
            <li> This polish is worth the cost but the consistency of that polish is weird.  </li>
            <li> Such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The Neon Yellow has a few clumps in it though.</li>
            <li> Some of the polish seemed to be old and thick.</li>
            <li> You can see the brush lines and it doesn&#x27;t flow well, and in a few they were so old they were dried and cracked.</li>
            <li> Some of them are thick, but can be fixed with polish thinner [not polish remover; it will permanently ruin them].</li>
            <li> The nail polishes and the plastic tray are wrapped in plastic and it does come the long black box (its cardboard).&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> One of the red polishes was damaged and dried up when i opened the package but other than that</li>
            <li> blue, green, dark purple.</li>
            <li> I could only salvage a few colors, not worth it.</li>
            <li> Overall, you get a little bit of everything!</li>
            <li> They get a little gunky as they dry so be careful not to tap your finger on anything</li>
            <li> There is very little chipping and it last for over a week.</li>
            <li> A few of the colors were hard to open up because, it looked like there were open and</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know that I would buy this brand again, which is too bad because I really like the colors, but only lasting</li>
            <li> Another bad was that the very first bottle I picked up to use had apparently not been closed well, and I almost couldn&#x27;t get the lid off because of polish that had leaked out and sealed the lid on.  </li>
            <li> I bought this set and the other one they have</li>
            <li> but I tried some of the other colors and I am about 50/50 on my opinion.</li>
            <li> We did not notice any odour at all as some other reviews have mentioned.</li>
            <li> but at Target and other department stores you can get one bottle of nail polish for eight dollars.</li>
            <li> Other than some of the colors I would recommend these polishes.</li>
            <li> My Daughter also found me a couple how to magazines for other ideas.  </li>
            <li> got basically the same if not better quality polish than the other over priced brands.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I was skeptical at first considering the price and what that adds up to per bottle.</li>
            <li> Some are shimmery and other have a matte finish.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been alternating between these polishes and some of my other brands</li>
            <li> so brush and the bottle got separated and ruined all other bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just got this the other day and</li>
            <li> Not sure I would wear some of these colors alone, but next time hope to do a stained glass design.  </li>
            <li> Also since the set comes with 24 different colors, some of which might not be your preferred style, you can always give a few to friends and family!  </li>
            <li> but that was due to me using a non acetone polish</li>
            <li> So to other reviewers that had an issue removing the polish, you probably will need to get an acetone based remover.</li>
            <li> OPI usually lasts me 7-10 days and this didn&#x27;t last 1!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think she&#x27;d like some of the colors, but for the price I figured this was too good to pass up, and any colors she wasn&#x27;t fond of wouldn&#x27;t go to such a terrible waste since we&#x27;d figure out a use for it eventually.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I are disappointed that we won&#x27;t be able to&lt;br /&gt;try</li>
            <li> None of the other bottles had this issue nor did they have a sticker.</li>
            <li> Sometimes that&#x27;s not the case with other nail polishes.  </li>
            <li> I been using them for the past two weeks and all the colors are so pigmented and only needs one coat.</li>
            <li> This biggest disappointment was that one of the bottles was completely dried out/not useable, but the others seem to be fine.  </li>
            <li> Several of the colors were watery and when applied very uneven.</li>
            <li> Packaged very carefully.</li>
            <li> They smells bad but it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a new customer to SHANY products and wanted to give this company a try after I&#x27;ve had countless bad experiences with a couple of other different companies.</li>
            <li> so I had to apply at least 2 coats but some colors you need 3 or 4 coats which takes a long time to dry.</li>
            <li> One thing to know is the sparkly gold and silver aren&#x27;t very thick in the amount of sparkles to the clear coat.</li>
            <li> The other half was all stuck together inside the bottle.</li>
            <li> The colors you get make it so hard to decide which color to do next.  </li>
            <li> The bad is that I ended up getting 2 sets of the exact same colors.  </li>
            <li> A lot of dark colors.  </li>
            <li> Unless you are really fast at covering your nails, it&#x27;s fairly difficult.</li>
            <li> Not really worth the hassle of returning for two bottles.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just not worth it.</li>
            <li> I did not want to wait that long for dried out polish!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend ordered these for me because I&#x27;m such a nail polish fanatic.</li>
            <li> I received the polish without any broken bottles, but all of the polishes are old and useless.&lt;br /&gt;After three hours it still doesn&#x27;t set.  </li>
            <li> only need one coat, but since I like that thick look, I always use 2 coats of color...along with a top and base</li>
            <li> And this is not based on the fact that I was trying to stamp with them, as most were for base colors</li>
            <li> I always apply a base coat, 2 color coats, and a top coat.  </li>
            <li> i purchased the shany 48 piece nail art set and had a time with \\&quot;base colors\\&quot; that i could paint art on top of them.  </li>
            <li> One bottle will be runny and take 4 coats to show up and the next bottle is thick and sticky.  </li>
            <li> Base and top coat used: OPI&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although it takes a few minutes to dry, and if you don&#x27;t dip it every couple of seconds it starts to get a little clumpy.</li>
            <li> Then, for the bottles that were still OK, the glitter ones (I&#x27;ve tried a couple) were so thick as to be almost impossible to use.</li>
            <li> Would definitely use everyday!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone because you don&#x27;t have to spend copious amounts of money, and it is just like any other brand you could find that cost up to 4$ a bottle!</li>
            <li> So when you look down at it, you don&#x27;t see the colors, just the black tops.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love these, even though a few where dried up &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> The only bad I have found is that it is a real pain to get off your nails.</li>
            <li> Had to throw out half of them.</li>
            <li> 24 bottles of nail polish for less than 1$ per--can&#x27;t beat that deal.  </li>
            <li> However, now that I have found these products, I am seriously contemplating doing regular self-manicures.</li>
            <li> each bottle is double the volume of polish of regular bottles you buy at the store... cant go wrong with 24 colors of nail polish</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that was less expensive with vibrant hues and found this set online.  </li>
            <li> Another time I tried one coat and it was chipping in less than 24 hours.</li>
            <li> typically every 2-4 days.</li>
            <li> Tried black color.</li>
            <li> After using this for less than 6 months, the nail polishes chip away within hours after use.  </li>
            <li> it just depends, and this means the appearance of each color is unpredictable.</li>
            <li> At less then $2 a bottle, I was not expecting anything fancy, but I will end up getting another because of the value.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didnt receive any duplicates, and because of SHANY packaging, no breaks or leakage (all three of which had been issues on previous nail polish purchses).  </li>
            <li> Do not buy this product even at less than $1.50 a bottle</li>
            <li> I did not have any problems as far as receiving broken bottles or product that was dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> but this stuff smells absolutely horrible, all in all spend a few extra bucks for a better quality polish</li>
            <li> 2 of the tops were not screwed on tightly.  </li>
            <li> It takes forever to dry and is hard to apply because of its thickness.  </li>
            <li> Half of them came dried up.</li>
            <li> When I removed the protective&lt;br /&gt;plastic wrap and went to lift that bottle out, it was slightly opened, which is probably why it dried up.  </li>
            <li> These nail polishes were purchased for my little one who loves to paint her nails.  </li>
            <li> So it took a little bit of time to get the bottles out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The colors are a little matte</li>
            <li> The polish became sticky like a chewing gum with little bit of polish remover.</li>
            <li> However, adding a little nail polish remover thinned it out well.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item to paint my little girl&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li> It has a little bit of everything: metallic shimmers, 5 glitters, some pastels, some creams, even a couple neons.</li>
            <li> Although, I feel like the yellows are a little too close in color.</li>
            <li> a little worried cause</li>
            <li> some with a little sparkle some a lot of sparkle some no sparkle.  </li>
            <li> I added a little acetone to the bottle, it helped marginally.</li>
            <li> God forbids you put layers and layers of these on your nails, because the wait time for them to dry is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> not thick enough for nail stamping :(</li>
            <li> I have even used a few myself.  </li>
            <li> So there was a bit of a spill nothing too messy.  </li>
            <li> every few weeks buy this product.</li>
            <li> I wasted a lot of money on all this nail polish.  </li>
            <li> When it arrived a few of the polishes were dried up.</li>
            <li> A few of my colors had faulty caps and dried out.</li>
            <li> You can also layer these polishes, because they&#x27;re thin and create different colors.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 8 year old that is obsessed with nail polish.</li>
            <li> and it was chipping off as soon as it dried.</li>
            <li> I just need to try out their makeup palette&#x27;s now that I know their product is affordable but not cheap or crappy.</li>
            <li> Without a base coat the polish just looks so lump and does not go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> and she has been using them almost everyday.</li>
            <li> It lasted about a month until it got gooey and dried out</li>
            <li> The brush was too messy</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because after a few months it went &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; it became sorta sticky and cant use it anymore.</li>
            <li> One bottle was completely dried up and</li>
            <li> However, there are a few complaints I have about the polish.</li>
            <li> so I had trouble creating even coats.</li>
            <li> Missing color numbers are 05, 11, 12, 15, 16, 22, 23, &amp; 24.  </li>
            <li> There was no spills and my nail polish wasn&#x27;t dried up.</li>
            <li> I received the polishes and immediately noticed that one of them was dried up.  </li>
            <li> When I opened the box I found out that few of the nail polish are dried.</li>
            <li> The polish was dried out and could not be used.</li>
            <li> It was dried out and had a sticker with the number 13 on it.</li>
            <li> Because of the shape of the brush, it caused polish to get on sides of skin and the polish was not smooth at all.</li>
            <li> Kinda ticked at this purchase and waste of my money.</li>
            <li> some bottles arrived broken or open in the box</li>
            <li> tested a few colors on one of my nails</li>
            <li> Saved a few for myselft</li>
            <li> My last complaint is that it is fairly thick and its not easy to touch-up spots without it sticking out.</li>
            <li> yellow, pink, and green were very thin.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t matter how thick or thin I put it on, if I put a top coat, base coat or nothing, every color that I tried (about 60% of them), would never fully dry.</li>
            <li> The only one I was really disappointed in was the neon green/yellow - even after several coats, it was still pretty sheer, so I have to use a base coat if I want to avoid streaks.</li>
            <li> NOT TRUE!</li>
            <li> But, not pleased with some dried up polish at $29.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I opened it all and tried a few of them and had them all out of the packaging before I realized that all of them were the same:  </li>
            <li> This product had nail polish that was dried up, empty and broken bottles.  </li>
            <li> But when it arrived - i opened the package and it immediately smelled of nail polish - nothing had leaked but at least 4 of the tops were not screwed on tight.  </li>
            <li> Just a little thick for some of them</li>
            <li> The polish is a little thin, so I would definitely recommend three thin coats to cover well.</li>
            <li> am literally shocked at how much I like this nail polish!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not about broken glass, the manicure didn&#x27;t closed at all,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too thick or clumpy or dried out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say if you like all the colors save for just a few, go for it anyways!</li>
            <li> but no out of the ordinary smell comes from the nail polish itself.</li>
            <li> Small enough bottles not to get bored with the color.</li>
            <li> None of mine were dried out, or even thick.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy essie</li>
            <li> None of my colors were dried out at all!</li>
            <li> not sure what I was going to get and received one of every color, no copies.</li>
            <li> But I hate that the nail polish starts chipping right away.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a gift and when I received it, one of the nail polishes was broken and was all over the other ones.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, one color was broken and dried up (white).  </li>
            <li> One of the bottles was broken in half spilling all the polish everywhere.</li>
            <li> The nailpolish itself is horrible, gooey and easily scratched off even after thorough drying time.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time choosing.</li>
            <li> It seemed like my nail polish remover hardly put a dent in the coat.</li>
            <li> Instead you can peel it off with your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;Really disappointed with this particular item from Shany.</li>
            <li> For the price I was expecting little bottles and not great quality...</li>
            <li> I found the yellows to be a little thin.  </li>
            <li> but the bad is far outweighing the good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was afraid it was going to be of low quality</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for nail polish, so of course I had to get these polishes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this until it was too late.</li>
            <li> paint my nails at LEAST once a week, and I&#x27;ve used all the brands at Walmart, and even some Salon quality nail polish...</li>
            <li> I order my nail polish late Friday evening</li>
            <li> Wish there was a way to at least return the one bottle and get</li>
            <li> Pulled my nails out and it was so thick and lumpy.</li>
            <li> Thick and clumpy upon opening.  </li>
            <li> The colors are to thick and sticky.</li>
            <li> The nail polishes are gorgeous!&lt;br /&gt;one of them was broken so it was dried</li>
            <li> So thick.</li>
            <li> I will admit after reading some of the reviews about getting broken or dried out bottles</li>
            <li> One use and they got too thick to use.</li>
            <li> Not very happy.</li>
            <li> Tip I learned for drying your nails faster is ice water, stick your fingertips in a bowl of cold water for 3-4 minutes and it helps to dry them a lot faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> IT WAS A MESS!!!</li>
            <li> The clumps were so bad, I had to start over multiple times, and then I just gave up and threw them out.</li>
            <li> Not a good product.</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment!</li>
            <li> Way too thick to go on evenly!</li>
            <li> , I couldn&#x27;t sleep, so I decided to take it off and it was very hard to do it.</li>
            <li> 20/24 were sticky and very hard to apply.  </li>
            <li> I saw all those bad reviews saying that the bottles broke or were dry or whatever.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed it peels &amp; is very goopy.</li>
            <li> Today, I was grabbed one by the handle to shake it up since they are usually very thick.</li>
            <li> So VERY SLOW</li>
            <li> was not happy</li>
            <li> Arrived broken &amp; spilled all over packaging.  </li>
            <li> 4 stars despite the broken bottle.</li>
            <li> Since it is not returnable, I was not happy.</li>
            <li> , it seems like they&#x27;re thin, which causes streaks...lots of streaks</li>
            <li> I bought this set along with a Shany stamping kit and these polishes are too thin too work for stamping.</li>
            <li> I was NOT happy with.</li>
            <li> I received the package with broken bottles and nail polish everywhere.</li>
            <li> Also one polish bottle from my set was broken.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a thin viscosity.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money and grave disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Seems like I will only need one base coat since the polish is that great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was worrying because some reviews said there were broken glasses, However, they are wrapped in a plastic and</li>
            <li> After looking around Amazon, and finding out that other polishes are about $8 each, I got thoroughly frustrated.</li>
            <li> ridiculous it that?!</li>
            <li> I was afraid that the bottle size would be small</li>
            <li> i hate waiting forever for my nail polish to dry!</li>
            <li> I read some negative reviews and was afraid to order because of the no return policy, but I ordered any way and relieved my order in tact.  </li>
            <li> 24 to 48 hours is not ideal.</li>
            <li> It was annoying because the spilled polish caused some of the other bottles to be \\&quot;glued\\&quot; to the package.</li>
            <li> And when i opened a few of them, the brush stayed inside of the bottle!!!!</li>
            <li> I know 30 dollars for nail polish may seem silly</li>
            <li> This nail polish was extremely stale.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s that there was a faint sort of chemical smell upon opening the box</li>
            <li> Im sad.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong with the price.</li>
            <li> unfortunately, it was not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It came in 4 boxes and none were broken or spilled!</li>
            <li> I would say I&#x27;m so what obsessed with painting my nails...</li>
            <li> Nail polish can be so expensive these days</li>
            <li> and I guess I&#x27;m unable to because they are flammable material which Amazon does not accept returns on.  </li>
            <li> There are 2 things that were not perfect.</li>
            <li> The darker colors seem very thin as well.</li>
            <li> Polish is very poor quality.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t see the mess until she opened it and needless to say I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Bad investment,  Polish is horrible and chips instantly!</li>
            <li> It stinks</li>
            <li> So that is a disappointment.</li>
            <li> It was equally crazy with just one coat of them.</li>
            <li> When I did use one, then tried to remove it, the glitter was so difficult to remove that it took A LOT of effort to get rid of it, including scraping my nails!</li>
            <li> and I mean crap!  </li>
            <li> The quality is really bad.</li>
            <li> I was worried that the quality would be bad, or that they would break during shipping</li>
            <li> I purchased based on reviews, so perhaps I got a bad batch, but nevertheless, it&#x27;s a REALLY bad batch.</li>
            <li> The nail polish was bad quality, it started to chip the day I put it on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously shocked at the quality.</li>
            <li> Colors are terrible and quality is worse.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t horrible, by any means, but they&#x27;re not great either.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed if you purchase these nail polishes.</li>
            <li> To my knowledge nobody was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my granddaughter&#x27;s birthday and was disappointed with</li>
            <li> looks like you get what you pay for :(</li>
            <li> cosmetics\\&quot;, once Im disappointed, I beleive I will always do.</li>
            <li> I gave this for a Christmas gift :(</li>
            <li> I am highly disappointed in this set.  </li>
            <li> You can not return this crap</li>
            <li> i hate it thats why i dont use it anymore</li>
            <li> i hate it</li>
            <li> I work with my hands often and hate it when my polish chips.</li>
            <li> I was shocked!</li>
            <li> : They chip off very badly in just 2 days after application</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This polish just peels off the clients toes, very Disappointed in this Polish seeing that had to wait on it</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE.  </li>
            <li> This is the worst nail polish I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I use to do my nails every week, so I can say this is the worst brand I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It goes on clumpy and nasty looking.  </li>
            <li> Worst polish ever!!</li>
            <li> This polish is horrible.  </li>
            <li> Really terrible nail polish.</li>
            <li> HATE IT!</li>
            <li> I think that this has to be some of the worst nail polish that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> By noon my nails are all chipping and just look awful.</li>
            <li> Two words:God Awful.</li>
            <li> Very disgusted and ended up throwing it away.</li>
            <li> Awful nail polish.</li>
            <li> but they weren&#x27;t terrible either.</li>
            <li> and I needed some base coats!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> the colors are really pretty, but the polish doesnt stay on</li>
            <li> Not terrible , not amazing. You get what you pay for !</li>
            <li> I really like this nail polish. I got it for my child 10th birthday party and she love it,it just take to long to dry but if i had to i will buy it again</li>
            <li> I really love this nail polish set, I like to paint my nails a solid color and then use the glitter nail polish to put on the tips of my nails. I personally love the bright colors :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used four of the colors already and I love the color and look of the nail polishes. I was afraid it was going to be of low quality but they turned out great! I have ordered another set to give to my mother.</li>
            <li> I bought this set and the other one they have and then I promptly proceeded to arrange them together and mix the colors up.  I can tell you this much: you don&#x27;t need both, but it&#x27;s nice to have them.  Lots of glitter colors (is glitter very popular suddenly?), lots of colors that are alike, but kind of different.  A lot of dark colors.  Nothing really light.  Dark, rich and bright would be how I would describe them.  Still totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Quick drying, high quality. Vibrant colors that are resistant to wear and tear.</li>
            <li> This is a great selection of colors.  It has mostly fun pedicure colors as well as some basic manicure colors.  Great value compared to OPI.</li>
            <li> You can not return this crap and I mean crap!  The nail polish is old any clumpy!  I can&#x27;t even use it and now I&#x27;m stuck with this garbage, so pissed...</li>
            <li> I love Shany&#x27;s products and this nail polish is a great buy. The colors are great and the bottles are a nice size. The shipping was fast and everything was packaged very nicely.</li>
            <li> A lot of colors good for the price but the color goes off on less than five days and it feels thick also</li>
            <li> My wife likes the nail polish it will be her surprise birthday gift when she actually receives it. Thanks for the timely delivery.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughters and I and we loved it.  I have even used a few myself.  My only complaint, which isn&#x27;t really the suppliers fault, is that since I ordered this in May(?), June(?) and live in the Arizona desert, one of the bottle caps was melting!! So there was a bit of a spill nothing too messy.  Figured orange wasnt really my color anyway. &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> A lot of these polishes are old and dried out. Had to throw out half of them. Good price but now I see why.</li>
            <li> Over my new polishes, great quality for low price. My clients love my new colors. Will be purchasing more in the near future.</li>
            <li> All the nail polishes are not in good condition. Some of my were so dry I could not even use them - I.e. the LIGHT blue shade and some other shades.</li>
            <li> I just got my polishes today and already did my swatches. The colors are very nice and I can&#x27;t wait to work with them. I have noticed that none of my polishes are matte but it doesn&#x27;t bother me because I have a bunch of mattes any way. Shipping was wonderful and nothing was spilled or broken which I think is because it was shipped in three different cardboard boxes then it was packed in a plastic box, shrink wrapped and it had a plastic tray with a plastic top. I am very happy with my purchase!!</li>
            <li> One polish came really really dry. But the rest were perfect. The colors have an amazing shine with too coats off polish but shine even more with the top coat. It held up well and the colors are so vivid. Happy hands and feet over here</li>
            <li> Great product. Big bottles and nice colors.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed. Product is like goo</li>
            <li> This was a wonderful gift for my two nieces who love to polish their nails.  They have a color for every finger.</li>
            <li> the colors are awesome also coats very good, dont really need to double coat, good value 100 rating, i love shany products are the best</li>
            <li> High end packaging with superior quality products to give you the most excellent manicure. The hottest colors that dry quickly and cover well with only one coat. The neon colors are fun too! The easy to hold bottle design comes in handy also.</li>
            <li> Great colors, they are very opaque I can do two coats and they look great. The only ones that I have to do three coats on are the lighter colors: Yellow, light pink etc. My only issue is they do chip pretty fast but I can live with that!!</li>
            <li> Love these, great quality.</li>
            <li> Some are okay.. some are transparent.. and some are too gunky to use.. I use them for crafts mostly anyway so it&#x27;s not too big of a deal.. I have used them on my nails and they peel right off.... pretty colors.. poor quality.</li>
            <li> I love the nail polishes they are so pretty and affordable</li>
            <li> When I recieved my polish, two of the bottles had leaked and had to be thrown out.&lt;br /&gt;I was not happy but I tried some of the other colors and I am about 50/50 on my opinion. Several of the colors were watery and when applied very uneven. My biggest issue is that they take forever to dry. I put on one coat and twenty minutes later it is still tacky. I like some of the colors but right now I wish I had saved my money.</li>
            <li> it isnt the greatest quality because when i put the polish on, it&#x27;s so HARD to get off with ordinary nail polish remover... i hate it thats why i dont use it anymore... i buy other polishes that are like $5-$10 for each bottle because the quality of the polish is great. but however if you&#x27;re looking for good quality nail polish. these arent really good.... and even when i put it on.. it doesnt look flat at all... its all thick, and its SO EASY to peel off after it dries i hate it</li>
            <li> 24 bottles of nail polish for less than 1$ per--can&#x27;t beat that deal.  Have just about every color in the palette and now can do all kinds of creative things.  THe irony is only a few colors always get used.  These are decent colors, and decent quality.  They are even viscosity, dry very consistently, (one bottle dries same speed as another or one color dries same as other).  They &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; well and last long.  My nails look great for about a week and then start looking a little raggedy.  WIth a top coat I expect more durable finish (obviously) but have not found the need to use as these hold up well for 4-5 days.  I&#x27;m ready for a new color by then, lol.  Clean up easily with nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> They were stripers, not nail polishes. HUGE WASTE OF MONEY. - My girlfirend.</li>
            <li> Bought thus for my 11year old daughter, she and her friends love it. Perfect gift for young girls</li>
            <li> There are 3 generations of women in my home. All LOVE the colors &amp; quality. My oldest (22) was the 1st to snap them up &amp; use it Christmas day before work. The variety of colors &amp; glitters mean we can all have our own favorites!</li>
            <li> I got this polish as a Christmas gift. I like the colors and how it dries pretty quickly. But I just tried to use it for water marbleing my nails. Yeah, didn&#x27;t work so well. It didn&#x27;t spread out like it should when you drop it in the water. Also it dries way to quickly. I put my fingers in after I used my orange stick to swirl the polish around. Pulled my nails out and it was so thick and lumpy. Don&#x27;t recommend this polish for water marveling. But like everyone has said it is great for other kinds of nail art.</li>
            <li> Great color selections, great quality, fun Mani-Pedi times!  Mother/Daughter, Friend/Friend Bonding Time will be had!!</li>
            <li> I really love this polish! It dries pretty quickly and is true to color. It has a bit of a matte finish so you&#x27;ll need a glossy topcoat. Perfect for those who like to do nail art!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for anyone that loves to be creative with nail polish. Every color that you could want. Excellent delivery.</li>
            <li> The polish is not top quality, but for the price, it is a great buy. Wonderful assortment of colors! We did not notice any odour at all as some other reviews have mentioned.</li>
            <li> The shipment was very fast and all my bottles are in tack. The polish came in a nice black box separated nicely in a plastic tray and plastic lid providing easy viewing of the colors and accessibility. I like the box so much, I will keep my polish stored in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I had to try the polish right away. The polish applies smoothly and covers well with one coat, although I chose to put on two coats.  I am still amazed that such beautiful polish was available at such a low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon thanks for the great service!</li>
            <li> These nail polishes were purchased for my little one who loves to paint her nails.  There are so many colors to choose them and she loves them.  Unfortunately, one color was broken and dried up (white).  I assume this happened in transit so I am not docking my review because of it.  You will not be disappointed if you purchase these nail polishes.</li>
            <li> Stays on really long love it</li>
            <li> I really love this set.  The colors are so bright and it pops!  it may not be as shiny as other brands, but using  a top coat definitely helps.  For the price you pay, I think it is a great deal.  The products doesn&#x27;t seem old as some may have experienced, or maybe i just got lucky.  It also comes in a tray that holds all nail polishes which makes it look very organized; however, i have my own nail polish rack &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love doing my own nails.  The colors you get make it so hard to decide which color to do next.  I love this set.  Some of the polishes have a little iridescence, there are a few sparkly ones, bright colors, dark colors...all the colors you could want.  The price at first was off putting because you see $30 for nail polish but when you figure it out it&#x27;s only $1.25 per bottle, which is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> The bottles are the perfect size so you get a good amount of product, but theybarent so big that they clutter your vanity. The colors are beautiful and are great for those who love to experiment with with different designs in all different colors.</li>
            <li> Yes I love them because I am a teenager who loves anything sparkly or colorful. There are a lot of colors and they all seem like they&#x27;re new... I know another review said something about that not being the case. None of the bottles were damaged and they were in a holder that I still use. I know 30 dollars for nail polish may seem silly but at Target and other department stores you can get one bottle of nail polish for eight dollars. Each of these bottles cost about $1.50 so they are a good deal in comparison.</li>
            <li> The polish arrived on time and was as advertised. I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with some of the colors in this set. I am a middle aged woman and mother of a mid 20s daughter. So some of these colors were not for me. The ones I did like were fantastic. They dried quickly and lasted a long time. Longer than my normal polish does, and it costs at lot more that these do. I also noticed that these polishes seemed more chip resistant. Other than some of the colors I would recommend these polishes. I plan to buy these again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;  OK I HAVE CHANGED MY MIND, thanks to being thought how to use the colors I thought weren&#x27;t for me.  My daughter took me to a friend of hers that does nails who showed me how to use these colors properly to get very nice effects.  I now love these colors, and will definately be ordering more.  My Daughter also found me a couple how to magazines for other ideas.  I guess a slightly older woman can learn new things.All of these colors are great, of course I still have my favorites over others, but knowing the new patterns and styles really helped.

            <li> These nail polishes are ok... they don&#x27;t go on as smooth as other brands.  Great color selection, but quality isn&#x27;t that impressive.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this nail polish. I thought for the price it would just be \\&quot;meh\\&quot;. The colors are vibrant and it dries fast too.  I&#x27;m seriously shocked at the quality. So happy with this!</li>
            <li> You have all the colors that you need, no chipping within the 1st week. I wash my hands alot so it&#x27;s not the Polishes fault! Goes on beautiful and I it&#x27;s gorgerous on the nails. Love them:)</li>
            <li> Nothing I have come across can beat this price or the quality. Other nail polishes are easily $7-$10 per bottle but this set is a mere fraction of that price got basically the same if not better quality polish than the other over priced brands. Buying this set is the perfect dream cone true for any self manicurist out there! I would add it to your cart right now!</li>
            <li> This is a great set and I can split it up with friends so we can each take our fave colors and only pay 1/3 of the price. Nice quality and a good variety of bright, true hues. Good value.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the price fool you.  You are getting top shelf polish here!! The colors are beautiful and it goes on very easy!  Shany, you got our vote!!!  We&#x27;ll be back for more!! Thank you for such a nice product!!</li>
            <li> This came in a timely manner with nice packaging for storage. But of the 6 Colors I&#x27;ve  used 3 were way too thick and all pealed off right away. Then when I went to remove them with polish remover I couldn&#x27;t get it off without removing some of my nail too. To top it off I can&#x27;t return it. Not very happy.</li>
            <li> I love nail polish and this has quickly become a favorite brand. My boyfriend sent it to me as a gift. Admittedly, I was skeptical at first considering the price and what that adds up to per bottle. I don&#x27;t like the cheaper brands like Sinful Colors because I find they chip so easily even with a top coat. Shany goes on smoothly, stays on longer, and comes off better with polish remover than Essie or OPI for $8 a bottle. The variety in colors is great I have a hard time choosing. It takes awhile to dry and the matte colors are really flat, but that&#x27;s easily fixed with a top coat. A great buy!!</li>
            <li> Although the price is right and the colors are beautiful, the polish itself is like old nail polish, hard to use and thick as glue.  It takes forever to dry and is hard to apply because of its thickness.  I advise you not to buy this nail polish, and to spend the money on quality nail polish that is thinner and easier to use and quicker to dry.  I wish I had just sent this back the moment I had tried it.  Unfortunately I opened it all and tried a few of them and had them all out of the packaging before I realized that all of them were the same:  TERRIBLE.  Do not buy polish from SHANY.</li>
            <li> This is the worst nail polish I have ever used. It really doesn&#x27;t matter how good the packing is when the quality of the product is so bad, the smell is too strong, made me have a strong headache all day, I couldn&#x27;t sleep, so I decided to take it off and it was very hard to do it. I use to do my nails every week, so I can say this is the worst brand I have ever used. Do not buy it!</li>
            <li> I ordered these as a Christmas gift for my two girls. Today, I was grabbed one by the handle to shake it up since they are usually very thick. Right when I shook it the... (I don&#x27;t even know how to explain what exactly happened)... the cap that holds the wand just came clean off and the bottle flew across the bathroom, hit the tile and shattered everywhere. I was really excited because the colors are very pretty. Some of them go on smooth and others are super thick. Buy overall it seemed like a good purchase. Now I&#x27;m kind of terrified to try using the rest of them. IT WAS A MESS!!! The picture I included was after the initial clean up and you can still see the polish on my tile and my cupboards are in pretty bad shape.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for its quanity and price. When it arrived I was pleasently surprised with its durability. I work with my hands often and hate it when my polish chips. After yard work, shooting my bow, and working on my car I had no chips what so ever! How amazing is that! The only downfall is that it takes a while to dry so don&#x27;t get your hands into anything for about five to ten minutes. Other then the dry time I would advise you to buy.</li>
            <li> Reading the reviews of the people who have already tried out this product sparked my curiosity, and made me interested in getting this product when I am able to.  I had given up on doing self manicures years ago because I didn&#x27;t find high-quality nail polish.  However, now that I have found these products, I am seriously contemplating doing regular self-manicures.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for nail polish, so of course I had to get these polishes. When I got my package I was amazed how neatly the polishes were wrapped in order to prevent any breakage. So I was pleased I didn&#x27;t receive any broken bottles. The colors are vivid and dry fairly quickly. I love the assortment of colors from soft pinks, purples, greens, and blues. Some are shimmery and other have a matte finish. Overall, you get a little bit of everything!</li>
            <li> i love the different colors and the glittery ones also. the are bright and it has a beautiful rich texture to it. it also drys real quickly for those of you that are in a rush.</li>
            <li> Shany is a great company because you know you are getting a good product here!! This is the perfect gift for any holiday! My little cousin&#x27;s absolutely have all the fun when they come over because they always want to paint their nails! 24 colors give them a variety. You can&#x27;t get a better deal then this! Love Love!</li>
            <li> Colors are true to the bottle, however the polish itself seems a little cheap. the polish doesnt last long, sometimes chipping off in the same day and even peels off with topcoat. You cant expect much being its not an expensive high quality brand compared to OPI for example, but my three year old loves it.I paint her nails with all the sparkled ones. Great for nail art practice too.</li>
            <li> These colors are so cute and not expensive at all. the pinks are beautiful colors and is perfect for a gift!</li>
            <li> I had a friend order these for her daughter&#x27;s birthday party, they did a night at the spa slumber party. The girls loved the colors and they did dry quicky.  thank goodness!</li>
            <li> I received my package today. One of the bottles was broken in half spilling all the polish everywhere. Not that big of a deal because it was the red color which I already have. It was annoying because the spilled polish caused some of the other bottles to be \\&quot;glued\\&quot; to the package. So it took a little bit of time to get the bottles out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I received my package in a timely fashion. The colors are beautiful and are what is in style right now. I painted my toes using the white and it took two coats which is pretty standard. It looks nice and shiny. If you&#x27;re looking for ok quality nail polish then this is a good set. I would give it 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for the packaging problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 5/2/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been alternating between these polishes and some of my other brands and I even though I love the colors and the prices of the Shany, the quality is seriously lacking in comparison with Sally Hansen and the like. I had to take another staff off for that. When I use it to paint my toes, if you don&#x27;t look at them too closely they look fine. But then you get up close and you can see lines and cracks as if I didn&#x27;t wait enough time to let it dry even though I do. No matter how much fanatical care I take to ensure a perfect pedicure, this happens everytime. Again, from far away ok, but just don&#x27;t look at my feet close up. Still love the colors, just don&#x27;t love the quality. I wish I could give it a 2.5 stars, but oh well.</li>
            <li> There is no way to return this even though one of the polish didn&#x27;t closed well, so it spilled everywhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not about broken glass, the manicure didn&#x27;t closed at all, so brush and the bottle got separated and ruined all other bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and there is no way that I can contact with seller and exchange/return the item because it&#x27;s glass product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How ridiculous it that?!</li>
            <li> I purchase this product to try some different ways to paint my nails. You need 3-4 coats if you want good coverage.</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit worried that the nail polish would be a bit watery and chip easily, but it was there totally better than expected. The nail polish was a great consistency and dried fairly quickly(not really quick). One thing to know is the sparkly gold and silver aren&#x27;t very thick in the amount of sparkles to the clear coat. But even then,doing a coat of silver on the black looked very nice(I thought). I would say this was a great deal and was a wonderful gift.</li>
            <li> Arrived broken &amp; spilled all over packaging.  Bummer!</li>
            <li> I love these. Unlike other nail polishes this one actually stays on and will not chip off the first week. I love the variety of colors.</li>
            <li> I have been working on different nail designs lately (thanks to the wonders of Pinterest...) and was looking for a set of nail colors with a large variety that were actually of good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not have made a better choice!  This arrived in two days, and I have nothing but praise for this!  It came in perfect packaging, I was worried that it would have been a little more fragile with so many containers of glass nail polish, but it arrived with each nail polish  snuggled neatly in it&#x27;s own little hole, a clear plastic box, a brown box, some of those big &amp;#34;bubble&amp;#34; fillers, and another big box.  Not even a single nail polish was out of place, and I was very pleased with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality:  The first thing I did was open one up to see how thick it would be, if it had a strong odor, and what the brushes looked like.  I can honestly say that this is the exact same quality you would get from the drugstore that you would pay $5 or more for each, easily.  For the price and quality, this is simply an amazing value,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know I&#x27;m about to sound like a huge nerd, but I was so excited when I first opened this, I took it over to my neighbor&#x27;s house.  We are pretty close friends, and often hang out and do our nails together.  They were just as excited as I was, and  we are planning a get-together soon to look at nail ideas and try them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great buy-will definitely buy again if needed!  This has all kinds of great colors, and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy that I decided to purchase this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hannah Booth</li>
            <li> The product is very good and it was beyond my expectation.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a gift so I didn&#x27;t get to try it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with the packaging! The nail polishes and the plastic tray are wrapped in plastic and it does come the long black box (its cardboard).&lt;br /&gt;All the colors are as shown. This will make an impressive gift for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I love these. One color came bad, but I loved the other ones. I have noticed it chips easier, but I just use OPI top coat, and it stays great. I paint my nails so often though that I always change the color before they end up chipping.</li>
            <li> i love the all the different vibrant colors to choose from. the nail polish itself tends to clump and chips pretty easy. its not bad enough to where i dont use it. i really love this product.</li>
            <li> The colors are nice (although, what&#x27;s with the NEON yellow one? ew).  The polish is solid and seems to hold up.  The only thing I&#x27;ll say is that the item is NON-RETURNABLE!  So, make SURE you want it first!  There&#x27;s no way to return it once you have it.  I didn&#x27;t realize this until it was too late.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is perfect for everyday use. The color payoff is great, it is so easy to use too.</li>
            <li> I received the product May 10th. Packaged very carefully. The colors look great.  I received the product way before it was supposed to come.Kudos to Shany Cosmetics.</li>
            <li> The colors are very bright and they pop. There is very little chipping and it last for over a week. The price is also very reasonable for such a good products.</li>
            <li> and a great price! SO many different colors to keep you looking good all year long!! Especially for someone like me who changes nail color almost daily!!</li>
            <li> I bought this set since I recently started back doing my own pedicures. I love the variety of colors. Great colors for the spring and summer time. Also they dry fast which I love. Also you can&#x27;t beat the price. I think it would make a great gift or if your like me mid 20&#x27;s and trying to save money from going to the salon every few weeks buy this product. Beautiful bright colors and even some glitter colors. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I received this set as a gift and love it. All the colors are perfect and vibrant.The quality is great too and seem to last as long as those big name polishes.In fact I am so impressed I will be trying out some of their other products.....</li>
            <li> Very nice and seems to stay on pretty good</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for a teenaged girl who wanted multiple colors nail polish. Shopped around online and in stores before finding this set.  Much of what I found in sets was smaller bottles and often with poor reviews from customers who had used the products.  This set had good reviews and so I decided to get it.  It arrived today and while I am not the user so I can&#x27;t speak to the quality of the product - the set looks fantastic! Great colors, full sized bottles and very well packaged for shipping and giving as a gift.  Would highly recommend it for someone looking for a gift set.  Really a great buy!</li>
            <li> I love these! I love the color variety! I always have loved learning how to do nails on YouTube, and now with these colors I can do them! Yay! I would for sure recommend these!</li>
            <li> I bought the set of 24 because it was more affordable and good quality nail polish. I got a bang for my buck and my husband happy it didn&#x27;t break his wallet.I like to do my own nails I don&#x27;t like nor trust nail salons I enjoy wearing bright colors this is perfeect for me. I recommend this product for people like me D.I.Y .</li>
            <li> great product i was sooo happy with my cousin loving this product she loved the variety of colors and thought it was great thanks again</li>
            <li> Lots of colors but the quality is sort of low. Either way it&#x27;s cool if u just want a variety of color and only plan on having the color on for a few days.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have these personally, but I have heard so many great things about them. Once again, you get a HUGE color selection for a WONDERFUL price. Check these out!</li>
            <li> Most of the colors I won&#x27;t use personally, but gave them to my daughter, The glitter ones are wonderful love the glitter nice coverage.</li>
            <li> My daughter received this set from her uncle for Christmas and we are very pleased with the product. They are full size bottles with beautiful colors. None of them broke and Polish is good quality. Excited to start purchasing more stuff by them.</li>
            <li> I love them!!!! More that I expected!!</li>
            <li> I am so amazed with this product. Great for nail art and just painting your nail i do not regret buy this item at all.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 sets, one for my daughter and one as a birthday gift for her friend. They arrived very quickly and were in great condition. When I initially opened the box the smell of polish was very strong, but the scent faded a bit. My daughter absolutely loves the variety of colors and I love the fact that you get so much polish (all 24 bottles are full sized) at such a reasonable price considering chain drug stores charge $5 - $8 for one bottle here in NYC. Perfect for pre-teen to teen girls.</li>
            <li> Great bargin quality is good even on darker colors u don&#x27;t have to put 3 or more coats to show the color</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend This set! I was worried that the bottles would be small because you get so many for such a good price, but they are full sized. And I was also worried that the quality of the nail polish was going to suck. But Its actually VERY nice. It covers well with one coat and is true to color. I am someone who does my nails ALOT!!!! And I am pretty picky when it comes to nail polish, but I LOVEEEEEEEE THIS! I can actually say that this may be my favorite brand of nail polish I have tried so far. My first pick used to be china glaze, but this covers just as well, with beautiful colors and its affordable. Compared to paying $5 a bottle for most other polishes.</li>
            <li> Premium quick dry colors are perfect for women that want to be polished, but don&#x27;t have all day to go to the salon or sit around and wait for their manicures to dry. It&#x27;s especially great for mommies who only have the length of nap time to paint their nails and allow for them to dry and still get errands done!</li>
            <li> Oh my Gosh, you have to love this. Every color under the sun. Bright and Vibrant. Goes on Smooth, shines like crazy, and best of all Dries super fast. Whoo Hoo!</li>
            <li> Love love love the colors! Great for gifts! Loved everyone that I tried so far! I am looking forward to trying more</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for</li>
            <li> I love these!  The polish is thick and only needs one coat and the colors are great!  I like these more than some expensive brands.  Great polish for the price.</li>
            <li> my dad got these for my bday and I love em!! each bottle is double the volume of polish of regular bottles you buy at the store... cant go wrong with 24 colors of nail polish</li>
            <li> Just got this the other day and the artist-in-me sees many possibilities for creating and experimenting.  One coat goes on smoothly, and dries in the normal amount of wait time.  Nineteen of the colors are matte and opaque, five others are glossy with sparkles.  I rather like the effect of doing an undercoat of a color (today it is peach) and a second coat of sparkles (today gold on top of the peach).  Not sure I would wear some of these colors alone, but next time hope to do a stained glass design.  My teenage granddaughter would just love this, I suspect.</li>
            <li> These nail polishes are really good. Thought they&#x27;d be smaller, but were a good size &amp; I like how it comes in its own little container/nail holder.</li>
            <li> All bottles arrived intact. Many awesome colors to choose from. The tray they come on is awesome as well. A+</li>
            <li> This set is great. There&#x27;s a color to match any mood! The quality of the polish is not bad at all for the price either. Two coats of paint covers it with all the colors I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> wrote a review already. some polishes thick, some good, some very very thin and dry too fast to get nail covered properly.</li>
            <li> I spread these around to all the girls in my life for Christmas.  To my knowledge nobody was disappointed. Great variety for those who like to do nail art.</li>
            <li> The bottles come all wrapped up nicely for sale at a store. For me it makes it easier to see all of the awesome colors. I read the comments before buying because I couldn&#x27;t believe how cheap they are but it&#x27;s real. Normal sized bottles if not on the bit larger size with 24 different colors. It&#x27;ll take forever to go through so I don&#x27;t know about buying them again but I&#x27;d definitely tell a friend to check them out.</li>
            <li> For cosmetics, I typically buy high-end brands, but I&#x27;m always open to try different products. As far as nail polish, even premium brands that are not supposed to chip, end up doing so because I work with my hands everyday in art projects.  I was looking for something that was less expensive with vibrant hues and found this set online.  I even had a $10 coupon, although it already came with a great price that I could not resist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I sampled a few colors which went on smoothly without any lumps.  Some of the colors might need to be reapplied with a second coat because they seem thinner, but that can happen even with the most expensive brands. This nail polish set is great for someone who wants to have fun with colors and experiment. Also since the set comes with 24 different colors, some of which might not be your preferred style, you can always give a few to friends and family!  â€‹&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this set again in a heartbeat!â€‹</li>
            <li> It has a very strong smell after is dry, takes forever to dry, polish does not last long it starts to fall the next day</li>
            <li> this is the best polish ive ever used. 6weeks go by and it hasnt even begun to come off! WOW</li>
            <li> Over all really great for the price but some of the colors came thick or got thicker faster than normal.  I do not believe this is because I use them more or something like that.  Also there isn&#x27;t a very good light purple or light green.  The purple is a little too blue and the only light green is metallic. Overall I&#x27;m glad I bought these but be prepared to need to replace a few shades</li>
            <li> Perfect packaging......perfect timing!!!! This is the perfect gift for a teen - she is going to love it. super cute colors.</li>
            <li> My mom gave me this for Easter and I love it. Its was in a very cute package that I&#x27;m going to store them it. Good job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a girl who just can&#x27;t sit still to wait for her nails to dry. I love that this kit has a wide verity of color and it all drys fast!</li>
            <li> these polishes come with a lot of options becuase with this buy you get 24 nail polishes in different colors. I&#x27;m the kind of girl that likes to have options and also likes to save money this seems like a good buy.</li>
            <li> Wow these colors are Show Stoppers with Amazing Diva Appeal!! Now how can you beat the quality and value that your getting here with these polishes. I do own some of the Shany polishes and I love each one. Very strong and vibrant colors You owe It to your Inner Diva To let Her Shine!![[ASIN:B005X2F7JY Shany Cosmetics The Cosmopolitan Nail Polish Set (24 Colors Premium Quality and Quick Dry), 40 Fluid Ounce]]</li>
            <li> This nail polish was extremely stale.  Thick and clumpy upon opening.  I wasted a lot of money on all this nail polish.  Such pretty colors, i just wish they had lived up to my expectations.  Sorry to say this but buy this product at your own risk.  I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Just very cheap polish. Sounds like a bargain but skip it.&lt;br /&gt;Go to your local drugstore and buy the cheap Wet and Wild if you want a variety of colors for bargain prices.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for stamping purposes. the colors are beautiful, highly pigmented and stamp very well. I would definately order this product again!</li>
            <li> Love the colors.  It&#x27;s a great assortment.  Color lasts without fading.  Very reasonable price.  Got here quickly without any problems.</li>
            <li> I gave this nail polish set to my grandaugther she and her friends love all the beautiful colors she loved it</li>
            <li> very good colors. I love painting it. Easy to paint.</li>
            <li> My daughter &amp; I love the polish set. The colors are great!! This set came earlier than expected and I&#x27;m sure my daughter has used them everyday since receiving them!! Will order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I just got my order of polish in the mail and I was very impressed when I opened it. The polishes were bigger than what I expected and The colors look even better in person! I haven&#x27;t used any of the polish yet, but am excited to see how they look on the nails. The SHANY customer service was helpful when I called, and were prompt in sending me the MSDS sheets that I requested. They sent me an email with the pdf file attached and I received that email within hours of talking to the Customer service rep. I&#x27;m very impressed overall and I am hoping to try more of their products in the future.</li>
            <li> I could smell the polish as soon as i got it out of the box then saw a busted bottle in the back. The product couldnt be returned because it was deemed hazardous material so amazon gave me a small discount that more than paid for the broken bottle. The quality is good and I really love the colors. 4 stars despite the broken bottle.</li>
            <li> The colors in this set look amazing!! Would love to get this for my nieces for Christmas or even use for myself. Would definitely use everyday!!</li>
            <li> I love these nail polishes! they are great colors! bright and neutrals! great for all year round! would really recommend you get these!</li>
            <li> I love all these fun colors. Its so much fun, I really like being able to change the colors and having such a wide variety of colors to use. I really like the pinks and reds they&#x27;re my favorites</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 10 year old daughter. We were going to have a spa birthday party. When it arrived a few of the polishes were dried up. Since it is not returnable, I was not happy. I guess that is the risk for ordering nail polish online. Haven&#x27;t used them yet- party is this weekend. But, not pleased with some dried up polish at $29.</li>
            <li> This seemed like a great deal but this is really poorly made nail polish, it chips after less than a day the colors are not glossy at all they have a matte finish and I know nail polish isn&#x27;t supposed to smell good but this stuff smells absolutely horrible, all in all spend a few extra bucks for a better quality polish this stuff is garbage</li>
            <li> Very nice nail polish, lots of colors for a great price. The product applys easily and stays on for a while.</li>
            <li> The quality of these polishes was WAY beyond what I expected for the price.  These were full-sized bottles of vibrant colors.  They were in no way &amp;#34;seconds&amp;#34; or the &amp;#34;leftover colors that no one wanted, so they were sold in a value pack&amp;#34;.  The quality was great, the application was smooth, and the users were extremely pleased with the results.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would never buy these again. I&#x27;ll stick with China Glaze. Please note that this item in non-refundable. A few of my colors had faulty caps and dried out. Many other are too thick and goopy to apply properly. So in general the colors are gorgeous but most are impossible to use. I&#x27;ll stick with the higher grade polishes form now on.</li>
            <li> 20/24 were sticky and very hard to apply.  It goes on clumpy and nasty looking.  Would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Polish appears to be a little old. Kind of thick and peels off easily, have already had to add polish thinner to some of the bottles.</li>
            <li> These colors are pretty, But if you do any type of water marble design, These won&#x27;t work. The colors are to thick and sticky. If you don&#x27;t know what water marble is,,, Go on youtube.com A seach water marble! SO COOL!</li>
            <li> got this for my girlfriend and she loves it. would order from them again. I recommend this if you want to get it for your lady</li>
            <li> They arrived quickly and I was so excited to receive them,  but I can only recommend them for nail art.  They are beautiful but the polish applies on too thick for a base coat.</li>
            <li> Colors are pretty, but most of the polishes are thick, stringy, and unusable.</li>
            <li> I just love these colors! How is it possible to have all of them in such a good price? I can&#x27;t believe my luck when I stumbled upon these cuties!</li>
            <li> Worst polish ever!! Way too thick to go on evenly!</li>
            <li> I regularly use polish, from top brands like china glaze and opi to cheap brands like wet n wild. This polish looks cheap, smells cheaper, and some of the bottles don&#x27;t even open. For the money, I&#x27;d much rather buy wet n wild polish or sinful colors.</li>
            <li> We love the nail polish. The cost and quantity are wonderful. Would have received 5 stars, but it seems that the polish peels off of our nails quickly.</li>
            <li> I received the polish without any broken bottles, but all of the polishes are old and useless.&lt;br /&gt;After three hours it still doesn&#x27;t set.  I had to throw them all away.  Complete waste of money.  I think the people who wrote good reviews did so before trying the product; it seems like a good value, but it is in fact a scam.  I cannot even call it nail polish.</li>
            <li> Great product. It was delivered within a week (free)! Beautiful colors. I highly recommend this product. I&#x27;m giving it as gifts and know they will love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this nail polish gift set as a birthday gift for my 15 year old daughter.  It came packaged in a rectangular box resembling a shoe box, so she predicted it was shoes when she was opening it.  Inside the box, all the polishes are standing upright.  So when you look down at it, you don&#x27;t see the colors, just the black tops.  Beware that although nothing had spilled, I did immediately smell nail polish upon opening the box upon arrival.  2 of the tops were not screwed on tightly.  Anyhow, my daughter loves it, She says it doesn&#x27;t chip like her other polishes, so that is a good sign.  I haven&#x27;t used it personally.  It does not come with a clear top coat, which is a bummer.  So i give it 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> There were two bottles leaking when the package arrived.  The smell was so strong it made my eyes sting and burn. Some of the polish seemed to be old and thick. I was a gift for my granddaughter and I didn&#x27;t see the mess until she opened it and needless to say I was very disappointed.  My reason for ordering it was the good reviews I read about it from other customers...She liked the colors but I don&#x27;t think I will ever order it again.</li>
            <li> Great selection of colors and styles. Good consistency. A gift for my daughter and we are very excited to see what all we can do!</li>
            <li> So many colors and for such an affordable price. Some people have said they come out looking kind of matte, but I think they just aren&#x27;t so glittery. I love the range of colors!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy the set from this seller, I got mine off of ebay because the shipping was free but I was very happy with this set. I don&#x27;t know if this seller ships it exactly the same but my polishes came in a UPS box and inside of that, they were unopened in the original Shany box and they come in a plastic nail polish holder (like the kind you see at the stores) which I thought was cute and it makes storing them a lot neater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are exactly what is shown in the picture except for the oranges. The lighter orange, in real life is more of a tannish color that I don&#x27;t particularly care for &amp; the darker orange is VERY close to the same color as the red. Like hardly a difference at all, I actually thought they were the same color until I tested them out on a white sheet of paper. The colors are just as bright and vivid as shown. You can also layer these polishes, because they&#x27;re thin and create different colors. So far I&#x27;ve tried layering neon green with the hot pink and I got a neon orange color. I also tried layering the dark yellow with the darkest pink/purple and got a color similar to Cajun Shrimp by OPI. So, layering can give you even more colors that are really pretty, just FYI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the polishes are of okay quality, it seems like they&#x27;re thin, which causes streaks...lots of streaks so I had to apply at least 2 coats but some colors you need 3 or 4 coats which takes a long time to dry. Some polishes (the bright blue) dry very fast and others (yellow) take hours to dry so be aware of that. Tip I learned for drying your nails faster is ice water, stick your fingertips in a bowl of cold water for 3-4 minutes and it helps to dry them a lot faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this set but definitely NOT for stamping. I bought this set along with a Shany stamping kit and these polishes are too thin too work for stamping.</li>
            <li> What a great value for the amount of vibrant and fun colors that you get. Less expensive than purchasing from a retail store and has a great case that it comes with.</li>
            <li> Bought this for the gf as a bday present to go with the bundle monster 20 pc brush set, hit a home run, thought it would b expensive cuz the stores charge so much for polish, great product and better price, arrived in nice packaging that holds and organizes them, wish the gf would put them back in their tho, haha women, gotta luv em</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors, nice polish.  Great value.</li>
            <li> My daughter is going to love these!!  25 fantastic beautiful colors!  I am so excited to give them to her!!  I have already picked out the ones I am going to borrow.  ;)  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my niece who is into make-up and fashion.  She will have plenty of polish to come up with creative ideas.</li>
            <li> Very watery polish. Such a disappointment!</li>
            <li> This polish lasts me about a week with no chips.  Most colors can be applied with just one coat.  I did have an issue removing the polish but that was due to me using a non acetone polish remover(I didn&#x27;t even know there was such a thing lol).  Purchased acetone and this polish comes off with no problems.  So to other reviewers that had an issue removing the polish, you probably will need to get an acetone based remover.</li>
            <li> So glad I purchased these beautiful stripers!  Very bright beautiful colors and I love them! Definitely will purchase more things from shany!!! Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 8 year old that is obsessed with nail polish. For the price I was expecting little bottles and not great quality... I was shocked! Great colors. Great coverage. Awesome product.</li>
            <li> great colors, great price, pretty decent quality. Just a little thick for some of them so you can add some thinner.</li>
            <li> Perfect gift! Came in a nice box and the choice of colors were very impressive.  My daughter was very pleased.</li>
            <li> I ordered this set  to try it out for my nail art stamping. I must say that i am blown away by how fast my order came,the way it was packaged, and the quality of my polish. I  am very pleased with my purchase. I will definitely buy more shany products in the future.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it and paints her nails up for school events. She loves the variety, and it gives her the options for school dances as well.</li>
            <li> This polish is horrible.  It stinks and it&#x27;s clumpy. Not a good product. I would return it if I could.</li>
            <li> The picture doesn&#x27;t do this justice. Wonderful colors at an amazing price!</li>
            <li> The black polish in this kit works a million times better then the Konad stamp art black polish! I do not recomend this polishes as full on nail colors because they can run on a bit thick and will take ages to dry. But they are definitely worth the price!! I do highly recomend this polishes for stamp art though it looks bold, bright and wonderful! I now don&#x27;t have to spend so much money on nail polish meant specifically for stamp art.</li>
            <li> These are really nice...nice thick polish....great assortment of colors...they are vibraant</li>
            <li> Some of the colors not all seem to clump or streak - doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Good quality polish and definently a great price! The colors are a little matte so it&#x27;s best to use a shiny top coat</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for gifting purpose ..... I not used this ..............but color&#x27;s are so amazing and attractive feels like taking for myself also ............love it.........</li>
            <li> The colors are very vibrant and fun and it goes on and covers very well.  However, it only lasts 24 hours max, with a topcoat!  It peels up and comes off very easily.  OPI usually lasts me 7-10 days and this didn&#x27;t last 1!  I&#x27;d recommend it for a fun night out, but not for a weeklong mani.</li>
            <li> My most favorite product I have ordered in a long time! So many colors to choose from, excellent packaging, and 24 vibrant colors at an amazing price! I def recommend to anyone! Would make a perfect gift also!</li>
            <li> I love it. I want to order for all of my friends. Everyone is amazed at all the colors it has</li>
            <li> Crapy polish. Very disappointed it peels &amp; is very goopy. Couldn&#x27;t use even by putting polish thinner in it.</li>
            <li> I got this product on a penny auction site.&lt;br /&gt;In the packaging it requested that I leave a review on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I am literally shocked at how much I like this nail polish!!&lt;br /&gt;Never heard of this brand before, and getting it by mail was not really impressing me...until I used it!&lt;br /&gt;All of the bottles in the set were fresh, new, and definitely NOT dried out/old.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are as crisp as they look in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;You only need one coat, but since I like that thick look, I always use 2 coats of color...along with a top and base coat!!&lt;br /&gt;With all of the layers of wet nail polish I apply on my nails, the polish always seems to bubble up on me and take hours and hours to really dry!  But this nail polish did NOT &amp;#34;bubble&amp;#34; and all of it dried nicely, rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I paint my nails at LEAST once a week, and I&#x27;ve used all the brands at Walmart, and even some Salon quality nail polish...THIS IS BY FAR my favorite brand.</li>
            <li> Really terrible nail polish. Chips and peels off easily. Not eve kind of worth it. Just don&#x27;t buy it!! Trust me, I&#x27;m trying to help you! The assortment of colors isn&#x27;t as good as it looks. And you cannot return it because it&#x27;s a hazardous material.</li>
            <li> This product honestly astounded me! I&#x27;m a new customer to SHANY products and wanted to give this company a try after I&#x27;ve had countless bad experiences with a couple of other different companies. All of the nail polishes arrived perfectly and neatly sealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing at all was damaged and after using this product I&#x27;ve concluded that I&#x27;ll definitely be shopping for more SHANY products. The colors are vibrant and not watered down at all. It went on my nails smoothly without any clumps and lasted a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this and many more SHANY products to anyone!</li>
            <li> I only got 1 polish that was double of a color. I got 23 individual colors. 24 polishes in cool colors, some glitter, for 25 is an absolute steal! That price can&#x27;t be beat, and the quality is good! That is Shany for you! That is why they are my number 1 cosmetics company! Salon quality make up for cheap! And doesn&#x27;t make me break out!</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy this again. The variety of colors in this is fantastic. This nail polish is long lasting, dries quickly, and has very vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> I was having to paint my nails every other day, I finally just threw the whole set away &amp; bought a different brand.</li>
            <li> Pretty good value for the money, although I don&#x27;t know that I love all of the colors.  This biggest disappointment was that one of the bottles was completely dried out/not useable, but the others seem to be fine.  They are regular-sized bottles, and well-packaged.  You could keep them stored in the plastic tray if you wanted to.</li>
            <li> They are good quality, not quite on par with OPI/China Glaze, but for the price they are good. Be sure to have nail polish thinner, as you will need it with these guys!</li>
            <li> Great quality nail polish, great bold colors, speedy delivery, I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My grandaughters love them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely in love with this product. The colors are absolutely beautiful. I just got it today and I was super excited about it. They come on just as beautiful. I was worried about ordering this at first because I did read some of the negative reviews but as soon as I got it and put it on my worries just went away. I&#x27;m so in love. I&#x27;m definitely going to try out some more shany products. I am a cosmetics snob so if the nail polish is just as good as buying the ones from the store than i wonder what their make up is like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this set once before and I have to say, I am thoroughly displeased. The nail polish I received this time was gloopy, slightly dry, and not useable. I threw out the last set for this same reason, but the last set I had for about 4 years before this happened. Makes me feel like this time, the set was old and they sent it to me. Also the nail polish was spilled out of some of the polishes, so i cannot use a lot of them.</li>
            <li> The are great colors, I don&#x27;t think I will have to buy nail polish for years.</li>
            <li> I bought this on Amazon&#x27;s Christmas blowout sale for $20 with free shipping. My wife loves the colors and tells me that the quality is top-notch. Why anyone would try to assemble a set like this with individual purchases is beyond me. Just buy the lot and fill in where you need them. I highly recommend this set for anyone building or adding to their current collection.</li>
            <li> nail polish chips after a day even with top coat.. but for a dollar a piece is a good deal for fun polishing for teens</li>
            <li> I bought this as a christmas present for my 13 yr old - she loves it!  The colors are just as bright as they appear here. Goes on well, etc. Normal sized bottles.</li>
            <li> I received this set last week and have given myself and my daughter two manicures so far.  The colors are bright and varied.  We&#x27;ve chosen different colors and we have been happy with the result.  The paint goes on smooth and thick so once is enough for a good coat.  It does chip if you don&#x27;t put a clear coat on top however, which is pretty normal for nail polish.  They dry quickly, which is a huge plus for me as I have trouble sitting still for long periods.  Overall, really very happy with this purchase.  Looking into their nail art collection next.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good deal for a lot of different colors of nail polish. This might be a good buy for someone who likes to do nail art or changes their nail color often. I like many of the colors, although there are a few I don&#x27;t love-- however, as one might expect from the price, the quality is fairly patchy. I applied the dark blue as soon as I received the set and it was chipping off as soon as it dried. By noon the next day, it was about 75% gone. To contrast, the second color I tried (the awesome 80&#x27;s teal) has lasted six days and is only now starting to chip. Some colors require multiple coats, some don&#x27;t. If you&#x27;re looking for polish you can apply and leave on for long periods of time without applying a topcoat, this probably isn&#x27;t for you. If you want some fun colors and a bunch of variety to add to your collection without costing a fortune, though, it&#x27;s a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> As a counselor for a college, I use this product for relaxation/spa days at my campus.  The students love these days and they especially love pamerping themselves with these great colors! One negative is the color does not stay on for more than a day. We just added a top coat and it seems to have helped keep the color fresh.</li>
            <li> Bad investment,  Polish is horrible and chips instantly! HATE IT!</li>
            <li> these colors are so pretty....</li>
            <li> Just as we expected. Beautiful colors,  fast delivery. Love it</li>
            <li> If your looking for more bang for your $$buck Shany Cosmetics is the way to go. Nails is my thing. I do hair as well, but I prefer nails. I know nail polish. I tried out most of the colors on sample designs I&#x27;ve made. It&#x27;s good for overall color as well as nail art. It stripes well. It&#x27;s not too thick or clumpy or dried out. It&#x27;s the perfect consistency. It dries fairly quick. This is the perfect set of colors. It has your very popular neon colors. Shiny colors. Solid everyday colors. Your white and black. All different pinks. I initially thought before I ordered this product that since it was so affordable, that it would come and be crappy product. I was amazed when I received it &amp; started trying the different colors out, that the product was professional grade. I&#x27;ve bought nail polishes for a fourth of the cost of this product for one 2oz bottle and it ended up being really crappy polish, but Shany Cosmetics has me blown out of the water. I also ordered the 32 Watt UV lamp. the bulbs are easy to place in &amp; it cures my gel sets perfectly :) I may have found my new cosmetics supplier. I just need to try out their makeup palette&#x27;s now that I know their product is affordable but not cheap or crappy.</li>
            <li> This was a nice variety of colors for the price and made a great gift. It was packaged very nicely too. The only negative is the strong smell, which is apparent before you even open the box.</li>
            <li> Great deal for the price, however it does chip after a couple of days even when using china glaze topcoat. I am grateful to have a bazillion colors to choose from and share with family and friends! It came well packaged too. All the colors expected came.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t written many reviews, but I wanted to this time.  I had some good and some bad issues with this order.  But ultimately the good outweighed the bad and I&#x27;m really glad I ordered it.  The bad is that I ended up getting 2 sets of the exact same colors.  The description given for them did not make it clear what colors I was getting.  I thought I was getting 2 separate sets of colors, but ended up with just different size bottles of the same color.  Another bad was that the very first bottle I picked up to use had apparently not been closed well, and I almost couldn&#x27;t get the lid off because of polish that had leaked out and sealed the lid on.  But I finally did get the lid off.  The polish was very clumpy.  I put the lid back on and tried to vigorously shake the bottle so that it would mix back up and as I was shaking the outer lid came off and the bottle of polish flew across my room and hit the wall.  Thankfully there was an inner lid so no polish came out.  The polish was still clumpy and even with 2 coats, it didn&#x27;t look good and had a very dull finish.  But since then, I&#x27;ve tried 2 more bottles of color and they were just what I was expecting -- smooth, covered well with only one coat, and great color!!  My recommendation would be to better describe the colors in each of these sets of polish.  Although my niece is quite happy that I made this mistake as she got a lovely set of polish!!!  :-)</li>
            <li> The packaging was nice.  The colors are as vibrant in person as they look on the site; however, I haven&#x27;t used any of them and won&#x27;t do so until 45 days for my teen birthday party.  I can&#x27;t speak of quality yet.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item on August 10, 2014 and got it August 12,2014 very quick delivery. when I got it I was very excited to use them, they are all very nice colors. I am  completely satisfied with my purchase the only little problem is the pinks are a bit too watery but they&#x27;re still very pretty.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love these. They take very long to dry (sometimes 10+ minutes for a coat), chip after a day (even with a base/top coat), and a few of the bottles dried up really quickly. I&#x27;m incredibly bummed that I cannot get my money back, and I will not be buying Shany products anymore.</li>
            <li> I have long been looking for an assortment of nail polish that covers smoothly and is easy to work with. This is it :) I love all the colors... the only thing I would recommend is to put the color names on the bottle. I have two different reds in this set that look so close that I had to test them out on two fingers and put them in various different lighting to figure out if they were different and/or which one I wanted to use.</li>
            <li> These nail polishes were amazing! They are full size nice and sturdy bottles! The colors are true to the picture you see!!! Although the darker color like the dark green and dark purple aren&#x27;t super dark like it looks but their still lovely colors!&lt;br /&gt;And sooooooo much better than buying $3.99 per bottle at Walgreens or Target! You get them for $1 for the same quality!!!&lt;br /&gt;It came in a great boxes and stand where they are stored fresh and organized, I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I barely got my set in and I&#x27;m already thinking about repurchasing with the brushes too for nail art!</li>
            <li> This nail polish looks professional when applied.  I highly recommend this product.  I will definitely purchase from this sight again.</li>
            <li> I was looking for some cheap and variety of nail polish colors that I could use to test out designs and wear for only a few days. This nail polish suffices that but it isn&#x27;t anything special. I like the wide variety of colors however some of the colors kind of repeat, such as there are two yellow and two light pinks which look like they are almost exactly the same colors. I would have prefer a very deep red along with a sparkly red. Some of the colors go on nicer and thicker than others where are some go on very thin, either way you need two coats as you do for most nail polishes. Some of the polishes are also a bit watery-er than I would have liked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing about this polish that is an absolute necessity is using a high quality base coat and top coat. One should always use these when painting their nails but it&#x27;s particularly necessary for these. O.P.I makes a fantastic base coat and Seche makes a great top coat. Both are available here on amazon and I highly recommend them. A base coat protects your natural nail but importantly with these polishes it allows the coat to go on more smoothly. Without a base coat the polish just looks so lump and does not go on smoothly. The polish also has a matte finish which is where is you need a nice top coat (two coats of a top coat).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one other thing I&#x27;m not a huge fan of with these nail polishes is the fast drying aspect. Fast drying is always desirable however this polish is too fast drying for it&#x27;s own good. When trying to apply the nail polish sometimes it will dry somewhat while your applying it making it lumpy and stringy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My personal favorite nail polish brand (and what I feel is the best available) is China Glaze. However it is around $6 a bottle and can not be bought in packs. For the very cheap price of these bottles and that they&#x27;re full sized they&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li> The nail polishes are gorgeous!&lt;br /&gt;one of them was broken so it was dried but it was a yellow that I didn&#x27;t really like so I didn&#x27;t mind!&lt;br /&gt;one thing the blue glitter color was a bit thick but with a little of solution it will fix it right up! the quality is good so I&#x27;m happy about it! I loved them and I loved that I could track the package the whoooole time! (:&lt;br /&gt;I got a text when it arrived so I&#x27;m very happy about this product!</li>
            <li> The first time i used this polish it chipped after a day and a half and I had two coats on. This was major chipping! In my sock I found the whole nail polish piece that came off cleanly from one toe. Another time I tried one coat and it was chipping in less than 24 hours. My set&#x27;s quality is poop. Nevertheless, I love the colors and the chance to have my own affordable nail polish.</li>
            <li> the color selection is great! the only problem is that the polish tends of chip off after only a few days.</li>
            <li> Got these as a gift for my wife. The quality was very good and the colors pretty. Knocked one star because we got two of the same color 3 or 4 times in the box.</li>
            <li> I think that this has to be some of the worst nail polish that I have ever used. I paint my nails, and I paint them often- typically every 2-4 days. You don&#x27;t have a choice but to paint your pain your nails every single day with this polish. By noon my nails are all chipping and just look awful. I would never purchase this item again, and I can&#x27;t even get my money back, at least I can re-gift it to someone that I don&#x27;t like very much.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a birthday gift for my niece.  She loved them so much.  Her friends parents have called me wanting to know where I purchased them so they can buy them.  They are really cute.</li>
            <li> A color for every occasion.  My daughter likes it so its all good.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast however, one of my nail polishes was missing and I got a lot of the same colors. I am very disappointed. The Polish is cheap like you could buy at Claire&#x27;s it has no gloss and the bright colors need a white underneath to ever show up. I regret this purchase save your money!!!!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about purchasing this products due to some of the reviews that it has received in the pass, but I ended up purchasing the product anyway because figured it&#x27; was a great deal. When I received my package everything was in order all of the polishes were there and useable. The dark colors only required one coat, the light colors required two. I was very pleased. I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the description very well, and thought these were mini bottles.  Still a great price, so I ordered.  They are full size!  So yay!  The polish goes on smooth, chipping is minimal, about what you&#x27;d expect.  Nothing a top coat won&#x27;t correct.</li>
            <li> They delivered very fast, but one of them is broken and almost emply.</li>
            <li> i love every one of these polish colors! so far all the ones i have tried i have been very satisfied with! they also work really well for stamping plates!!!:)</li>
            <li> -3 stars for quality.  After 12 hours, my daughters nails are nearly completely bare of polish!  This stuff will NOT stay on.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my step-mom who loves painting her nails all sorts of colors. I didn&#x27;t think she&#x27;d like some of the colors, but for the price I figured this was too good to pass up, and any colors she wasn&#x27;t fond of wouldn&#x27;t go to such a terrible waste since we&#x27;d figure out a use for it eventually. A few colors look very similar but are marked differently on the bottom of the bottles and if you look close they are different shades!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She says they dry super fast and she has been using them almost everyday. (It seems like every evening she&#x27;s wiping off her nail polish to try a new color.) I&#x27;d say if you like all the colors save for just a few, go for it anyways! If I had any qualms about this product it&#x27;s that there was a faint sort of chemical smell upon opening the box but no out of the ordinary smell comes from the nail polish itself.</li>
            <li> Theyre just right. Theyre cheap that i cannot have these nail color stays for more than 4 days. Im sad. Too many to choose but cannot use glitter coz it looks like more glue glitter. So thick. But hey. Better than nothing.</li>
            <li> Most nail polishes that I purchase chip off so quickly but the polishes from my cosmopolitan set never disappoints. I am so glad I found such great quality polishes for such a great price!</li>
            <li> I get overwhelmed in the nail polish aisle... this collection has pretty much every color I&#x27;m looking for in one kit.  Definite plus!!</li>
            <li> This set is a lot like Shany&#x27;s nail art set - but for your whole nail! I love Shany products they&#x27;re amazing products for an affordable price. These colors are beautiful, last long, and are easy to clean up. I knocked some over on my boyfriend&#x27;s laptop stand and quickly cleaned it up with a wet cloth then with a dab of polish remover. He said he couldn&#x27;t tell I spilled polish. Big relief for me!</li>
            <li> The best part of this set are the pinks and yellows!! perfect for summer!!! And will not harm your nails!!</li>
            <li> It lasted about a month until it got gooey and dried out</li>
            <li> Wonderful. Many colors come with plastic tray that can be used to store them. They are worth your money.</li>
            <li> The quality of these shany nail polish aren&#x27;t the best and not the worst they smell extremely strong I have to wear a cleaning mask when I use them, may just be only me since I am sensitive to strong chemical smells. A few of the colors were hard to open up because, it looked like there were open and not closed properly(I don&#x27;t understand why they would have been opened in the first place) and also were drying out luckily I have nail polish thinner which helped enough, to try the colors.</li>
            <li> Dried fine for me does take a little longer than others maybe 10 minutes. Awesome colors. Smells really strong I agree! Got the nail art ones too. Same exact colors so that&#x27;s awesome to match up when doing cool designs on other fingers and toes. Thanks. Awesome products!!</li>
            <li> This polish just peels off the clients toes, very Disappointed in this Polish seeing that had to wait on it lil longer than what was promised</li>
            <li> Love all the amazing colors!!! I can do pretty much any design I want!!! Having so much fun deciding what to do each week!!!</li>
            <li> Arrived way before expected shipping arrival, which is great. Packaging was solid and all polishes seemed fine until i took off the plastic wrapping and realized that my #6 color \\&quot;fuscia pink\\&quot; was left partially open somehow and is extremely goopy, might be able to fix with a little polish remover to thin it out but still kind of disappointing because it was my favorite color in the whole set :(</li>
            <li> Received the nail polish yesterday. Well packed and all bottles were perfect. Great colors. My daughter immediately colored her nails.  My daughter said the brushes were fine - not too thin.  I would order this product again.  Good deal and nice variety of colors.</li>
            <li> This product had nail polish that was dried up, empty and broken bottles.  I purchased this for my granddaughter&#x27;s birthday and was disappointed with this&lt;br /&gt;product.</li>
            <li> This set has some lovely colors, and has received good reviews, so I was expecting to have a winner. Not so. Several of the bottles were not tightened properly, so the polish had partially dried and was unusable. Then, for the bottles that were still OK, the glitter ones (I&#x27;ve tried a couple) were so thick as to be almost impossible to use. When I did use one, then tried to remove it, the glitter was so difficult to remove that it took A LOT of effort to get rid of it, including scraping my nails! The matte finish polishes that were not dried up worked well, but they do chip easily and don&#x27;t last long before the chips appear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general I would not purchase this product again. There are just too many better polishes out there to choose from. It should be a good value, but it certainly wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> Got this set for my wife and she instantly loved it. She still hasn&#x27;t used all the colors. If the person using this changes colors often this is right up thier ally</li>
            <li> There are so many nail colors these days and I decided to get the entire set so we could pick from many colors.  A better deal than buying all colors separate.  Fun to have for girls to paint nails for team colors or for holidays. We use it often.</li>
            <li> This is a really fun set of nail polishes, and I loved the idea of getting so many different colors at such a great price. It just turns out that there&#x27;s a reason I always buy red or pink...because that&#x27;s what I wear. I will at least try some of the more unusual shades here, but I really can&#x27;t see myself ever wearing the yellowy-yellow or neon green or black (on any day that isn&#x27;t Halloween).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would make a great gift for a younger teen with more adventurous tastes than I!</li>
            <li> my daughter loved the colors but not the brushes -</li>
            <li> I participated in a secret santa and my person seemed very pleased with this gift so I can say from second hand experience(?) that this is a lovely gift.</li>
            <li> Great variety of colors for every outfit and occasion. Small enough bottles not to get bored with the color. Great for sharing too.</li>
            <li> the polish is cheap and needs at least 2 coats and chips with in first day.</li>
            <li> Got these for my sister-in-law who loves doing her nails.  She let me know that they&#x27;re really good quality and the color selection is excellent.  There were even some glitter colors including, which the desciption didn&#x27;t mention.  There were no colors that were &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34;.  And they were a nice variety of all colors, not just your typical pinks and reds.</li>
            <li> I bought this set specifically for the range of colors and I wanted to try my handle at water marbling. I am not sure if it is the quality of the lacquer itself or the \\&quot;quick dry time\\&quot; but the polish doesn&#x27;t spread out AT ALL in the water, just staying as drops in the middle or eventually sinking to the bottom. I tried all the colors in different temps of water. No luck. So that is a disappointment. That being said, the colors of the polishes are great. They are true to the bottle and rich. The polish is a little thin, so I would definitely recommend three thin coats to cover well.</li>
            <li> This product are really good have great colors the quality is ok too&lt;br /&gt;the only thing is they send to me 2 same color I prefere for sure to have&lt;br /&gt;one of each one colors for have more options but is fast delivery , in&lt;br /&gt;perfect shape and the others colors are fantastic .</li>
            <li> I am very happy with these polishes! The colors are rich and vibrant. Most of the solid colors provide smooth coverage in just one coat. I love the variety of colors and glitters. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love to paint my nails so when I saw this product I HAD to buy. It&#x27;s great quality and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am a nail technician. I bought this set to practice nail art at home. I didn&#x27;t expect much because each polishes are $1 only. Yeah. The quality is really bad. Dark green color is applied smoothly but color itself looks cheap. I tried to pactice white French style but I couldn&#x27;t do anything with it. I tried to fix French lines with a wet brush using polish remover. The polish became sticky like a chewing gum with little bit of polish remover. Tried black color. The brush was too messy so I had to trim with scissors. Still the brush is not straight. I&#x27;ve been trying different ranges of nail products. This is the weirdest nail polish I&#x27;ve ever tried. If you are serious about nail art, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product unless you have kids and want to have fun.</li>
            <li> Great price on a large number of polishes. I&#x27;ve had some issues with the bristles on the brushes coming loose, but the polish goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> ; ) grand daughter loved it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these, even though a few where dried up &#x3D;( you can&#x27;t go wrong with the price. ad you get plenty of colors to pick from very happy</li>
            <li> Colors are terrible and quality is worse. They seemed old upon arrival.</li>
            <li> This product is lovely! Package came in as expected and the presentation was well preserved to prevent cracking/damage. All the colors are labeled 1-24 on the bottom of the bottle to ensure none are duplicates. All the colors are set accordingly. I&#x27;ve only tried 2 colors so far (red and gold sparkle) and they glide on the nail just fine. I did notice that the colors takes a while to air dry but that&#x27;s okay- I have nail drops by OPI to quick dry them and also a nail drier so time isn&#x27;t a factor to deter myself from enjoying this playful color set. Very pleased and would buy future products from again. Also, I think some people complain about drying time is because they don&#x27;t allow the coats to set before applying another coat. The lighter the color the more coats you&#x27;ll end up needing to get the same color on the bottle (that&#x27;s with every polish). As long as you allow it to set you&#x27;ll be fine. This is a Matte finish so be prepared to use a glossy top coat and buff to get that high gloss shine,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Jill (using my fiancÃ©s amazon prime account)</li>
            <li> I really love the colors of the nail polish. It came in a nice sturdy box that can be left in for storage. Shipping was super, super fast. But, the nail polish is too thick and does not dry properly. I used the nail polish once and did not like how it felt. never used it again until this week 10/01/13 just to try it and it felt the same way.. waste of my money.. sad because when you look at the product it looks amazing but, the nail polish it self I was NOT happy with.</li>
            <li> Ichose 5 star ,love the nail polish color and shine.Would really recommend it to my friends and family.nails are so pretty</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and packaged well. I have not tried many of the colors yet as I don&#x27;t get to wear nail polish that often. All the bottles do seem to be in great shape and just fine. So for the cost I like it so far. The only bad I have found is that it is a real pain to get off your nails. It seemed like my nail polish remover hardly put a dent in the coat.</li>
            <li> I had so much fun with these polishes!!  They are great.  I can&#x27;t wait until my grandgirls see them.  They are normal size bottles, easy to open and such fun colors.  They go on your nails easily and stay on.  Some chipped a little after a few days but you can fix that easily.  Love them!  I was going to put a picture on here but there is nowhere to add an attachment.  I colored every nail a different color!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get 24 flashy nail colors for such a good price. But apparently the price WAS infact too good to be true. When I first started applying the nail polish it was streaky and didnt cover well. It takes forever to dry and chipped before the next morning. I had never heard of SHANY brand before and thought it was woth a shot. But now I can say I&#x27;ve learned my lesson and wont be buying any more of their products. Save your money and buy something that is better quality.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this product. the bottles are full size and true to color. It was delivered to me pretty quickly and comes with a cute packaging. It covers with one coat but if you like it darker you can paint over it again if you like it glossy i recommend putting a clear coat on it because some of them turn out matte. i love the colors and the fast shipping i will buy more products from this company in the future. very happy</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use with my nail image plates. Basically, I can admit, I was being a bit cheap because I didn&#x27;t want to buy nail art polish for something I was just trying for the first time. So, I bought this set. As my subject line suggests, some colors are awesome, some not so much. And this is not based on the fact that I was trying to stamp with them, as most were for base colors only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The neon colors yellow, pink, and green were very thin. God forbids you put layers and layers of these on your nails, because the wait time for them to dry is ridiculous. It was equally crazy with just one coat of them. The glittery colors like gold and silver are very sheer. These may be better as an accent on top of another color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best colors for me were the HD like colors: blue, green, dark purple. And regular colors, black, orange, and white were also delightful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I cannot complain given the amount of polish I got for the price. I can also stamp with the thicker colors ( I am so happy about that). The quality is good; there&#x27;s room for improvement there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this to someone? It would depend on the purpose of the polish for that person. If you just want something to use to play with your nails a bit, sure, try this brand. You get plenty of colors in this set to do that activity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a nut for rapid dry, one coat quality, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> The colors are so beautiful and they&#x27;re exactly like the bottle when applied. It dries fast. Easy to remove with a nail polish remover and doesn&#x27;t leave stains. I gave it 4 stars because after a few months it went &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; it became sorta sticky and cant use it anymore.</li>
            <li> Amazing color and the it has nice luster no need to apply topcoat on it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a gift and when I received it, one of the nail polishes was broken and was all over the other ones. One bottle was completely dried up and when I tried to return it , amazon&#x27;s return policy doesn&#x27;t allow me to return it because it is considered as a flammable liquid.</li>
            <li> Works well. We are very satisfied with the pricing of this product also!</li>
            <li> The polish was very clumpy... I had to buy polish thinner to try and fix this problem.... It was packaged pretty but seems to be old polish cause even the thinner did not work well</li>
            <li> My nails get a different color daily. I love it, my 12 year old daughter does also. As soon as i run out I will order more.</li>
            <li> I was pleased at the packaging! The polish came in a box that hold all the polish in place that makes it easy to store.&lt;br /&gt;The polish is salon grade and works great!</li>
            <li> I read some negative reviews and was afraid to order because of the no return policy, but I ordered any way and relieved my order in tact.  I loved the colors but they do chip quickly.</li>
            <li> lots of polish for the money. goes on good. last long time. very good product. nice varity of colors r</li>
            <li> as soon as I saw this I wanted it I did not hesitate to order... I am impressed by all the colors.. I will use all these colors... I was very happy with the packaging... the polish is perfect with flawless coverage did not have to use multiple coats</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t sure is this would be worth it. It is. Had to play right away. My daughter and I are trying our hands at nail art. This polish goes on smooth, covers well, does not bleed or streak when colors are layered &amp; dries fast. I can chip my polish with out moving. After working in the yard it is still perfect. It was also delivered quickly &amp; in perfect condition. Love the holder too.</li>
            <li> I love this set.  It brings a variety of colors, and it is so well packed I was amazed!  I just love it and will probably buy again!!</li>
            <li> more than I expected  I kept the light colors and my kid got the darks we shared  the quality is good,,,i really like getting a whole bunch AT ONCE....</li>
            <li> Three of the bottles had leaked and spilled. It was not that big of a deal, given the number that you get for the price. I will say that it takes a long time to try and it stays tacky for a long while. The polish seems to dry like a film. If you do not seal it, you can simply peel it off your nails. In the end, you get a lot and if you use something like Seche Vete. You will be fine.</li>
            <li> These were the perfect gift for a bridal shower I hosted. I was worried that the quality would be bad, or that they would break during shipping but they arrived perfectly intact, none were dried out and everyone loved it....</li>
            <li> I am very happy with these polishes! The colors are rich and vibrant. Most of the solid colors provide smooth coverage in just one coat. I love the variety of colors and glitters. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Great quality, color variety, wonderful finish, and an affordable price. Quality: Put one coat and your done. Colors: Picture says it all. Finish: Not gloopy and fine smooth finish. Price: One bottle &#x3D; $1.25 can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> I love this set. This is a great deal and it has a lot of variety. The colors are so bright a beautiful!</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with the packaging of the nail polish. There were no leaks and the colors looked great. The color variety was good for the price. It also shipped quickly. However, there are a few complaints I have about the polish. The polish doesn&#x27;t spread easily onto the nails. It solidifies really quickly so I had trouble creating even coats. Unless you are really fast at covering your nails, it&#x27;s fairly difficult. I am a first time nail decorator, so I&#x27;m not very good at it yet. Also, they aren&#x27;t very good stamping polishes. My last complaint is that it is fairly thick and its not easy to touch-up spots without it sticking out. However, adding a little nail polish remover thinned it out well.</li>
            <li> for the price they work great. I love all the different colors and my kids enjoy painting their nails. I would recommend this product to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> 24 different polishes for the price is amazing.  Gave them as gifts at a baby shower.  I haven&#x27;t heard from anyone regarding the quality.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised these are full size nail polish bottles and lots of colors. Got this for my daughters princess makeover party and I am very excited!</li>
            <li> I use these with the Butter London Patent Gel set and it works fine for me. Takes about two coats and will chip after wear. Good buy all in all when starting a collection!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to find such a great range of colors and hoped the quality would be as good as some other reviews... unfortunately, it was not.&lt;br /&gt;The colors look like they would be great- but many of them were dried out due to the caps being loose or just being old!&lt;br /&gt;It looks like you get what you pay for :(</li>
            <li> I was torn on whether or not to give these polishes a 3 or 4 star rating. I&#x27;m very happy with the colors (even the neon yellow, as it can still be used for nail art, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it on my whole nail), but the quality of the actual polish is why I&#x27;m a little up in the air about the star rating. They aren&#x27;t horrible, by any means, but they&#x27;re not great either. I haven&#x27;t used all of the colors yet, but some of the polishes I did apply to my entire nail went on a little streaky (thinner in some parts, thicker in others), and absolutely require more than one coat - which cuts down on the dry time, which is a big bummer for me. I love having nice nails, but I really don&#x27;t like waiting much longer than 15 minutes max. for the polish to be completely dry. These took far longer than that simply because I put two coats on, pretty thick, in order to avoid streaking. That said, I do think these would be excellent polishes for nail art (which I&#x27;m getting into lately), and good for your whole nail if you&#x27;re patient and willing to wait for dry time if you want a pretty bold color. I&#x27;m sure one coat would dry quickly, but the color wouldn&#x27;t be nearly as noticeable that way. I should also add that when I received these in the mail, it was a pretty hot day, so when I opened the package the bottles of polish were very warm to the touch - which I&#x27;m sure can probably diminish the quality of the polish. If other people don&#x27;t have streaking issues, mine could simply be because of the hot weather, so if you do decide to purchase these, try to wait for a mild weather period. Other than what I&#x27;ve said so far, the packaging was great; the plastic tray prevents the bottles from breaking during their trip and also stops any leakage from occurring. To reiterate: Very nice choice for nail art, but not necessarily the best choice if you&#x27;re interested in painting your entire nail (unless it had something to do with the very hot weather when I ordered).</li>
            <li> Two words:God Awful. Goes on streaky, matte finish, and chips like nobody&#x27;s business. After one day of wear it looked like I had month old polish on.  AND IT&#x27;S NON-REFUNDABLE/NON-RETURNABLE!  Awesome.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item to paint my little girl&#x27;s nails. At four this is so perfect for her. All the different colors its great. I will buy this item again if its still available by the time we run out.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging was also excellent. No bottles were damaged or leaked. It came in a little box with a neat little display case.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for this perfect product and quick shipping. I will be purchasing again from Amazon..I so love it. Thanks..</li>
            <li> I chose a five star rating because this set really stunned me. It has the cutest colors! There are plenty colors to choose from. The packaged arrive quickly. It was packaged neatly and sturdy. No broken bottles, a nice try to keep all the little bottles neat. I don&#x27;t want to share my polish but I would definitely recommend this product from SHANY Cosmetics. It is well worth it!</li>
            <li> great nail polishes took 3 days and they last a long time and nail polishes don&#x27;t dry out.(in the bottle)&lt;br /&gt;dry fast on nails and last about 3 weeks cause my mom clean houses and they last her 3 weeks good product so good money spend</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a great variety of colors! Have you ever wanted to do a special design on your fingers but never knew how? Well the tools that you can buy with Shany Cosmetics allow you to! The dotter tools and the colorful tape work magically! Love it so much!</li>
            <li> Fair value for the price. Good selection.</li>
            <li> The nail polish had some great colors but a few of the colors were half empty and dried up. Not really worth the hassle of returning for two bottles.</li>
            <li> This set contains vibrant colors with perfect consistency! The size of the application brush affords ease of use and the variety of colors are certain to please everyone. The polish stays on until you decide to take it off. I use in conjunction with the Shany Nail Art Set (24 colors), and I am constantly changing the patterns to match my outfits. The polish is not too harsh for nails, or drying, therefore my nails are still growing strong and healthy. I do nail art for my family and friends, people always ask where I go , I always smile and say Shany Polish and Shany Nail Art! Easy to use and wonderful to show off nails! The selection of colors in this set are varied &amp; vibrant! I received as a gift and I have been playing with the colors and designs ever since! Thank You!</li>
            <li> Bought it for the girlfriend &amp; she loves it theres a mix &amp; match combination to go with every outfit &amp; shoes.......there is ALOT! of shoes.</li>
            <li> I only received 16 colors .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9 out of the 24 are hot pink color #04.  Missing color numbers are 05, 11, 12, 15, 16, 22, 23, &amp; 24.  Packaging is very nice, but didn&#x27;t get quite the deal I thought I was getting .  Non- returnable .</li>
            <li> I was very surprised when I saw this full size 24 piece nail polish set for such a great price. The colors are great and the polish is as good as any other of the more expensive ones. I think I am going to order the eyeshadow palette next!</li>
            <li> I have recently started to organize my nail polishes and realized I didn&#x27;t have a few vital colors. After looking around Amazon, and finding out that other polishes are about $8 each, I got thoroughly frustrated. Then I stumbled across the collection from Shany and to quote Joey Lawrence \\&quot;whoa\\&quot;! First of all, the colors are so fabulous and vibrant and secondly, the company shipped everything so fast and ensured that the package had no chance of being damaged. Love this company and will continue to support them!</li>
            <li> Love the colors! But I hate that the nail polish starts chipping right away. You also have to coat the nail polish a couple of times to get the color that it actually is.</li>
            <li> Great colors and price the only problem I had with this product is some of the lighter colors and pretty much all the dark colors gooey so it&#x27;s had to paint them.</li>
            <li> Lightning fast shipping!! Regular size bottle of fabulous colors for summer. Some colors only need one coat so that&#x27;s nice. My daughter and I will have a lot of fun with these.</li>
            <li> So, I received this product and was very happy with it. The only problem that I did have with it was that there were too many boxes. Maybe that can be changed into different packaging because it is wasteful.</li>
            <li> Love the variety, and this product is a great value at such a great price. I am going to try this out with the SHANY stamp sets</li>
            <li> This polish is very thick and cheap. You can see the brush lines and it doesn&#x27;t flow well, and in a few they were so old they were dried and cracked. Very disgusted and ended up throwing it away. I could only salvage a few colors, not worth it.</li>
            <li> I love the color selection in this set and when you consider how many you get in one box, you can&#x27;t beat the price. The darker matte colors go on more thickly than the frosts/pearls and some of the lighter colors. The only one I was really disappointed in was the neon green/yellow - even after several coats, it was still pretty sheer, so I have to use a base coat if I want to avoid streaks. Worth it since it&#x27;s a gorgeous color and all of the others are great, so I would recommend this set (and I already have) to my friends.</li>
            <li> Ordered these because of the price. Arrived to me right on time. No broken bottles, and although I have not checked every bottle, none of them seem to be dried out. What I will say though, is that they are not one coat (or two) colors. In order for the neon colors to show true, I had to coat my daughter&#x27;s nails with white polish first and then use the neon color over it. The darker colors seem very thin as well. Also, the colors dry to a matte finish, so unless you like matte, or intend to use a gloosy topcoat, these are not the polishes for you. All in all, decent product for the price, but definitely not high quality polishes.</li>
            <li> Awful nail polish. Half of them came dried up. The other half was all stuck together inside the bottle. Definitely a wast of money!!! Do not buy!!!!</li>
            <li> I order my nail polish late Friday evening and I it arrived on Tuesday. The packaging was well intact.There was no spills and my nail polish wasn&#x27;t dried up. I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this out. I used hot pink on my toes and Barbie pink on my nails. One coat is all you need for this product .Absolutely love it I well be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Purchased to use for a spa party and were pleased with the assortment of colors. The girls had fun and by having such a large assortment they all could be different.</li>
            <li> Colors look nice, however they are not thick, nail technician had to put something in it to give it a little body, however, they are not returnable, so will make the best of them. For the price it is good, just be prepared to use more than two coats</li>
            <li> I am just getting into nail art, but I have been painting my nails for the better part of 25 years.  This is a really awesome way to bulk up your stash for a house full of nail painters or nail artists.  I love most of these polishes.  *Most* of them have great coverage, and they are all really great colors.  I found the yellows to be a little thin.  None of mine were dried out, or even thick.  I think I did receive 2 of the same color, and did not receive one, but it was red so I&#x27;m not hurting for it.  All in all, this is a good buy and I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m going to buy the other sets.</li>
            <li> For the price I really didn&#x27;t expect the quality or the vibrant colors.  They came in the perfect box to keep them neat and ready.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This really is a great nail polish set!! I love how all the colors go on in their true color with only one coat! Doesnt chip very easily with a good base/top coat. I love how it dries really fast! i hate waiting forever for my nail polish to dry! The reason i took away one star is because when i first got these i opened each bottle to just check them out, and some of them had chunks of nail polish dried up on the side, making the bottle a bit hard to open. And when i opened a few of them, the brush stayed inside of the bottle!!!! I had to get my hands all dirtyed up with nail polish in order to jam it back into place. Even so they still fall off. Those are some i can&#x27;t really use anymore. Other than that the polish is very good quality and are all very good colors!! Very good for nail art if you have nail art brushes! ^_^ I hope you get these! Very nice!!</li>
            <li> This nail polish set is absolutely awesome! The neon yellow looking color is exactly like a highlighter yellow, after 2 coats it looks sweet! Some polishes might take more than one coat but it is totally worth it! The packaging was very good. It came in 4 boxes and none were broken or spilled! I was very happy about this product! 24 polishes for only $25? Can&#x27;t beat that! They rock! I definitely want to try and find the other sets from SHANY. I love it!</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this purchase - and never would have done it if I didn&#x27;t have a gift certificate, I just wouldn&#x27;t plunk down the cash for an unknown brand of this many polishes- but this is totally worth it. There is only one color I don&#x27;t like (the burnt orange) and even so, I think it will work for nail art at Halloween. The packaging was excellent - I can&#x27;t imagine how these could break. Only one of the bottles had leaked a bit and the polish thickened - but some nail polish thinner will straighten it out. I tested out all of these polishes on sample nails. Excellent coverage - the black and white, which is where most brands show their weak spots, are great quality. It has a little bit of everything: metallic shimmers, 5 glitters, some pastels, some creams, even a couple neons. I think these will even work for stamping.</li>
            <li> Even after reading mostly great reviews, I was a bit skeptical...but after receiving and trying them, I LOVE them!  The bottles were all intact, no leaking or breaking, and came in a cute box that I may continue to use.  The color selection is as shown, and I love most of them.  I always apply a base coat, 2 color coats, and a top coat.  The first coat of this polish is pretty rich/thick so I almost didn&#x27;t need a second coat on some of my nails.  The colors are a bit matte so I used a glossy top coat and my nails look great! I&#x27;ve tried 5 colors so far and am anxious to try more.  It will take me awhile to go through these, but I will buy them again when the time comes.....and am thinking this would make an amazing Christmas gift!  This package will not disappoint, you will love it!</li>
            <li> the color variety is great! The only problem I have with this product is that it takes the polish a long time to dry.</li>
            <li> Very very pretty and vibrant colors, just a little stringy and some of the caps and brushes would not stay together. It&#x27;s fun for a first time set for younger people</li>
            <li> I was so excited to give this gift to my daughter for her birthday.  When I painted her toenails tonight, the polish wasn&#x27;t dry after 20 min. Meaning the polish was old.  I was going to send it back and I find out that you can&#x27;t return this product since it&#x27;s hazardous and I can&#x27;t seem to find a link for a refund.  Don&#x27;t take a chance on wasting $30.00.</li>
            <li> Full size bottles of amazing colors. I bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas. She loved it.  She and my daughter headed straight for the bedroom to put on.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this nail polish collection (SHANY Cosmetics The Cosmopolitan Nail Polish Set 24 Colors) since it comes with all sorts of colors and is very reasonably priced.  After using this for less than 6 months, the nail polishes chip away within hours after use.  I had to throw them in the garbage because almost immediately after applying they would chip all over the place leaving a trail of nail polish every where I went.  I thought maybe the issue was that I was not using a base or top coat, so I purchased premium quality base/ top coats &amp; tried applying the nail polish that way- no change whatsoever.  The nail polishes are a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> We bought this as a Christmas gift for one of our granddaughters who had requested it.  She was very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Very upset. I ordered this over two weeks ago and it still hasnt arrived. The seller needs to do a much better job managing shipping. It was supossed to arrive by three days ago and I haven&#x27;t seen a sign of it.  Rating may go up when I actually get to try the polishes but for now the seller doesn&#x27;t deserve a higher rating.</li>
            <li> I just received my polishes. The colors are so beautiful. I&#x27;m starting my business, and this is the perfect addition to my polishes.  It adds a great variety of beautiful colors for my clients to choose from:))</li>
            <li> you buy 24 colors for 24 dollars knowing that makes each one a dollar value nail polish so i got what i expected. it is fun to have lots of colors to use and they do chip after a couple of days but then you just change your color!</li>
            <li> I like the idea that I have all the colors that I want ,it&#x27;s pretty cool and nice to have ...this will last me for a long time .....yes I will tell a friend about this product</li>
            <li> I have yet to be disappointed by Shany Cosmetics, this set came packaged perfectly with no issues. Each color was perfect and in working order, I am thinking of buying more for gifts.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift and got it on lightening deal, boy was I impressed!  It looks like its professional status and I have already heard from the person I bought this for that she loves it and its amazing quality.  Looks amazing in person too, much better than the pictures.  If you&#x27;re looking for a good set of polish, this is it!  I would pay full price for this, well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughters because they love for me to paint their nails. So many wonderful colors to choose from!  It also contains my favorite color - sapphire! It&#x27;s a very rich color and consistency.</li>
            <li> My teen daughter Loves them! I haven&#x27;t used them but she said that the quality of the polish is great. Great price and colors!</li>
            <li> One of the bottles had no bristles on the brush, I had to clean an old one off and use it instead-</li>
            <li> I guess i was satisfied with this purchase... the polishes weren&#x27;t by any means AMAZING but they weren&#x27;t terrible either. One of the red polishes was damaged and dried up when i opened the package but other than that, everything was good. There is a good variety of colors and glitters and there are alot of pink! Some look exactly the same until you actually put it on and see the small difference. One coat isn&#x27;t quite enough for your nail but two coats takes hours to dry. But as a plus, the polish comes off easily with nail polish remover unlike some other brands. All in all, this was an okay purchase especially for the small price you have to pay! I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and the quality but its really thick. It doesn&#x27;t make a good polish for designing and things.</li>
            <li> Very vibrant colors - goes on smooth not chunky. Color selection was better then I thought. Although it takes a few minutes to dry, and if you don&#x27;t dip it every couple of seconds it starts to get a little clumpy.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and intact! Beautiful bright colors!</li>
            <li> I bought this set of Nail polish as a gift for my niece and was so pleased with it upon arrival that I bought two more sets! Beautiful colors and full sized bottles for a great price!</li>
            <li> I love nail polish. Mine arrived quick and intact. Quickly did me and my daughters nails. Did my rottweilers nails too! Highly recommend. I will buy again</li>
            <li> The colors are BEAUTIFUL.I love using these nail polishes on my nails.They dry very quickly so I can tend to my childern afterwards.I also use them on my four year old because you know haow they can get a little  impatient sometimes.</li>
            <li> I recieved the nailpolish in a sealed package but when I opened it and tried to use the light purple, it was empty. One of the containers (light blue) had broken too and spilled everywhere. Other than that I love the colors and this product!</li>
            <li> This set is amazzzzzing! So many colors to choose from - and they are all so pigmented! These go on smoothly and last for days. This set is perfection!</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a great price for all the colors you get. You could have a different color for ever season or almost everday of the month. I would try them and see if you like them as much as i do.</li>
            <li> These colors are opague on the first coat, and last a long time. I am very impressed with the nail polish set. Although, I feel like the yellows are a little too close in color. Other than that, they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li> The packaging itself was impressive, comes in a nice display. The nailpolish itself is horrible, gooey and easily scratched off even after thorough drying time. Reminds me of kids peel off paint.</li>
            <li> I got this set for Christmas and was worried since it&#x27;s not a brand I&#x27;ve used. But after trying it, I am very pleased with the outcome! I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my teen.  She loves it!  It was exactly what I was looking for!  Excellent price and the colors are excellent.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.  The colors are pretty and the price was cheap, after 30 minutes of drying, you could scrape it off your nails, because it never harden.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughter-in-law.  She loves to do her nails.  Now she can do them for quite some time and all different colors.  She loved the gift.  Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Would recomend to everyone! I love the color varieties. I usually buy essie but these polishes are just as great :-)</li>
            <li> I researched through amazon for a set of nail polish that had very good feedback from other customers. I have never used this brand until I received this set. I paint my nails twice a week (because I love doing different colors and such.) I could not be more pleased. Package arrived on time and packaged very well. The colors were amazing.They came in a separate box, which I love because now I do not have to find a container to store them in. I would not only buy this product in the future but I would recommend it to anyone who would listen :-)</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift for Christmas and I have been very pleased with it. The array of colors is wide and fun to mix and match. I opened all the bottles to check the condition and, except for 2, they were perfect. The green glitter (15) and burnt sienna (23) were gooped around the rim and a good bit seemed to be missing from the glitter green. A little clean up with acetone and all are good as new.</li>
            <li> Reviews@SanyCosmetics.com this was great i loved this product hope to get free samples get shany products!!!! Loved it so much!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The child I bought this for just loves it. She is handicapped and her nurse paints her nails once a week. She was thrilled with all the colors.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my daughter at Christmas time.  I was very happy with the quality, price and packaging.  I would purchase from them again.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I received the polishes and immediately noticed that one of them was dried up.  When I removed the protective&lt;br /&gt;plastic wrap and went to lift that bottle out, it was slightly opened, which is probably why it dried up.  I&lt;br /&gt;see that there is no way to return this product.  My daughter and I are disappointed that we won&#x27;t be able to&lt;br /&gt;try this very vibrant yellow color.  Wish there was a way to at least return the one bottle and get a usable&lt;br /&gt;replacement.</li>
            <li> I was waiting for this nail polish set for a very long time. I can say for your credit that I received the package earlier then I imagined.&lt;br /&gt;I red few of the reviews and I knew I should buy them. When I opened the box I found out that few of the nail polish are dried. I bought 2 sets of the nail polish, one for my friend as a present but Im too embaressed to give it to her this way. When I checked them 1by1 I discovered that MOST of them are dried. so disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the colors are not at all what it looks like at the pictures.&lt;br /&gt;Im no longer buying from \\&quot;SHANY cosmetics\\&quot;, once Im disappointed, I beleive I will always do.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend purchasing this product. The polish was dried out and could not be used. I would never purchase this again and wish I had never purchased it.</li>
            <li> Great selection of colors but the nail polish is a very thin liquid</li>
            <li> I ordered this set of 24 nail polishes specifically because they had the normal nail polish brush with them.  i purchased the shany 48 piece nail art set and had a time with \\&quot;base colors\\&quot; that i could paint art on top of them.  this completed my set.  I now have about 100 colors(some very similar, but some very different) and all of my artistic talents (or lack thereof depending on who you ask) can definitely be displayed proudly on my fingers!  i&#x27;m not one to go \\&quot;all out\\&quot; or \\&quot;wild and crazy\\&quot; but this allows me to express myself and the total cost for everything i purchased is definitely budget friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy the prompt shipment and I also enjoy the colors that were sent.  Shany is a great product i&#x27;ve trusted for a while now.  It&#x27;s not low-odor, but neither are more expensive brands.  I&#x27;m completely satisfied with all of the products i have purchased before and I this is 100% recommended by me to my friends, family, and coworkers!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely order from the company again, as the customer services was friendly, fast, and i received my package of nail polishes unbroken and relatively quickly.  The arrival date was the first of my \\&quot;estimated delivery days\\&quot; and I was very pleased!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend again and will work with this company again in the future! great purchase and at a great price!</li>
            <li> Colors are very Spring and Summer seasoned.&lt;br /&gt;They take for ever to dry too!&lt;br /&gt;I like the colors tho, they&#x27;re very bright and different.&lt;br /&gt;And you&#x27;re pretty much paying just a little over $1 for each; can&#x27;t go wrong with that here. The actual dollar store nail polishes are very watery, these are pretty thick which makes one coat of color a sufficient amount most of the time.</li>
            <li> I love these nails polishes for the first 3 days after applying a color but after that is peels off in strips. It goes on nice, even and thick. I dont know if there is a trick to get the nail polish to stay on for longer but if there is I want to know it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind the peeling, all the colors are beautiful and they really do apply great.</li>
            <li> I received the package with broken bottles and nail polish everywhere. I wanted to return it, but apparently I can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This product arrived in Perfect condition with no bottles broken or spilled. None of my colors were dried out at all! I seriously think this is my new favorite nail polish! Not only because of the price, but the quality as well. Have been wearing the true red color on my nails forr nearly a week now with no chipping at all! Love these!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my sister for her birthday. She LOVES to paint her nails! However, upon opening the package, we noticed that there was a bottle that was only 1/3 full and dried out. It was one of the prettier purple colors, which happens to be her favorite color.  It was dried out and had a sticker with the number 13 on it. None of the other bottles had this issue nor did they have a sticker. Other than this, the product seems okay and the rest of the bottles are filled completely and not dried out. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try out the colors on her just yet, but plan to soon I am hoping that they turn out alright.</li>
            <li> My roommate and I collect nail polish, so we decided to try this set. We are in love! Great value for the price. Classy packaging and a quality product. We will soon be purchasing the nail art kit.</li>
            <li> Great vibrant colors. Gets sticky after a while though.</li>
            <li> I like this set when it comes to colours - they are really vivid and bright. It&#x27;s also versy cheap. But I don&#x27;t recommend it if you are looking for something long-lasting -  the quality is rather low and polish rips off after one day. Also one polish bottle from my set was broken.</li>
            <li> One of the bottles was cracked!</li>
            <li> Ok, so I&#x27;m typing this having literally just screwed the cap on the last bottle and here are the facts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Yes, it&#x27;s a thin viscosity. Yes, you will likely have to use 3-4 layers. However, this is outweighed by the even spreading of the polish and the fact that it is still lightweight (aka, doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;build up\\&quot; on the nail).&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s probably one of the quickest drying polishes I&#x27;ve ever used (hence why I&#x27;m already typing this review) despite the extra layers needed.&lt;br /&gt;3. There&#x27;s so many choices! What&#x27;s not to love about a kaleidoscope of color for this price?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, two thumbs way up and I can&#x27;t wait to get more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Edit** (after further use, and from 5 to 4 stars)&lt;br /&gt;So after using the product for a while, I find it interesting that each color seems to act differently. Some don&#x27;t need as many layers for full color...for those that you need more layers, some colors will build up on the nail causing that puffy look and others won&#x27;t...it just depends, and this means the appearance of each color is unpredictable. There&#x27;s a bit of hit and miss with the consistency of the product, but overall I still stand by the purchase as the price for this many colors is just too good to beat. Plus, point 2 from the first review is still true--quickest drying polish I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I received my nail polish very quick. I will admit after reading some of the reviews about getting broken or dried out bottles I was very hesitant about buying this set. What I received is exactly what I was hoping for though! I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. The colors are very true to what they look like in the bottle &amp; I only had to apply 1 coat (except for the lighter colors like yellow &amp; orange). It takes longer to dry then some nail polish, but other then that it seems like a great brand!</li>
            <li> Impressive color collection, but paint chips in three days or less. Guess I need to paint my nails more often.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased with the nail color.  It dries fast, but is vivid in color.  Some of the colors are glittery, most are not, but ALL are shiny and fresh-looking!  I highly recommend the product!&lt;br /&gt;Also, I called the company for a delivery question &amp; received an immediate call-back to the message I left.  Michelle answered my questions, was very courteous and helpful! Great customer service!</li>
            <li> I just received my package today, and I am really excited!  The package came protected and sealed very well.  I will update a another review when I use this polish.  Nonetheless, not disappointed so far.</li>
            <li> The polish is great! I used this as baby shower gifts for the guest and I have received plenty of compliments on how great the polish is. Everyone was satisfied. :)</li>
            <li> Items was good there are about 1/9 that are clumpy but if you use Nail polish removal it fixes it.</li>
            <li> The product actually arrived earlier than the estimated delivery date!! I purchased these for my niece who loves to do her own nails and she loves them.</li>
            <li> I love the variety of colors and it comes in a handy tray, will recommend this to other people!</li>
            <li> These colors are bright.  I got exactly what is pictured which is great!  Sometimes that&#x27;s not the case with other nail polishes.  My daughters love these.</li>
            <li> Love how many colors their is and isn&#x27;t to expensive for all of them great nail polish all the amazing colors doesn&#x27;t chip to fast love it</li>
            <li> I just received these polishes in the mail a couple days ago and they are great. Some of them are a bit goopy, but definitely useable. The variety of colors is very great, and they all add up to the product images, except for the orange polish next to the red and mustard yellow, which looks more brown. I would recommend this to anyone because you don&#x27;t have to spend copious amounts of money, and it is just like any other brand you could find that cost up to 4$ a bottle! Also the colors are very cute, the only ones that I probably wouldn&#x27;t use are the dark grey and the sort of brown color I mentioned earlier. This is a must buy for anyone who wants an abundance of colors of good quality for less money.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with this product line. I purchased the polish in order to use it in a professional setting. It doesn&#x27;t stand up to other professional polish brands. However, it is wonderful for personal use.&lt;br /&gt;To be specific: the application brush isn&#x27;t the best, to achieve a perfect coverage you have to use a lot of product, the polishes aren&#x27;t shiny once they dry.</li>
            <li> I got this set because it was inexpensive, and my daughter goes through nail polish like no other. At less then $2 a bottle, I was not expecting anything fancy, but I will end up getting another because of the value.&lt;br /&gt;  I didnt receive any duplicates, and because of SHANY packaging, no breaks or leakage (all three of which had been issues on previous nail polish purchses).  There are glitters, shimmers, metalics and opaques!  An awesome selection for the price.  And the polishes didnt need extra coats except for the really dark colors, which is normal.&lt;br /&gt;  I love them, but sadly my daughter will have to wait till after the holidays, because they are now out of stock, and I&#x27;m not giving these up!</li>
            <li> I chose this kind because my niece love to paint her nails.&lt;br /&gt;She picked these one coz she liked it.</li>
            <li> This is an  amazing deal for the money! The colors are bright and the polish dries very quickly! You can&#x27;t beat this deal anywhere else!</li>
            <li> Got it early then expected! I was scared to buy it cuz quality n will be broken or something but love it!!!! Will purchase again! Great colors n love the bottles n great size n most importantly great price!!!!! Great colors n dries fast! Love it! Will recommend it!</li>
            <li> bought this for my sister and she loves them</li>
            <li> I received this set as a gift for Christmas. I was sooo excited when I unwrapped the present and saw all the beautiful colors. I would say I&#x27;m so what obsessed with painting my nails...&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the first polish I opened the brush went flying off the end and landed on my NEW jeans I had just received for Christmas as well! I was very upset. I put the brush back on and haven&#x27;t had an issue with any of the other ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This nail polish does NOT dry quickly. I had to sit still for about 30 minutes as I waited for them to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are pretty true to the color on the bottle with the exception of the bright yellow. It painted on streaky and took many coats to get it to look like the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could say I&#x27;m truly happy with the set but I&#x27;m not, its just ok.</li>
            <li> Awesome collection of colors.  Looks good on and can use for nail stamping.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my teenage niece since I had no clue what else to get her.  She absolutely loved this with so many bright colors.  She had the box open and painting her nails within minutes.  There is a great selection and it was a great price for 24 different colors!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. great colors, applies easily. Quality nail polishes and colors to match everything, dries quickly weather you use 1 or 2 coats of polish.</li>
            <li> Awesome, full sized set! I couldn&#x27;t be happier. The polish dries fast as others said, and it is a tad matte if you only use one coat, but I found adding a second coat helps.  It was packaged in this nice box, I&#x27;m very impressed. Great colors too. One very happy customer.</li>
            <li> Great selection of trendy colors! I was afraid that the bottle size would be small but these are full size bottles. My first polish lasted over a week and didn&#x27;t chip or fade. This is a great bargain and would make a great gift .</li>
            <li> Super satisfied with my purchase!!! They are all great colors!! The polish was the perfect thickness and dried fast!! Love it!! I was a little worried cause there was some mixed reviews, but would definitely recommend this nail polish!!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! There are so many colors to choose from :) I would recommend any of Shany&#x27;s products!!</li>
            <li> Love this nail polish! It goes on nice and smooth, and dries very fast. I&#x27;ll be using Shany from now on. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this set! All the polishes are high quality! Some of them are thick, but can be fixed with polish thinner [not polish remover; it will permanently ruin them]. They aren&#x27;t as good as essie or OPI of course, but they&#x27;re great for the price! A few of the polishes, such as both of the yellow ones are a little think and require 2-4 coats to get a full opacity.</li>
            <li> COLORS ARE SIMPLY BEUTIFUL !!!!!!</li>
            <li> Wow! I LOVE this set! Have started my Christmas shopping early this year and thought this would be a great gift for my teenage niece. The set comes in a large box in a nice tray that looks just perfect for gift giving! So many BEAUTIFUL BRIGHT colors. When I opened the box â€“ I was so impressed. The display is simply stunning. I canâ€™t wait to see the look on my nieceâ€™s face when she opens this gift at Christmas. Very happy with this purchase. I really feel like I got my moneyâ€™s worth.</li>
            <li> One use and they got too thick to use.</li>
            <li> I got this immediately before I left to get an acrylic manicure. When I came back, I removed the polish that I had on my nails and put one of these colors on. I LOVE THEM. The color goes on smoothly and seems like it will last a long time with top coat. There is such a variety of color to choose from and the white works PERFECTLY for nail stamping. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> This packet of nail polish have lots of colors and it dry very fast. They smells bad but it is easy to use.I think this brand of nail polish is very suitable for this kind of people. There are many colors to choose from, not only more style and the color is more bright-coloured.I love that.[[ASIN:B005X2F7JY SHANY Cosmetics The Cosmopolitan Nail Polish Set (24 Colors Premium Quality and Quick Dry), 40 Fluid Ounce]]</li>
            <li> Love all the colors! Goes on smoothly and looks amazing! A few months back I ordered a similar set of polishes from another seller and was not impressed, the polishes in this set are true to color!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t familiar with this brand of polish, as OPI, Essie &amp; China Glaze are my go to polishes.  But of course, 24 great colors for $30 is hard to pass up.  So after reading the reviews I decided to make the purchase.  Overall I was really happy with the color selection.  The colors are great and look amazing when they are on.  I have natural nails and usually do them myself.  My manicure and polish will usually last about 5-7 days before my color starts to chip.  With the Shany Cosmetics polish, I have found the polish to start chipping after 1-2 days, which is a total bummer.  Don&#x27;t know that I would buy this brand again, which is too bad because I really like the colors, but only lasting 24 to 48 hours is not ideal.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a bright green nail polish and ran across this. The packaging was great, the quality of the nail polish is awesome. You can&#x27;t beat 24 full size nail polishes for less than $30. One of my best finds on Amazon to date.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my wife. She is a regular customer of Shany cosmetics and bought many other items from them. Thinking this would be of the same quality she ordered this but it didnot meet her expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: good color range and great deal for the price&lt;br /&gt;Cons: They chip off very badly in just 2 days after application and she don&#x27;t even has to use a thinner to remove the remaining polish. Instead you can peel it off with your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;Really disappointed with this particular item from Shany. Ddnt expect this from you. Recommend only if you are looking for just one day wear or so. Hope they do something to improve the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> the odor was very strong and some had leaked in the box.  I will not order again because of the strong stench.  Prior to opening the delivery package.</li>
            <li> So I was apprehensive about these nail polishes as they were so cheap and I had a $10 coupon, but I figured I would try it. They are great! They go on very smooth and dried pretty quickly. Some bottles are thinner than others but that will just require another coat. All in all a good deal and nice rich colors for the price! Hope you enjoy as much as I am!!!</li>
            <li> This polish is fantastic for stamping! I have searched all of amazon for a stamping polish without the expensive price and this one was perfect for me. I didn&#x27;t feel that it was fantastic for full color coating (unless its for the kiddos or a 1-2day design without chipping) but for full plate stamping is gets the absolute full 5stars. No chipping with the polish on stamped design whatsoever. I didn&#x27;t have a single problem with any one of the 24 colors, each one was in excellent condition and there are no duplicate colors. They are all quick dry which makes them even better if you will paint kids nails. Brushes were good, no pieces of the brush coming loose or anything crazy like that. I will order this brand again and am waiting for the full set of new colors from the shany to be released in this size also.</li>
            <li> Received this for Christmas and absolutely love the selection of colors, the number of bottles and the size.  This size at drug stores and cosmetic stores would cost even on sale over $1.50.  Can&#x27;t wait to use them and will come back and add to my review after my first application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July 6, 2013&lt;br /&gt;I have totally changed my review after using this product for 6 months and at least 8 different colors.  They are thick, gloppy, show brush lines, wear off and chip easily and I just use them for my toes!  Do not buy this product even at less than $1.50 a bottle it&#x27;s just not worth it.</li>
            <li> Awesome set! They came in super quick. I&#x27;ve only used a couple colors so far but the colors are fantastic and smooth. They are full size bottles. Good quality for such a good price. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This polish is worth the cost but the consistency of that polish is weird.  One bottle will be runny and take 4 coats to show up and the next bottle is thick and sticky.  Wish it would be all a nice consistency to put on the nails.  OK for the price though.</li>
            <li> This polish is great. I bought this not sure what I was going to get and received one of every color, no copies. Glitters also. Love it.</li>
            <li> this came right on time and was everything I needed.  They are beautiful vibrant colors some with a little sparkle some a lot of sparkle some no sparkle.  Couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better value for my money</li>
            <li> Base and top coat used: OPI&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m normally not a Shany nail polish user, but I&#x27;m taking a break from Gelish and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: the colors are awesome. The brights are gorgeous, and the darks are rich.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The variety is pretty good. Maybe a couple too many pinks, but that could be a preference thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The brushes suck. Seriously. I&#x27;ll post a picture of my nails, and on the orange, you can see a strand of the brush fell off onto my nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s also no brush standard. They&#x27;re not all bad, but they&#x27;re not all good. Some are thicker than others, some are shaped differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nail polish peels and chips easily. Even with a good top coat AND using the Shany nail dryer, I have smudges and chips. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, if you&#x27;re looking for some fun colors for a good price, and aren&#x27;t looking for salon quality, this will do it for you! :)</li>
            <li> not thick enough for nail stamping :( also, without topcoat nail polish chips off... not the best polish for nail art and stamping :( wish i could say simething positive, but can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I eagerly awaited the arrival of these with great expectations-Was extremely disappointed. Tried one color and it was gloppy, did not brush on smoothly.  Tried another with same results.The brush nor polish were good.  Because of the shape of the brush, it caused polish to get on sides of skin and the polish was not smooth at all. Polishes sold in drug stores, even the most inexpensive brands were far better quality than these.This was a waste of money and grave disappointment.  I would not purchase this again or recommend it.  I purchased based on reviews, so perhaps I got a bad batch, but nevertheless, it&#x27;s a REALLY bad batch. Oh, and it&#x27;s non-returnable because it&#x27;s considered hazardous substance.  Such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Great value for the price. Polish went on easily and has lasted over a week. I received so many great colors I&#x27;ve given some away to friends in gift bags.</li>
            <li> The clumps were so bad, I had to start over multiple times, and then I just gave up and threw them out.</li>
            <li> I highly recomend it. I been using them for the past two weeks and all the colors are so pigmented and only needs one coat. The most amazing thing is that I start with my left hand and continue with the right and when I am finishing the right hand the left is already dry, as a new mom I don&#x27;t have to much of me time to wait it to be dry . Love them. Hope that shany cosmetics comes with peach colors for this set, that will be the cherry on the top.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the colors it came in wonderful condition I have done 2 nail designs including simple colors and a totoro manicure both turned out amazing and the colors are so pretty and opec. my favorites are baby blue, blue purple, and metallic green! I am so excited these are the best colors I&#x27;ve ever owned. Thank you shany for the wonderful products</li>
            <li> This set is great and I absolutely LOVE it! The pigmentation of the colors are very true and all you need is the standard two coats. To ensure that my polish last longer I used a good top coat such as Seche Vite. All the colors are vibrant and gorgeous! The polish dries fairly quick, so that&#x27;s a plus in my book. This set is great for someone who is looking to start a nail polish collection or even add to one. For the price, I feel you get your moneys worth plus more!  LOVE LOVE LOVE. 100% Satisfied with this product!!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors and great quality. The bottles are large, so you get a lot of product for a great price. I will definitely be buying more shany polishes.</li>
            <li> Good colors, good quality, got to me quickly....I love my new nail polishes!!! I also got a gel uv light &amp; it&#x27;s great too!</li>
            <li> The&lt;br /&gt;Colors are beautiful</li>
            <li> These nail polishes go on very well and the colors are vibrant. The biggest gripe I have is the time it takes to get it off. I do not know if you need a specific nail polish remover or cotton ball, but it is such a hassle getting it off. I learned after trying this out for a few months that I rather spend a little bit more on other more popular nail polish to avoid this problem cause&#x27; \\&quot;I ain&#x27;t got no time for this.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I found that it was better to use acetone nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> I am a nail polish snob. I have been looking in drugstores and makeup stores for a new nail polish when I came across these on amazon. Nail polish can be so expensive these days and you don&#x27;t really know if they&#x27;re worth the money or not. Well, I received these yesterday along with the 10 piece eye lash set, the neutral eye shadow palette, and the colourful eye shadow palette. I absolutely love all of these products!! These nail polishes are cheap and have extraordinary colour! I love how glossy and pigmented these colours are!!! I haven&#x27;t used all of them, I&#x27;ve only tried out five on my left hand, but already I am hooked! As far as how long they last, I&#x27;m not sure yet because I just put the polishes on this morning. These are so worth it, so I definitely recommend buying them :).</li>
            <li> So i got this for my sisters birthday and she loved them , she told me 2 of them were a bit dry but she fixed them with her nail polish thinner and she says their good quality</li>
            <li> This is a set that is great for the price. Each polish is regular polished sized and comes off with little or no streaks. Once I got my set, It was packaged nicely and came with it&#x27;s own little case. Although each coloris darker than the picture, they are still pretty colors. The only thing that wasn&#x27;t to my liking was the bright neon green, which was somewhat dried up and not full like the other polishes. But overall , it is a very nice set.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I purchased this.  And judging by the reviews it was a decent set and worth the money.  But when it arrived - i opened the package and it immediately smelled of nail polish - nothing had leaked but at least 4 of the tops were not screwed on tight.  I tried out those 4 colors and all are very gloppy.  Possibly old/most likely expired.  I went to return them and I guess I&#x27;m unable to because they are flammable material which Amazon does not accept returns on.  Kinda ticked at this purchase and waste of my money.</li>
            <li> This is literally the best nail polish I have ever used in my life!!! I love painting my nails and now I will only do it with Shany Cosmetics Nail Polish!! I paint my nails every night and I enjoy every second of it!! It doesn&#x27;t clump or flake and I only have to do one coat! I just love it best product ever! If your thinking ah maybe I shouldn&#x27;t buy nail polish do it you will not regret it!!!!:D</li>
            <li> BEST NAILS POLISH EVER ...</li>
            <li> Nice colors, but the product was probably too old because some of the colors were dry out when it got here</li>
            <li> lots of great colors, some strange colors are included of course. some of the polish goes on really great and others are a little clumpy and look like a mess on the nail. some of the colors chip off pretty easy and others are long lasting.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find that the colors were vibrant. However, the nail polish is sticky. Even being very careful, I could never achieve a smooth layer. I added a little acetone to the bottle, it helped marginally.</li>
            <li> Very good quality for the price. They come in beautiful packaging and are bright, vibrant colours. Most must-have colours are in this set, including reds and pinks. I was very surprised to find that the white polish is thick and opaque! All of the mattes are great to mix and match with the glitters, and the pearls and shiny and pretty. Great buy and great fun.</li>
            <li> some bottles arrived broken or open in the box</li>
            <li> Love the colours. goes well in my Nail Accessories Makeup Case...lolol</li>
            <li> my daughter loved all the colors</li>
            <li> Merchandise arrived on time and in good condition.  I  bought these for my daughter and she loves them.  Based on her information, the variety of colors is amazing and they are full size.  I will definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT, ITEM IS AS DESCRIBED AND ARRIVED VERY FAST AS DESCRIBED EXCELLENT PROTECTION A+ WILL BUY AGAIN IN FUTURE</li>
            <li> I bought this last year so a little delayed on writing the review. the product arrived nicely packaged and colors are really nice however the nail polish starts to chip the next day. Therefore I would not buy it again</li>
            <li> The nail polish was bad quality, it started to chip the day I put it on.</li>
            <li> Nice colors works fine. I am dissapointed because the nail polish dont last more than few days. Besides that I like it.</li>
            <li> Great array of colors, I love it, I get to make many designs on myself and my friends.  Now I just need some remover haha</li>
            <li> MY MOM&#x27;S ALWAYS POLISHING HER NAILS.  IT WAS A MOTHERS DAY GIFTS.  THIS COLLECTION MAKES HOURS, DAYS, WEEKS FUN FOR A RETIRED WOMAN WHO LIKES TO KEEP UP HER LOOKS</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use nail polish often, but bought these as individual gifts for a women&#x27;s spa day and everyone loved them. The color were great from bold to more traditional. The items looked just as they were pictured so I got exactly what I expected packaging and color-wise, but my expectations were exceeded in value!</li>
            <li> Love the nail polish! The colors are great and doesn&#x27;t take me 20 coats to get a strong pigment. They don&#x27;t smell as strong as the nail polishes I have and I love that!</li>
            <li> Nice rich colors, glides on easily, not clumpy or thick and gluey.  I just wish there weren&#x27;t so many colors that I will never use.  I guess I could give some as teen grab bag gifts.</li>
            <li> I got this for my teenage niece who&#x27;s discovering all kinds of different designs &amp; techniques she gets from pintrest. my favorite is when she paints stripes of different colors on a makeup sponge &amp; sponges a nice fade on the nail. with a great top coat, it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> So many of the reviews for this product are really great, so I have to wonder if Shany is &amp;#34;paying&amp;#34; for their reviews or if there are major inconsistencies in their production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very excited when I recieved this, as the colors looked great. I did not have any problems as far as receiving broken bottles or product that was dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major issue that I have with this, is that the product never dries! I tried several times- it didn&#x27;t matter how thick or thin I put it on, if I put a top coat, base coat or nothing, every color that I tried (about 60% of them), would never fully dry. They would stay at that tacky stage where if you pushed your finger on it, you could see your finger print.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried these with the Shany nail stamps, and they were just not the right consistency. I love the nail stamps, but I have to use them with other polish.</li>
            <li> The brushes kept falling out ....and there is no way t snap them back in!!!  Defective&lt;br /&gt;So embarrassed I gave this for a Christmas gift :(</li>
            <li> Bought these as a gift for my sister. She says it is the best nail polish she has ever used. Goes on very smooth and beautiful colors</li>
            <li> I never buy any cheap polish like that again, delivery very fast, but some color never dry. I also have 2 color #21in box and no way to returm.</li>
            <li> I had a return issue with this product but after figuring out use chat, they are sending me a new set, first one was damaged. Very quick to resolve my issues so please disregard any negative complaints I had.</li>
            <li> Polish is very poor quality. It does not apply smoothly and chips off very easily. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Overall I am happy with my purchase! There are 2 things that were not perfect. I ordered on Aug 22 and the estimated delivery day was Aug 29 - Sept 1. It finally shipped on Aug 28 and the delivery date mysteriously changed to Sept 5. So VERY SLOW SHIPPING!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I waited I did read into the reviews a bit more than before I ordered and saw that a lot of people complained about dried out polishes! That made me really nervous - I did not want to wait that long for dried out polish! Anyhow, the polish arrived today (Sept 5) and the first thing I did was check every polish to see if any were dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Neon Yellow and White were a little dried, but not to a point where you can&#x27;t use it. The Neon Yellow has a few clumps in it though. I do have some nail polish thinner so I think that will fix that problem.&lt;br /&gt;I tested a few colors on one of my nails and I am impressed! They are not thin and see through at all. I do a lot of Konad Nail Art and I needed some base coats! Seems like I will only need one base coat since the polish is that great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this? Yes - for the price its really a great deal - even if 1-2 nail polishes had been dried out. Get some thinner if that is the case. Just don&#x27;t hold your breath while waiting on it to get delivered! LOL!</li>
            <li> Really really lovely Shany nail polish set!&lt;br /&gt;Great variety of colors and they dry quick!&lt;br /&gt;Plus it is a great price</li>
            <li> shipped fast, true to image, 24 colors. bought for kid sister. She liked the variety of neons and hot colors.</li>
            <li> great product, great seller</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. It arrived on schedule. It came with all the shown colors. It&#x27;s simply amazing. I love painting my nails and do my sister and cousins&#x27; nails all the time. It&#x27;s usually hard to find a really good nail polish set for such a great price but you really get the bang for you buck. The colors are so vibrant and you don&#x27;t really need to do two coats like you do with most nail polishes. Granted, if you don&#x27;t use a top coat, it chips easily, but you can use any $6.00 top coat. Great for ombre effects on your nails since you get so many different shades of blue and reds/pink. I would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> The nail polish color variety was amazing. It went on smoothly and lasted quite awhile. I really love this polish.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend ordered these for me because I&#x27;m such a nail polish fanatic. I only use OPI or like Sally Hansen so ik a good product when I see one. It&#x27;s such a great variety of colors! Their Metallica &amp; sparkly ones &amp; jus good colors all together. He ordered them on Saturday &amp; I got them Tuesday. VERY FAST shipping. &amp; I&#x27;ve tried quite a few colors today their true to the color in the bottle not watery at all &amp; their nice &amp; thick. They get a little gunky as they dry so be careful not to tap your finger on anything but I used my orly glosser as a topcoat &amp; I&#x27;m VERY impressed. I&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone looking to buy polishes &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> used them as stocking stuffers at Christmas and the girls loved them.  Saved a few for myselft</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. These are full sized nail polishes and the array of colors are great! I&#x27;ve been using them for about two weeks now, and though it seems to chip a little faster than more expensive polishes, they seem to hold up pretty well. They look great and are a great value--What more can you ask for?!</li>
            <li> These were great little gifts at my baby shower.  Because of the low cost, I thought maybe they would be in smaller bottles, but they were a standard size for nail polish.  Very cool. Colors are fun.</li>
            <li> Flakes off far more easily than any other polish I&#x27;ve ever used, but the colors are fun for kids.</li>
            <li> So Many pretty colors! and only $1 per bottle- can&#x27;t beat that except by including a tray to keep them organized - which is what they did! They are grreat!!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended. They came with in nice package. I was worrying because some reviews said there were broken glasses, However, they are wrapped in a plastic and then in 3 boxes. I immediately try the polishes and they are as good as i thought! $25 for 24 nail polishes! You&#x27;re gonna regret if you dont get them!!</li>
            <li> I saw all those bad reviews saying that the bottles broke or were dry or whatever. NOT TRUE! They came packed tightly in a pretty (and protective) box, and not one is spilled or dry. There are soooo many colors, and they are thick and not messy. They also dry incredibly fast. These are literally the nicest nail polishes I&#x27;ve ever seen, and the cheapest too!</li>
            <li> I am a nail art beginner and even I know the difference between quality and this set!  I am highly disappointed in this set.  I originally wrote two reviews based on how amazing they were packaged and after using the red regular color (which is fine) but the bad is far outweighing the good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the white tonight and it took 3 coats to cover my nails and then was gloppy.  Pretty disappointing after liking that the plain colors and the sparklies had so much promise.  I decided to open them all today and many were inconsistent in texture - some too thin, some too thick.  Many didn&#x27;t mix together, some looked like they had been used before.  Very disappointing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spend the money on a quality set!</li>
            <li> We bought this to package gift bags after a birthday party.  For the price of this item, you cannot beat it!</li>
