            <li>This is amazing!</li>
            <li>its amazing!</li>
            <li>This is the best product out there works like a charm LOVE</li>
            <li>Excellent, love the idea of not having to remove with polish, just peel off.</li>
            <li>but I bet if I gave it more time, it would work perfectly.</li>
            <li>I loved the color with my summer skin tone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now making good use of my glitter polishes.</li>
            <li>and I had a good 3 coats of this stuff on.</li>
            <li>The idea of a glitter off basecoat is a good one,but this misses the mark.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I say that in a good way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it is good for someone like me, I change my nail polish about once a week.</li>
            <li>yr good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does work, though.</li>
            <li>Peeled off too easily!!</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the way this adhered to the nail.  </li>
            <li>I did another mani where I applied 3 layers of top coat, and it lasted for 1.5 weeks!</li>
            <li>If anyone has any comments/suggestions, I&#x27;d love to hear them!  </li>
            <li>This works fantastic!!  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I love glitter polish, but what a pain!  </li>
            <li>LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I need!!!!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>amazing..</li>
            <li>This is an amazing breakthrough in polish and nail care.</li>
            <li>nail polish starts peeling off on its own within hours.</li>
            <li>like to use my own &amp; bring my products when I get a manicure.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>put it in my own nail polish bottle</li>
            <li>Arrived on time, packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t peel off on its own no matter what you do.</li>
            <li>glitter peels off nicely.  </li>
            <li>It peels off easily which I loved, because it didn&#x27;t damage my nail.</li>
            <li>Seems to work well and peels off glitter polish very easily.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get the glitter polish to peel off but it was very easy to remove with nail polisher remover.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>this product is pretty darned good, I&#x27;d give it 3.5 stars!  </li>
            <li>It peels off so easy!</li>
            <li>This makes it so easy!  </li>
            <li>makes removal easy!</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!</li>
            <li>It was fine through regular-length showers but when I tried to take a bath, I lost my manicure!tried to take a bath, I lost my manicure!</li>
            <li>I got this and use it with large glitter nail polish but it doesn&#x27;t work as great as I hoped it would.</li>
            <li>My nails are feeling and looking much better.</li>
            <li>Then apply one or more coats of color or glitter.  </li>
            <li>I love glitter polish but dreaded taking it off.</li>
            <li>I applied 1 top coat and it lasted one week.</li>
            <li>Then I used one coat of color, two coats of glitter and one top coat.</li>
            <li>I also feel with glitter polish, it&#x27;s ok if you bump and dent it a bit, since the glitter keeps the dents from showing.  </li>
            <li>but I am glad I persevered.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product!</li>
            <li>is magic.</li>
            <li>I love glitter polishes and was so hoping this product would solve the nightmare that is the removal of glitter polish, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>Since this product worked so well for so many others, I am thinking perhaps it was the top coat.  </li>
            <li>I tried this again and had way better results.  </li>
            <li>my glitter polishes are calling to me!  :-)    </li>
            <li>, it was more pick and scrap than it was peel.  </li>
            <li>I watched many YouTubers demonstrate it</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product under the impression from the description and marketing that this was an authentic OPI product.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s free shipping!</li>
            <li>I thought this might be more sophisticated</li>
            <li>Glitter polish takes about five seconds more.  </li>
            <li>When I applied it I didn&#x27;t go all the way to the edges and then applied the polish and top coat to the edges which I feel</li>
            <li>may have given it a better seal</li>
            <li>I love to wear glitter polish on my toes.</li>
            <li>use OPI top coat.  </li>
            <li>I like it much better than Seche Vite.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love most OPI stuff</li>
            <li>I do plan on buying more.</li>
            <li>It did take the top layer of my nail off with it.  </li>
            <li>I used two coats to make sure I got even coverage.  </li>
            <li>This does what is says it will do for the most part.</li>
            <li>It almost has a more glue like texture.</li>
            <li>All you have to do is apply one layer of this and then add as many glitter layers as you wish.</li>
            <li>Love it and have already started recommending it to my friends.</li>
            <li>to use and more easy to remove&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It does do it&#x27;s purpose though of making sure it comes off easy.</li>
            <li>And you can use it for clean up purposes around the nails too, or even designs!</li>
            <li>it came right off!!</li>
            <li>This is one nail product I may finish off completely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note, though: don&#x27;t soak your hands in warm water or your nailpolish will slide right off.  </li>
            <li>This polish peels off too easily, when my daughter isn&#x27;t trying to take it off.</li>
            <li>This peels off easily, but it peels off all the time.</li>
            <li>I found if you use your thumb nail at the side, easy does it and it comes off easily.</li>
            <li>The Glitter Off allows me to remove my polish easily and without nail damage.  </li>
            <li>My glitter polish stayed on for 6 days and removed easily.  </li>
            <li>you want to see how easy it is to use, you can check this link :</li>
            <li>My polish also didn&#x27;t come off as easily as the product claimed it would.  </li>
            <li>The polish came off  too easily.  </li>
            <li>You put on the cuticles and skin around the nail and it easily peels off any polish that isn&#x27;t on the nail.  </li>
            <li>Peels off way to easily.</li>
            <li>When the times comes all you have to do is push it off from one corner and it all comes off so easily without harming your nails.</li>
            <li>In fact you need to be kind to your nails or your whole piece of nail art will just pop off!</li>
            <li>I Love this new top coat!</li>
            <li>I find a slightly thicker coat works best for me.</li>
            <li>The rest was fine.  </li>
            <li>I liked that it came off easier than if I hadn&#x27;t used it, but it tended to chip more than normal.  </li>
            <li>Used it several times with great results.  </li>
            <li>Makes wearing glitter polish more fun and easier since you don&#x27;t have to battle removing it.</li>
            <li>I tried taking off the rest of the polish by lightly pressing and peeling up at the bottom</li>
            <li>It goes on fairly smoothly and evenly.  </li>
            <li>Am happy to add the glitters shoved in the back of my stash into my rotation without dreading the foil at the end of the tunnel.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>But this works way better and just peels right off.  </li>
            <li>I guess I was lucky as I see a lot of comments about people receiving Elmer&#x27;s glue instead...not cool!</li>
            <li>Super easy to peel off the polish.  </li>
            <li>I had two problems with it, one you need to make sure you get it on your full nail, if you don&#x27;t get right to the edge, you&#x27;ll have glitter all around the edge of your nail.</li>
            <li>Have fun!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited that I can wear glitter polish again without the dread of the process to take it off.</li>
            <li>I was really excited when I saw a YouTube video where a nail technician was using this product.</li>
            <li>This time I did NOT use a Seche Vite top coat, as I&#x27;d theorized perhaps the hard-as-acrylic surface of that topper might have doomed my first experiment.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this item, thanks OPI!</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive this product and wear my glitter nail polishes.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this product</li>
            <li>I was so excited when the box arrived.  </li>
            <li>Giving 4 stars instead of 5 because sometimes your polish will start to feel off before you&#x27;re ready to remove it, but even then, this makes it easy to reapply when needed!</li>
            <li>It was so fast and easy!  </li>
            <li>When this runs out, then maybe I&#x27;ll clean the bottle and put glue in it.</li>
            <li>This looks white on but dries clear and works awesome!</li>
            <li>I have used it for glitter and around my nail to keep a clean manicure look.</li>
            <li>Might be good if you really don&#x27;t use your hands to do much?</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s nothing special about this product at all</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what is special about this formula to make it work the money, but you may want to just try the shortcut.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li>and it comes right off!</li>
            <li>a layer of polish will just pop right off one of your nails when you don&#x27;t want it to!  </li>
            <li>This time, I applied it on Sunday, and made it to Tuesday when opening a soda popped the polish right off my index finger!</li>
            <li>Make sure to apply a strong clear top coat when you&#x27;re done too, otherwise it will peel too easily with normal activities.  </li>
            <li>My manicure was still looking good four days later, even though I use my hands (and wash them) a LOT.</li>
            <li>Enjoy this product and have fun.</li>
            <li>I am VERY conservative when it comes to my clothing, makeup, etc., but I LOVE glitter nail polish.  </li>
            <li>I have a full review on my blog with photos to show just how well this</li>
            <li>I think their mom will love this product just as much as I do</li>
            <li>with so much else, body chemistry plays a pivotal role and will determine if this is a holy grail or money pit product.</li>
            <li>Helped remove glitter polish quickly.</li>
            <li>You can change colors quickly too.</li>
            <li>Added my glitter nail polish on top and when I was ready to remove it, it peeled right off.</li>
            <li>Really great idea, but upon using it, it appears to have many of the same  characteristics of white glue...</li>
            <li>offthe only reason that I rated it 2 stars was because Elmer&#x27;s glue does work pretty good</li>
            <li>Works exactly like it says it does!</li>
            <li>When I was done, I barely had to use one cotton ball with acetone to clean up, and that was mostly on the edges where I&#x27;d done touch-ups.  </li>
            <li>Great for the outsides of your nails, not your nails themselves, when you&#x27;re doing a gradient mani (or if you&#x27;re just messy like I am).</li>
            <li>But in the meantime, totally worth the buy.</li>
            <li>If you find you have some left on your nail after peeling, try soaking your fingers in warm water for a bit.</li>
            <li>do I do not think you could put a clear glitter top coat over it.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews, but I had to this time.</li>
            <li>but you can make your own version for pennies out of watered-down white school glue.  </li>
            <li>Its useful</li>
            <li>It does peel off the glitter coat really nice, BUT it starts peeling as soon as the next day.  </li>
            <li>when you are ready to remove, simply get a fingernail up under the nail polish of the desired finger/nail and it will peel right off!!!!</li>
            <li>Many times, the polish will lift up in one big sheet and leave the nail completely clean.  </li>
            <li>and it started peeling right</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t keep polish on with this stuff because it just comes right off as soon as you use you hands.</li>
            <li>and it came right off.</li>
            <li>So I jumped right on Amazon to buy it.</li>
            <li>This product does work, the glitter nail polish peels right off.  </li>
            <li>The polish came right off.</li>
            <li>When it was time to remove the polish from the others, it peels right off.  </li>
            <li>Also, if you are a bit rough on your nails (washing dishes, swimming, anything with your hands really), the polish might start to peel off on its own!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually write reviews because I&#x27;m generally happy with everything I get from Amazon</li>
            <li>Not as good as other products I&#x27;ve used, but it does the job!</li>
            <li>I used with the new OPI glitter polish and it looked fabulous.</li>
            <li>Ok so I have to say this works REALLY well for me as far as my nails not shipping.</li>
            <li>Thisi product allows you to wear glitter bulbs easy with no mess.</li>
            <li>I first bought this from Ulta</li>
            <li>First trial peeled off, but not as well as described.  </li>
            <li>I have a small wooden cuticle pusher that works perfect for this.  </li>
            <li>I did another one without any top coat and the nail polish chipped off the very next day.</li>
            <li>Would buy again from Cosmetics Central :-)</li>
            <li>you won&#x27;t be sorry :-) :-) :-)</li>
            <li>It works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>but I kind of expected that.  </li>
            <li>Doing my nails is so much easier now!</li>
            <li>worker recommended Out the Door top coat - plan to try that next.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m ready for a change I just peel off and am done!  </li>
            <li>I am going to purchase several more of these for my nieces this Christmas.  </li>
            <li>This product does exact as it says...</li>
            <li>But it works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used all the same.</li>
            <li>I think this product marks the first time I have ever purchased something after seeing it in a magazine ad.  </li>
            <li>That is also unusual, right?</li>
            <li>It really works to be able to remove especially the glitter polish.  </li>
            <li>sure to use a solid coat, no thin or skipped spots or it won&#x27;t peel off in one piece.  </li>
            <li>I will try it once more for the \\&quot;tiebreaker\\&quot; and report back if this is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>I love this base coat, I do my nails every week and this works perfectly for me</li>
            <li>but all the reviews were positive</li>
            <li>if you put a nice coat of this stuff under the glitter you want to wear, it will stay on no problems for several days without chipping or peeling off (i&#x27;ve never worn it for more than a few days in a row</li>
            <li>It dries pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>this is pretty much elmers glue in an OPI bottle</li>
            <li>I imagine I can take a shower, to soften the polish, then afterward scrape it off with one nail with my hands in a bowl of warm water, so the bits of nail polish don&#x27;t go down the drain.</li>
            <li>You just need to wait to make sure it&#x27;s fully dry, which can take up to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Nail polish does not last as long, but on the bright side</li>
            <li>For most of my nails, the polish came off in a single sheet.  </li>
            <li>Only problem I have is that it takes FOREVER to dry, if it was fast dry, it would be perfect.</li>
            <li>One coat is ideal but it is a little harder to remove.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really come with a lot of instructions though</li>
            <li>once you&#x27;re done with that polish, just gently start peeling from the edges of the nail.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you apply at least 2 coats of clear top coat, otherwise your mani will chip off in one day.</li>
            <li>Glue wants to pop off alot easier than this stuff.</li>
            <li>Now, with the Peel-Able I&#x27;m ready to buy a bottle.</li>
            <li>REALLY.  </li>
            <li>When ready to take points l u should off, I just peel it off.</li>
            <li>When I was ready to take it off, I just peeled it from the edge</li>
            <li>Unusual in this day and age.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>it makes things so much easier.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much easier to remove.</li>
            <li>I know it works on real nail becuase</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I thought the product worked very well.</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>so idk how much longer it lasts after that).</li>
            <li>Even if you get a real stubborn polish that won&#x27;t peel off well, it makes using nail polish remover a lot easier.</li>
            <li>and it worked very well.</li>
            <li>I used to hesitate before using glitter nail polish but it changed thanks to OPI Glitter Off.</li>
            <li>Makes removal so much easier.</li>
            <li>Does this really work?</li>
            <li>Thought it would go faster than it really is.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m really upset</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this.</li>
            <li>It makes it so much easier to get glittery</li>
            <li>Looks and smells like Elmer&#x27;s glue, so maybe the DIY on Pinterest really does work.</li>
            <li>My main issue was that the nail polish started peeling off on its own after less than a day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to redo many of my nails due to that happening.  </li>
            <li>It took just as long as the old soak-with-foils method and frankly caused more discomfort.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you let it dry completely before applying polish.</li>
            <li>I had made my own &#x27;glue&#x27; mixture in the past but that would pop off in a day or 2.  </li>
            <li>This works just as I expected it to - peels off easily.  </li>
            <li>The first one I got from Amazon smelled and applied exactly the same.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, the product I received was not the same.</li>
            <li>It smells so much like White glue you use in elementary school that I zone off to then when ever I use it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this when I bought it.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You should also use at least 3 coats to make sure it&#x27;s sticky enough to peel off easily.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use a fairly heavy coat (maybe 2 layers) and then skip the cuticle and nail oil while you&#x27;re wearing your glitter mani (I found the oil will make it lift before you want it to).</li>
            <li>so I think it will work better for gels and heavy embellishing.</li>
            <li>Then I applied my full glitter Alice in Wonderland polish, which normally requires a box of Q-tips and a long movie to remove.</li>
            <li>Peeled off within an hour of normal wear.</li>
            <li>On a few nails, there were more pieces.  </li>
            <li>I love to use glitter polish, but have always had trouble with some of the brands coming off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this is just watered down white glue</li>
            <li>If you change your polish or wear glitter constantly, it&#x27;s great and less messy than polish remover.</li>
            <li>well-the entire nail of polish comes right off with the slightest push.</li>
            <li>You need multiple layers of this before the glitter for it to work right.</li>
            <li>the only thing i did notice however is that if you only use a light coat of glitter</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re just using lacquer and a little glitter, the Elmer&#x27;s might work for you - and you can buy another bottle of lacquer with the money saved! :)</li>
            <li>What more can I say, I am a woman of few words!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The other reviews are correct though, it behaves a LOT like Elmer&#x27;s School Glue from when I was a kid, and the scent is hauntingly familiar as well...</li>
            <li>Because they pop off easily, with little to no effort.</li>
            <li>That bottle will sit in my clean up drawer for a while except for extreme emergencies.</li>
            <li>By the next day (not even a full 24 hours later!)</li>
            <li>I usually swipe a little polish remover just to make sure my nails are completely clean</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it dozens of times now with all kinds of tough glitters and shimmer polishes and for the most part, it really does peel off in 1-3 pieces per nail.  </li>
            <li>That being said, it really does allow you to simply remove nail polish and it does not ruin your natural nails.</li>
            <li>It dries clear.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a clear liquid</li>
            <li>but it dries (mostly) clear.  </li>
            <li>have natural nails.&lt;br /&gt;Recd:&lt;br /&gt;Orly</li>
            <li>Bonder for basecoat on Natural nails&lt;</li>
            <li>This works really well if you use two coats of it before the regular polish, and then sort of baby your toes so it doesn&#x27;t peel off before you want it to.  </li>
            <li>It smells suspiciously like Elmer&#x27;s glue, and it very well might be something quite similar.  </li>
            <li>May require preventative clear coat touchups too if you want it to last more than a few days.  </li>
            <li>It was my only BLING, and only rarely because well, I just couldn&#x27;t get it off.  </li>
            <li>I applied this product on first, then 2 layers of normal pink color, then 2 glitter layers, topped them off with a thick clear top coat.</li>
            <li>down side is that if the edge lifts off for whatever reason, the nail polish begins to quickly wear off or peel off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you have to go through so many pads of cotton or wipes and they keep tearing etc its ridiculous.</li>
            <li>After peeling off the main portions of my nail polish, I still go back with nail polish remover to get all of the nooks and crannys.</li>
            <li>but it is definitely easier to remove my glitter and normal nail</li>
            <li>It helped it come off so much that my entire nail color was peeling off the next day!  </li>
            <li>but when i&#x27;ve used several coats to make it thick on top of this glitter-off coat.</li>
            <li>For the most part, it lasts just as long as a regular polish (unless you&#x27;re doing something particularly harsh with your nails like picking at stuff).</li>
            <li>I did my nails, letting them dry between each coat, and my manicure began pealing off within a couple hours just through normal use!  </li>
            <li>I love glitter polish, but have always tried to use it at a min since it&#x27;s so tough to remove it.</li>
            <li>I used to buy strong polish removers to get rid of thick glitter coats, but those didn&#x27;t really work and it took me several tries to get it completely removed.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly as it says, 1 coat of glitter off, allow to dry and 2 coats of glitter polish, allow to dry and add a clear topcoat to seal.  </li>
            <li>I had a hard time getting it off with acetone free polish remover as well.</li>
            <li>I used two coats, it goes on white, dries clear.</li>
            <li>:O</li>
            <li>all ten of my nails were either completely peeled off or chipped.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li>later, my index &amp; thumb nails were completely bear.  </li>
            <li>Very disappointing for this to be sold as an authentic product when it is just a cheap knock off.</li>
            <li>It initially goes on cloudy white but as it dries it becomes clear.</li>
            <li>I had a professional application of OPI Goldeneye several years ago, and flat out couldn&#x27;t get it off.</li>
            <li>I change my nail polish almost every other day and my nails are usually pretty dry from all the remover they&#x27;re exposed to.</li>
            <li>Super convenient, no more struggling to remove nail decals, glitter, etc!</li>
            <li>Absolutely takes time stress &amp; time out of removing glitter &amp; stained nails from dark shades!</li>
            <li>This base coat is AWESOME when used with your Glitter polishes AND very Dark shades.  </li>
            <li>Its the same as kiesque just cheaper and dries clear instead of pink.</li>

            <li> its amazing!</li>
            <li> This is the best product out there works like a charm LOVE</li>
            <li> Excellent, love the idea of not having to remove with polish, just peel off.</li>
            <li> but I bet if I gave it more time, it would work perfectly.</li>
            <li> I loved the color with my summer skin tone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now making good use of my glitter polishes.</li>
            <li> and I had a good 3 coats of this stuff on.</li>
            <li> The idea of a glitter off basecoat is a good one,but this misses the mark.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I say that in a good way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it is good for someone like me, I change my nail polish about once a week.</li>
            <li> yr good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does work, though.</li>
            <li> Peeled off too easily!!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the way this adhered to the nail.  </li>
            <li> I did another mani where I applied 3 layers of top coat, and it lasted for 1.5 weeks!</li>
            <li> If anyone has any comments/suggestions, I&#x27;d love to hear them!  </li>
            <li> This works fantastic!!  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I love glitter polish, but what a pain!  </li>

            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> amazing..</li>
            <li> This is an amazing breakthrough in polish and nail care.</li>
            <li> nail polish starts peeling off on its own within hours.</li>
            <li> like to use my own &amp; bring my products when I get a manicure.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> put it in my own nail polish bottle</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t peel off on its own no matter what you do.</li>
            <li> glitter peels off nicely.  </li>
            <li> It peels off easily which I loved, because it didn&#x27;t damage my nail.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well and peels off glitter polish very easily.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get the glitter polish to peel off but it was very easy to remove with nail polisher remover.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> this product is pretty darned good, I&#x27;d give it 3.5 stars!  </li>
            <li> It peels off so easy!</li>
            <li> This makes it so easy!  </li>
            <li> makes removal easy!</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!</li>
            <li> It was fine through regular-length showers but when I tried to take a bath, I lost my manicure!tried to take a bath, I lost my manicure!</li>
            <li> I got this and use it with large glitter nail polish but it doesn&#x27;t work as great as I hoped it would.</li>
            <li> My nails are feeling and looking much better.</li>
            <li> Then apply one or more coats of color or glitter.  </li>
            <li> I love glitter polish but dreaded taking it off.</li>
            <li> I applied 1 top coat and it lasted one week.</li>
            <li> Then I used one coat of color, two coats of glitter and one top coat.</li>
            <li> I also feel with glitter polish, it&#x27;s ok if you bump and dent it a bit, since the glitter keeps the dents from showing.  </li>
            <li> but I am glad I persevered.  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product!</li>
            <li> is magic.</li>
            <li> I love glitter polishes and was so hoping this product would solve the nightmare that is the removal of glitter polish, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> Since this product worked so well for so many others, I am thinking perhaps it was the top coat.  </li>
            <li> I tried this again and had way better results.  </li>
            <li> my glitter polishes are calling to me!  :-)    </li>
            <li> , it was more pick and scrap than it was peel.  </li>
            <li> I watched many YouTubers demonstrate it</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product under the impression from the description and marketing that this was an authentic OPI product.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s free shipping!</li>
            <li> I thought this might be more sophisticated</li>
            <li> Glitter polish takes about five seconds more.  </li>
            <li> When I applied it I didn&#x27;t go all the way to the edges and then applied the polish and top coat to the edges which I feel</li>
            <li> may have given it a better seal</li>
            <li> I love to wear glitter polish on my toes.</li>
            <li> use OPI top coat.  </li>
            <li> I like it much better than Seche Vite.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I love most OPI stuff</li>
            <li> I do plan on buying more.</li>
            <li> It did take the top layer of my nail off with it.  </li>
            <li> I used two coats to make sure I got even coverage.  </li>
            <li> This does what is says it will do for the most part.</li>
            <li> It almost has a more glue like texture.</li>
            <li> All you have to do is apply one layer of this and then add as many glitter layers as you wish.</li>
            <li> Love it and have already started recommending it to my friends.</li>
            <li> to use and more easy to remove&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does do it&#x27;s purpose though of making sure it comes off easy.</li>
            <li> And you can use it for clean up purposes around the nails too, or even designs!</li>
            <li> it came right off!!</li>
            <li> This is one nail product I may finish off completely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note, though: don&#x27;t soak your hands in warm water or your nailpolish will slide right off.  </li>
            <li> This polish peels off too easily, when my daughter isn&#x27;t trying to take it off.</li>
            <li> This peels off easily, but it peels off all the time.</li>
            <li> I found if you use your thumb nail at the side, easy does it and it comes off easily.</li>
            <li> The Glitter Off allows me to remove my polish easily and without nail damage.  </li>
            <li> My glitter polish stayed on for 6 days and removed easily.  </li>
            <li> you want to see how easy it is to use, you can check this link :</li>
            <li> My polish also didn&#x27;t come off as easily as the product claimed it would.  </li>
            <li> The polish came off  too easily.  </li>
            <li> You put on the cuticles and skin around the nail and it easily peels off any polish that isn&#x27;t on the nail.  </li>
            <li> Peels off way to easily.</li>
            <li> When the times comes all you have to do is push it off from one corner and it all comes off so easily without harming your nails.</li>
            <li> In fact you need to be kind to your nails or your whole piece of nail art will just pop off!</li>
            <li> I Love this new top coat!</li>
            <li> I find a slightly thicker coat works best for me.</li>
            <li> The rest was fine.  </li>
            <li> I liked that it came off easier than if I hadn&#x27;t used it, but it tended to chip more than normal.  </li>
            <li> Used it several times with great results.  </li>
            <li> Makes wearing glitter polish more fun and easier since you don&#x27;t have to battle removing it.</li>
            <li> I tried taking off the rest of the polish by lightly pressing and peeling up at the bottom</li>
            <li> It goes on fairly smoothly and evenly.  </li>
            <li> Am happy to add the glitters shoved in the back of my stash into my rotation without dreading the foil at the end of the tunnel.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> But this works way better and just peels right off.  </li>
            <li> I guess I was lucky as I see a lot of comments about people receiving Elmer&#x27;s glue instead...not cool!</li>
            <li> Super easy to peel off the polish.  </li>
            <li> I had two problems with it, one you need to make sure you get it on your full nail, if you don&#x27;t get right to the edge, you&#x27;ll have glitter all around the edge of your nail.</li>
            <li> Have fun!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited that I can wear glitter polish again without the dread of the process to take it off.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I saw a YouTube video where a nail technician was using this product.</li>
            <li> This time I did NOT use a Seche Vite top coat, as I&#x27;d theorized perhaps the hard-as-acrylic surface of that topper might have doomed my first experiment.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this item, thanks OPI!</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this product and wear my glitter nail polishes.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product</li>
            <li> I was so excited when the box arrived.  </li>
            <li> Giving 4 stars instead of 5 because sometimes your polish will start to feel off before you&#x27;re ready to remove it, but even then, this makes it easy to reapply when needed!</li>
            <li> It was so fast and easy!  </li>
            <li> When this runs out, then maybe I&#x27;ll clean the bottle and put glue in it.</li>
            <li> This looks white on but dries clear and works awesome!</li>
            <li> I have used it for glitter and around my nail to keep a clean manicure look.</li>
            <li> Might be good if you really don&#x27;t use your hands to do much?</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s nothing special about this product at all</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what is special about this formula to make it work the money, but you may want to just try the shortcut.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li> and it comes right off!</li>
            <li> a layer of polish will just pop right off one of your nails when you don&#x27;t want it to!  </li>
            <li> This time, I applied it on Sunday, and made it to Tuesday when opening a soda popped the polish right off my index finger!</li>
            <li> Make sure to apply a strong clear top coat when you&#x27;re done too, otherwise it will peel too easily with normal activities.  </li>
            <li> My manicure was still looking good four days later, even though I use my hands (and wash them) a LOT.</li>
            <li> Enjoy this product and have fun.</li>
            <li> I am VERY conservative when it comes to my clothing, makeup, etc., but I LOVE glitter nail polish.  </li>
            <li> I have a full review on my blog with photos to show just how well this</li>
            <li> I think their mom will love this product just as much as I do</li>
            <li> with so much else, body chemistry plays a pivotal role and will determine if this is a holy grail or money pit product.</li>
            <li> Helped remove glitter polish quickly.</li>
            <li> You can change colors quickly too.</li>
            <li> Added my glitter nail polish on top and when I was ready to remove it, it peeled right off.</li>
            <li> Really great idea, but upon using it, it appears to have many of the same  characteristics of white glue...</li>
            <li> offthe only reason that I rated it 2 stars was because Elmer&#x27;s glue does work pretty good</li>
            <li> Works exactly like it says it does!</li>
            <li> When I was done, I barely had to use one cotton ball with acetone to clean up, and that was mostly on the edges where I&#x27;d done touch-ups.  </li>
            <li> Great for the outsides of your nails, not your nails themselves, when you&#x27;re doing a gradient mani (or if you&#x27;re just messy like I am).</li>
            <li> But in the meantime, totally worth the buy.</li>
            <li> If you find you have some left on your nail after peeling, try soaking your fingers in warm water for a bit.</li>
            <li> do I do not think you could put a clear glitter top coat over it.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but I had to this time.</li>
            <li> but you can make your own version for pennies out of watered-down white school glue.  </li>
            <li> Its useful</li>
            <li> It does peel off the glitter coat really nice, BUT it starts peeling as soon as the next day.  </li>
            <li> when you are ready to remove, simply get a fingernail up under the nail polish of the desired finger/nail and it will peel right off!!!!</li>
            <li> Many times, the polish will lift up in one big sheet and leave the nail completely clean.  </li>
            <li> and it started peeling right</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t keep polish on with this stuff because it just comes right off as soon as you use you hands.</li>
            <li> and it came right off.</li>
            <li> So I jumped right on Amazon to buy it.</li>
            <li> This product does work, the glitter nail polish peels right off.  </li>
            <li> The polish came right off.</li>
            <li> When it was time to remove the polish from the others, it peels right off.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you are a bit rough on your nails (washing dishes, swimming, anything with your hands really), the polish might start to peel off on its own!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews because I&#x27;m generally happy with everything I get from Amazon</li>
            <li> Not as good as other products I&#x27;ve used, but it does the job!</li>
            <li> I used with the new OPI glitter polish and it looked fabulous.</li>
            <li> Ok so I have to say this works REALLY well for me as far as my nails not shipping.</li>
            <li> Thisi product allows you to wear glitter bulbs easy with no mess.</li>
            <li> I first bought this from Ulta</li>
            <li> First trial peeled off, but not as well as described.  </li>
            <li> I have a small wooden cuticle pusher that works perfect for this.  </li>
            <li> I did another one without any top coat and the nail polish chipped off the very next day.</li>
            <li> Would buy again from Cosmetics Central :-)</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be sorry :-) :-) :-)</li>
            <li> It works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> but I kind of expected that.  </li>
            <li> Doing my nails is so much easier now!</li>
            <li> worker recommended Out the Door top coat - plan to try that next.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m ready for a change I just peel off and am done!  </li>
            <li> I am going to purchase several more of these for my nieces this Christmas.  </li>
            <li> This product does exact as it says...</li>
            <li> But it works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used all the same.</li>
            <li> I think this product marks the first time I have ever purchased something after seeing it in a magazine ad.  </li>
            <li> That is also unusual, right?</li>
            <li> It really works to be able to remove especially the glitter polish.  </li>
            <li> sure to use a solid coat, no thin or skipped spots or it won&#x27;t peel off in one piece.  </li>
            <li> I will try it once more for the \\&quot;tiebreaker\\&quot; and report back if this is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> I love this base coat, I do my nails every week and this works perfectly for me</li>
            <li> but all the reviews were positive</li>
            <li> if you put a nice coat of this stuff under the glitter you want to wear, it will stay on no problems for several days without chipping or peeling off (i&#x27;ve never worn it for more than a few days in a row</li>
            <li> It dries pretty fast.  </li>
            <li> this is pretty much elmers glue in an OPI bottle</li>
            <li> I imagine I can take a shower, to soften the polish, then afterward scrape it off with one nail with my hands in a bowl of warm water, so the bits of nail polish don&#x27;t go down the drain.</li>
            <li> You just need to wait to make sure it&#x27;s fully dry, which can take up to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Nail polish does not last as long, but on the bright side</li>
            <li> For most of my nails, the polish came off in a single sheet.  </li>
            <li> Only problem I have is that it takes FOREVER to dry, if it was fast dry, it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> One coat is ideal but it is a little harder to remove.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really come with a lot of instructions though</li>
            <li> once you&#x27;re done with that polish, just gently start peeling from the edges of the nail.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you apply at least 2 coats of clear top coat, otherwise your mani will chip off in one day.</li>
            <li> Glue wants to pop off alot easier than this stuff.</li>
            <li> Now, with the Peel-Able I&#x27;m ready to buy a bottle.</li>
            <li> REALLY.  </li>
            <li> When ready to take points l u should off, I just peel it off.</li>
            <li> When I was ready to take it off, I just peeled it from the edge</li>
            <li> Unusual in this day and age.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> it makes things so much easier.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much easier to remove.</li>
            <li> I know it works on real nail becuase</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I thought the product worked very well.</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> so idk how much longer it lasts after that).</li>
            <li> Even if you get a real stubborn polish that won&#x27;t peel off well, it makes using nail polish remover a lot easier.</li>
            <li> and it worked very well.</li>
            <li> I used to hesitate before using glitter nail polish but it changed thanks to OPI Glitter Off.</li>
            <li> Makes removal so much easier.</li>
            <li> Does this really work?</li>
            <li> Thought it would go faster than it really is.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m really upset</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this.</li>
            <li> It makes it so much easier to get glittery</li>
            <li> Looks and smells like Elmer&#x27;s glue, so maybe the DIY on Pinterest really does work.</li>
            <li> My main issue was that the nail polish started peeling off on its own after less than a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to redo many of my nails due to that happening.  </li>
            <li> It took just as long as the old soak-with-foils method and frankly caused more discomfort.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you let it dry completely before applying polish.</li>
            <li> I had made my own &#x27;glue&#x27; mixture in the past but that would pop off in a day or 2.  </li>
            <li> This works just as I expected it to - peels off easily.  </li>
            <li> The first one I got from Amazon smelled and applied exactly the same.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, the product I received was not the same.</li>
            <li> It smells so much like White glue you use in elementary school that I zone off to then when ever I use it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this when I bought it.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You should also use at least 3 coats to make sure it&#x27;s sticky enough to peel off easily.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use a fairly heavy coat (maybe 2 layers) and then skip the cuticle and nail oil while you&#x27;re wearing your glitter mani (I found the oil will make it lift before you want it to).</li>
            <li> so I think it will work better for gels and heavy embellishing.</li>
            <li> Then I applied my full glitter Alice in Wonderland polish, which normally requires a box of Q-tips and a long movie to remove.</li>
            <li> Peeled off within an hour of normal wear.</li>
            <li> On a few nails, there were more pieces.  </li>
            <li> I love to use glitter polish, but have always had trouble with some of the brands coming off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this is just watered down white glue</li>
            <li> If you change your polish or wear glitter constantly, it&#x27;s great and less messy than polish remover.</li>
            <li> well-the entire nail of polish comes right off with the slightest push.</li>
            <li> You need multiple layers of this before the glitter for it to work right.</li>
            <li> the only thing i did notice however is that if you only use a light coat of glitter</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re just using lacquer and a little glitter, the Elmer&#x27;s might work for you - and you can buy another bottle of lacquer with the money saved! :)</li>
            <li> What more can I say, I am a woman of few words!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The other reviews are correct though, it behaves a LOT like Elmer&#x27;s School Glue from when I was a kid, and the scent is hauntingly familiar as well...</li>
            <li> Because they pop off easily, with little to no effort.</li>
            <li> That bottle will sit in my clean up drawer for a while except for extreme emergencies.</li>
            <li> By the next day (not even a full 24 hours later!)</li>
            <li> I usually swipe a little polish remover just to make sure my nails are completely clean</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it dozens of times now with all kinds of tough glitters and shimmer polishes and for the most part, it really does peel off in 1-3 pieces per nail.  </li>
            <li> That being said, it really does allow you to simply remove nail polish and it does not ruin your natural nails.</li>
            <li> It dries clear.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a clear liquid</li>
            <li> but it dries (mostly) clear.  </li>
            <li> have natural nails.&lt;br /&gt;Recd:&lt;br /&gt;Orly</li>
            <li> Bonder for basecoat on Natural nails&lt;</li>
            <li> This works really well if you use two coats of it before the regular polish, and then sort of baby your toes so it doesn&#x27;t peel off before you want it to.  </li>
            <li> It smells suspiciously like Elmer&#x27;s glue, and it very well might be something quite similar.  </li>
            <li> May require preventative clear coat touchups too if you want it to last more than a few days.  </li>
            <li> It was my only BLING, and only rarely because well, I just couldn&#x27;t get it off.  </li>
            <li> I applied this product on first, then 2 layers of normal pink color, then 2 glitter layers, topped them off with a thick clear top coat.</li>
            <li> down side is that if the edge lifts off for whatever reason, the nail polish begins to quickly wear off or peel off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you have to go through so many pads of cotton or wipes and they keep tearing etc its ridiculous.</li>
            <li> After peeling off the main portions of my nail polish, I still go back with nail polish remover to get all of the nooks and crannys.</li>
            <li> but it is definitely easier to remove my glitter and normal nail</li>
            <li> It helped it come off so much that my entire nail color was peeling off the next day!  </li>
            <li> but when i&#x27;ve used several coats to make it thick on top of this glitter-off coat.</li>
            <li> For the most part, it lasts just as long as a regular polish (unless you&#x27;re doing something particularly harsh with your nails like picking at stuff).</li>
            <li> I did my nails, letting them dry between each coat, and my manicure began pealing off within a couple hours just through normal use!  </li>
            <li> I love glitter polish, but have always tried to use it at a min since it&#x27;s so tough to remove it.</li>
            <li> I used to buy strong polish removers to get rid of thick glitter coats, but those didn&#x27;t really work and it took me several tries to get it completely removed.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly as it says, 1 coat of glitter off, allow to dry and 2 coats of glitter polish, allow to dry and add a clear topcoat to seal.  </li>
            <li> I had a hard time getting it off with acetone free polish remover as well.</li>
            <li> I used two coats, it goes on white, dries clear.</li>
            <li> :O</li>
            <li> all ten of my nails were either completely peeled off or chipped.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li> later, my index &amp; thumb nails were completely bear.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing for this to be sold as an authentic product when it is just a cheap knock off.</li>
            <li> It initially goes on cloudy white but as it dries it becomes clear.</li>
            <li> I had a professional application of OPI Goldeneye several years ago, and flat out couldn&#x27;t get it off.</li>
            <li> I change my nail polish almost every other day and my nails are usually pretty dry from all the remover they&#x27;re exposed to.</li>
            <li> Super convenient, no more struggling to remove nail decals, glitter, etc!</li>
            <li> Absolutely takes time stress &amp; time out of removing glitter &amp; stained nails from dark shades!</li>
            <li> This base coat is AWESOME when used with your Glitter polishes AND very Dark shades.  </li>
            <li> Its the same as kiesque just cheaper and dries clear instead of pink.</li>
            <li> This base coat dries quickly and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I used it properly as per instructions, allowed it to dry, followed with 1 creme coat then 2 glitter coats and finally topped it all with Seche Vite.  </li>
            <li> I was a little concerned that it would peel off before I wanted it to, but so far I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it!</li>
            <li> Polish doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> It was somewhat difficult to get a grasp on it to start peeling away, but once I did it came off fairly easily.  </li>
            <li> It has a very short dry time and peeling is a breeze.</li>
            <li> I would just stick to regular base coat if you want your nail polish to last more than a day!</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend and will be repurchasing, though you have to be so careful when choosing sellers on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I will keep buying as long as they make this stuff.  </li>
            <li> If you have your hands in water for extended time (like to do the dishes), you may want to wear gloves, as it does seem susceptible to peeling off after long soaks in water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> yourselves the wait to get this hot product.&lt;br /&gt;Yep-just put some glue in an old nail polish bottle, thin it down, and</li>
            <li> The only negative I find, is that once dried, nail polish can literally glide right off the nail unintentionally...which can be an inconvenience.</li>
            <li> My new favorite base coat even for non-glitter and lighter polish.</li>
            <li> This stuff does work if you put on 2 coats which don&#x27;t take that long to dry.  </li>
            <li> I love the glitter look, but had such a hard to impossible time getting some of it off, that I used it few times but it wasn&#x27;t worth the struggle to remove it.  </li>
            <li> - you cannot use this product with nail tip guide stickers or tape (like to do a French manicure or other tape based design work).  </li>
            <li> After I used this, I tried peeling glitter nail polish off when my other nails of a different color started chipping, and it wouldn&#x27;t peel!</li>
            <li> I used opi drip,dry to dry my mails.  </li>
            <li> It needs to be completely dry before you try to peel it off.  </li>
            <li> You paint on one coat and let dry before using your glitter polish.</li>
            <li> my nails don&#x27;t seem to be brittle or dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been scrubbing with stripped all the oils from my fingers, too, and made my hands really dry.)  </li>
            <li> Unless you like to paint your nails every single day--do not buy this product.  </li>
            <li> I do not have time for polish changes every single day.  </li>
            <li> It is also a great base, because my polish lasted just as long  with this base as it does with my other favorite bases.  </li>
            <li> Having this as a base coat encourages me to switch things up if only because it&#x27;s so freaking easy!</li>
            <li> Instead, I used two thin layers, letting each layer dry very well.</li>
            <li> I like to do somewhat of a thick coat before applying, because if you use too thin a coat, it doesn&#x27;t peel off as easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely better than the do it yourself glue base coat, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I accidentally bumped one of my nails in the shower the first day, and it started to peel off from there!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t rate it higher because unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t allow the polish to stay on long.  </li>
            <li> While with a normal base coat my textured polishes could last 7-10 days through cleaning with chemicals and hot showers</li>
            <li> but that was expected</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so difficult to find this product in Beauty supplies stores, it is worth it to buy it online</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rough w/my hands</li>
            <li> Until now, I&#x27;ve been using plain white glue.</li>
            <li> When I decided to change the color all I had to do was poke the polish from one of the corners and it all came off easily no removing solution necessary.</li>
            <li> the rest of the day, but the little (not literally) OCD monkey got me by evening, and</li>
            <li> I applied it and noticed when I started putting polish over it that it wasn&#x27;t fully dry yet - not sure how long you have to wait</li>
            <li> I will definitely try this glitter-off base again because I am not one to give up easily</li>
            <li> At first I thought it had weirdly coagulated onto one side of my nail, and I did two coats on one hand, and one coat on the other to compare.</li>
            <li> After that, I kept it on the other nine nails</li>
            <li> My nail polish rippled almost immediately after I put this stuff on after accidentally bumping my fingernail on a sharp edge.  </li>
            <li> I used this last night, and wanting to test the peelability of it peeled it off of a couple of small nails.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I used it properly so need to do again.</li>
            <li> Chipping/length of wear were the same as with other base coats and with no base coat.  </li>
            <li> I just pretty much left my glitter nail polishes at the back of the drawer never to be used because I couldn&#x27;t remove the stupid stuff.  </li>
            <li> did notice this shrinks a bit more than other base coats, so you would want to try to get some on the edges of your nails and over to the other side if you can</li>
            <li> But I love that it comes in a bottle with a brush like any other base coat.  </li>
            <li> Note that this does not work under regular polish, just glitters (at least for me; I hoped it would work for both</li>
            <li> However, it carries a big negative in</li>
            <li> Pops off when you are ready like a fake fingernail without damaging your nails.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s generally not a big deal since I&#x27;m usually over glitter polish after a few days but just a warning on that one.</li>
            <li> This base coat, will hold on more.</li>
            <li> I love this base coat.</li>
            <li> I applied this base, one coat of a color polish with two coats of glitter polish on top, finishing with Seche Vite.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good base coat !</li>
            <li> I dried my toes carefully with the towel after showering, etc.  </li>
            <li> Love glitter polishes, hate removal.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s longer than most base coats.</li>
            <li> so there were a few spots where peeling it off was harder</li>
            <li> The product smelled like Elmer&#x27;s Glue and the labeling seemed a little off, but since it is peel off base coat, I thought it was okay due to many women I have seen use Elmer&#x27;s Glue as their base for glitter at home manicures.</li>
            <li> So....if you can live with that happening at odd moments, and you realllllly hate removing glitter polish the old-fashioned way, this product can be a real time-saver.  </li>
            <li> this base coat barely made it a week before taking a hot shower made it gummy again</li>
            <li> Sephora sells or over for glitter polish in a black pump dispenser bottle.</li>
            <li> Not really worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> so make this product all u got to do is get elmers glue fill it half way in a nail polish bottle then add a little water and shake it</li>
            <li> this base makes removing the glitter polish easy.</li>
            <li> Then just swipe with a little remover to prep your nail for another polish session or to remove any lingering polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only one base coat needed and let dry completely.  </li>
            <li> You have to be a little careful with how hard you might hit your nail edges as it will cause polish to peel.  </li>
            <li> and then u have this product don&#x27;t waste ur time and money on this</li>
            <li> Will do another few tests</li>
            <li> The manicure lasted for 5 days until I finally got tired of it</li>
            <li> I must admit that I had a few chips about 4 days into wearing it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money</li>
            <li> Just everyday actions of writing or answering phones caused the nail polish to peel off.</li>
            <li> I touched up in a few places.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /sparkly nail polish off without destroying your nails.</li>
            <li> Cause using plain glue, at work my mani would just pop off.</li>
            <li> I did have one small section of my thumb come off after a few days</li>
            <li> It dries and hardens to a thick acrylic-like finish in less than a minute.  </li>
            <li> This base has quickly become one of my beauty staples.</li>
            <li> I just changed my polish a little sooner!</li>
            <li> I hated that!&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, Seller shipped quickly!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid of how clear it looks when it dries.</li>
            <li> but for ME it was a waste of money I couldn&#x27;t wait to edivv.com away!</li>
            <li> (my nails were too short to do that, unfortunately).  </li>
            <li> (I usually chose the cuticle end).  </li>
            <li> Fantastic base coat for hard to remove glitter &amp; chunky nail polishes!  </li>
            <li> With the base coat, it came right off.  </li>
            <li> Regular polish remover is time consuming and frustrating because it does a poor job of removing it.  </li>
            <li> This Peel-Able Base Coat works exactly as it claims.</li>
            <li> I will keep it and maybe try adding a base coat first.</li>
            <li> Since getting this, I hardly ever have to use polish remover anymore.</li>
            <li> If you use glitter you know how hard it is to get off with just remover.</li>
            <li> I applied 2 very thin coats and let it dry for 5 minutes before applying glitter polish.</li>
            <li> I need at least two coats of it.</li>
            <li> This base coat really makes it to where you can just peel off your glitter polish.  </li>
            <li> BLoggers have used the trick of elmers glue to make a peelable base for years, and that is really</li>
            <li> i think whatever you put on has to be really thick.</li>
            <li> No more scrubbing and scrubbing to remove glitter!</li>
            <li> I tried it once so far, but I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> I find that this makes things VERY difficult to peel off later.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers mentioned that it tends to not stay on as long as other base coats, but what would you expect from something designed to PEEL OFF?  </li>
            <li> I have really thin nails on my toes and usually when I paint them</li>
            <li> Historically I had such a terrible time taking off glitter nail polish.  </li>
            <li> I went to my local Ulta salon to pick up a few things and saw they still had some OPI Glitter Off base coat</li>
            <li> The time it took to get them off was ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t much different than my usual base coat.</li>
            <li> it comes in the natural nail base coat which I have</li>
            <li> It was the same as scratching nail polish off my nails :(</li>
            <li> My manicure last 1 day and then started to peel one by one :(  </li>
            <li> so whatever you do, to make it work, go thick or go home!</li>
            <li> I tried it as a base coat a few times and it just works a little TOO</li>
            <li> This product game to me broken all over the place smelled just like glue</li>
            <li> I received this broken.</li>
            <li> On the third day I tried to peel off my polish with the base</li>
            <li> The instructions on the tag say to apply one thin coat.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a GAME CHANGER.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the DIY Peel-able base coats, but found they didn&#x27;t hold and the polish would fall off my nail while at work, outside, etc.  </li>
            <li> The only issue I have with the base is that my glitter polish chips in about a day.</li>
            <li> When I tried it, I didn&#x27;t use it as a base coat for glitter polish but for regular polish.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like an expensive bottle of weak Elmer&#x27;s glue.  </li>
            <li> Without this base coat, it was near impossible to remove the glitter.  </li>
            <li> Glitter polish peels off after using base coat as  advertised ,  however polish chips and peels in less than a day.  </li>
            <li> Delivered with bottle broken and had leaked all over in the box!</li>
            <li> I change my manicure every 2-3 days, so I always hesitated to use glitter polishes, or my Zoya Pixie Dust collection, because it was so difficult to remove.  </li>
            <li> Useless.  </li>
            <li> OR if you put non-glitter nail polish and layer with glitter, it&#x27;s a bit difficult to peel and will peel in pieces.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I bought it</li>
            <li> Just apply a thin coat as a base before polish.  </li>
            <li> But I was wrong!</li>
            <li> It was impossible to peel off.</li>
            <li> It smells like Elmer&#x27;s glue (not that that&#x27;s a bad thing).</li>
            <li> With glue base coat, it&#x27;s impossible to do anything with it.</li>
            <li> Did not peel :(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this base coat.</li>
            <li> however I was disappointed with this base coat.</li>
            <li> I wear a lot of glitter polish, so this base coat is a godsend.</li>
            <li> I even use it when I don&#x27;t do nail glitter, just because I hate the smell of nail polish remover, and this makes that obsolete.</li>
            <li> This base allowed me to peel off my polish in one piece without damage to the nail.</li>
            <li> If your thinking of trying this base.</li>
            <li> Just apply as base coat.</li>
            <li> With the OPI glitter off peel-able base coat</li>
            <li> Peel-Able Base Coat, works well.</li>
            <li> I use OPI glitter off peel base coat when I am doing gradient nail art.</li>
            <li> I was just to the point where they were all gone when I found this base coat on amazon.  </li>
            <li> I think since I applied too soon, some bits of the base coat didn&#x27;t stay put</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Now I can use a peel-able base coat, when I am working!</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> The worst part is that I cannot even return the product to Amazon because it is classified as a &amp;</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t adhere to gel nails</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely better than the do it yourself glue base coat, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long. While with a normal base coat my textured polishes could last 7-10 days through cleaning with chemicals and hot showers this base coat barely made it a week before taking a hot shower made it gummy again and it started peeling right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should also use at least 3 coats to make sure it&#x27;s sticky enough to peel off easily.</li>
            <li> This polish peels off too easily, when my daughter isn&#x27;t trying to take it off.</li>
            <li> Helped remove glitter polish quickly.</li>
            <li> I have tried this three different times with three different nailpolishes and cannot get it to peel. I end up having to use nail polish remover anyway.</li>
            <li> This base has quickly become one of my beauty staples. I use it under all of my polishes, not just glitter ones. I find a slightly thicker coat works best for me. I change my nail polish almost every other day and my nails are usually pretty dry from all the remover they&#x27;re exposed to. Since getting this, I hardly ever have to use polish remover anymore. My nails are feeling and looking much better. Definitely recommend and will be repurchasing, though you have to be so careful when choosing sellers on Amazon. I first bought this from Ulta so I knew what it was supposed to be like. The first one I got from Amazon smelled and applied exactly the same. I guess I was lucky as I see a lot of comments about people receiving Elmer&#x27;s glue instead...not cool!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this is just watered down white glue</li>
            <li> This product game to me broken all over the place smelled just like glue there&#x27;s nothing special about this product at all so make this product all u got to do is get elmers glue fill it half way in a nail polish bottle then add a little water and shake it and then u have this product don&#x27;t waste ur time and money on this just make it</li>
            <li> Works like it says it does!</li>
            <li> The jury is still out.  First trial peeled off, but not as well as described.  Will do another few tests</li>
            <li> I wear a lot of glitter polish, so this base coat is a godsend. I like to do somewhat of a thick coat before applying, because if you use too thin a coat, it doesn&#x27;t peel off as easily. Make sure you let it dry completely before applying polish. Note that this does not work under regular polish, just glitters (at least for me; I hoped it would work for both so I could skip using remover, but nope!). Giving 4 stars instead of 5 because sometimes your polish will start to feel off before you&#x27;re ready to remove it, but even then, this makes it easy to reapply when needed!</li>
            <li> It was impossible to peel off. I had a hard time getting it off with acetone free polish remover as well. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is awesome stuff. Works great! It does seem like it&#x27;s just Elmer&#x27;s glue, and hey, it might just be, but it was cheaper to buy this then a nail lacquer bottle and glue to fill it. When this runs out, then maybe I&#x27;ll clean the bottle and put glue in it. But in the meantime, totally worth the buy. And you can use it for clean up purposes around the nails too, or even designs! I used it to make this heart design on my nails. I would recommend buy this product. Have fun!</li>
            <li> I received this broken.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!  Used it several times with great results.  I will keep buying as long as they make this stuff.  I used to buy strong polish removers to get rid of thick glitter coats, but those didn&#x27;t really work and it took me several tries to get it completely removed.  But this works way better and just peels right off.  Doesn&#x27;t really come with a lot of instructions though, so you may have to experiment to see what works best for your needs.  Just apply a thin coat as a base before polish.  Goes on milky white and dries matte clearish.  Only one base coat needed and let dry completely.  Then apply one or more coats of color or glitter.  Make sure to apply a strong clear top coat when you&#x27;re done too, otherwise it will peel too easily with normal activities.  May require preventative clear coat touchups too if you want it to last more than a few days.  If you have your hands in water for extended time (like to do the dishes), you may want to wear gloves, as it does seem susceptible to peeling off after long soaks in water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then once you&#x27;re done with that polish, just gently start peeling from the edges of the nail.  I have a small wooden cuticle pusher that works perfect for this.  Many times, the polish will lift up in one big sheet and leave the nail completely clean.  Then just swipe with a little remover to prep your nail for another polish session or to remove any lingering polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I did learn though - you cannot use this product with nail tip guide stickers or tape (like to do a French manicure or other tape based design work).  Anything adhesive will cause all layers to be pulled up and ruin your manicure.</li>
            <li> This peels off easily, but it peels off all the time. I can&#x27;t keep polish on with this stuff because it just comes right off as soon as you use you hands. Might be good if you really don&#x27;t use your hands to do much?</li>
            <li> This is amazing! I love glitter polish but dreaded taking it off. Just follow the directions and it comes right off!</li>
            <li> Thisi product allows you to wear glitter bulbs easy with no mess. The only negative I find, is that once dried, nail polish can literally glide right off the nail unintentionally...which can be an inconvenience. That being said, it really does allow you to simply remove nail polish and it does not ruin your natural nails.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well and peels off glitter polish very easily.</li>
            <li> This is the best product out there works like a charm LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I tried it once so far, but I&#x27;m disappointed. It lasted well for 3 days. On the third day I tried to peel off my polish with the base and I couldn&#x27;t. It was the same as scratching nail polish off my nails :( It just didn&#x27;t work for me as it was supposed to...</li>
            <li> Works exactly like it says it does! You just need to wait to make sure it&#x27;s fully dry, which can take up to 10 minutes. Make sure you apply at least 2 coats of clear top coat, otherwise your mani will chip off in one day. I applied 1 top coat and it lasted one week. I did another one without any top coat and the nail polish chipped off the very next day. I did another mani where I applied 3 layers of top coat, and it lasted for 1.5 weeks! It peels off easily which I loved, because it didn&#x27;t damage my nail. Super convenient, no more struggling to remove nail decals, glitter, etc! I even use it when I don&#x27;t do nail glitter, just because I hate the smell of nail polish remover, and this makes that obsolete.</li>
            <li> The instructions on the tag say to apply one thin coat. I find that this makes things VERY difficult to peel off later. Instead, I used two thin layers, letting each layer dry very well. Then I used one coat of color, two coats of glitter and one top coat. My manicure was still looking good four days later, even though I use my hands (and wash them) a LOT. I was impressed. If you find you have some left on your nail after peeling, try soaking your fingers in warm water for a bit. This stuff is basically glue, after all. It&#x27;s water soluble.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AAWEESOMEE!! I love glitter polish, but have always tried to use it at a min since it&#x27;s so tough to remove it. This base allowed me to peel off my polish in one piece without damage to the nail. You only need one coat. Don&#x27;t be afraid of how clear it looks when it dries. At first I thought it had weirdly coagulated onto one side of my nail, and I did two coats on one hand, and one coat on the other to compare. Two coats works well too, but my pointer finger polish just flaked off somewhere prematurely and I have no idea where it went? One coat is ideal but it is a little harder to remove.  I used opi drip,dry to dry my mails.  Someone else mentioned that Secha Vite messes with the texture of the coat, so I avoided that. I also feel with glitter polish, it&#x27;s ok if you bump and dent it a bit, since the glitter keeps the dents from showing.  I used essie nail polish and essie glitter flakes (summit something was the name?). I imagine this will also be great for keeping pigmented polishes from staining your nail. All in all, GREAT product.</li>
            <li> It took me forever to find this but I am glad I persevered.  This stuff is great!</li>
            <li> This stuff does work if you put on 2 coats which don&#x27;t take that long to dry.  It needs to be completely dry before you try to peel it off.  If you change your polish or wear glitter constantly, it&#x27;s great and less messy than polish remover.</li>
            <li> It peels off so easy! Unfortunately, I accidentally bumped one of my nails in the shower the first day, and it started to peel off from there! :O(  I can&#x27;t wait to try it again with my glitter polishes!</li>
            <li> Love this!! Works great if wear glitter polish. Just peels off without damaging nails. If you use glitter you know how hard it is to get off with just remover.</li>
            <li> Works well. Make sure your nails are dry and clean, use before base coat.</li>
            <li> This looks white on but dries clear and works awesome!</li>
            <li> I Love this new top coat! Until now, I&#x27;ve been using plain white glue. I was thinking, since this Opi Peel looks the same, that it would be the same as glue. But I was wrong! Glue wants to pop off alot easier than this stuff. With glue base coat, it&#x27;s impossible to do anything with it. Because they pop off easily, with little to no effort. This base coat, will hold on more. I LOVE that!! Now I can use a peel-able base coat, when I am working! Thats priceless to me! Cause using plain glue, at work my mani would just pop off. I hated that!&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, Seller shipped quickly! Would buy again from Cosmetics Central :-) If your thinking of trying this base. You NEED to give it a go! you won&#x27;t be sorry :-) :-) :-)</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this base coat. I always dread getting glitter nail polish off so thought that this might be the perfect solution. It helped it come off so much that my entire nail color was peeling off the next day!  It is also a matte white do I do not think you could put a clear glitter top coat over it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I had no issues with it peeling off prematurely. I applied 2 very thin coats and let it dry for 5 minutes before applying glitter polish. I&#x27;m so excited that I can wear glitter polish again without the dread of the process to take it off.</li>
            <li> I tried this yesterday, it is great. I love the glitter look, but had such a hard to impossible time getting some of it off, that I used it few times but it wasn&#x27;t worth the struggle to remove it.  I had a professional application of OPI Goldeneye several years ago, and flat out couldn&#x27;t get it off. Now, with the Peel-Able I&#x27;m ready to buy a bottle. I loved the color with my summer skin tone. Lots of Bling. Enjoy this product and have fun. This Peel-Able Base Coat works exactly as it claims. I found if you use your thumb nail at the side, easy does it and it comes off easily.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is very effective. After I used this, I tried peeling glitter nail polish off when my other nails of a different color started chipping, and it wouldn&#x27;t peel! Wasn&#x27;t much different than my usual base coat.</li>
            <li> Glitter polish peels off after using base coat as  advertised ,  however polish chips and peels in less than a day.  Does not hold up doing dishes etc.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!!! Smells like Elmer&#x27;s glue. Lol. Polish doesn&#x27;t last very long but that was expected and I wash a lot of dishes. Makes wearing glitter polish more fun and easier since you don&#x27;t have to battle removing it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a GAME CHANGER.  I just pretty much left my glitter nail polishes at the back of the drawer never to be used because I couldn&#x27;t remove the stupid stuff.  This base coat really makes it to where you can just peel off your glitter polish.  REALLY.  Make sure you use a fairly heavy coat (maybe 2 layers) and then skip the cuticle and nail oil while you&#x27;re wearing your glitter mani (I found the oil will make it lift before you want it to).</li>
            <li> Just apply as base coat. Polish nails. When ready to take points l u should off, I just peel it off. Does not damage my nails!!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife. Delivered with bottle broken and had leaked all over in the box!</li>
            <li> I used this product twice under glitter nail polish.  It really works to be able to remove especially the glitter polish.  You have to be a little careful with how hard you might hit your nail edges as it will cause polish to peel.  Otherwise worked great.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but I had to this time. This is a fantastic product! You paint on one coat and let dry before using your glitter polish. This base coat dries quickly and is easy to apply. No need to be a perfectionist. Doesn&#x27;t matter.&lt;br /&gt;I showered and washed my hair and washed dishes. The polish did not peel or pop off. When I was ready to take it off, I just peeled it from the edge and it came right off. No damage to the nail.&lt;br /&gt;This is magic.</li>
            <li> I got this and use it with large glitter nail polish but it doesn&#x27;t work as great as I hoped it would.</li>
            <li> I am VERY conservative when it comes to my clothing, makeup, etc., but I LOVE glitter nail polish.  It was my only BLING, and only rarely because well, I just couldn&#x27;t get it off.  Woohoo, this WORKS.  Some reviewers mentioned that it tends to not stay on as long as other base coats, but what would you expect from something designed to PEEL OFF?  I think it does just what it says it will do, I didn&#x27;t expect it to last weeks.  I just want BLING, and I got it!</li>
            <li> This works too well...nail polish starts peeling off on its own within hours.</li>
            <li> This works just as I expected it to - peels off easily.  For the most part, it lasts just as long as a regular polish (unless you&#x27;re doing something particularly harsh with your nails like picking at stuff).</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I saw a YouTube video where a nail technician was using this product. So I jumped right on Amazon to buy it. Works great...BUT after I ordered it, I saw a posting on Facebook where someone used Elmer&#x27;s School Glue to do the same thing. This OPI product is a heavier consistency so I think it will work better for gels and heavy embellishing. But if you&#x27;re just using lacquer and a little glitter, the Elmer&#x27;s might work for you - and you can buy another bottle of lacquer with the money saved! :)</li>
            <li> Does not work.  Needed remover to take off.  Did not peel :(</li>
            <li> It works exactly as advertised. Unusual in this day and age. What more can I say, I am a woman of few words! That is also unusual, right?</li>
            <li> amazing.. I use to use it every time now with glitter&lt;br /&gt;easy to use and more easy to remove&lt;br /&gt;I can do any design I want without any concern how I&#x27;ll remove</li>
            <li> BLoggers have used the trick of elmers glue to make a peelable base for years, and that is really all this is.  It is same consistency and smell.  I don&#x27;t know what is special about this formula to make it work the money, but you may want to just try the shortcut.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to use a solid coat, no thin or skipped spots or it won&#x27;t peel off in one piece.  It dries clear.</li>
            <li> Life changing.  Glitter polish?  Bring it on.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly!! I was a little concerned that it would peel off before I wanted it to, but so far I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it!</li>
            <li> I love glitter polishes and was so hoping this product would solve the nightmare that is the removal of glitter polish, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.  I used it properly as per instructions, allowed it to dry, followed with 1 creme coat then 2 glitter coats and finally topped it all with Seche Vite.  The manicure lasted for 5 days until I finally got tired of it (I like to change up my nails often) and thought, \\&quot;Time to peel these babies off!\\&quot;  Only...they didn&#x27;t peel.  Not even close.  I ended up getting a tapered wooden cuticle stick and chipping away at each nail as though I were using a hammer and chisel.  It took just as long as the old soak-with-foils method and frankly caused more discomfort.  Since this product worked so well for so many others, I am thinking perhaps it was the top coat.  Seche Vite is truly a miraculous finishing touch to any manicure.  It dries and hardens to a thick acrylic-like finish in less than a minute.  But perhaps that was the reason I had to chisel away at my manicure?  If anyone has any comments/suggestions, I&#x27;d love to hear them!  I will definitely try this glitter-off base again because I am not one to give up easily and I so adore my glittery polishes that there must be a way....  I will update this post when I do.    UPDATE, 8/8/14, added a star:  I tried this again and had way better results.  This time I did NOT use a Seche Vite top coat, as I&#x27;d theorized perhaps the hard-as-acrylic surface of that topper might have doomed my first experiment.  Lo and behold, this time the polish came off in 1 or 2 big pieces per nail, just as advertised.  I will try it once more for the \\&quot;tiebreaker\\&quot; and report back if this is the real deal.  Man, I hope so... my glitter polishes are calling to me!  :-)    FINAL UPDATE:  2/09/15:  The tiebreaker settled it:  this product is pretty darned good, I&#x27;d give it 3.5 stars!  I&#x27;ve used it dozens of times now with all kinds of tough glitters and shimmer polishes and for the most part, it really does peel off in 1-3 pieces per nail.  However, it carries a big negative in that sometimes it works so well, a layer of polish will just pop right off one of your nails when you don&#x27;t want it to!  I&#x27;ve had to redo many of my nails due to that happening.  So....if you can live with that happening at odd moments, and you realllllly hate removing glitter polish the old-fashioned way, this product can be a real time-saver.  Definitely try it out and see how it works for you!</li>
            <li> Great for the outsides of your nails, not your nails themselves, when you&#x27;re doing a gradient mani (or if you&#x27;re just messy like I am). I tried it as a base coat a few times and it just works a little TOO well-the entire nail of polish comes right off with the slightest push. Definitely recommend it if you want to wear a polish just for a day, or if you&#x27;re using on on the skin around your nails, but not so great as a base coat.</li>
            <li> This definitely worked (almost too well, actually). I used two coats, it goes on white, dries clear. Then I applied my full glitter Alice in Wonderland polish, which normally requires a box of Q-tips and a long movie to remove. This time, I applied it on Sunday, and made it to Tuesday when opening a soda popped the polish right off my index finger! After that, I kept it on the other nine nails the rest of the day, but the little (not literally) OCD monkey got me by evening, and I tried taking off the rest of the polish by lightly pressing and peeling up at the bottom corners.&lt;br /&gt;Under two minutes and it was all off!&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll skip this when I want to keep polish on for a week or so, but if I&#x27;m just looking for an &amp;#34;event&amp;#34; look, it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other reviews are correct though, it behaves a LOT like Elmer&#x27;s School Glue from when I was a kid, and the scent is hauntingly familiar as well...</li>
            <li> It was somewhat difficult to get a grasp on it to start peeling away, but once I did it came off fairly easily.  I only wish it came off in larger pieces, it was more pick and scrap than it was peel.  Overall, I&#x27;d recommend it!</li>
            <li> Where has this been all my life?  Fantastic base coat for hard to remove glitter &amp; chunky nail polishes!  Makes removal a snap!  Pops off when you are ready like a fake fingernail without damaging your nails.  It is also a great base, because my polish lasted just as long  with this base as it does with my other favorite bases.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this base coat. I have a full review on my blog with photos to show just how well this works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> Historically I had such a terrible time taking off glitter nail polish.  With the OPI glitter off peel-able base coat it makes things so much easier.  This a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It works well, but it&#x27;s a double-edged sword. Nail polish does not last as long, but on the bright side it&#x27;s much easier to remove. It can peel off prematurely.</li>
            <li> but let me explain...I was lied to. THIS DOES NOT WORK WITH ACRYLIC NAILS!!! Do not buy this if that is what you are using it for and to tell the truth...I think this is just glue LOL It smells like Elmers glue. I know it works on real nail becuase I watched many YouTubers demonstrate it but for ME it was a waste of money I couldn&#x27;t wait to edivv.com away! I actually destroyed and hurt my thumb trying to peel with an orange stick on my acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get the glitter polish to peel off but it was very easy to remove with nail polisher remover.  Without this base coat, it was near impossible to remove the glitter.  With the base coat, it came right off.  Glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I am thanking the nail polish Gods for this product.  I LOVE IT.  I change my manicure every 2-3 days, so I always hesitated to use glitter polishes, or my Zoya Pixie Dust collection, because it was so difficult to remove.  The Glitter Off allows me to remove my polish easily and without nail damage.  I&#x27;ve tried the DIY Peel-able base coats, but found they didn&#x27;t hold and the polish would fall off my nail while at work, outside, etc.  I haven&#x27;t experienced that with this product.  I&#x27;m now making good use of my glitter polishes.</li>
            <li> Not what I imagined. I used it once and after cleaning and cooking (5 hours later) it came right off!!</li>
            <li> This product does work, the glitter nail polish peels right off.  I didn&#x27;t rate it higher because unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t allow the polish to stay on long.  I followed the directions exactly as it says, 1 coat of glitter off, allow to dry and 2 coats of glitter polish, allow to dry and add a clear topcoat to seal.  My manicure last 1 day and then started to peel one by one :(  I will keep it and maybe try adding a base coat first.</li>
            <li> This base coat is AWESOME when used with your Glitter polishes AND very Dark shades.  Absolutely takes time stress &amp; time out of removing glitter &amp; stained nails from dark shades! LOVE this item, thanks OPI!</li>
            <li> This product does what it says.  Super easy to peel off the polish.  I applied this base, one coat of a color polish with two coats of glitter polish on top, finishing with Seche Vite.  I must admit that I had a few chips about 4 days into wearing it but I kind of expected that.  I just changed my polish a little sooner!</li>
            <li> I read online that this peels off prematurely, but I didn&#x27;t have that problem at all. Shipping was fast. I thought the product worked very well.</li>
            <li> Horrible. Smells like elders glue. Don&#x27;t waste money</li>
            <li> Useless.  I used as directed and nail polish does not stay on.  Peeled off within an hour of normal wear.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product under the impression from the description and marketing that this was an authentic OPI product. However, after opening my packaging, I was concerned. The product smelled like Elmer&#x27;s Glue and the labeling seemed a little off, but since it is peel off base coat, I thought it was okay due to many women I have seen use Elmer&#x27;s Glue as their base for glitter at home manicures. I went to my local Ulta salon to pick up a few things and saw they still had some OPI Glitter Off base coat and I opened it to compare to what I had received from this seller. Sure enough, the product I received was not the same. Very disappointing for this to be sold as an authentic product when it is just a cheap knock off. Will not be ordering from them again.</li>
            <li> Ok so I have to say this works REALLY well for me as far as my nails not shipping. The low rating was because I couldn&#x27;t peel it off to save my life!  I tried for 5 minutes on each nail and I had a good 3 coats of this stuff on. My nails didn&#x27;t ship for a week though. Haha. Sephora sells or over for glitter polish in a black pump dispenser bottle. That got the glitter off!</li>
            <li> this is the best thing since sliced bread! you see, when you put on glitter nail polish it is a beast to get off as you know. you have to go through so many pads of cotton or wipes and they keep tearing etc its ridiculous. if you put a nice coat of this stuff under the glitter you want to wear, it will stay on no problems for several days without chipping or peeling off (i&#x27;ve never worn it for more than a few days in a row so idk how much longer it lasts after that). when you are ready to remove, simply get a fingernail up under the nail polish of the desired finger/nail and it will peel right off!!!! its amazing! the only thing i did notice however is that if you only use a light coat of glitter OR if you put non-glitter nail polish and layer with glitter, it&#x27;s a bit difficult to peel and will peel in pieces. why? i think whatever you put on has to be really thick. so i&#x27;ve even taken off non-glitter nail polish in a breeze but when i&#x27;ve used several coats to make it thick on top of this glitter-off coat. so whatever you do, to make it work, go thick or go home!</li>
            <li> I wear a lot of glitter polish and it is a beast to get off. This OPI Glitter off Peel-Able Base Coat, works well. I need at least two coats of it. It smells so much like White glue you use in elementary school that I zone off to then when ever I use it. Even if you get a real stubborn polish that won&#x27;t peel off well, it makes using nail polish remover a lot easier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so difficult to find this product in Beauty supplies stores, it is worth it to buy it online and it&#x27;s free shipping! I love this base coat, I do my nails every week and this works perfectly for me, I don&#x27;t problems at all,. Doing my nails is so much easier now!</li>
            <li> Works great but you can make your own version for pennies out of watered-down white school glue.  I thought this might be more sophisticated but it isn&#x27;t.  Its useful but I&#x27;d have kept my money had I known...</li>
            <li> I use two coats under glitter or any polish.  It dries pretty fast.  Under regular polish, the color comes off with a swipe or two.  Glitter polish takes about five seconds more.  I use a rubber tipped manicure stick, start the edge and it peels off in one piece.  I usually swipe a little polish remover just to make sure my nails are completely clean but that&#x27;s it.  Bonus: my nails don&#x27;t seem to be brittle or dry.</li>
            <li> Not as good as other products I&#x27;ve used, but it does the job!</li>
            <li> Unless you like to paint your nails every single day--do not buy this product.  I was excited to receive this product and wear my glitter nail polishes.  I painted my nails in the afternoon and by evening three nails had already chipped.  By the next day (not even a full 24 hours later!) all ten of my nails were either completely peeled off or chipped.  I do not have time for polish changes every single day.  The worst part is that I cannot even return the product to Amazon because it is classified as a &amp;#34;hazardous material.&amp;#34; So, I have lost that money.</li>
            <li> convenient but you need to do twice</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  I&#x27;ve only used it once so far but it was great!  My glitter polish stayed on for 6 days and removed easily.  I did have one small section of my thumb come off after a few days but I just redid that part.  The rest was fine.  I had made my own &#x27;glue&#x27; mixture in the past but that would pop off in a day or 2.  I was very pleased with the way this adhered to the nail.  ** When I applied it I didn&#x27;t go all the way to the edges and then applied the polish and top coat to the edges which I feel may have given it a better seal and it worked very well.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have with the base is that my glitter polish chips in about a day. It does do it&#x27;s purpose though of making sure it comes off easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good base coat ! I used to hesitate before using glitter nail polish but it changed thanks to OPI Glitter Off. I you want to see how easy it is to use, you can check this link : https://fr.peoplbrain.com/tutoriaux/maquillage/utiliser-la-base-opi-glitter-off-pour-retirer-son-vernis-a-paillettes-sans-dissolvant</li>
            <li> I love to wear glitter polish on my toes. Makes removal so much easier.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use. I use OPI glitter off peel base coat when I am doing gradient nail art.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this formula.  Peels/Chips off too easily.&lt;br /&gt;I like to use my own &amp; bring my products when I get a manicure.&lt;br /&gt;I have natural nails.&lt;br /&gt;Recd:&lt;br /&gt;Orly Bonder for basecoat on Natural nails&lt;br /&gt;China Glaze lacquer is best value for $ @ Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.&lt;br /&gt;Good values for nail polish online @ Head to Toe.&lt;br /&gt;I have bought several Essie nail polishes online.&lt;br /&gt;I use OPI top coat.  I like it much better than Seche Vite.&lt;br /&gt;Sally&#x27;s worker recommended Out the Door top coat - plan to try that next.</li>
            <li> I had finally given up on glitter polishes.  The time it took to get them off was ridiculous.  I was just about to throw them all in the garbage when I stumbled upon this product.  This works fantastic!!  When I&#x27;m ready for a change I just peel off and am done!  I am going to purchase several more of these for my nieces this Christmas.  I think their mom will love this product just as much as I do and they can use for any type of polish without having to get out the nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> This works really well if you use two coats of it before the regular polish, and then sort of baby your toes so it doesn&#x27;t peel off before you want it to.  I dried my toes carefully with the towel after showering, etc.  Tried one coat, didn&#x27;t work as well, so definitely go for the two coats.  Only problem I have is that it takes FOREVER to dry, if it was fast dry, it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> Does this really work? Yes it does! Great item!</li>
            <li> Peeled off too easily!! Manicure not staying</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t find this too great. I&#x27;m going to try again.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product and I love most OPI stuff however I was disappointed with this base coat. I did my nails, letting them dry between each coat, and my manicure began pealing off within a couple hours just through normal use!  I would just stick to regular base coat if you want your nail polish to last more than a day!</li>
            <li> My nail polish rippled almost immediately after I put this stuff on after accidentally bumping my fingernail on a sharp edge.  Yes, I followed the instructions.  My polish also didn&#x27;t come off as easily as the product claimed it would.  It&#x27;s like an expensive bottle of weak Elmer&#x27;s glue.  It smells like Elmer&#x27;s glue (not that that&#x27;s a bad thing).</li>
            <li> The idea of a glitter off basecoat is a good one,but this misses the mark.  The polish came off  too easily.  Just everyday actions of writing or answering phones caused the nail polish to peel off. It didn&#x27;t even last 3 hours.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! I have used it for glitter and around my nail to keep a clean manicure look. Works awesome either way. Thought it would go faster than it really is. I do plan on buying more. Its the same as kiesque just cheaper and dries clear instead of pink. And a bigger brush to apply it with. I prefer this over Kiesque Liquid Palisade. That bottle will sit in my clean up drawer for a while except for extreme emergencies.</li>
            <li> The concept is great and it did allow my glitter nailpolish to be peeled off.  My main issue was that the nail polish started peeling off on its own after less than a day. Bummer.</li>
            <li> OPI is incredible. This is exactly what I need!!!! It works great.  You put on the cuticles and skin around the nail and it easily peels off any polish that isn&#x27;t on the nail.  LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Peels off way to easily. Lasts maybe a day before it starts to come off.&lt;br /&gt;Smells and looks like elmers glue.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews because I&#x27;m generally happy with everything I get from Amazon but I&#x27;m really upset this is pretty much elmers glue in an OPI bottle it doesn&#x27;t even come in the peelable glitter bottle it comes in the natural nail base coat which I have it&#x27;s a clear liquid so they are putting glue into these nail polish bottles and calling it OPI glitter offthe only reason that I rated it 2 stars was because Elmer&#x27;s glue does work pretty good but I could have paid $2 for this at the dollar storeand put it in my own nail polish bottle</li>
            <li> This product does exact as it says...peels off &amp; I say that in a good way. When I tried it, I didn&#x27;t use it as a base coat for glitter polish but for regular polish.  I&#x27;m rough w/my hands so a day (or 2) later, my index &amp; thumb nails were completely bear.  The polish came right off. When it was time to remove the polish from the others, it peels right off.  No leftover polish residue.  I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this. I was so excited when the box arrived.  I have really thin nails on my toes and usually when I paint them I get these white marks that have to be grown out.  I was just to the point where they were all gone when I found this base coat on amazon.  I used this last night, and wanting to test the peelability of it peeled it off of a couple of small nails.  It did take the top layer of my nail off with it.  I tried to use nail polish remover to the rest of it off and it wont come off.  Going to spend the rest of the week picking at it.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this when I bought it.  I liked that it came off easier than if I hadn&#x27;t used it, but it tended to chip more than normal.  Within a day, I had chips on the ends of my nails.  I&#x27;ve only used it twice and had the same result, but am hoping that maybe it was just the nail polish brand.</li>
            <li> Excellent, love the idea of not having to remove with polish, just peel off.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I used it properly so need to do again.</li>
            <li> I only gave this 4 stars because the peeling, while total and removes all of the glitter polish easily, only works for me in one place: the shower. I imagine I can take a shower, to soften the polish, then afterward scrape it off with one nail with my hands in a bowl of warm water, so the bits of nail polish don&#x27;t go down the drain. But it works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used all the same. ALL polish comes off as purported. Although I didn&#x27;t use a topcoat. I will try that, and update if I have a different outcome.</li>
            <li> This is just great. No more scrubbing and scrubbing to remove glitter! It wears well and as they stated removal is a snap. You can change colors quickly too. My new favorite base coat even for non-glitter and lighter polish.</li>
            <li> Love glitter polishes, hate removal.  This makes it so easy!  Don&#x27;t know how I lived without it. A must have.</li>
            <li> I think this product marks the first time I have ever purchased something after seeing it in a magazine ad.  But I happened upon the ad a day or two after spending 20 minutes trying to remove glitter polish from my fingers and toes.  (The acetone I&#x27;d been scrubbing with stripped all the oils from my fingers, too, and made my hands really dry.)  I love glitter polish, but what a pain!  So I had to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was very easy to apply.  It goes on fairly smoothly and evenly.  It&#x27;s white when you put it on but it dries (mostly) clear.  I used two coats to make sure I got even coverage.  Then I put on some glitter polish (I&#x27;ve now used this with two different Zoya glitter polishes).  The polish went on perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice this shrinks a bit more than other base coats, so you would want to try to get some on the edges of your nails and over to the other side if you can (my nails were too short to do that, unfortunately).  Chipping/length of wear were the same as with other base coats and with no base coat.  I touched up in a few places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then it came time to take this off.  And I was amazed.  For most of my nails, the polish came off in a single sheet.  All I had to do was start peeling at a corner (I usually chose the cuticle end).  On a few nails, there were more pieces.  When I was done, I barely had to use one cotton ball with acetone to clean up, and that was mostly on the edges where I&#x27;d done touch-ups.  It was so fast and easy!  It didn&#x27;t do any damage to my nails, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyway, this stuff is great.  It smells suspiciously like Elmer&#x27;s glue, and it very well might be something quite similar.  But I love that it comes in a bottle with a brush like any other base coat.  This is one nail product I may finish off completely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note, though: don&#x27;t soak your hands in warm water or your nailpolish will slide right off.  This must be water soluble.  It was fine through regular-length showers but when I tried to take a bath, I lost my manicure!tried to take a bath, I lost my manicure!</li>
            <li> Does what it says. Really great idea, but upon using it, it appears to have many of the same  characteristics of white glue...which would probably do the same thing. Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> this base makes removing the glitter polish easy.</li>
            <li> This does what is says it will do for the most part. I applied it and noticed when I started putting polish over it that it wasn&#x27;t fully dry yet - not sure how long you have to wait but it&#x27;s longer than most base coats. It almost has a more glue like texture. So just wait a lot longer than you expect. I think since I applied too soon, some bits of the base coat didn&#x27;t stay put so there were a few spots where peeling it off was harder but I bet if I gave it more time, it would work perfectly. Also, if you are a bit rough on your nails (washing dishes, swimming, anything with your hands really), the polish might start to peel off on its own! That&#x27;s generally not a big deal since I&#x27;m usually over glitter polish after a few days but just a warning on that one. Mine did start to come off of a few of my nails before I was ready to remove it.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing breakthrough in polish and nail care. I used with the new OPI glitter polish and it looked fabulous. It has a very short dry time and peeling is a breeze. In fact you need to be kind to your nails or your whole piece of nail art will just pop off!</li>
            <li> I love to use glitter polish, but have always had trouble with some of the brands coming off. This is definitely a solution. I had two problems with it, one you need to make sure you get it on your full nail, if you don&#x27;t get right to the edge, you&#x27;ll have glitter all around the edge of your nail. Second, because it works so well if you bump it, off it comes. But even with this, it is a great product. The polish comes off, all it one piece its great.</li>
            <li> No, this isn&#x27;t for marathon manicures.&lt;br /&gt;Allows you to have your glitter and wear it too. Having this as a base coat encourages me to switch things up if only because it&#x27;s so freaking easy! Am happy to add the glitters shoved in the back of my stash into my rotation without dreading the foil at the end of the tunnel.&lt;br /&gt;As with so much else, body chemistry plays a pivotal role and will determine if this is a holy grail or money pit product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t peel off in one piece but it is definitely easier to remove my glitter and normal nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;One down side is that if the edge lifts off for whatever reason, the nail polish begins to quickly wear off or peel off.&lt;br /&gt;However, it is good for someone like me, I change my nail polish about once a week. After peeling off the main portions of my nail polish, I still go back with nail polish remover to get all of the nooks and crannys.</li>
            <li> Will never polish my nails again without this product.  Regular polish remover is time consuming and frustrating because it does a poor job of removing it.  Stopped using it years ago and switched to acetone.  I don&#x27;t like using it because of the fumes and potential to spill and ruin hardwood floors, not to mention the lungs.  Therefore, I use it outside.  With Peel-Able, the polish comes off in one or two strips.  Wonderful.</li>
            <li> Great product! Arrived on time, packaged nicely. All you have to do is apply one layer of this and then add as many glitter layers as you wish. When the times comes all you have to do is push it off from one corner and it all comes off so easily without harming your nails. It doesn&#x27;t peel off on its own no matter what you do. I applied this product on first, then 2 layers of normal pink color, then 2 glitter layers, topped them off with a thick clear top coat. When I decided to change the color all I had to do was poke the polish from one of the corners and it all came off easily no removing solution necessary. Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!  It makes it so much easier to get glittery/sparkly nail polish off without destroying your nails. I will always have to keep this in stock!</li>
            <li> glitter peels off nicely.  makes removal easy!</li>
            <li> does what it says it does.......................BUT.............This is the same as the &#x27;home remedy&#x27;......&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe I just paid $6 for some watery Elmer&#x27;s Glue in a nail polish bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Save yourselves the wait to get this hot product.&lt;br /&gt;Yep-just put some glue in an old nail polish bottle, thin it down, and yr good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does work, though.</li>
            <li> It works! I was skeptical when I bought it but all the reviews were positive so I thought I&#x27;d try it. It initially goes on cloudy white but as it dries it becomes clear. Added my glitter nail polish on top and when I was ready to remove it, it peeled right off. It worked as advertised--easy peasy. Love it and have already started recommending it to my friends.</li>
            <li> You need multiple layers of this before the glitter for it to work right. Looks and smells like Elmer&#x27;s glue, so maybe the DIY on Pinterest really does work.</li>
            <li> It does peel off the glitter coat really nice, BUT it starts peeling as soon as the next day.  Not really worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> Makes cleanup a breeze. Love it!!!</li>
