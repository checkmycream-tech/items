            <li> I like this Almond oil. I use it on my hair and skin and happy (not amazed) with the results. It&#x27;s however not certified organic. Also, the pump was broken when it came to me so I could not use it at all. I put a vanilla bean in it to infuse it, I prefer a little bit of pleasant smell than nothing at all. This oil has no smell at all, which makes me wonder if it&#x27;s really almond oil or is it processed in some way.</li>
            <li> Easy to use because of the pump.

            <li> Great for diminishing dark circles under eyes. My husband noticed a difference too. Just massage a little all over the eye area at night. Also great for reducing acne. Much.cheaper than eye creams that don&#x27;t work. The pump makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great price and excellent quality! I love the pump too - it makes it even easier to use as a carrier oil in my EO roll on bottles.</li>
            <li> This massage oil is one of best I have used, it&#x27;s not greasy and not too oily it&#x27;s honestly the perfect oil for massages. Will be ordering more soon.</li>

            <li> Very happy with this Organic Almond Oil and especially love the convenient pump!  I keep the oil next to the sink use it after I wash my hands to keep them from drying out.  It takes a minute to sink in, but I love how soft my hands feel now, and it has the most subtle but natural yummy smell to it.</li>
            <li> Awesome natural and organic replacement for shaving cream. The pump is great for the shower but not meant for travel.</li>
