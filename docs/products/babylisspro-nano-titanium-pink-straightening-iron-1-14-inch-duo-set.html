            <li>The best one i have ever used!</li>
            <li>I loved this straightener!</li>
            <li>They are GREAT for straightening.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so happy I held out for the miracle worker of BaByliss.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>The price was great as well.</li>
            <li>Very nice, good performance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved these irons and I hope the seller will replace them.</li>
            <li>good night the reason for my post is to wish congratulations to the way they move their labor hambiente and hope they continue improving through</li>
            <li>nice, good performance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipping was ultra fast, the irons are awesome</li>
            <li>Great product, great price would highly recommend.[[ASIN:B0049W1GNU BaBylissPRO Nano Titanium-Plated Straightening Iron, 1 1/4 Inch PLUS</li>
            <li>so many days I considered getting a relaxer again</li>
            <li>and I feel like it is better for those with finer hair.  </li>
            <li>But the awesome thing is that it has multiple settings</li>
            <li>to top it all off you get two, basically for the price of one.</li>
            <li>Overall, excellent product!</li>
            <li>Overall, Love IT!!!</li>
            <li>We both have fine hair and really think this was a great purchase.</li>
            <li>The best flat iron ever!!!!</li>
            <li>Loving the way it glides and how quick it flatten&#x27;s my curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It felt so smooth and nice, heated up quickly and</li>
            <li>Hair glides right through and in one pass, it is nicely straightened.  </li>
            <li>just for what i need it, meets my expectations, completely recomended, it was very nice to buy</li>
            <li>The smaller one would probably be better on shorter hair or for travel.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, amazing flat iron at a great price!!</li>
            <li>so far they both work perfectly, theay are very easy to use, heat up fast and really strain your hair</li>
            <li>so anyways I decided on getting the BaByliss PRO Nano Titanium and to my amazement after washing my hair with Paul Mitchell Curly line shampoo that&#x27;s sulfate free and using their leave in conditioner, and using a heat protectant serum I blow dryed my hair and used the iron at 450 degrees</li>
            <li>OMG it was so light and bouncy.</li>
            <li>Also, because there are 2 I don&#x27;t have to wait in line for the straightener and the second one is a great travel size.</li>
            <li>When plugged in the display would light up, but it wouldn&#x27;t heat up.</li>
            <li>I replied back said, I know, I&#x27;m so glad I bought it!!  </li>
            <li>- how fun!</li>
            <li>I LOVED this flat iron.</li>
            <li>Both work great, especially on my daughters very curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I have done extensive review on the best flat irons and the science of them.</li>
            <li>works great, Seems to do much better than my last flat iron.  </li>
            <li>After receiving this flat iron, I realized that though it is a good quality flat iron, it isn&#x27;t as spectacular as others have made it out to be.  </li>
            <li>It STAYS straight, all day!!</li>
            <li>She said both units worked great for 1 month but than the small unit stopped working.</li>
            <li>This awesome flat iron came much quicker than expected, this thing saves me time in getting ready now, so that is a PLUS!  </li>
            <li>and it came out EXACTLY</li>
            <li>CHI, Hot Tools, Solia, Sedu..</li>
            <li>Ever since I purchased my first Babyliss iron in 2008, I will never buy anything else.</li>
            <li>Its better than a lot of flat irons, it does leave your hair damaged.</li>
            <li>But while I was researching ceramic I found that African American women were talking about Sedu and BabyLiss and how good they are.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem half as nice, but hopefully it lasts much, much longer!</li>
            <li>I like these irons because they get hot fast and straightens my hair well.</li>
            <li>One major thing that I have learned with flat irons is that they should have a nice \\&quot;grip\\&quot; on your hair without pulling and breaking it.</li>
            <li>A travel and a full size that heat up more quickly than other flat irons .. works for any type of hair and  will leave your hair looking shinier,  silky, and smoother.</li>
            <li>I really like these irons.</li>
            <li>It would never come out like it would at the salon and the whole time</li>
            <li>any my hair is straight and shiny.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I like it better than my other brand I also have.</li>
            <li>She is able to straighten her hair in half the time because the Babyliss gets so much hotter than the chi.  </li>
            <li>The people were not helpful: they took forever to respond, when they did, they acted like I was lying, and they did not give me anything back for selling me a used item for full price.  </li>
            <li>Works so much better than the Chi I previously owned.</li>
            <li>Plus, for hair like mine, I need a high heat setting.</li>
            <li>the small one works just as good as the larger one.</li>
            <li>The smallest drop of water on my newly styled &#x27;do will puff it up and curl up the ends.</li>
            <li>I just purchased a new one on Amazon (the Kiss).</li>
            <li>Also, when I received it, it had residue in the corner of the plates so it was clear to me that this was repackaged as presented as new.  </li>
            <li>Keep in mind, the DUO is not two irons of the same large size...</li>
            <li>I promise I almost cried because my hair has been natural for 3 years and it has been a struggle</li>
            <li>When I dropped my old Babyliss for the 100th time and it finally gave out on me after 7 years of daily use, I set out to search for a new one online.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>the extra one is a smaller version, I say good for a teenager or someone with small hands, or maybe someone who doesn&#x27;t have a lot of thick hair.</li>
            <li>Also, the smaller iron that comes with it barely works as well as the big one.</li>
            <li>Other flat irons seem to just slide through my hair without really straightening it, so I have to do it multiple times.</li>
            <li>At first I was going to go with the Hana Elite flat iron because in the mall a kiosk lady told me that CHI was only ceramic plated and my CHI had had broke a few months ago out of nowhere.</li>
            <li>Even when I went outside in a foggy weather it only got a little frizzy which if i had been using another iron my whole head would have been looking like Diana Ross</li>

            <li> With this flat iron, I use the highest setting to get the results I want.</li>
            <li> Lastly, the iron only goes a few temperatures starting at 300, 340, 375 and so on.  </li>
            <li> So i spent 2 days reviewing flat irons online on YouTube and Folica.com.</li>
            <li> If I let my hair air dry, it looks like something out of a horror movie.</li>
            <li> If I blow dry it, it is a big ball of frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> One swipe down my hair with this flat iron</li>
            <li> plus it was pink</li>
            <li> I mean this is a PROFESSIONAL IRON</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve never used a Babyliss flat iron, you don&#x27;t know what you are missing!!&lt;br /&gt;First and foremost, know that I have thick, coarse, frizzy, wavy/curly hair.</li>
            <li> It cuts down styling time in half.</li>
            <li> One of them is a little shorter and thinner</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve has a few Chi&#x27;s in my past and I needed to upgrade from mine.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone that has curly and hard to straighten hair.</li>
            <li> I have curly thick hair</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I was so wrong</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed.</li>

            <li> Great product, great price would highly recommend.[[ASIN:B0049W1GNU BaBylissPRO Nano Titanium-Plated Straightening Iron, 1 1/4 Inch PLUS BaByliss Pro BABNT2090 Nano Titanium-Plated Straightening Iron, 1 Inch]]</li>
            <li> I really like these irons. They are GREAT for straightening. It cuts down styling time in half. But I have even had them a year and my irons went out and there is no way to contact the seller to let them know. I loved these irons and I hope the seller will replace them. I didn&#x27;t even get a Chance to review them on YT channel. I hope this company sees this review and replaces my iron. I mean this is a PROFESSIONAL IRON And I haven&#x27;t even had it a year! Do not buy.</li>
            <li> I used the flat iron just a couple of times then it suddenly stopped working.. I want my money back!!</li>
            <li> OMG! So i spent 2 days reviewing flat irons online on YouTube and Folica.com. At first I was going to go with the Hana Elite flat iron because in the mall a kiosk lady told me that CHI was only ceramic plated and my CHI had had broke a few months ago out of nowhere. But while I was researching ceramic I found that African American women were talking about Sedu and BabyLiss and how good they are. So I watched lots of vids and saw that Sedu was still leaving their hair poofy and frizzy and that had been my problem for years while trying to do my hair at home. It would never come out like it would at the salon and the whole time I thought my hairdresser and I had the same flat iron. I was so wrong lol so anyways I decided on getting the BaByliss PRO Nano Titanium and to my amazement after washing my hair with Paul Mitchell Curly line shampoo that&#x27;s sulfate free and using their leave in conditioner, and using a heat protectant serum I blow dryed my hair and used the iron at 450 degrees and it came out EXACTLY LIKE IT WOULD AT THE HAIRDRESSER!! I promise I almost cried because my hair has been natural for 3 years and it has been a struggle lol so many days I considered getting a relaxer again but I&#x27;m so happy I held out for the miracle worker of BaByliss. OMG it was so light and bouncy. Even when I went outside in a foggy weather it only got a little frizzy which if i had been using another iron my whole head would have been looking like Diana Ross lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so thankful for a product that&#x27;s for US!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mishael</li>
            <li> Awesome purchase .... still working perfect after all this years.</li>
            <li> I recvd 1 box w/ both straightners in it, everything went as planned for me. Can&#x27;t wait to use it since my middle daughter already bought one and my oldest daughter and I used hers all the time.</li>
            <li> I got my flat iron a couple weeks ago.  I have done extensive review on the best flat irons and the science of them. I&#x27;ve has a few Chi&#x27;s in my past and I needed to upgrade from mine.  After receiving this flat iron, I realized that though it is a good quality flat iron, it isn&#x27;t as spectacular as others have made it out to be.  Its better than a lot of flat irons, it does leave your hair damaged. I think it tricks your hair almost.  I have curly thick hair and I feel like it is better for those with finer hair.  Also, when I received it, it had residue in the corner of the plates so it was clear to me that this was repackaged as presented as new.  Everyone who owns a flat iron knows how that gunk residue from the oils in your hair looks when it piles up at the side of the plates.  The people were not helpful: they took forever to respond, when they did, they acted like I was lying, and they did not give me anything back for selling me a used item for full price.  Lastly, the iron only goes a few temperatures starting at 300, 340, 375 and so on.  There is nothing lower so my hair smells like its burning each time.  Also, the smaller iron that comes with it barely works as well as the big one.</li>
            <li> When I dropped my old Babyliss for the 100th time and it finally gave out on me after 7 years of daily use, I set out to search for a new one online.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never used a Babyliss flat iron, you don&#x27;t know what you are missing!!&lt;br /&gt;First and foremost, know that I have thick, coarse, frizzy, wavy/curly hair. If I let my hair air dry, it looks like something out of a horror movie. If I blow dry it, it is a big ball of frizzy mess. The smallest drop of water on my newly styled &#x27;do will puff it up and curl up the ends. That is, until I found Babyliss.&lt;br /&gt;I have used every brand imaginable... CHI, Hot Tools, Solia, Sedu.. None of them even compare to the Babyliss Pro. Seriously. One swipe down my hair with this flat iron any my hair is straight and shiny. You can use it to curl the ends in or out if you want. It STAYS straight, all day!! One major thing that I have learned with flat irons is that they should have a nice \\&quot;grip\\&quot; on your hair without pulling and breaking it. This one does that. Other flat irons seem to just slide through my hair without really straightening it, so I have to do it multiple times. Plus, for hair like mine, I need a high heat setting. With this flat iron, I use the highest setting to get the results I want. But the awesome thing is that it has multiple settings so I can let my mom use it for her finer hair.&lt;br /&gt;And to top it all off you get two, basically for the price of one. One of them is a little shorter and thinner but they both do the same job. The smaller one would probably be better on shorter hair or for travel.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, amazing flat iron at a great price!! Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this!</li>
            <li> works great, Seems to do much better than my last flat iron.  I&#x27;m keeping the second one for later.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Loooove this straightener. Works so much better than the Chi I previously owned. Would recommend this to all.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my girlfriend. She said both units worked great for 1 month but than the small unit stopped working.</li>
            <li> so far they both work perfectly, theay are very easy to use, heat up fast and really strain your hair</li>
            <li> The best flat iron ever!!!! A travel and a full size that heat up more quickly than other flat irons .. works for any type of hair and  will leave your hair looking shinier,  silky, and smoother.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my daughter recommended it and because there were 2 in the pack.  Both work great, especially on my daughters very curly hair.  She is able to straighten her hair in half the time because the Babyliss gets so much hotter than the chi.  Also, because there are 2 I don&#x27;t have to wait in line for the straightener and the second one is a great travel size.</li>
            <li> Shipping was ultra fast, the irons are awesome but I guess I didn&#x27;t notice one is smaller in the pics lol oh well they&#x27;re awesome and can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> just for what i need it, meets my expectations, completely recomended, it was very nice to buy and i received it so soon</li>
            <li> Ever since I purchased my first Babyliss iron in 2008, I will never buy anything else. I purchased this duo to give one as a gift and the small one works just as good as the larger one. Keep in mind, the DUO is not two irons of the same large size... the extra one is a smaller version, I say good for a teenager or someone with small hands, or maybe someone who doesn&#x27;t have a lot of thick hair. Overall, excellent product!</li>
            <li> This awesome flat iron came much quicker than expected, this thing saves me time in getting ready now, so that is a PLUS!  Loving the way it glides and how quick it flatten&#x27;s my curly hair.  I let a friend borrow the trial size and she texted me and said this thing is awesome!  I replied back said, I know, I&#x27;m so glad I bought it!!  One thing I had to get use to are the sides, they aren&#x27;t protected, I have burnt myself twice....not looking at doing it again.  Overall, Love IT!!! and the COLOR.</li>
            <li> Excelente compra, no tengo nada que decir con respecto al producto y el manejo del mismo dentro de USA, en cambio por parte del despacho dentro de Venezuela pésimo, tarda mucho tiempo en llegar y esto por culpa del sistema de aduana de nuestro país.</li>
            <li> good night the reason for my post is to wish congratulations to the way they move their labor hambiente and hope they continue improving through</li>
            <li> Got one for me, one for my daughter.  Hair glides right through and in one pass, it is nicely straightened.  We both have fine hair and really think this was a great purchase.</li>
            <li> I loved this straightener! it works great! The best one i have ever used! I recommend this to anyone that has curly and hard to straighten hair.</li>
            <li> Very nice, good performance.&lt;br /&gt;It is like to have two irons with the same characteristics&lt;br /&gt;Very nice, good performance.&lt;br /&gt;It is like to have two irons with the same characteristics</li>
            <li> I LOVED this flat iron. My friend and I split it and I kept the smaller of the two. I took it on trips and my friends would ask to use it. It felt so smooth and nice, heated up quickly and plus it was pink - how fun! Well, I purchased it is July and it died four months later. When plugged in the display would light up, but it wouldn&#x27;t heat up. I was so disappointed. I just purchased a new one on Amazon (the Kiss). It doesn&#x27;t seem half as nice, but hopefully it lasts much, much longer!</li>
            <li> I like these irons because they get hot fast and straightens my hair well. I like it better than my other brand I also have. The price was great as well.</li>
