            <li>Dove has been a name that we have been able to trust for some time and it&#x27;s nice that they give us such a wonderful choice of products and fragrances to use.  </li>
            <li>It has a very light scent to it that isn&#x27;t overpowering and doesn&#x27;t make me smell like I have women&#x27;s perfume on me or been using perfumed soaps.</li>

            <li>The scent was invigorating, and since I used it in the morning after I went running, I found it particularly refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Just love it so refreshing.</li>
            <li>I wished I had tried it sooner because I love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I love it and will keep using.</li>
            <li>Aside from that though, I enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>I love the Dove Body Wash line and really love this one with</li>
            <li>I would love to see a Strawberry fragrance line of Dove care products.  </li>
            <li>If you have a shower soap dispenser, u will be pleased to know that this bottle fills up to two containers.</li>
            <li>I love the way Dove Body Wash makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>In addition to being a great soap that moisturizes, it has a very pleasing scent that is not at all overpowering or too perfume-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve bought it many times.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because it is my favorite Dove scent and it has been discontinued.</li>
            <li>The nectarine and ginger is a lovely combination.</li>
            <li>love the smell of tropical fruits.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m more of a fan of transparent or exfoliant body washes, but I enjoyed this product.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>Love the texture.</li>
            <li>Love how our feels after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love about the Dove line of cleansing products?</li>
            <li>so I feel like i need to use more than maybe another brand.</li>
            <li>I do love the scent and color of this.</li>
            <li>This is now my favorite body wash</li>
            <li>This body wash has a nice, light scent and lots of nice suds to make me feel squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is pleasant, though decidedly fruity, so if you prefer not to smell like a summer snack, be aware.</li>
            <li>Fresh has a nice scent and provides a good clean.</li>
            <li>It makes a nice rich lather.</li>
            <li>I feel clean and smell nice when I get out of the bath; there is no film or greasy feeling</li>
            <li>Oh, and it gets you nice and clean too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Or if you just want to feel nice and clean and not smell like you&#x27;ve been dipped in perfume.</li>
            <li>The Dove go fresh, Burst Body wash is  creamy citrus-scented (very mild) and feels good on the skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommendation: Definitely, an excellent product, lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li>Not only are they rich and nourishing, but you also smell wonderful once you step out of the shower.</li>
            <li>The most important thing to me in a bath gel is the scent.</li>
            <li>Or even normal skin that you want to feel good.</li>
            <li>For those who like Dove&#x27;s body washes, this is as fine as any and the buyer will not be displeased.  </li>
            <li>This body wash is notably less drying than others I&#x27;ve tried, which makes it an especially good choice for the winter.</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s fine with me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just lather onto the skin, and enjoy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this body wash for about 2 weeks now and overall i am happy with its performance.</li>
            <li>So smooth.</li>
            <li>They are against animal cruelty and testing and that&#x27;s important to me.  </li>
            <li>The scent from this bottle literally filled the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great body wash</li>
            <li>Love the light fresh</li>
            <li>I will trust Dove for many years to come and can&#x27;t say enough good things about the line.  </li>
            <li>It easily works into a rich lather, cleans well, rinses off quickly and leaves your skin feeling clean and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get a product from Dove</li>
            <li>So I was excited to try this bodywash.  </li>
            <li>It rinses off clean.</li>
            <li>And so totally clean and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It washes off cleanly without leaving any residue on your skin.  </li>
            <li>This particular fragrance has a nice, fresh and clean smell, but is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>If you are familiar with the Dove body mist sprays then you will not be surprised to know that the body wash carries the same delightful clean, fresh smell.</li>
            <li>To me a product has to go above and beyond good and be awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is not too spicy or too sweet.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the scent and afterwards, no one could really say that I smelled fruity or tropical.</li>
            <li>For those who are new to Dove, well, the body washes are simply amazing: high cleaning power, great sudsing, super-soft skin even if the bottle doesn&#x27;t boast any extra moisturizing, no soapy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fresh and clean, and not overly fruity.  </li>
            <li>Scented with nectarine and white ginger, it has a very pleasant, clean, fresh aroma that is slightly citrus and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased with the texture, smell, and subtlety of this soap.</li>
            <li>After the shower I was left with a nice, clean feeling</li>
            <li>This actually performs better than many higher priced body wash products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>With Dove\\&quot;s Go Fresh, Burst Body Wash, I have a new favorite body wash.</li>
            <li>The fruit/spice combination of the fragrance was refreshing, not overpowering, and the wash is a thick creamy product in a peach color that easily lathers into an enjoyable shower and a comfortable way to moisturize.  </li>
            <li>I love taking daily showers but many soaps and body washes can be very drying.</li>
            <li>I rarely give 5 stars anymore.</li>
            <li>Fresh Burst body wash is truly awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After the Fresh Burst body wash, I was not itchy at all.</li>
            <li>cheap to expensive, but I have to say that this has got to be the best I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li>Go Fresh does all of this and hooray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fresh</li>
            <li>I got all that AND a fresh citrusy scent.</li>
            <li>It suds up nicely and washes away without any residue left like some washes.</li>
            <li>B003ZYGPOS Dove go fresh Burst Body Mist, 3 Ounce (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li>I like the idea of a moisturizing body wash with a fresh scent.</li>
            <li>It left me feeling clean, and I love the scent.  </li>
            <li>It also did not smell right.</li>
            <li>great, scent doesnt last more than half an hour after shower.&lt;br /&gt;-&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>Fresh Body Wash is a stellar product from this line.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overly exceptional though in that it doesn&#x27;t stand out in comparison to some of the other citrusy scented washes...</li>
            <li>The nectarine and white ginger scent was wonderful and fresh and the wash left my skin feeling smooth, without the dryness associated with other soaps.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Secondly, it does great with my hard water.</li>
            <li>This item is exactly what one would expect.</li>
            <li>Love the White Ginger and Nectarine scent</li>
            <li>I am thinking that they sat in a hot warehouse and lost potency.  </li>
            <li>Overall, though, I&#x27;m satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>After several weeks of use my skin is NOT softer, in fact I am using more body lotion.</li>
            <li>Amazon ONLY sent ONE bottle of this product - this time I am glad they did.</li>
            <li>Fresh Burst Body Wash is a European-style cleanser that is used with a washcloth or loofah and doesn&#x27;t produce much lather.  </li>
            <li>The combination of nectarine and ginger sounded nice, so I swapped for my normal Dove Deep Moisture.</li>
            <li>If you can, I would smell this in a store prior to purchasing on Amazon, just to make sure you like it.</li>
            <li>We love Dove products in our household, especially their soap.  </li>
            <li>It does clean well and leaves the skin feeling soft, almost like lotion has been applied to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It lathers up well and rinses cleanly and completely.</li>
            <li>The freshness of the product is evident, and there really is a \\&quot;burst\\&quot; quality that gets to the senses.  </li>
            <li>Been a fan of dove products for many years now, and this body wash is another item I can add to the long list.</li>
            <li>It smells much like mandarin orange at first</li>
            <li>The scent is soft and sweet.</li>
            <li>If your looking for a new body wash it is worth a try...</li>
            <li>Might try again but will not buy so much at one time again.</li>
            <li>It was a very</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t produce a ton of bubbles, but the scent is very relaxing.</li>
            <li>The soap was gentle and felt like lotion on the skin.</li>
            <li>It also contains moisturizer, which is nice though my skin didn&#x27;t feel any different afterwards than from my regular bodywash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a sucker for a good body wash...</li>
            <li>I still need another kind of moisturizer in the dead of winter to keep my skin from drying out, but I have that issue with any body wash I use.  </li>
            <li>What had me sold on this particular item is the scent...</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to purchase this product and highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for an in-the-morning wash.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>When I tried the Dove Body Wash it made my skin feel soft and clean without getting dried out and completely itch free.</li>
            <li>It is useful and I would recommend it to others if they needed such an item.</li>
            <li>is a relatively thick cream and lathers nicely</li>
            <li>I live in the high desert.</li>
            <li>Just because I want a nice scent, doesn&#x27;t mean I want the product to be colored.  </li>
            <li>This has the NutriumMoisturizer quality that I think goes that little bit extra in skin care, so your skin feels amazing.  </li>
            <li>Same clean feeling as other dove soap and body washes with a fresh citrus scent.</li>
            <li>This seemed to wash and retain moisiture just as well as the Deep Moisture, but I will be switching back to the clean, fresh scent of the standard product.  </li>
            <li>Intrigued by the combination of nectarine and white ginger, and always interested in trying new body wash products, I ordered Dove&#x27;s new Burst Body Wash from Amazon Vine.  </li>
            <li>My Wife swears by Dove Body Wash, and she loves it, plus, she&#x27;s usually very sensitive to scents, and this didn&#x27;t bother her at all.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and a lot of soaps make be break out and itch.</li>
            <li>It lingers a little after drying off but is very fresh and neutral so it works easily with any other scented products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Price is comparable with other Body Washes but this one does leave your skin feeling smooth and silky soft.  </li>
            <li>I want to be clear that is the product I&#x27;m reviewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin soft...</li>
            <li>My grandmother always used Dove and nothing but, and with Dove&#x27;s much more complex line there&#x27;s plenty to like.  </li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to scent/odors DO NOT buy this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it myself and also on the more delicate and prone to rashes skin of my children.  </li>
            <li>Luckily the scent of this body wash DOES NOT last long after you shower.</li>
            <li>, the price is right on par with Target, Walmart or any other drugstore, so I can&#x27;t complain about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just no other word for it.  </li>
            <li>I have used a lot of different kinds of body wash and was very pleasantly surprised by this one.  </li>
            <li>Love the scent and is delicate on very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty loyal to my usual brand but occasionally like to try something different, and I always go back to my brand because I find other products lacking.  </li>
            <li>It also leaves my skin feeling soft afterwards, rather than dry.  </li>
            <li>It works well with the hard water at her house and the scent is mild enough that my father can use the body wash without smelling like perfume.</li>

            <li> Or if you just want to feel nice and clean and not smell like you&#x27;ve been dipped in perfume.</li>
            <li> The Dove go fresh, Burst Body wash is  creamy citrus-scented (very mild) and feels good on the skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Recommendation: Definitely, an excellent product, lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> Not only are they rich and nourishing, but you also smell wonderful once you step out of the shower.</li>
            <li> The most important thing to me in a bath gel is the scent.</li>
            <li> Or even normal skin that you want to feel good.</li>
            <li> For those who like Dove&#x27;s body washes, this is as fine as any and the buyer will not be displeased.  </li>
            <li> This body wash is notably less drying than others I&#x27;ve tried, which makes it an especially good choice for the winter.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s fine with me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just lather onto the skin, and enjoy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this body wash for about 2 weeks now and overall i am happy with its performance.</li>
            <li> So smooth.</li>
            <li> They are against animal cruelty and testing and that&#x27;s important to me.  </li>
            <li> The scent from this bottle literally filled the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great body wash</li>
            <li> Love the light fresh</li>
            <li> I will trust Dove for many years to come and can&#x27;t say enough good things about the line.  </li>
            <li> It easily works into a rich lather, cleans well, rinses off quickly and leaves your skin feeling clean and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get a product from Dove</li>
            <li> So I was excited to try this bodywash.  </li>
            <li> It rinses off clean.</li>
            <li> And so totally clean and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It washes off cleanly without leaving any residue on your skin.  </li>
            <li> This particular fragrance has a nice, fresh and clean smell, but is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> If you are familiar with the Dove body mist sprays then you will not be surprised to know that the body wash carries the same delightful clean, fresh smell.</li>
            <li> To me a product has to go above and beyond good and be awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not too spicy or too sweet.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the scent and afterwards, no one could really say that I smelled fruity or tropical.</li>
            <li> For those who are new to Dove, well, the body washes are simply amazing: high cleaning power, great sudsing, super-soft skin even if the bottle doesn&#x27;t boast any extra moisturizing, no soapy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fresh and clean, and not overly fruity.  </li>
            <li> Scented with nectarine and white ginger, it has a very pleasant, clean, fresh aroma that is slightly citrus and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased with the texture, smell, and subtlety of this soap.</li>
            <li> After the shower I was left with a nice, clean feeling</li>
            <li> This actually performs better than many higher priced body wash products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> With Dove\\&quot;s Go Fresh, Burst Body Wash, I have a new favorite body wash.</li>
            <li> The fruit/spice combination of the fragrance was refreshing, not overpowering, and the wash is a thick creamy product in a peach color that easily lathers into an enjoyable shower and a comfortable way to moisturize.  </li>
            <li> I love taking daily showers but many soaps and body washes can be very drying.</li>
            <li> I rarely give 5 stars anymore.</li>
            <li> Fresh Burst body wash is truly awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After the Fresh Burst body wash, I was not itchy at all.</li>
            <li> cheap to expensive, but I have to say that this has got to be the best I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li> Go Fresh does all of this and hooray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fresh</li>
            <li> I got all that AND a fresh citrusy scent.</li>
            <li> It suds up nicely and washes away without any residue left like some washes.</li>
            <li> B003ZYGPOS Dove go fresh Burst Body Mist, 3 Ounce (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li> I like the idea of a moisturizing body wash with a fresh scent.</li>
            <li> It left me feeling clean, and I love the scent.  </li>
            <li> It also did not smell right.</li>
            <li> great, scent doesnt last more than half an hour after shower.&lt;br /&gt;-&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> Fresh Body Wash is a stellar product from this line.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overly exceptional though in that it doesn&#x27;t stand out in comparison to some of the other citrusy scented washes...</li>
            <li> The nectarine and white ginger scent was wonderful and fresh and the wash left my skin feeling smooth, without the dryness associated with other soaps.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, it does great with my hard water.</li>
            <li> This item is exactly what one would expect.</li>
            <li> Love the White Ginger and Nectarine scent</li>
            <li> I am thinking that they sat in a hot warehouse and lost potency.  </li>
            <li> Overall, though, I&#x27;m satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> After several weeks of use my skin is NOT softer, in fact I am using more body lotion.</li>
            <li> Amazon ONLY sent ONE bottle of this product - this time I am glad they did.</li>
            <li> Fresh Burst Body Wash is a European-style cleanser that is used with a washcloth or loofah and doesn&#x27;t produce much lather.  </li>
            <li> The combination of nectarine and ginger sounded nice, so I swapped for my normal Dove Deep Moisture.</li>
            <li> If you can, I would smell this in a store prior to purchasing on Amazon, just to make sure you like it.</li>
            <li> We love Dove products in our household, especially their soap.  </li>
            <li> It does clean well and leaves the skin feeling soft, almost like lotion has been applied to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lathers up well and rinses cleanly and completely.</li>
            <li> The freshness of the product is evident, and there really is a \\&quot;burst\\&quot; quality that gets to the senses.  </li>
            <li> Been a fan of dove products for many years now, and this body wash is another item I can add to the long list.</li>
            <li> It smells much like mandarin orange at first</li>
            <li> The scent is soft and sweet.</li>
            <li> If your looking for a new body wash it is worth a try...</li>
            <li> Might try again but will not buy so much at one time again.</li>
            <li> It was a very</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t produce a ton of bubbles, but the scent is very relaxing.</li>
            <li> The soap was gentle and felt like lotion on the skin.</li>
            <li> It also contains moisturizer, which is nice though my skin didn&#x27;t feel any different afterwards than from my regular bodywash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for a good body wash...</li>
            <li> I still need another kind of moisturizer in the dead of winter to keep my skin from drying out, but I have that issue with any body wash I use.  </li>
            <li> What had me sold on this particular item is the scent...</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to purchase this product and highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for an in-the-morning wash.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> When I tried the Dove Body Wash it made my skin feel soft and clean without getting dried out and completely itch free.</li>
            <li> It is useful and I would recommend it to others if they needed such an item.</li>
            <li> is a relatively thick cream and lathers nicely</li>
            <li> I live in the high desert.</li>
            <li> Just because I want a nice scent, doesn&#x27;t mean I want the product to be colored.  </li>
            <li> This has the NutriumMoisturizer quality that I think goes that little bit extra in skin care, so your skin feels amazing.  </li>
            <li> Same clean feeling as other dove soap and body washes with a fresh citrus scent.</li>
            <li> This seemed to wash and retain moisiture just as well as the Deep Moisture, but I will be switching back to the clean, fresh scent of the standard product.  </li>
            <li> Intrigued by the combination of nectarine and white ginger, and always interested in trying new body wash products, I ordered Dove&#x27;s new Burst Body Wash from Amazon Vine.  </li>
            <li> My Wife swears by Dove Body Wash, and she loves it, plus, she&#x27;s usually very sensitive to scents, and this didn&#x27;t bother her at all.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and a lot of soaps make be break out and itch.</li>
            <li> It lingers a little after drying off but is very fresh and neutral so it works easily with any other scented products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Price is comparable with other Body Washes but this one does leave your skin feeling smooth and silky soft.  </li>
            <li> I want to be clear that is the product I&#x27;m reviewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin soft...</li>
            <li> My grandmother always used Dove and nothing but, and with Dove&#x27;s much more complex line there&#x27;s plenty to like.  </li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to scent/odors DO NOT buy this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it myself and also on the more delicate and prone to rashes skin of my children.  </li>
            <li> Luckily the scent of this body wash DOES NOT last long after you shower.</li>
            <li> , the price is right on par with Target, Walmart or any other drugstore, so I can&#x27;t complain about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just no other word for it.  </li>
            <li> I have used a lot of different kinds of body wash and was very pleasantly surprised by this one.  </li>
            <li> Love the scent and is delicate on very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty loyal to my usual brand but occasionally like to try something different, and I always go back to my brand because I find other products lacking.  </li>
            <li> It also leaves my skin feeling soft afterwards, rather than dry.  </li>
            <li> It works well with the hard water at her house and the scent is mild enough that my father can use the body wash without smelling like perfume.</li>
            <li> body wash is thick, but it rinses off easily, leaving no odd film that takes forever to rinse off, and though it isn&#x27;t thick enough or moisturizing enough to skip lotion in the winter, I can see it being enough in the warmer months.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have no problem recommending this body wash for anybody that has sensitive skin and/or dry to very dry skin.</li>
            <li> , it only lasts for as long as one is washing.  </li>
            <li> There was no residue left on my skin, and it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin either.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint, and it is very minor, is that it doesn&#x27;t lather as much as i&#x27;d like a body wash to do</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve long been a fan of Dove Products (for about as long as I&#x27;ve been a sufferer of dry skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As Dove products usually are, the body wash is thick, rich and creamy and makes showering almost addictive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li> About the only other soap I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t make me itch is</li>
            <li> although because I have really dry skin</li>
            <li> I have a hard time using new body washes.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not really \\&quot;soapy.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> the Olay Body Wash. And then only the one with Aloe or the plain unscented when I can find it.</li>
            <li> but the bottle is a bit awkward to grasp when it is full and wet because of the size and the way it is curved and</li>
            <li> /&gt;-&gt;Doesnt make me itch or leave any other undesirable effects</li>
            <li> It makes lots of bubbles on the bath puff, even in our hard rural well water.</li>
            <li> the tab on the cap is almost sharp and not pleasant to open and close.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are none of the little microbeads in this version of Dove&#x27;s Body Wash.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super disappointed in the lather.  </li>
            <li> this provided VERY little.  </li>
            <li> After yet another dry cold winter, my skin is dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> Not sure why.</li>
            <li> The smell of this soap was fruity and subtle.</li>
            <li> When I got the package it was wrapped in sloppy plastic..</li>
            <li> It sounds stereotypical but you do remember your visit to the islands with this fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sad that I have to return this :(</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a bad product, but I did not like the smell one bit....</li>
            <li> but this body wash is a bust, not a burst: The smell is not fruity or floral, it smells like bug repellent.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using soap anymore on my body because of that awful film you feel after.  </li>

            <li> I have used a lot of different kinds of body wash and was very pleasantly surprised by this one.  The scent was invigorating, and since I used it in the morning after I went running, I found it particularly refreshing.  There was no residue left on my skin, and it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin either.  After the shower I was left with a nice, clean feeling and I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> This item is exactly what one would expect. It is useful and I would recommend it to others if they needed such an item.</li>
            <li> Dove body wash is a great product for women of a certain age (I&#x27;m 56). I love taking daily showers but many soaps and body washes can be very drying. This Dove body wash is nice and foamy, but not drying. It makes lots of bubbles on the bath puff, even in our hard rural well water. Love the light fresh scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation: Definitely, an excellent product, lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> I like the Dove products because of the way they make my skin feel.  This particular fragrance has a nice, fresh and clean smell, but is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> been buying this product for the last 10 yrs..don&#x27;t use anything else..I just like the variety so I purchase different choices for the year at the same time</li>
            <li> loved the smell and softness to my skin</li>
            <li> I buy this for my mother who loves it. It works well with the hard water at her house and the scent is mild enough that my father can use the body wash without smelling like perfume.</li>
            <li> Just love it so refreshing.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and is delicate on very dry skin.  Been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Love the White Ginger and Nectarine scent but Dove stopped making it.  Found it here and bought several double packs.  When it arrived I found to my surprise that none of the items had any of the scent!  I am thinking that they sat in a hot warehouse and lost potency.  Very disappointed.  Might try again but will not buy so much at one time again.</li>
            <li> I just started using dove body wash about two months ago. I wished I had tried it sooner because I love how it makes my skin feel. I can&#x27;t wait to try all the different scents.</li>
            <li> I rarely give 5 stars anymore. To me a product has to go above and beyond good and be awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dove Go Fresh Burst body wash is truly awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the smell is so great. It is not too spicy or too sweet. It is a bright clean smell that I really loved. It lingers a little after drying off but is very fresh and neutral so it works easily with any other scented products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it does great with my hard water. It makes a nice creamy foam when worked into a bath pouf. It rinses off clean. It left no residue on me or my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, it was not drying. I live in the high desert. After yet another dry cold winter, my skin is dry and itchy. After the Fresh Burst body wash, I was not itchy at all. But my skin was moisturized and felt great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just a great product. I love it and will keep using.</li>
            <li> I must have about 10 different body washes.... cheap to expensive, but I have to say that this has got to be the best I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Condensed enough so you don&#x27;t need to use a lot, silky, smooth feel and good fragrance.  Leaves your skin soft...although because I have really dry skin I still need a good moisturizer.  Not the fault of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to purchase this product and highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;MEF</li>
            <li> I like the scent while I am in the shower. I cannot smell it on me after I am out. I have the matching body spray it added to the scent. It is bright orange in color and makes a nice lather.</li>
            <li> On the item description it said this was suppose to be a pack of 2, however I only received one body wash. Not sure why. Aside from that though, I enjoyed it. The smell is nice, and it&#x27;s not too sticky. Just lather onto the skin, and enjoy. It also contains moisturizer, which is nice though my skin didn&#x27;t feel any different afterwards than from my regular bodywash. Overall, though, I&#x27;m satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I like Dove products.  My grandmother always used Dove and nothing but, and with Dove&#x27;s much more complex line there&#x27;s plenty to like.  For those who like Dove&#x27;s body washes, this is as fine as any and the buyer will not be displeased.  For those who are new to Dove, well, the body washes are simply amazing: high cleaning power, great sudsing, super-soft skin even if the bottle doesn&#x27;t boast any extra moisturizing, no soapy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove Go Fresh does all of this and hooray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what I would like to focus upon is the freshness and the scent.  This is one of those body washes meant to wake up and your skin up.  This has the NutriumMoisturizer quality that I think goes that little bit extra in skin care, so your skin feels amazing.  One part of the wake-up process.  The freshness of the product is evident, and there really is a \\&quot;burst\\&quot; quality that gets to the senses.  The white ginger here?  Incredible addition for a killer scent.  I highly recommend this for an in-the-morning wash.</li>
            <li> I love the Dove Body Wash line and really love this one with it&#x27;s wonderful citrus fragrance.  Dove has been a name that we have been able to trust for some time and it&#x27;s nice that they give us such a wonderful choice of products and fragrances to use.  Price is comparable with other Body Washes but this one does leave your skin feeling smooth and silky soft.  No drying out like some of the harsher brands.  I will trust Dove for many years to come and can&#x27;t say enough good things about the line.  I would love to see a Strawberry fragrance line of Dove care products.  Oh and maybe a Lavender line also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this body wash for about 2 weeks now and overall i am happy with its performance. If your looking for a new body wash it is worth a try... Here are my notes/thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;-&gt;It lathers up nice and quick.&lt;br /&gt;-&gt;Doesnt make me itch or leave any other undesirable effects&lt;br /&gt;-&gt;Smells great, scent doesnt last more than half an hour after shower.&lt;br /&gt;-&gt;Easy to use (open/close) though it is quite big being 24 ounces.</li>
            <li> Been a fan of dove products for many years now, and this body wash is another item I can add to the long list. Same clean feeling as other dove soap and body washes with a fresh citrus scent. If you have a shower soap dispenser, u will be pleased to know that this bottle fills up to two containers.</li>
            <li> I love the way Dove Body Wash makes my skin feel. So smooth. So silky. And so totally clean and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Dove Go Fresh I got all that AND a fresh citrusy scent. Yummy!</li>
            <li> I was excited to get a product from Dove but this body wash is a bust, not a burst: The smell is not fruity or floral, it smells like bug repellent. After several weeks of use my skin is NOT softer, in fact I am using more body lotion. Amazon ONLY sent ONE bottle of this product - this time I am glad they did. If you are sensitive to scent/odors DO NOT buy this product. Luckily the scent of this body wash DOES NOT last long after you shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve long been a fan of Dove Products (for about as long as I&#x27;ve been a sufferer of dry skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dove Go Fresh Body Wash is a stellar product from this line.  It has everything that you might expect from Dove.  It washes off cleanly without leaving any residue on your skin.  It cleans well and moisturizes.  I&#x27;ve used it myself and also on the more delicate and prone to rashes skin of my children.  In addition to being a great soap that moisturizes, it has a very pleasing scent that is not at all overpowering or too perfume-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great winner!</li>
            <li> Dove Nectarine and Ginger Go Fresh Burst Body Wash is a European-style cleanser that is used with a washcloth or loofah and doesn&#x27;t produce much lather.  It smells much like mandarin orange at first but then the floral ginger and finally the nectarine are detectable.  It does clean well and leaves the skin feeling soft, almost like lotion has been applied to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body wash itself is quite nice between the scent and the way it leaves my skin but the bottle is a bit awkward to grasp when it is full and wet because of the size and the way it is curved and the tab on the cap is almost sharp and not pleasant to open and close.  I put it in a bottle with a pump dispenser which works well.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time using new body washes.  I always use body wash from The Body Shop.  They are against animal cruelty and testing and that&#x27;s important to me.  I decided to give this a shop just because of the scent.  I love nectarines!  I&#x27;m super disappointed in the lather.  I like suds when I&#x27;m washing and this provided VERY little.  The scent is also overpowering while I&#x27;m washing and 10 minutes after I&#x27;m out of the shower I can&#x27;t even smell it on my body anymore.  I also didn&#x27;t care for the way my skin felt after the shower.  It was a very</li>
            <li> My family really liked this product. We&#x27;ve bought it many times. I have three girls and they all like it quite a bit.</li>
            <li> This body wash is notably less drying than others I&#x27;ve tried, which makes it an especially good choice for the winter. The fragrance is pleasant, though decidedly fruity, so if you prefer not to smell like a summer snack, be aware. Otherwise, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a bad product, but I did not like the smell one bit....I don&#x27;t get either Nectarine or White Ginger out of this at all. It just smells like chemicals to me. My Wife swears by Dove Body Wash, and she loves it, plus, she&#x27;s usually very sensitive to scents, and this didn&#x27;t bother her at all.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because it is my favorite Dove scent and it has been discontinued. When I got the package it was wrapped in sloppy plastic.. I went to open it and there was built up &amp;#34;crud&amp;#34; all around the opening. It also did not smell right. Sad that I have to return this :(</li>
            <li> The most important thing to me in a bath gel is the scent. The nectarine and ginger is a lovely combination. The scent is soft and sweet. In addition to it being a great body wash, I like to use it like a bubble bath. It doesn&#x27;t produce a ton of bubbles, but the scent is very relaxing. I feel clean and smell nice when I get out of the bath; there is no film or greasy feeling and I don&#x27;t feel overwhelmed my fragrance when I get out of the tub.</li>
            <li> The scent from this bottle literally filled the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of tropical fruits.  It sounds stereotypical but you do remember your visit to the islands with this fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove is a relatively thick cream and lathers nicely but it&#x27;s not really \\&quot;soapy.\\&quot;  Usually, it&#x27;s best to let it sits on your skin a couple of minutes before washing off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even 90 minutes after the shower, you can still smell the fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is nice body wash. It lathers up well and rinses cleanly and completely. The fragrance is nectarine and white ginger. I really liked the fragrance and thought it was refreshing. Overall, this is a great body wash and I would recommend it to those who like a scented bodywash.</li>
            <li> Intrigued by the combination of nectarine and white ginger, and always interested in trying new body wash products, I ordered Dove&#x27;s new Burst Body Wash from Amazon Vine.  My review isn&#x27;t clouded by the fact that they advertised pack of 2, and I only got one; instead I focused on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m more of a fan of transparent or exfoliant body washes, but I enjoyed this product.  The fruit/spice combination of the fragrance was refreshing, not overpowering, and the wash is a thick creamy product in a peach color that easily lathers into an enjoyable shower and a comfortable way to moisturize.  I would/will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I want to be clear that is the product I&#x27;m reviewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are none of the little microbeads in this version of Dove&#x27;s Body Wash.  And that&#x27;s fine with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First let&#x27;s talk about the smelly-awesome!  Just no other word for it.  It reminds me of spring-it&#x27;s fresh and clean, and not overly fruity.  Some washes, especially ones with fruit scents, have a cloying scent-overly perfumed if you will-but not this one.  That&#x27;s a win with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body wash is thick, but it rinses off easily, leaving no odd film that takes forever to rinse off, and though it isn&#x27;t thick enough or moisturizing enough to skip lotion in the winter, I can see it being enough in the warmer months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a two pack, the price is right on par with Target, Walmart or any other drugstore, so I can&#x27;t complain about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a nice body wash.  It left me feeling clean, and I love the scent.  Here&#x27;s hoping Dove does a body lotion with the same scent!</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Love the texture. Love how our feels after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;Love Dove!&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs up...5 star!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love about the Dove line of cleansing products? Not only are they rich and nourishing, but you also smell wonderful once you step out of the shower. I have always been a fan of their body wash and with a line like this, they will continue to have me hooked.</li>
            <li> Dove Go Fresh has a nice scent and provides a good clean. It suds up nicely and washes away without any residue left like some washes. It&#x27;s not overly exceptional though in that it doesn&#x27;t stand out in comparison to some of the other citrusy scented washes...</li>
            <li> I do not like the smell of this body wash.  The combination of nectarine and ginger sounded nice, so I swapped for my normal Dove Deep Moisture. This seemed to wash and retain moisiture just as well as the Deep Moisture, but I will be switching back to the clean, fresh scent of the standard product.  The good news for this, it only lasts for as long as one is washing.  The scent doesn&#x27;t stay on one&#x27;s skin.  I also don&#x27;t like that they added dye to make it a nectarine color.  Just because I want a nice scent, doesn&#x27;t mean I want the product to be colored.  Bottom line:  If you can, I would smell this in a store prior to purchasing on Amazon, just to make sure you like it.</li>
            <li> If you are familiar with the Dove body mist sprays then you will not be surprised to know that the body wash carries the same delightful clean, fresh smell. As Dove products usually are, the body wash is thick, rich and creamy and makes showering almost addictive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003ZYGPOS Dove go fresh Burst Body Mist, 3 Ounce (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for a good body wash... I don&#x27;t like using soap anymore on my body because of that awful film you feel after.  The Dove go fresh, Burst Body wash is  creamy citrus-scented (very mild) and feels good on the skin.  My only complaint, and it is very minor, is that it doesn&#x27;t lather as much as i&#x27;d like a body wash to do so I feel like i need to use more than maybe another brand. What had me sold on this particular item is the scent...</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and a lot of soaps make be break out and itch. About the only other soap I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t make me itch is the Olay Body Wash. And then only the one with Aloe or the plain unscented when I can find it. When I tried the Dove Body Wash it made my skin feel soft and clean without getting dried out and completely itch free. It has a very light scent to it that isn&#x27;t overpowering and doesn&#x27;t make me smell like I have women&#x27;s perfume on me or been using perfumed soaps. I just might have found a soap to replace the Olay that I&#x27;ve been using for years. I&#x27;ll have to use this one for a while but I think its going to be a keeper. Oh, and it gets you nice and clean too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no problem recommending this body wash for anybody that has sensitive skin and/or dry to very dry skin. Or even normal skin that you want to feel good. Or if you just want to feel nice and clean and not smell like you&#x27;ve been dipped in perfume. [;-Þ Give it a shot, I think you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review from the point of view of a male consumer on a body wash. If you are a male that prefers the heavy-scented male body soaps such as Axe, this is NOT for you. The smell of this soap was fruity and subtle. The soap was gentle and felt like lotion on the skin. It was not overpowering and it did not resemble any feminine heavy-perfumed body soaps that I have smelled before. I enjoyed the scent and afterwards, no one could really say that I smelled fruity or tropical. Overall, I am very pleased with the texture, smell, and subtlety of this soap. I believe it can be used as a unisex brand for both males and females for those sharing households.</li>
            <li> Looking for the bar of soap</li>
            <li> This is a very nice body wash.  I&#x27;m pretty loyal to my usual brand but occasionally like to try something different, and I always go back to my brand because I find other products lacking.  Not so this time.  This body wash has a nice, light scent and lots of nice suds to make me feel squeaky clean.  It also leaves my skin feeling soft afterwards, rather than dry.  I still need another kind of moisturizer in the dead of winter to keep my skin from drying out, but I have that issue with any body wash I use.  I would definitely try this product again.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of a moisturizing body wash with a fresh scent. I do love the scent and color of this. It makes a nice rich lather. It&#x27;s not as drying as perfumed shower gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 STARS: I loved it. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it still isn&#x27;t quite moisturizing enough for winter. For that, I need Olay with body butter ribbons.</li>
            <li> With Dove\\&quot;s Go Fresh, Burst Body Wash, I have a new favorite body wash. Scented with nectarine and white ginger, it has a very pleasant, clean, fresh aroma that is slightly citrus and refreshing. It easily works into a rich lather, cleans well, rinses off quickly and leaves your skin feeling clean and hydrated. This actually performs better than many higher priced body wash products I&#x27;ve tried. This is now my favorite body wash and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> We love Dove products in our household, especially their soap.  So I was excited to try this bodywash.  The nectarine and white ginger scent was wonderful and fresh and the wash left my skin feeling smooth, without the dryness associated with other soaps.  It felt like a luxurious treat for my body.</li>
