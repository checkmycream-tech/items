            <li>will greatly add to the pleasure of both partners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>anyway these condoms are very nice</li>
            <li>Very nice variety, too.</li>
            <li>Good times.</li>
            <li>The vibrating rings were really good.</li>
            <li>, maybe that&#x27;s their way of making good in advance?    </li>
            <li>Great product, and cheap prices...  </li>
            <li>it is really nice.</li>
            <li>So far this selection of condoms have been great!  </li>
            <li>&#x3D;)    </li>
            <li>My condoms were mostly from India...</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m a physician who helps men and women with sexual dysfunction)</li>
            <li>/&gt;See the books I recommend on my profile for ideas about how to make the most of these rings and even the condoms to increase pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charles Runels, MD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure these work for some people.  </li>
            <li>this was the best deal I have ever got in recent times, there are bunch of different types of condoms and all are very good.</li>
            <li>The purple ones were pretty good.</li>
            <li>Everything was good, but this is the first time i bought something with a vibrating condom?    </li>
            <li>It had free vibration ring too that was interesting for me and my partner.</li>
            <li>Everything went fine with the condoms.  </li>
            <li>Your lover will thank you for using the ring that comes as a free bonus with this order.  </li>
            <li>the quality is good in general.</li>
            <li>Waiting for special opportunity.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I am forever loyal to buying condoms online now</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly, were the brand I was expecting, and hadn&#x27;t expired yet, but that&#x27;s about it.    </li>
            <li>I got them for a pretty low price, making it a good value pack.</li>
            <li>Personally, I liked the red ones a lot.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not worth their time to make good on what I didn&#x27;t get.  </li>
            <li>It can be fun because you will have different options to try and decide about your favorite.</li>
            <li>What more can you say about condoms than that they work properly and feel right?</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised and the vibrating cockrings were a gag too.  </li>
            <li>Except for the last one, I&#x27;ve tried all of them and I am pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li>So, don&#x27;t be surprised if they didn&#x27;t send you the FREE stuff they (condomman) promised.</li>
            <li>They did include a coupon in the box for 10% off my next order from them (good at CondomMan only, not Amazon)</li>
            <li>reasonable price and fast shipping  &lt;br</li>
            <li>No breaks or failures yet, and very well priced.  </li>
            <li>I felt them to be very restrictive &amp;</li>
            <li>Again, should be fine (assuming they haven&#x27;t been sitting in a hot warehouse in Nevada for 3 years) but wasn&#x27;t as I expected.    </li>
            <li>It is pretty thin and good feeling &lt;</li>
            <li>Yes, they were assorted as I was expecting, and the price is still decent compared to the corner drugstore, but I still kinda feel gypped for not getting all that I ordered.    </li>
            <li>I got:  12 Maximum Love, red  12 Intense Sensation, orange  12 Extra Sensitive, purple  12 Performax, silver  2 vibrating rings.     </li>
            <li>It seems there are other better offers.</li>
            <li>But the rings that come with this order are small, unobtrusive, and by many reports</li>
            <li>So; i bought 4 packs (48 condoms with 2 rings), and none of them were complete.    </li>
            <li>Durex Natural Feeling  - Durex</li>
            <li>Intense Sensation  - Durex Regular  </li>
            <li>and I cannot believe how much money I could of saved if I looked into this product online earlier.  </li>
            <li>Most of them were flavored or \\&quot;extended pleasure,\\&quot; which do me no good.</li>
            <li>Inside the box:  12 Maximum Love(red)/Exp2011/Thailand,   12 Intense Sensation(orange)/Exp2012/India,   12 Extra Sensitive(purple)/Exp2012/Thailand,   12 Performax(silver)/Exp2012/Thailand,   2 unknown brand vibrating rings.  </li>
            <li>Extra thin, maximum love, the shaped one, and the endurance one.</li>

            <li> The vibrating ring is too loose, though.</li>
            <li> Last, they were just thrown in the box, no original packaging to tell me what I had.  </li>

            <li> Well I was getting tired of buying boxes of them at the local stores for $10-$15 a box of 12, so I decided to look at Amazon</li>

            <li> Toys can sometimes be bulky and uncomfortable and almost silly.  </li>
            <li> this isn&#x27;t a bad deal, but it sounds from the assorted reviews like \\&quot;your mileage my vary\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The girlfriend hated the orange ones, and I found the silver extremely uncomfortable.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> So; i bought 4 packs (48 condoms with 2 rings), and none of them were complete.    2 of them were 40 out of 48  2 of them were 42 out of 48</li>
            <li> I got my package via USPS within 72 hours of ordering.     Inside the box:  12 Maximum Love(red)/Exp2011/Thailand,   12 Intense Sensation(orange)/Exp2012/India,   12 Extra Sensitive(purple)/Exp2012/Thailand,   12 Performax(silver)/Exp2012/Thailand,   2 unknown brand vibrating rings.  plus one 10% off coupon.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. All condoms are lubricated. Packaging included a coupon for 10% off next order.    4 varieties with 12 condoms per style  - Durex Natural Feeling  - Durex Intense Sensation  - Durex Regular  - Durex Extra  With 2 vibrating rings with condoms    Date ordered: Dec 8, 2010  Date received: Dec 11, 2010  Price: $13.75  Price per condom: 27 cents!</li>
            <li> Well I was getting tired of buying boxes of them at the local stores for $10-$15 a box of 12, so I decided to look at Amazon and I cannot believe how much money I could of saved if I looked into this product online earlier.  I am forever loyal to buying condoms online now, it is way cheaper and I get a variety of them without having to pay all the extra money.     Do not expect to get a shiny box with these, but after all you only need the actual product described and not the box it comes in.</li>
            <li> no vibrating rings in  package as mentioned in product description. Don&#x27;t recommend this. It seems there are other better offers.</li>
            <li> I received 75 condoms all in all. I was expecting 48pcs only. &#x3D;)    was thinking of 12pcs of 4 different kinds. But I received 12pcs of 6 kinds + 3 + 2 rings..</li>
            <li> it is really nice. I like it It is pretty thin and good feeling &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;very reasonable price and fast shipping  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;although, 2 vibrating ring was so so. my girlfriend does not like that &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;and i also do not like that anyway these condoms are very nice</li>
            <li> The title says all. I should have trust other review that there is no vibration rings sent. the quality is good in general. I did not count them all. not any one break yet.</li>
            <li> I only got 40 condoms. Most of them were flavored or \\&quot;extended pleasure,\\&quot; which do me no good. Also, instead of 2 vibrating rings, I got 0.</li>
            <li> I received the order today, and was not happy when I counted out 28 condoms instead of the 48 I was expecting and paid for.</li>
            <li> I got this in 2008 while I was trying a bunch of different condoms.    I got:  12 Maximum Love, red  12 Intense Sensation, orange  12 Extra Sensitive, purple  12 Performax, silver  2 vibrating rings.     All expired in 2012 if memory serves.   I got them for a pretty low price, making it a good value pack. Personally, I liked the red ones a lot. The purple ones were pretty good. The girlfriend hated the orange ones, and I found the silver extremely uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Everything was good, but this is the first time i bought something with a vibrating condom?    i don&#x27;t see a condom in the box, but only a ring... and why does it expire..?    it says on the box \\&quot; Vibrating Ring-Made in China\\&quot; \\&quot;Durex Condom-Made in Thailand\\&quot;   i think the ring is made by CondomMan Production    also unlike the other review  My condoms were mostly from India...</li>
            <li> No breaks or failures yet, and very well priced.  Not the thinnest on the market, but sufficient.  Very nice variety, too.</li>
            <li> Everything went fine with the condoms.  Exactly as advertised and the vibrating cockrings were a gag too.  I used them with my ex then upgraded to one with a replaceable battery.  Good times.</li>
            <li> So far this selection of condoms have been great!  Haven&#x27;t used the the vibrating rings yet.  Waiting for special opportunity.</li>
            <li> Your lover will thank you for using the ring that comes as a free bonus with this order.  Toys can sometimes be bulky and uncomfortable and almost silly.  But the rings that come with this order are small, unobtrusive, and by many reports (I&#x27;m a physician who helps men and women with sexual dysfunction) will greatly add to the pleasure of both partners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See the books I recommend on my profile for ideas about how to make the most of these rings and even the condoms to increase pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charles Runels, MD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Author of \\&quot;Anytime...for as Long as You Want:  Strength, Genius, Libido, &amp; Erection by Integrative Sex Transmutation.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Great product, and cheap prices...  The rings lasted a lot longer then expected.     A+</li>
            <li> I received this item on-time. It can be fun because you will have different options to try and decide about your favorite. It had free vibration ring too that was interesting for me and my partner. this item is recommandeble.</li>
            <li> What more can you say about condoms than that they work properly and feel right? So these do.</li>
            <li> There are four varieties of condoms. Extra thin, maximum love, the shaped one, and the endurance one. Except for the last one, I&#x27;ve tried all of them and I am pretty satisfied. The vibrating ring is too loose, though.</li>
            <li> good company as I got my product the best price, arrived on time and without problems</li>
            <li> Hi,    this was the best deal I have ever got in recent times, there are bunch of different types of condoms and all are very good. The vibrating rings were really good. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> They arrived quickly, were the brand I was expecting, and hadn&#x27;t expired yet, but that&#x27;s about it.    The description says 48 assorted, but I only got 40.  Yes, they were assorted as I was expecting, and the price is still decent compared to the corner drugstore, but I still kinda feel gypped for not getting all that I ordered.    The description says expires in 2-5 years, but mine expire in 3 mos - 2 years.  Again, should be fine (assuming they haven&#x27;t been sitting in a hot warehouse in Nevada for 3 years) but wasn&#x27;t as I expected.    Last, they were just thrown in the box, no original packaging to tell me what I had.  Again, they&#x27;re condoms so they should be fine...just not very professional.    An e-mail to their contact wasn&#x27;t answered, I guess for the price it&#x27;s not worth their time to make good on what I didn&#x27;t get.  They did include a coupon in the box for 10% off my next order from them (good at CondomMan only, not Amazon), maybe that&#x27;s their way of making good in advance?    So, I guess for the price this isn&#x27;t a bad deal, but it sounds from the assorted reviews like \\&quot;your mileage my vary\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I received the 48 condoms but did not receive the vibrating rings. So, don&#x27;t be surprised if they didn&#x27;t send you the FREE stuff they (condomman) promised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure these work for some people.  I felt them to be very restrictive &amp; some packages I opened had lumpy pieces of spermicide in them.  Never again.</li>
