            <li>And I have to say my mouth feels clean fresh and very healthy.</li>
            <li>and I love the fresh taste!</li>
            <li>I was impressed with how it didn&#x27;t hurt my teeth like some other toothpastes did.</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health toothpaste is my family&#x27;s favorite brand - we like it because it has everything to meet each person&#x27;s unique dental care needs.</li>
            <li>I got to try the new Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste for free and review it by giving my own 100% honest opinion.  </li>
            <li>You definitely need the classic &amp;#34;pea-sized&amp;#34; portion to get the best use out of it - otherwise, it&#x27;s too much toothpaste and the experience is not so great.</li>
            <li>Crest Pro Health Toothpaste leaves your mouth feeling very fresh and your teeth feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth felt just as clean, but the flavor in my mouth was better.</li>
            <li>It does not &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; when I close and the shape of the tip can easily get toothpaste stuck around it.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel very clean and my mouth very fresh after using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Many toothpastes will claim they can whiten teeth or help with sensitivity or help with tartar or keep your breath fresh and more.</li>
            <li>Got my mouth clean and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>It seems to fall off the toothbrush easily.  </li>
            <li>I love the flavor and how clean it leaves my mouth feeling.  </li>
            <li>Crest Pro Zhealth had a easy dispenser.</li>
            <li>and I did not get the refreshing, clean feeling that I do from Colgate</li>
            <li>It dissolves easily in my mouth instead of staying in a clump in my mouth or on my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>love how clean this toothpaste makes my mouth feel.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>it helps clean my teeth better.</li>
            <li>I love the strong flavor and how squeaky clean</li>
            <li>The mint flavor is strong, but not overpowering</li>
            <li>The toothpaste has a strong but not overpowering flavor.  </li>
            <li>The taste was way too strong, almost burns my tongue.</li>
            <li>The taste is somewhat strong and a bit too minty for me (even if not a lot of tooth paste is used).</li>
            <li>It has a fresh, clean taste and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; my mouth like most oral care!</li>
            <li>Was pleasantly surprised by the very fresh taste a great way to wake up your mouth in the morning.</li>
            <li>I liked it very much, I like the minty flavor</li>
            <li>It is not gritty, mild taste that is good and leaves my mouth fresh &amp; happy</li>
            <li>I love the fresh feeling after I use it &amp; my teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li>Made my teeth feel very clean and fresh :)</li>
            <li>my teeth looked great even after just a few days.love the taste and smile look great.</li>

            <li>We had been using Colgate toothpaste exclusively for the past year and had been happy with price and quality.  </li>
            <li>I have used  other brands of toothpaste for sensitive teeth before,however Crest Pro-Health is by far the best yet.</li>
            <li>I was glad it was a paste and not a gel (personal preference) and found it much thicker than the Original formula.</li>
            <li>I was glad it was a paste and not a gel (personal preference) and found it much thicker than the Original formula.</li>
            <li>I tried the new Crest Pro-Health Whitening toothpaste that I received for free from Smiley 360.</li>
            <li>So far, so good, has not caused any sensitivity in my gums, I brush twice daily with this, intend to use for a month</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see a great deal of Whitening, however, I have only used the product for 2 weeks and as for the Tartar buildup, will have to wait until go back to Dentist in October.  </li>
            <li>This is an effective whitening toothpaste and I really have noticed a difference in how white my teeth look.  </li>
            <li>I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to try Crest Pro-Health Whitening toothpaste for free.  </li>
            <li>I love how strong the minty flavor is - strong a long lasting that is!</li>
            <li>have been using this for 1 week now and following the instructions, it lathers better with the right amount.</li>
            <li>I received the toothbrush for free to test from smiley and was really impressed on how the different lengths of the bristols really cleaned in the hard to reach places and between the teeth  </li>
            <li>and I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Firstly, the fact that helps with sensitivity on top of the fact that it fights cavities, gingivitis, plaque, tartar &amp; whitening is just amazing - usually separate from everything else!  </li>
            <li>I felt it left my mouth very clean and fresh</li>
            <li>As a member of smiley360.com, we received a free tube of crest pro health and I have to say that I love the taste of Crest over the other brands</li>
            <li>I did not feel like this toothpaste got my teeth as clean as my normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using fresh clean mint flavor and my mouth feels clean like I just left my hygienist.</li>
            <li>When I received it, I went straight to brush my teeth, haha!!</li>
            <li>I have a little sensitivity, and it also seemed to help that, all in all a good product, does what it says it does.  </li>
            <li>They are a little whiter after using one tube, which to me is good &amp;#34;cause</li>
            <li>I received this recently and wanted top rate it.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>I recently tried this toothpaste that I  received a free full sized sample of this from Smiley360.</li>
            <li>I plan on buying more of this in the future.</li>
            <li>I recently a free tube of Crest Pro Health from Smiley 360 and was pleasantly surprised at the taste.</li>
            <li>only recommend this :)</li>
            <li>I really like the fresh minty taste of my mouth after brushing.</li>
            <li>I am also an avid coffee drinker but with the use of this product you can&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li>Started using CrestProHealth whitening tooth for about a week now &amp; my teeth are much more white</li>
            <li>I just received my sample of crest pro health toothpaste tried it today for the first time.</li>
            <li>It melts better than their blue toothpaste</li>
            <li>was my first time using a Crest Pro-Health product.</li>
            <li>We all love this product, would definitely recommend to others for purchase and we will be using this in our family from now on.</li>
            <li>Many people have asked what am I doing different with my smile/teeth</li>
            <li>At first, it took me by surprise, with the crunching, but then I realized it&#x27;s just like getting your teeth cleaned at the dentist.  </li>
            <li>So, it really works!</li>
            <li>This came to me as a free trial and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I am pretty picky when it comes to toothpaste</li>
            <li>I tried this product thanks to Smiley360!  </li>
            <li>First impression:</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t like the gritty texture but for the most part this product does what it says.</li>
            <li>I tried Crest Pro Health toothpaste for the first time a week or so ago.  </li>
            <li>I brushed my teeth and noticed that it wasn&#x27;t overwhelmingly minty, as i don&#x27;t like that.</li>
            <li>Thanks for letting me try this !</li>
            <li>It only took about a week of use before we were able to see a noticeable difference in the color of our teeth.  </li>
            <li>I really like this toothpaste!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend Crest Pro Health Whitening Toothpaste!!</li>
            <li>I am also an avid coffee and tea drinker,so you can imagine just how stained my teeth are.</li>
            <li>I have only been using for about 10 days but already notice that my teeth look whiter and feel better.</li>
            <li>We are pretty picky as a family and for us to find a product we all like is reassuring.  </li>
            <li>Crest ProHealth Whitening is an ok commercial toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I have never had a toothpaste that makes my mouth feel this way, such a refreshing felling.</li>
            <li>first day I used it</li>
            <li>This one says about an inch, so I didnt like my first experience because of the amount I used.</li>
            <li>Out of this whole week I have not had either of those problems at all!</li>
            <li>I received a free tube of Crest pro health whitening fluoride toothpaste recently and I liked the&lt;br /&gt;taste, but not the gritty particles.</li>
            <li>are really stained up!</li>
            <li>I found this to be pretty tasty for a whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It does clean your teeth better than other brands of whitening Toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Not only do my teeth feel clean they are clean and it doesn&#x27;t take a lot either.</li>
            <li>It is not too strong and it leaves your mouth feeling extra fresh.</li>
            <li>I use it which is amazing since I&#x27;ve only been using for 3 days so far!</li>
            <li>While the produce worked well, I think I would need more then one tube (and use the other products in the line) to try to achieve the full effect wanted.  </li>
            <li>Clean and fresh tasting, no bitter afterward, no chalky taste.</li>
            <li>I have used it, i enjoy the clean feelin after brushing my teeth that lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>The opinion is my own and is not influenced by any other party.  </li>
            <li>I love their whole line of Pro Health products and also use the oral rinse on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>this absolutely worked better than the brand I was using prior to this.  </li>
            <li>After using Crest-Pro health toothpaste for two weeks, my teeth definitely feel much cleaner and more polished.</li>
            <li>It is such a complete toothpaste for me as I need something that works on coffee and soda stains as well as effective for the sensitivity of my teeth.</li>
            <li>I often see it on sale at major retailers and there are always coupons available.  </li>
            <li>I could feel the deep cleaning the very first time I used it, and this clean feeling continued throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Crest Pro-Health Clinical for Gum Health</li>
            <li>This toothpaste has good consistency as Crest usually does.  </li>
            <li>I must say, it definitely left my mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Makes my teeth so white, also leaves my mouth so fresh &amp; clean.  </li>
            <li>It left a clean and fresh taste in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>It left my mouth and teeth feeling clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>It seems to really deep clean in between your teeth and leave you feeling so fresh.</li>
            <li>The Fresh clean mint flavor is a definite boost in the morning.  </li>
            <li>It left my mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>My breath felt clean and fresh and my teeth are looking white.</li>
            <li>It left my teeth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Honestly I wasn&#x27;t sure when I first started trying it, because it was something completely different than anything I have ever tried in the past.  </li>
            <li>It is easy open for the kids, and the paste itself is sparkly.  </li>
            <li>I liked this toothpaste, I typically don&#x27;t use a lot of toothpaste on my brush so that is how I used this product as well.</li>
            <li>I did receive a tube of this toothpaste for free to evaluate, but I have tried to offer an objective evaluation ;)</li>
            <li>The texture made me feel like it was gentle enough on the enamel of your teeth but also powerful to clean away stains and plaque off of your teeth.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t too strong but left my mouth with a minty flavor.  </li>
            <li>It did not have a strong baking soda taste that you tend to find with whitening toothpastes and it was not gritty.</li>
            <li>My teenage son has declared this his new favorite.  </li>
            <li>Crest Pro Health has a nice minty flavor that bubbles a little in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>I liked how within the toothpaste you could see the little whitening crystals.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always hoping that my tooth paste will keep my breath fresh and clean for a long period of time.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get over how long my teeth feel clean!</li>
            <li>I really like how fresh my breath is and how long my mouth and teeth feel clean, even hours after brushing.</li>
            <li>This may be due to the mild mint flavor that some people would really enjoy, but I prefer a stronger flavor.</li>
            <li>I have been a huge fan of the Colgate Optic White since it came out</li>
            <li>I really like this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I recently got a free tube of Crest Pro Health Whitening tooth paste because I am a member of Smiley360.com and was asked to write a review in exchange.  </li>
            <li>I recently received a tube of this toothpaste for free for testing purposes from Smiley360 (opinions are my own, however), but this is actually a toothpaste that I currently purchase for my husband and 3 kiddos!</li>
            <li>I recently received a free tube of Crest from Smiley360</li>
            <li>I just felt it didn&#x27;t give me as much sensitivity protection as I need.</li>
            <li>Crest Pro Health has really turned a page.</li>
            <li>I do really really like this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>I really like the texture,  taste and the way my mouth felt after using it.</li>
            <li>i like the way it sets in my cabinet in a package that is ready to use.</li>
            <li>just flip the cap and its ready.</li>
            <li>It scrubs the surface of my teeth really well</li>
            <li>But i will continue to use this for my whole family.</li>
            <li>I really like the texture of this toothpaste and the flavor.</li>
            <li>My daughter and fiancé really like the flavor.</li>
            <li>My whole mouth feels cleaner after I use it.</li>
            <li>Oh, I also like that the product is for whole health mouth including gingivitis and gum disease.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Cleans teeth well, doesn&#x27;t take too much on toothbrush to do the work.</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend giving it a try!</li>
            <li>Thanks again for having me a part of this.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in my teeth being whiter.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the opportunity</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ineffective,  but not so much that it leaves you looking like a rabid dog.</li>
            <li>My problem with tartar and plaque build up are non-existent now, thanks to my extended use of Crest Pro health toothpaste.</li>
            <li>and I really like this Crest ProHealth toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>kids don&#x27;t like the taste very well though.</li>
            <li>this toothpaste really helps with that issue.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Smiley360</li>
            <li>As for the whitening I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve really seen a difference</li>
            <li>I really like the taste of this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>but you really don&#x27;t see results but with crest pro health</li>
            <li>I really like this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I was given this product 100% free by Smiley360, for the sole purpose of a written review after testing.</li>
            <li>and my mouth wasn&#x27;t as fresh as with the complete series.</li>
            <li>product REALLY DOES make a difference.</li>
            <li>I really like this product as it works as described.</li>
            <li>I received this toothpaste for free for testing purposes, but my review expresses the results I&#x27;ve personally experience after using it.</li>
            <li>The flavor has a bit of an anise taste, but it is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product 100% free by Smiley360, for the sole purpose of a written review after testing.</li>
            <li>Going to continue to use the whole tube.</li>
            <li>My teeth have become so much whiter</li>
            <li>&amp;#34; I recently received a free Crest pro health product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li>Did not notice much of a difference in the whiteness of my teeth though</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much whitening difference</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t so much like the texture.</li>
            <li>this toothpaste really helps with the toothbrush as well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toothpaste to others!</li>
            <li>The toothpaste seems to maintain the whiteness of my teeth really well.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Smiley360 and the opportunity to try #Crest pro health toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I recently received crest as a free sample from smiley 360.  </li>
            <li>I found this reasonably priced and have already picked some up.  </li>
            <li>I received a free tube of Crest Pro Health Whitening paste recently from Smiley 360.</li>
            <li>There is no doubt that it really works.</li>
            <li>It did not leave a after taste or too much of a minty feel.  </li>
            <li>Your mouth feels very refreshed during and after brushing.</li>
            <li>I really like Crest pro health toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;  This toothpaste really surpised me.  </li>
            <li>I dont feel it has whitened my teeth any within the week, but i really didnt expect to see that by using just one tube of this stuff.</li>
            <li>my husband and I agree that Crest Pro-Health Gum Health Clinical and the one I got Crest Pro-Heath whitening was really helping our teeth.</li>
            <li>It was like having daily microdermabrasion for my teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li>It really whitened my teeth visibly within 4 days of using it.</li>
            <li>It really helps considering my teeth</li>
            <li>I really like Crest Pro Health.</li>
            <li>I received the  Crest-Pro health toothpaste to review and can tell you that after using it for about 2 weeks my teeth feel much cleaner.</li>
            <li>I received a free Crest Pro White toothpaste from Smiley 360.</li>
            <li>I never tried the Pro White one until I got&lt;br /&gt;the free sample.</li>
            <li>I  especially like the gritty particles that are in the toothpaste because it kind of feels like its giving my teeth</li>
            <li>Some toothpastes actually make my teeth feel more sensitive but this toothpaste does not.</li>
            <li>Ive tried many different toothpastes and this one, by far, gets the job done.</li>
            <li>In regards to the whitening formula, I honestly can&#x27;t tell if it makes a difference in the color of my teeth even though I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now</li>
            <li>I had to change to a different brand because my teeth have become more sensitive and brittle.  </li>
            <li>It left my mouth feeling very fresh</li>
            <li>It also had a pretty powerful minty flavor that left my mouth super fresh and lasted a long time.</li>
            <li>It really makes my mouth feel extra clean.</li>
            <li>It also had a pretty powerful minty flavor that left my mouth super fresh and lasted a long time.</li>
            <li>a child, my family always bought Crest toothpastes, and I&#x27;ve always enjoyed the flavor in comparison to other toothpaste brands.</li>
            <li>The scrubbing particles help polish and whiten my teeth more so when compared to other whitening toothpastes  </li>
            <li>It is better tasting than other whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li>an extra clean.</li>
            <li>Crest is the only toothpaste i use that makes my teeth feel completely clean.  </li>
            <li>I like the way it left my mouth feeling clean and</li>
            <li>It left my mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>I received a full size tube of the Crest Pro-Health Whitening for free a few weeks ago from Smiley360.com&lt;br /&gt;never</li>
            <li>I recently received a tube of this toothpaste for free for testing purposes (opinions are my own, however), but this is actually toothpaste I already buy regularly for my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;d like for the clean feeling would last longer, however, I have noticed my teeth look whiter and brighter since I&#x27;ve used Crest Pro-Health Whitening.</li>
            <li>We only use a small amount - most people use too much toothpaste, and it does have a strong flavor if you load your brush.</li>
            <li>The taste is not strong and the clean fresh feeling lasts for a while!</li>
            <li>I would and have recommended this toothpaste long before I was given the product to test for free.</li>
            <li>so you have to use twice the normal amount to feel like you are really brushing.</li>
            <li>while the mint is strong it does keep your mouth feeling fresh and is long lasting.</li>
            <li>This is definitely my new toothpaste!</li>
            <li>I might have found a new toothpaste!</li>
            <li>I would appreciate it more if the small bits were more like bursts of tiny soft bubbles.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other so-called whitening products before, but this one really is worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li>Perhaps my favorite part though is the stand up cap, it takes up less space on my already crowded bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li>I love it, I think starting it be the same</li>
            <li>Received this particular one through Smiley360 and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li>This is the main reason to purchase whitening toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health is a decent toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for over two weeks now and have noticed it helps my sensitivity in the same way that Sensodyne does, but it definitely tastes better.</li>
            <li>Although I can not say for sure, I felt like after using this toothpaste for a short period of time my gums felt and looked (to me) healthier, this fact I plan on confirming with my dentist on my next visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a life long Crest Original fan.  </li>
            <li>I am a life long Crest Original fan.</li>

            <li>It leaves your teeth feeling clean all day long.  </li>
            <li>My mouth and teeth feel clean for a long time after brushing.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth and would like to use a whitening product I would certainly recommend giving this stuff</li>
            <li>I do find that my Colgate may whiten my teeth a little more</li>
            <li>Tastes better than Sensodyne but the grittiness takes a little bit to get used to.</li>
            <li>I have to say I was surprised at the gritty particles in the toothpaste, however this product made my teeth feel clean.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I really did enjoy this toothpaste and would buy it in the future.</li>
            <li>Crest ProHealth Toothpaste made my teeth and mouth feel much cleaner than my old paste.</li>
            <li>In regards to the whitening action, i do not feel that it did much to improve the shades of my teeth.</li>
            <li>I noticed this tooth paste is a gel, which I normally don&#x27;t like, but figured I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li>The immediate aftertaste was enjoyable but after a few minutes, I felt like I had residue in my mouth and had a chalky feeling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only been a week, but I can already start to tell a difference in my smile.  </li>
            <li>Crest always has high quality products and this definitely fits right in with the rest of them.</li>
            <li>I am an older person who has very sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I live in a high rise condo in south Florida with over 150 units.  </li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive gums and use an electric toothbrush that more times out of not makes them sore or even bleed a little.</li>
            <li>I use other sensitive toothpaste and it is much milder than normal, this toothpaste did not QUITE fit that bill.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I am completely satisfied with this toothpaste and would recommend it to anyone that wants a whitening toothpaste that actually works.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth are very sensitive to whitening toothpastes and after using for a couple weeks I needed to alternate between this and a toothpaste specifically for sensitive teeth other than that I really liked this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>it has little gritty things to help clean and whiten, , it foams well, and it seems to really clean.</li>
            <li>I do think I have found my self a new toothpast.</li>
            <li>I have a new toothpaste and will not use anything else.</li>
            <li>so this was a &#x27;new&#x27; experience for me.  </li>
            <li>It made my mouth/teeth feel clean and fresh after using and it seemed to last longer than other toothpaste I have tried.  </li>
            <li>As someone who has not purchased this particular brand before I was pleasantly surprised by the quality, taste, effectiveness and price.</li>
            <li>I enjoy my two cups of coffee each day and Crest Pro-Health made it possible that I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about any lasting coffee stains on my teeth.</li>
            <li>We are coffee drinkers, and also enjoy red wine, but you wouldn&#x27;t know from our white teeth!</li>
            <li>I was able to look past that since I had no sensitivity while brushing like I normally do.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>My personal experience with it in my household was not very favorable as it did not make your mouth feel very clean.</li>
            <li>Many years have past</li>
            <li>But for all the other benefits it provides, it is definitely worth it to me!</li>
            <li>Many years have past</li>
            <li>And the whitening properties seem to work better than other toothpastes with the same claim.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a difference, in my already pretty white teeth.</li>
            <li>I am a big coffee drinker and appreciate the fact that the whitening factor in the toothpaste really works!</li>
            <li>Normally I use the sensitive Crest toothpaste</li>
            <li>It makes my mouth feel fresh for a long time.  </li>
            <li>But for all the other benefits it provides, it is definitely worth it to me!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that my teeth are any whiter, but they sure feel cleaner and that&#x27;s all I can ask for at this point.</li>
            <li>I would purchase it in the future but it wouldn&#x27;t be my first choice.</li>
            <li>My 10 year old, who hates to brush his teeth, loves this toothpaste!  </li>
            <li>I did not like the gritty feeling of the toothpaste at first</li>
            <li>I ended up pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>My teeth were fairly clean white from the start from a recent teeth cleaning at the dentist.</li>
            <li>I felt a deeper clean and the whitening helped keep my recently ZOOM whitening procedure looking sparkly white.  </li>
            <li>It does have a bit of grit to it, but I actually felt that was key to making my teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li>I am also already noticing my teeth becoming whiter after just one week as well as less sensitivity!  </li>
            <li>The mint flavor was not overwhelming and left my mouth feeling super clean for an extended amount of time.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, that was years ago and the new version is not as good.    </li>
            <li>The toothpaste did not clean nor keep my teeth as clean as my normal brand.  </li>
            <li>My husband normally only uses one certain brand</li>
            <li>Also, I only use a small amount of the toothpaste as it is very strong and bubbly.  </li>
            <li>leaves you teeth feeling clean and the minty flavor has a slight tingle to it that lets</li>
            <li>I have used the Crest brand for many years and Crest Pro-Health proves that I can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li>overall I really like this toothpaste and will keep using it along with my natural toothpaste to keep my teeth whiter</li>
            <li>I was surprised to read the two (one was a duplicate) unfavorable reviews...</li>
            <li>and I can tell the whitening in it is working as well as my teeth not being so sensitive.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive teeth at times when I brush and this toothpaste has not bothered my teeth at all.</li>
            <li>I would recommend Crest Pro Health to any one with sensitive teeth and need to do some whiting.</li>
            <li>Surprised when I tried this, I always buy sensitive toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>This said it was sensitive</li>
            <li>but, it wasn&#x27;t considered a sensitive toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and</li>
            <li>paste a lot as another had said it doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive teeth and gums</li>
            <li>like this product for controlling my sensitive teeth, the taste and whitening</li>
            <li>It whitens dental work a lot faster than natural teeth.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this toothpaste and you can tell a difference after a few days of using it.  </li>
            <li>My 10yr old daughter can use it Without It Being Overly Minty, She Calls it Being&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I like crest products and had been using Crest Complete.</li>
            <li>I prefer and am used to a natural toothpaste</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and</li>
            <li>(I think maybe I&#x27;m sensitive to the whitening ingredients, perhaps?)</li>
            <li>They developed a couple of days after using this toothpaste, and cleared up within a week of my stopping</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>As far as whitening, I do not drink coffee, tea or wine</li>
            <li>When I received the toothpaste I was beyond surprised with the outcome.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and it seems to work well.  </li>
            <li>I was using crest sensitive shield when I was asked to review crest prohealth whitening.  </li>
            <li>complete mouth care.  </li>
            <li>I got to complete the mission.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would highly recommend this toothpaste to anyone!</li>
            <li>This is the only toothpaste that I have found that my whole family can agree on and I feel that provides the fluoride protection that we all need.</li>
            <li>I was also surprised at how well it worked since I have sensitive</li>
            <li>I recommened it to my friend who was leary of using a whitening product on her sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>As a former smoker, i had some staining and yellowing, plus i am wearing a dental flipper, which has a very light white color to it, so it stood out and differed from the other teeth.</li>
            <li>It certainly leaves you mouth fresher and cleaner for a MUCH longer time than other toothpastes.  </li>
            <li>The taste is just right, not overpowering and the texture is gritty enough that I know it is cleaning.  </li>
            <li>The toothpaste DID burn my mouth similar to most other regular toothpastes.</li>
            <li>The little beads or whatever it is in the toothpaste helps to clean, I think.  </li>
            <li>The first few times I used it seemed to really burn my gums, I guess from peroxide.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed when using it was that it has a gritty texture, which I personal like.  </li>
            <li>I also use Crest Classic Whitestrips, so my teeth are already very white.</li>
            <li>It was a little too sweet for me.</li>
            <li>if not at least I have a clean mouth!</li>
            <li>It left your mouth refreshed, and feeling clean, long after you brushed!</li>
            <li>I normally use bleaching trays from my dentist when my teeth look stained, so I don&#x27;t expect a toothpaste to keep them white.  </li>
            <li>I am a heavy sweet tea/coffee drinker too and have lessening of stains..</li>
            <li>I definitely found a new toothpaste.</li>
            <li>This will be my new regular brand from now on</li>
            <li>The only negative side of this toothpaste is that it does not foam up like most Toothpaste brands do.</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive teeth and gums and have noticed a big improvement since I started using this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>My other teeth have a lighter whiter to them now, and my dental flipper doesn&#x27;t stand out as much anymore!</li>
            <li>I do prefer the Clean Cinnamon non-whitening variety personally, though, as it&#x27;s a little gentler.</li>
            <li>Considering it is much more expensive than regular toothpaste and you have to use twice as much, it is something I would use for a special occasion, not as everyday toothpaste.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t have a bad  after teast just leaves your mouth feeling great</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve only used it about 7 times so far.</li>
            <li>My 14 year old son said his mouth feels cleaner after using this for a week than it did after his last tooth cleaning at the dentist.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive teeth and this does not affect them so that it is a big plus.</li>
            <li>I liked it a lot, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but I can&#x27;t get over the grittiness to it.</li>
            <li>when you are brushing it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; as much as the other toothpastes do.  </li>
            <li>much longer than the other brands.  </li>
            <li>I am in my mid 40s, so I am concerned about my teeth in general.  </li>
            <li>I usually use natural toothpaste so the mint is a little strong for me.</li>
            <li>The shape of the tube and cap were very convenient as I like to set my toothpaste tube upside down on the cap.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste was a little gritty at first, but I got used to it.</li>
            <li>We have tried several other brands, but we seem to come back to this particular one!  </li>
            <li>As far as the whitening, I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to determine if it is working.&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical when I first tried this, but once I tasted it, I was ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to use special toothpaste for my sensitive teeth for a few years now but switched to Pro-Health a few months ago.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to everyone, along with all the other Crest Pro-Health products they make!  </li>

            <li> Toothpaste was pretty good.</li>

            <li> I am very satisfied with the product and the price is just right.  </li>
            <li> I prefer a bit more of a strong mint flavor in my toothpaste though.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it did not have a strong after taste.  </li>
            <li> then i thought and i love how it doesnt leave a strong after minty taste.  </li>
            <li> The taste is still very mild, I wish there was more minty-ness.</li>
            <li> and I receive that product free for test,I love it :-)</li>
            <li> really tried this toothpaste before I would highly recommend this product to everyone it does a great job and the taste is good.</li>
            <li> I have shared what is happening too my smile with many people!  </li>
            <li> The health of my teeth is very important and to find a product for sensitivity, gingivitis, plaque, tartar that whitens and freshens your breath all in one is fantastic.</li>
            <li> All of the whitening toothpaste I have tried did not give me the clean feeling and this one does!  </li>
            <li> You get the best clean mouth you can hope for while at the same time helping with teeth sensitivity.</li>
            <li> It tastes great and really gets my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> The taste (fresh clean mint flavor) is very nice and my teeth feel wonderfully clean for hours.  </li>

            <li> :) Received this toothpaste for free for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> Best of all I had just eaten blueberries, and the toothpaste completely got rid of remaining color, and left my teeth looking as good as a dentist cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a member of Smiley360.com, where I qualify to try brands for free in exchange for sharing my authentic feedback.</li>
            <li> however all of what I am telling you is true and of my own free will...</li>
            <li> It leaves a nice minty taste afterwards, and my mouth feels so fresh for hours.</li>
            <li> My mouth is feeling super clean, looking bright, smelling fantastic.</li>
            <li> My husband is really picky about his toothpaste and he thoroughly loved this one.</li>
            <li> The whitening effect takes a good week to be really noticeable but it does eventually whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled that it is in gel form and has a fresh minty taste.  </li>

            <li> I was impressed with how it didn&#x27;t hurt my teeth like some other toothpastes did.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health toothpaste is my family&#x27;s favorite brand - we like it because it has everything to meet each person&#x27;s unique dental care needs.</li>
            <li> I got to try the new Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste for free and review it by giving my own 100% honest opinion.  </li>
            <li> You definitely need the classic &amp;#34;pea-sized&amp;#34; portion to get the best use out of it - otherwise, it&#x27;s too much toothpaste and the experience is not so great.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health Toothpaste leaves your mouth feeling very fresh and your teeth feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth felt just as clean, but the flavor in my mouth was better.</li>
            <li> It does not &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; when I close and the shape of the tip can easily get toothpaste stuck around it.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel very clean and my mouth very fresh after using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Many toothpastes will claim they can whiten teeth or help with sensitivity or help with tartar or keep your breath fresh and more.</li>
            <li> Got my mouth clean and refreshing.  </li>
            <li> It seems to fall off the toothbrush easily.  </li>
            <li> I love the flavor and how clean it leaves my mouth feeling.  </li>
            <li> Crest Pro Zhealth had a easy dispenser.</li>
            <li> and I did not get the refreshing, clean feeling that I do from Colgate</li>
            <li> It dissolves easily in my mouth instead of staying in a clump in my mouth or on my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> love how clean this toothpaste makes my mouth feel.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels clean and healthy.</li>

            <li> The taste was way too strong, almost burns my tongue.</li>
            <li> The taste is somewhat strong and a bit too minty for me (even if not a lot of tooth paste is used).</li>
            <li> It has a fresh, clean taste and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; my mouth like most oral care!</li>

            <li> I was glad it was a paste and not a gel (personal preference) and found it much thicker than the Original formula.</li>
            <li> I tried the new Crest Pro-Health Whitening toothpaste that I received for free from Smiley 360.</li>
            <li> So far, so good, has not caused any sensitivity in my gums, I brush twice daily with this, intend to use for a month</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a great deal of Whitening, however, I have only used the product for 2 weeks and as for the Tartar buildup, will have to wait until go back to Dentist in October.  </li>

            <li> and I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Firstly, the fact that helps with sensitivity on top of the fact that it fights cavities, gingivitis, plaque, tartar &amp; whitening is just amazing - usually separate from everything else!  </li>
            <li> I felt it left my mouth very clean and fresh</li>
            <li> As a member of smiley360.com, we received a free tube of crest pro health and I have to say that I love the taste of Crest over the other brands</li>

            <li> Many people have asked what am I doing different with my smile/teeth</li>
            <li> At first, it took me by surprise, with the crunching, but then I realized it&#x27;s just like getting your teeth cleaned at the dentist.  </li>
            <li> So, it really works!</li>
            <li> This came to me as a free trial and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I am pretty picky when it comes to toothpaste</li>
            <li> I tried this product thanks to Smiley360!  </li>
            <li> First impression:</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t like the gritty texture but for the most part this product does what it says.</li>
            <li> I tried Crest Pro Health toothpaste for the first time a week or so ago.  </li>
            <li> I brushed my teeth and noticed that it wasn&#x27;t overwhelmingly minty, as i don&#x27;t like that.</li>
            <li> Thanks for letting me try this !</li>
            <li> It only took about a week of use before we were able to see a noticeable difference in the color of our teeth.  </li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend Crest Pro Health Whitening Toothpaste!!</li>
            <li> I am also an avid coffee and tea drinker,so you can imagine just how stained my teeth are.</li>
            <li> I have only been using for about 10 days but already notice that my teeth look whiter and feel better.</li>
            <li> We are pretty picky as a family and for us to find a product we all like is reassuring.  </li>
            <li> Crest ProHealth Whitening is an ok commercial toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I have never had a toothpaste that makes my mouth feel this way, such a refreshing felling.</li>
            <li> first day I used it</li>
            <li> This one says about an inch, so I didnt like my first experience because of the amount I used.</li>
            <li> Out of this whole week I have not had either of those problems at all!</li>
            <li> I received a free tube of Crest pro health whitening fluoride toothpaste recently and I liked the&lt;br /&gt;taste, but not the gritty particles.</li>
            <li> are really stained up!</li>
            <li> I found this to be pretty tasty for a whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It does clean your teeth better than other brands of whitening Toothpaste.</li>

            <li> It is not too strong and it leaves your mouth feeling extra fresh.</li>
            <li> I use it which is amazing since I&#x27;ve only been using for 3 days so far!</li>
            <li> While the produce worked well, I think I would need more then one tube (and use the other products in the line) to try to achieve the full effect wanted.  </li>
            <li> Clean and fresh tasting, no bitter afterward, no chalky taste.</li>
            <li> I have used it, i enjoy the clean feelin after brushing my teeth that lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> The opinion is my own and is not influenced by any other party.  </li>
            <li> I love their whole line of Pro Health products and also use the oral rinse on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> this absolutely worked better than the brand I was using prior to this.  </li>
            <li> After using Crest-Pro health toothpaste for two weeks, my teeth definitely feel much cleaner and more polished.</li>
            <li> It is such a complete toothpaste for me as I need something that works on coffee and soda stains as well as effective for the sensitivity of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I often see it on sale at major retailers and there are always coupons available.  </li>
            <li> I could feel the deep cleaning the very first time I used it, and this clean feeling continued throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Crest Pro-Health Clinical for Gum Health</li>
            <li> This toothpaste has good consistency as Crest usually does.  </li>
            <li> I must say, it definitely left my mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>

            <li> Honestly I wasn&#x27;t sure when I first started trying it, because it was something completely different than anything I have ever tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> It is easy open for the kids, and the paste itself is sparkly.  </li>
            <li> I liked this toothpaste, I typically don&#x27;t use a lot of toothpaste on my brush so that is how I used this product as well.</li>
            <li> I did receive a tube of this toothpaste for free to evaluate, but I have tried to offer an objective evaluation ;)</li>
            <li> The texture made me feel like it was gentle enough on the enamel of your teeth but also powerful to clean away stains and plaque off of your teeth.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t too strong but left my mouth with a minty flavor.  </li>
            <li> It did not have a strong baking soda taste that you tend to find with whitening toothpastes and it was not gritty.</li>
            <li> My teenage son has declared this his new favorite.  </li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health has a nice minty flavor that bubbles a little in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> I liked how within the toothpaste you could see the little whitening crystals.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always hoping that my tooth paste will keep my breath fresh and clean for a long period of time.</li>

            <li> I really like how fresh my breath is and how long my mouth and teeth feel clean, even hours after brushing.</li>

            <li> just flip the cap and its ready.</li>
            <li> It scrubs the surface of my teeth really well</li>
            <li> But i will continue to use this for my whole family.</li>
            <li> I really like the texture of this toothpaste and the flavor.</li>
            <li> My daughter and fiancé really like the flavor.</li>
            <li> My whole mouth feels cleaner after I use it.</li>
            <li> Oh, I also like that the product is for whole health mouth including gingivitis and gum disease.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Cleans teeth well, doesn&#x27;t take too much on toothbrush to do the work.</li>
            <li> , I highly recommend giving it a try!</li>
            <li> Thanks again for having me a part of this.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in my teeth being whiter.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the opportunity</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ineffective,  but not so much that it leaves you looking like a rabid dog.</li>
            <li> My problem with tartar and plaque build up are non-existent now, thanks to my extended use of Crest Pro health toothpaste.</li>
            <li> and I really like this Crest ProHealth toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> kids don&#x27;t like the taste very well though.</li>
            <li> this toothpaste really helps with that issue.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Smiley360</li>
            <li> As for the whitening I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve really seen a difference</li>
            <li> I really like the taste of this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> but you really don&#x27;t see results but with crest pro health</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I was given this product 100% free by Smiley360, for the sole purpose of a written review after testing.</li>
            <li> and my mouth wasn&#x27;t as fresh as with the complete series.</li>
            <li> product REALLY DOES make a difference.</li>
            <li> I really like this product as it works as described.</li>
            <li> I received this toothpaste for free for testing purposes, but my review expresses the results I&#x27;ve personally experience after using it.</li>
            <li> The flavor has a bit of an anise taste, but it is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product 100% free by Smiley360, for the sole purpose of a written review after testing.</li>
            <li> Going to continue to use the whole tube.</li>
            <li> My teeth have become so much whiter</li>
            <li> &amp;#34; I recently received a free Crest pro health product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> Did not notice much of a difference in the whiteness of my teeth though</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much whitening difference</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t so much like the texture.</li>
            <li> this toothpaste really helps with the toothbrush as well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothpaste to others!</li>
            <li> The toothpaste seems to maintain the whiteness of my teeth really well.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Smiley360 and the opportunity to try #Crest pro health toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I recently received crest as a free sample from smiley 360.  </li>
            <li> I found this reasonably priced and have already picked some up.  </li>
            <li> I received a free tube of Crest Pro Health Whitening paste recently from Smiley 360.</li>
            <li> There is no doubt that it really works.</li>
            <li> It did not leave a after taste or too much of a minty feel.  </li>
            <li> Your mouth feels very refreshed during and after brushing.</li>
            <li> I really like Crest pro health toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;  This toothpaste really surpised me.  </li>
            <li> I dont feel it has whitened my teeth any within the week, but i really didnt expect to see that by using just one tube of this stuff.</li>
            <li> my husband and I agree that Crest Pro-Health Gum Health Clinical and the one I got Crest Pro-Heath whitening was really helping our teeth.</li>
            <li> It was like having daily microdermabrasion for my teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> It really whitened my teeth visibly within 4 days of using it.</li>
            <li> It really helps considering my teeth</li>
            <li> I really like Crest Pro Health.</li>
            <li> I received the  Crest-Pro health toothpaste to review and can tell you that after using it for about 2 weeks my teeth feel much cleaner.</li>
            <li> I received a free Crest Pro White toothpaste from Smiley 360.</li>
            <li> I never tried the Pro White one until I got&lt;br /&gt;the free sample.</li>
            <li> I  especially like the gritty particles that are in the toothpaste because it kind of feels like its giving my teeth</li>
            <li> Some toothpastes actually make my teeth feel more sensitive but this toothpaste does not.</li>
            <li> Ive tried many different toothpastes and this one, by far, gets the job done.</li>
            <li> In regards to the whitening formula, I honestly can&#x27;t tell if it makes a difference in the color of my teeth even though I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now</li>
            <li> I had to change to a different brand because my teeth have become more sensitive and brittle.  </li>
            <li> It left my mouth feeling very fresh</li>
            <li> It also had a pretty powerful minty flavor that left my mouth super fresh and lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> It really makes my mouth feel extra clean.</li>
            <li> It also had a pretty powerful minty flavor that left my mouth super fresh and lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> a child, my family always bought Crest toothpastes, and I&#x27;ve always enjoyed the flavor in comparison to other toothpaste brands.</li>
            <li> The scrubbing particles help polish and whiten my teeth more so when compared to other whitening toothpastes  </li>
            <li> It is better tasting than other whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li> an extra clean.</li>
            <li> Crest is the only toothpaste i use that makes my teeth feel completely clean.  </li>
            <li> I like the way it left my mouth feeling clean and</li>
            <li> It left my mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I received a full size tube of the Crest Pro-Health Whitening for free a few weeks ago from Smiley360.com&lt;br /&gt;never</li>
            <li> I recently received a tube of this toothpaste for free for testing purposes (opinions are my own, however), but this is actually toothpaste I already buy regularly for my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;d like for the clean feeling would last longer, however, I have noticed my teeth look whiter and brighter since I&#x27;ve used Crest Pro-Health Whitening.</li>
            <li> We only use a small amount - most people use too much toothpaste, and it does have a strong flavor if you load your brush.</li>
            <li> The taste is not strong and the clean fresh feeling lasts for a while!</li>
            <li> I would and have recommended this toothpaste long before I was given the product to test for free.</li>
            <li> so you have to use twice the normal amount to feel like you are really brushing.</li>
            <li> while the mint is strong it does keep your mouth feeling fresh and is long lasting.</li>
            <li> This is definitely my new toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I might have found a new toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I would appreciate it more if the small bits were more like bursts of tiny soft bubbles.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other so-called whitening products before, but this one really is worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> Perhaps my favorite part though is the stand up cap, it takes up less space on my already crowded bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li> I love it, I think starting it be the same</li>
            <li> Received this particular one through Smiley360 and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li> This is the main reason to purchase whitening toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health is a decent toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for over two weeks now and have noticed it helps my sensitivity in the same way that Sensodyne does, but it definitely tastes better.</li>
            <li> Although I can not say for sure, I felt like after using this toothpaste for a short period of time my gums felt and looked (to me) healthier, this fact I plan on confirming with my dentist on my next visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a life long Crest Original fan.  </li>
            <li> I am a life long Crest Original fan.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this toothpaste.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend the Crest Pro-health toothpaste..</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this toothpaste to anyone.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it .</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> made my teeth and mouth feel clean all day long.</li>
            <li> It leaves my mouth feeling clean and keeps that feeling a long time.</li>
            <li> It leaves your teeth feeling clean all day long.  </li>
            <li> My mouth and teeth feel clean for a long time after brushing.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth and would like to use a whitening product I would certainly recommend giving this stuff</li>
            <li> I do find that my Colgate may whiten my teeth a little more</li>
            <li> Tastes better than Sensodyne but the grittiness takes a little bit to get used to.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was surprised at the gritty particles in the toothpaste, however this product made my teeth feel clean.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I really did enjoy this toothpaste and would buy it in the future.</li>
            <li> Crest ProHealth Toothpaste made my teeth and mouth feel much cleaner than my old paste.</li>
            <li> In regards to the whitening action, i do not feel that it did much to improve the shades of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I noticed this tooth paste is a gel, which I normally don&#x27;t like, but figured I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> The immediate aftertaste was enjoyable but after a few minutes, I felt like I had residue in my mouth and had a chalky feeling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a week, but I can already start to tell a difference in my smile.  </li>
            <li> Crest always has high quality products and this definitely fits right in with the rest of them.</li>
            <li> I am an older person who has very sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I live in a high rise condo in south Florida with over 150 units.  </li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive gums and use an electric toothbrush that more times out of not makes them sore or even bleed a little.</li>
            <li> I use other sensitive toothpaste and it is much milder than normal, this toothpaste did not QUITE fit that bill.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I am completely satisfied with this toothpaste and would recommend it to anyone that wants a whitening toothpaste that actually works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth are very sensitive to whitening toothpastes and after using for a couple weeks I needed to alternate between this and a toothpaste specifically for sensitive teeth other than that I really liked this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> it has little gritty things to help clean and whiten, , it foams well, and it seems to really clean.</li>
            <li> I do think I have found my self a new toothpast.</li>
            <li> I have a new toothpaste and will not use anything else.</li>
            <li> so this was a &#x27;new&#x27; experience for me.  </li>
            <li> It made my mouth/teeth feel clean and fresh after using and it seemed to last longer than other toothpaste I have tried.  </li>
            <li> As someone who has not purchased this particular brand before I was pleasantly surprised by the quality, taste, effectiveness and price.</li>
            <li> I enjoy my two cups of coffee each day and Crest Pro-Health made it possible that I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about any lasting coffee stains on my teeth.</li>
            <li> We are coffee drinkers, and also enjoy red wine, but you wouldn&#x27;t know from our white teeth!</li>
            <li> I was able to look past that since I had no sensitivity while brushing like I normally do.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> My personal experience with it in my household was not very favorable as it did not make your mouth feel very clean.</li>
            <li> Many years have past</li>
            <li> But for all the other benefits it provides, it is definitely worth it to me!</li>
            <li> Many years have past</li>
            <li> And the whitening properties seem to work better than other toothpastes with the same claim.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference, in my already pretty white teeth.</li>
            <li> I am a big coffee drinker and appreciate the fact that the whitening factor in the toothpaste really works!</li>
            <li> Normally I use the sensitive Crest toothpaste</li>
            <li> It makes my mouth feel fresh for a long time.  </li>
            <li> But for all the other benefits it provides, it is definitely worth it to me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that my teeth are any whiter, but they sure feel cleaner and that&#x27;s all I can ask for at this point.</li>
            <li> I would purchase it in the future but it wouldn&#x27;t be my first choice.</li>
            <li> My 10 year old, who hates to brush his teeth, loves this toothpaste!  </li>
            <li> I did not like the gritty feeling of the toothpaste at first</li>
            <li> I ended up pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> My teeth were fairly clean white from the start from a recent teeth cleaning at the dentist.</li>
            <li> I felt a deeper clean and the whitening helped keep my recently ZOOM whitening procedure looking sparkly white.  </li>
            <li> It does have a bit of grit to it, but I actually felt that was key to making my teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li> I am also already noticing my teeth becoming whiter after just one week as well as less sensitivity!  </li>
            <li> The mint flavor was not overwhelming and left my mouth feeling super clean for an extended amount of time.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that was years ago and the new version is not as good.    </li>
            <li> The toothpaste did not clean nor keep my teeth as clean as my normal brand.  </li>
            <li> My husband normally only uses one certain brand</li>
            <li> Also, I only use a small amount of the toothpaste as it is very strong and bubbly.  </li>
            <li> leaves you teeth feeling clean and the minty flavor has a slight tingle to it that lets</li>
            <li> I have used the Crest brand for many years and Crest Pro-Health proves that I can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> overall I really like this toothpaste and will keep using it along with my natural toothpaste to keep my teeth whiter</li>
            <li> I was surprised to read the two (one was a duplicate) unfavorable reviews...</li>
            <li> and I can tell the whitening in it is working as well as my teeth not being so sensitive.</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive teeth at times when I brush and this toothpaste has not bothered my teeth at all.</li>
            <li> I would recommend Crest Pro Health to any one with sensitive teeth and need to do some whiting.</li>
            <li> Surprised when I tried this, I always buy sensitive toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> This said it was sensitive</li>
            <li> but, it wasn&#x27;t considered a sensitive toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and</li>
            <li> paste a lot as another had said it doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive teeth and gums</li>
            <li> like this product for controlling my sensitive teeth, the taste and whitening</li>
            <li> It whitens dental work a lot faster than natural teeth.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this toothpaste and you can tell a difference after a few days of using it.  </li>
            <li> My 10yr old daughter can use it Without It Being Overly Minty, She Calls it Being&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I like crest products and had been using Crest Complete.</li>
            <li> I prefer and am used to a natural toothpaste</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and</li>
            <li> (I think maybe I&#x27;m sensitive to the whitening ingredients, perhaps?)</li>
            <li> They developed a couple of days after using this toothpaste, and cleared up within a week of my stopping</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> As far as whitening, I do not drink coffee, tea or wine</li>
            <li> When I received the toothpaste I was beyond surprised with the outcome.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and it seems to work well.  </li>
            <li> I was using crest sensitive shield when I was asked to review crest prohealth whitening.  </li>
            <li> complete mouth care.  </li>
            <li> I got to complete the mission.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would highly recommend this toothpaste to anyone!</li>
            <li> This is the only toothpaste that I have found that my whole family can agree on and I feel that provides the fluoride protection that we all need.</li>
            <li> I was also surprised at how well it worked since I have sensitive</li>
            <li> I recommened it to my friend who was leary of using a whitening product on her sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> As a former smoker, i had some staining and yellowing, plus i am wearing a dental flipper, which has a very light white color to it, so it stood out and differed from the other teeth.</li>
            <li> It certainly leaves you mouth fresher and cleaner for a MUCH longer time than other toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> The taste is just right, not overpowering and the texture is gritty enough that I know it is cleaning.  </li>
            <li> The toothpaste DID burn my mouth similar to most other regular toothpastes.</li>
            <li> The little beads or whatever it is in the toothpaste helps to clean, I think.  </li>
            <li> The first few times I used it seemed to really burn my gums, I guess from peroxide.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when using it was that it has a gritty texture, which I personal like.  </li>
            <li> I also use Crest Classic Whitestrips, so my teeth are already very white.</li>
            <li> It was a little too sweet for me.</li>
            <li> if not at least I have a clean mouth!</li>
            <li> It left your mouth refreshed, and feeling clean, long after you brushed!</li>
            <li> I normally use bleaching trays from my dentist when my teeth look stained, so I don&#x27;t expect a toothpaste to keep them white.  </li>
            <li> I am a heavy sweet tea/coffee drinker too and have lessening of stains..</li>
            <li> I definitely found a new toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This will be my new regular brand from now on</li>
            <li> The only negative side of this toothpaste is that it does not foam up like most Toothpaste brands do.</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive teeth and gums and have noticed a big improvement since I started using this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> My other teeth have a lighter whiter to them now, and my dental flipper doesn&#x27;t stand out as much anymore!</li>
            <li> I do prefer the Clean Cinnamon non-whitening variety personally, though, as it&#x27;s a little gentler.</li>
            <li> Considering it is much more expensive than regular toothpaste and you have to use twice as much, it is something I would use for a special occasion, not as everyday toothpaste.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t have a bad  after teast just leaves your mouth feeling great</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only used it about 7 times so far.</li>
            <li> My 14 year old son said his mouth feels cleaner after using this for a week than it did after his last tooth cleaning at the dentist.</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive teeth and this does not affect them so that it is a big plus.</li>
            <li> I liked it a lot, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but I can&#x27;t get over the grittiness to it.</li>
            <li> when you are brushing it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; as much as the other toothpastes do.  </li>
            <li> much longer than the other brands.  </li>
            <li> I am in my mid 40s, so I am concerned about my teeth in general.  </li>
            <li> I usually use natural toothpaste so the mint is a little strong for me.</li>
            <li> The shape of the tube and cap were very convenient as I like to set my toothpaste tube upside down on the cap.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste was a little gritty at first, but I got used to it.</li>
            <li> We have tried several other brands, but we seem to come back to this particular one!  </li>
            <li> As far as the whitening, I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to determine if it is working.&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I first tried this, but once I tasted it, I was ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to use special toothpaste for my sensitive teeth for a few years now but switched to Pro-Health a few months ago.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to everyone, along with all the other Crest Pro-Health products they make!  </li>
            <li> I have used other products from the Pro health toothpaste line, but find that the Whitening formula helps with gradually removing old stains from being a coffee drinker for years.</li>
            <li> I like the way there is some little gritty like substance in the toothpaste that work extra hard to clean my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Crest has definitely come a long way.</li>
            <li> (I guess if used long enough) are added bonuses.</li>
            <li> The minty flavor is long lasting, even after brushing has been completed.</li>
            <li> I feel that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long</li>
            <li> I have tried Colgate and the other competitors and have not liked them near as much.</li>
            <li> I also felt like it left my mouth so dry after use.</li>
            <li> I usually use Colgate Total which makes similar claims as far as what it does.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this toothpaste at first as I thought its whitening agent may irritate my gums and teeth but not only does it contain ingredients to help with sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I have been using Arm and Hammer toothpaste for YEARS occasionally trying other things, but always going back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to gauge how much whitening happened because of my use of this product</li>
            <li> I was surprised that there was crunchy bits in the toothpaste, which is why i gave it a 4 star-because its like biting into small bits of gritty sand!</li>
            <li> The freshness lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> After using this product for a few weeks, the stain that would not go away is now completely gone.</li>
            <li> I use the mouthwash to go a long with it.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it and see how it works in the long run.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels cleaner and the feeling lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that the mint freshens breath for a long period  of time.</li>
            <li> My teeth are very sensitive and I constantly experience discomfort with hot or cold food.</li>
            <li> I notice that my teeth weren&#x27;t as sensitive to cold after only the second use and it has whitened my teeth really well.</li>
            <li> I recently had gum surgery due to receding gums and was told to use an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Overall, i would recommend the toothpaste to other users.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it was a little gritty.</li>
            <li> It also made my gums feel dry.</li>
            <li> This would be the toothpaste I would use, but I need something for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> it had a loose texture.</li>
            <li> I can already tell it is making my teeth slightly whiter as well, but i will have to see if it gets them as white as i would like/expectvthem to be.</li>
            <li> The only draw back that I had was that it doesn&#x27;t foam up like my usual toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I really have noticed any type of whitening in the past few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to go for my next dental check-up to see if there is less plaque build-up.</li>
            <li> It last for about an half hour if I eat something or drink something.  </li>
            <li> I believe my overall mouth is healthier and cleaner, less &amp;#34;germier&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> A little gritty, but does the job.</li>
            <li> A little gritty, but I didn&#x27;t mind that.</li>
            <li> I found Pro-Health to be a little gritty</li>
            <li> A little gritty, but I didn&#x27;t mind that.</li>
            <li> Trying this toothpaste was a little different for me</li>
            <li> The gritty parcels take a little getting used too...</li>
            <li> It is a little gritty to me</li>
            <li> I have noticed after using this toothpaste for the last few weeks that my teeth are whiter.</li>
            <li> so I have never really had an issue with any of their products.  </li>
            <li> and it left my mouth sort of dried out feeling.</li>
            <li> The one thing that I Did not enjoy is that the toothpaste was gritty, I kept thinking about the Lil scrubbing bubbles, which is probably what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> The cap began not to close correctly after a few uses but it wasn&#x27;t a big deal to me.</li>
            <li> I noticed the my teeth were whiter only after using for a few days.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel cleaner and are less sensitive to cold and hot beverages.</li>
            <li> but for the right price you can&#x27;t go wrong with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> With this Crest toothpaste my sensitivity has diminished and my gums are less swollen and less red as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the Pro-Health part of it or the Whitening part of it, but I would not pay for the Pro-Health Whitening mint gel toothpaste, and would recommend a different type.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> It makes your mouth feel cleaner for a longer time than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste leaves a cleaner feeling in my mouth than other brands/type.</li>
            <li> , I am just not sure if it&#x27;s because I keep adding double the amount of toothpaste or if it&#x27;s just the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I value the ability to whiten my teeth with a toothpaste that covers my other needs too.</li>
            <li> but I think it is too runny compared to other toothpastes that I use.  </li>
            <li> but my other toothpaste do not seem to have this problem.  </li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste, just unsure about the whitening level of it compare to the other Crest Product.</li>
            <li> Other than it done the job.</li>
            <li> My gums tend to become swollen due to it.</li>
            <li> I also prefer the gel texture to other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t prefer the taste over other brands.</li>
            <li> He prefers the taste of this toothpaste over other brands.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste blows every other toothpaste I&#x27;ve used out of the water.</li>
            <li> It didnt foam up as much as other toothpastes and made my teeth feel</li>
            <li> I like the wide cap, so you can sit the tube on a cabinet shelf, upside down.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant because I normally do not like a &#x27;whitening&#x27; toothpaste</li>
            <li> I have tried previous brands and the taste was bitter and bleachy.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical after writing off Crest Complete recently.  </li>
            <li> A few of the past comments said they didn&#x27;t like the gritty feel.</li>
            <li> Whitening is about average.</li>
            <li> Also, I had some dental work done and it hasn&#x27;t affected any of the work negatively at all and as a matter of fact has only benefited my mouth/teeth.  </li>
            <li> If I have one complaint it is that it is a bit gritty.</li>
            <li> My family members would not use it after a few tries.</li>
            <li> But soon i realize the grit was a good thing it was cleaning working away grim on my teeth.</li>
            <li> , I can stand the tube up instead of laying it down.</li>
            <li> This product leaves your mouth feeling fresher for longer than any other product I have ever tried!</li>
            <li> So what I started doing was using the pro health at night and my other in the morning!</li>
            <li> harsh scrubbing particles like some other whitening toothpastes.&lt;br /&gt;Can</li>
            <li> It takes up a lot less space in your medicine cabinet that way.</li>
            <li> I drink a lot of tea each day and my teeth have a slight stain, but I have noticed the stains getting lighter since using this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> The flavor is typical</li>
            <li> I have a dentist appointment in less than a week for a 6 month cleaning...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started to notice a slight whitening, hopefully that will continue.</li>
            <li> As far as how the toothpaste works overall, it would rank around mid level for me.</li>
            <li> I also noticed a slight whitening effect after having used it for a few weeks.    </li>
            <li> It does feel a little grainy when you begin brushing for</li>
            <li> It has a little grittiness to it, but I guess that&#x27;s what helps whiten your teeth and rid them of plaque.</li>
            <li> no so little thst</li>
            <li> The toothpaste is a little runny</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the little bursts of flavor while brushing</li>
            <li> The toothpaste left a little bit of grittiness behind that I didn&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li> However, it leave a strange taste in the mouth and after taste that is not good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it everyday since I got it.</li>
            <li> Teeth are also noticeably whiter after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> I received the crest pro health from smiley 360 and I have used it everyday for a month.  </li>
            <li> However, it helps get stains out everyday for you</li>
            <li> I received a tube of Crest Pro-Health a few weeks ago from Smiley.  </li>
            <li> I have tried this product and within a few days I could see a difference.  </li>
            <li> even after just a few days my teeth are whiter</li>
            <li> Both my husband and myself are heavy coffee drinkers.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my mouth feeling raw or burning,  like  other toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> (I had less yellowing after longer use after drinking coffee!).</li>
            <li> no strong aftertaste or burning sensation.</li>
            <li> very much helped my husband with his gingivitis and accompanying bad breath.  </li>
            <li> Ever since I started using the Crest Pro-health toothpaste,  my mouth has felt fresher and less sensitive to cold and heat.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to like this, but I had a pretty bad reaction to it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have a serious problem with other tooth paste that burn and irritate my mouth, but Crest pro didn&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have as bad of a taste as other toothpastes made for sensitive teeth, so I appreciate that.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste has a little &#x27;grit&#x27; to it, but it was nothing to complaint about.</li>
            <li> It is a bit to minty for my taste, even though I use a small amount of toothpaste on my toothbrush,</li>
            <li> I have had some whitening ones that left a weird after taste but Crest Pro health whitening didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> After struggling with stains from a lifetime of drinking tea and using tobacco in the past, Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste has made a visible difference within the 2 weeks I have been using the product.</li>
            <li> and I usually choose a &#x27;gel&#x27; over a &#x27;paste&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant because I don&#x27;t usually care for the texture Crest has.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive teeth that causes me to experience severe sensitivity pain to cold air or cold liquid and a old root canal.</li>
            <li> I usually have no preference on toothpaste and buy whatever&#x27;s on sale, but I&#x27;ll go out of my way for this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> However, the toothpaste has small grandules of some sort in it and it feels like sand which I do not like.  </li>
            <li> so I usually stick with another brand of toothpaste to help alleviate the pain from sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> I usually use baking soda toothpaste</li>
            <li> I am not sure yet if my teeth are getting whiter.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to tell from day to day.</li>
            <li> After using Crest Pro-Health gel toothpaste for few days, I have not experienced any sensitivity pain whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I am a little obsessed about my teeth as I have worked in an orthodontic office in the past.  </li>
            <li> After trying it I am seriously considering switching.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I anxiously awaited the delivery of this Crest Pro Health toothpaste because I was eager to try it!!</li>
            <li> But, both my husband and I tired it</li>
            <li> I am so tired of the tooth paste tubes where the toothpaste hardens and get stuck in the tube.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a bad aftertaste like other toothpaste that I have tried.</li>
            <li> nothing too dramatic.  </li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed in that aspect, but otherwise, I am sold on the way it gets my teeth and gums cleaned and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after using this for a while I haven&#x27;t found my teeth to be any whiter than before.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, Smiley 360 and Crest -</li>
            <li> When I received a sample of Crest Pro-Health toothpaste from Smiley360, I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> I had no problems eating anything that was too cold at all</li>
            <li> It does not have that unpleasant aftertaste you often get with whitening toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> The taste was horrible.</li>
            <li> It gave my mouth a chemical burn, leaving me with terrible blisters.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was surprised to read the two (one was a duplicate) unfavorable reviews... we love this toothpaste. It has everything - cleaning, whitening, and sensitivity. We only use a small amount - most people use too much toothpaste, and it does have a strong flavor if you load your brush. As for the person who had sores in her mouth, that cannot possibly have anything to do with the toothpaste. If you use the recommended amount, the taste is fine - and I&#x27;m sensitive to strong flavors.    I like the wide cap, so you can sit the tube on a cabinet shelf, upside down. It takes up a lot less space in your medicine cabinet that way.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste has good consistency as Crest usually does.  However, it leave a strange taste in the mouth and after taste that is not good.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the Pro-Health part of it or the Whitening part of it, but I would not pay for the Pro-Health Whitening mint gel toothpaste, and would recommend a different type.</li>
            <li> As a member of smiley360.com, we received a free tube of crest pro health and I have to say that I love the taste of Crest over the other brands and I can tell the whitening in it is working as well as my teeth not being so sensitive. I would highly recommend this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Love the product,... wonderful smile</li>
            <li> I love this product! It has great cleaning power and a great flavor! I can feel it working while I brush! I will definitely purchase this product. I am a member of Smiley360, and I received this product for free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I received this recently and wanted top rate it.  I really like this toothpaste.  I  especially like the gritty particles that are in the toothpaste because it kind of feels like its giving my teeth an extra clean. I think the amount of foam that it makes is also perfect.  As far as the whitening, I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to determine if it is working.&lt;br /&gt;Overall...great!</li>
            <li> I just received free Crest Pro-Heath toothpast to sample and review from Smiley 360 I&#x27;ve tried a lot of toothpast in my life. And I have to say my mouth feels clean fresh and very healthy.I do think I have found my self a new toothpast. Thank you Crest!!</li>
            <li> I love it, I think starting it be the same but my surprise is my theft looks different, I look my mirror and I say brilliant and elegant theft is great, product,thanks , and my opinion is my and I receive that product free for test,I love it :-)</li>
            <li> Got a free tube of toothpaste and I loved the taste.  Unlike another reviewer I didn&#x27;t mind the gritty particles and felt it was helping to get my teeth cleaner and whiter.</li>
            <li> leaves you teeth feeling clean and the minty flavor has a slight tingle to it that lets you know it is working.</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro Health Whitening for free. This opinion is 100% my own. I really like this product! After only one week of use, my teeth are noticeably whiter.  The taste was also good as well, not too strong.  I have tried many whitening toothpaste&#x27;s and this one has worked quite well compared to others I have tried.  I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Crest is the only toothpaste i use that makes my teeth feel completely clean.  Received this particular one through Smiley360 and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Will purchase is the future.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is great.  I received it as a free sample from Smiley360 and couldn&#x27;t be happier about it.  I have always used Crest toothpaste and I am switching to this brand from now on.</li>
            <li> I received the toothbrush for free to test from smiley and was really impressed on how the different lengths of the bristols really cleaned in the hard to reach places and between the teeth  I&#x27;m impressed</li>
            <li> I am a member of Smiley360 and I received a tube of Crest pro health whitening fluoride toothpaste free for the purpose of reviewing the product. The opinions I share are my own. I grew up with Crest. It was the only toothpaste my family purchased! Many years have past and I have tried numerous toothpaste products. I was delighted to try this product, and was happily satisfied with the flavor!  I have to say I was surprised at the gritty particles in the toothpaste, however this product made my teeth feel clean.  Although I haven&#x27;t used Crest in a number of years I am going to include Crest pro health whitening fluoride toothpaste as part of my oral regiment. I would recommend trying Crest Pro Health Whitening Fluoride Toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Awesome. I got this for free in turn for review. The toothpaste is mellow and not as super strong minty (which I like better this way). You don&#x27;t get the gritty aftertaste in your mouth. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I recently tried this toothpaste that I  received a free full sized sample of this from Smiley360. I like the way it left my mouth feeling clean and the flavor is pleasant.</li>
            <li> Amazing taste, my teeth feel so much cleaner!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I received the Crest Pro Health Whitening Toothpaste full size sample for free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own I have used other products from the Pro health toothpaste line, but find that the Whitening formula helps with gradually removing old stains from being a coffee drinker for years. It leaves a nice minty taste afterwards, and my mouth feels so fresh for hours. Will definitely stick to the whitening formula from now on!</li>
            <li> I recently got a free tube of Crest Pro Health Whitening tooth paste because I am a member of Smiley360.com and was asked to write a review in exchange.  I like this tooth paste. It has a great taste, and it makes my teeth and mouth feel so clean.  I can already tell it is making my teeth slightly whiter as well, but i will have to see if it gets them as white as i would like/expectvthem to be. It has a gritty feeling while brushing, i understand that is how it cleans and it does rinse out well with water. I plan on buying more of this in the future.</li>
            <li> As a member Smiley 360 I have received this product to try for free and any opinion regarding this product is my own. As someone who has not purchased this particular brand before I was pleasantly surprised by the quality, taste, effectiveness and price. My teeth have never looked whiter just by using a toothpaste. I will be switching to Crest from now on.</li>
            <li> I recently received a tube of this toothpaste for free for testing purposes from Smiley360 (opinions are my own, however), but this is actually a toothpaste that I currently purchase for my husband and 3 kiddos! We have tried several other brands, but we seem to come back to this particular one!  Great taste and no chalky texture!  In regards to the whitening formula, I can honestly see a difference if I haven&#x27;t used this toothpaste for awhile and then come back to it...excellent product!  But for all the other benefits it provides, it is definitely worth it to me!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample from Smiley360 and in my own opinion, this is a great product. I&#x27;ve used it everyday since I got it. My mouth stays fresh for hours.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste! I received this free through Smiley360!  This is definitely my new toothpaste! The taste is not strong and the clean fresh feeling lasts for a while! I love it!</li>
            <li> Received Crest Pro Health Toothpaste to try for free and all opinions are my own. Crest Pro Health Toothpaste leaves your mouth feeling very fresh and your teeth feeling very clean. Teeth are also noticeably whiter after just a few uses. The fluoride is an added bonus that helps protect enamel. I will definitely buy and recommend to people.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this toothpaste through Smiley360. I saw it mentioned sensitivity on the package and was glad to try it because I have very sensitive teeth and gums. The toothpaste DID burn my mouth similar to most other regular toothpastes. I use other sensitive toothpaste and it is much milder than normal, this toothpaste did not QUITE fit that bill. So this is not the best way to go if you&#x27;re like me, but if you don&#x27;t need sensitive toothpaste, then I&#x27;m sure this is fine.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful. The taste is great just don&#x27;t like the fluoride in it.</li>
            <li> I recently received a free tube of Crest from Smiley360 and I love the fresh taste! I am hoping that it brightens my teeth so I will use and let you know.</li>
            <li> I received a full sized sample of Crest Pro Health Whitening from Smiley360 for free to test and review. I enjoyed how it made my mouth feel clean and fresh. Also the flavor was pleasant. I just felt it didn&#x27;t give me as much sensitivity protection as I need. Other than that, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love starting my day with fresh breath and a healthy smile and thanks to a free sample of #CrestProHealth from @smiley360 I was able to do so today.  I received product free but opinion is 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I received a free tube of Crest Pro Health Whitening from Smiley360Mission. My mouth is feeling super clean, looking bright, smelling fantastic. I have tried many Crest products before and have been happy with them. This. Crest Pro Health has really turned a page. Will definitely be buying when my sample runs out!</li>
            <li> I am a member of Smiley360 and I received a tube of Crest pro health whitening fluoride toothpaste free for the purpose of reviewing the product. The opinions I share are my own.

            <li> I received a tube of this Crest Pro Health toothpaste for free from Smiley360 for the purpose of my review. This review is 100% my own opinion. This toothpaste is great and my whole family loves it! It&#x27;s the only brand my fianc&amp;eacute; will buy. It makes your mouth feel cleaner for a longer time than other brands I&#x27;ve tried. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the flavor stays in your mouth for a longer time as well. Overall though I feel like it&#x27;s a good toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I got a free full size sample from Smiley360!  It has a great flavor and whitens really well.  The only draw back that I had was that it doesn&#x27;t foam up like my usual toothpaste.  But if I brush a second time this toothpaste works wonders!  It also helps to repel my coffee in the mornings from staining my teeth (I had less yellowing after longer use after drinking coffee!).</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product in the mail through smiley 360 for reviewing, but my comments and opinion are completely my own. This toothpaste leaves a cleaner feeling in my mouth than other brands/type. The minty taste is actually good flavorwise (i dont like spearmint). I was surprised that there was crunchy bits in the toothpaste, which is why i gave it a 4 star-because its like biting into small bits of gritty sand! I would appreciate it more if the small bits were more like bursts of tiny soft bubbles. Also, it would be nice if they could add a bit more spiciniess or kick in their mint for an even fresher feeling and taste!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Crest Pro-Health Whitening Toothpaste for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;As a child, my family always bought Crest toothpastes, and I&#x27;ve always enjoyed the flavor in comparison to other toothpaste brands. However, in my marriage, we always seemed to buy Colgate Total. While that is a fine toothpaste, when I received the sample, I discovered that this Crest product tasted far better than the Colgate. My teeth felt just as clean, but the flavor in my mouth was better. In the future, I will make sure I buy Crest more often.</li>
            <li> I do really really like this toothpaste.  There is only one con.  I feel like when you are brushing it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; as much as the other toothpastes do.  Basically you end up feeling like you need to add more toothpaste to keep brushing your teeth.  I do feel like i have seen results, I am just not sure if it&#x27;s because I keep adding double the amount of toothpaste or if it&#x27;s just the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I anxiously awaited the delivery of this Crest Pro Health toothpaste because I was eager to try it!! When I received it, I went straight to brush my teeth, haha!! And might I say, I was 95% satisfied with this product. The only drawback to the Crest Pro Health Toothpaste is that it didn&#x27;t foam to my liking. I believe with foam, the bubbles and such can reach I between your teeth better! But, overall...I was very pleased with this product. It has a fresh, clean taste and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; my mouth like most oral care! And the whitening properties seem to work better than other toothpastes with the same claim. I have and will continue to recommend this product to my family and friends!! Thanks Smiley360 for the great trial opportunity!! And thanks Crest for an overall great product!!</li>
            <li> I received a tube of Crest whitening toothpaste to try for free. A few of the past comments said they didn&#x27;t like the gritty feel. I disagree as the grit makes me feel as if all the stains and yellow coloring is being scrubbed off my teeth. This is the main reason to purchase whitening toothpaste.  It is a bit to minty for my taste, even though I use a small amount of toothpaste on my toothbrush,</li>
            <li> I received pro-health as a freebie to try and review, so I tried it and here&#x27;s my review - the taste is good, minty, but not eye-popping. it has little gritty things to help clean and whiten, , it foams well, and it seems to really clean. I have a little sensitivity, and it also seemed to help that, all in all a good product, does what it says it does.  you can&#x27;t ask for more than that!</li>
            <li> I love Crest pro health! I received this toothpaste free from Smile360 to review. I have used it now for a couple of weeks and am very happy with the results. First of all it has a great taste. It is not too strong and it leaves your mouth feeling extra fresh. My teeth feel very clean after each use and I love that this whitens. I love that i can protect my teeth. but also work on whitening them at the same time! Everyone loves a healthy smile and clean breath!</li>
            <li> I received a free tube of crest pro health toothpaste and couldn&#x27;t even finish brushing my teeth. The taste was horrible.</li>
            <li> I received a free tube of Crest Pro health for my review. It made mu teeth feel great and also they looked whiter after using the tub of Crest Pro Heath. I would recommend it to everyone to use. Great product for healthy teeth and mouth</li>
            <li> RECEIVED CREST PRO HEALTH TOOTHPASTE FROM SMILEY 360 TO TRY MY TEETH FEEL SO CLEAN AND SMOOTH I AM ONLY BUYING THIS IN THE FUTURE I ALSO SEE SHINER TEETH</li>
            <li> I received my free full size Crest Pro Heath Whiting. I have noticed a difference, in my already pretty white teeth. Even my husband noticed! I also have sensitive teeth at times when I brush and this toothpaste has not bothered my teeth at all. I would recommend Crest Pro Health to any one with sensitive teeth and need to do some whiting. This is 100% my own opinion and experience. I will continue to buy Crest Pro Health</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste. The taste was minty and fresh. It left my mouth feeling clean. To top it all off, my teeth are looking better than they have in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I received a free full size sample of this product to review from Smiley 360. The opinions expressed in this review are 100% my own. The toothpaste was a little gritty at first, but I got used to it. Tastes much better than baking soda peroxide-based toothpastes. Whitening is about average. My teeth were fairly clean white from the start from a recent teeth cleaning at the dentist. It does the job. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I recently a free tube of Crest Pro Health from Smiley 360 and was pleasantly surprised at the taste. Unlike many other toothpastes, I thought the taste was refreshing without the filmy or paste-like residue</li>
            <li> I liked it a lot, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but I can&#x27;t get over the grittiness to it. All in all a great toothpaste and left my mouth feeling clean, but the grittiness of toothpaste? Really? I could do with out that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received Crest pro Health for free to test from smiley 360 (thank you guys )&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste does the job, love the way it makes your teeth feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;No harsh scrubbing particles like some other whitening toothpastes.&lt;br /&gt;Can only recommend this :)</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. My family likes Crest toothpaste and we use it a lot. We tried the Crest Pro Health Clean Mint and it leaves our breath minty fresh and leaves a clean taste. It does a great job cleaning our teeth. Crest can always be counted on for good quality and a trustworthy product. I highly recommend Crest Pro Health toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I am a Smiley360 member and received this product for free to review. I usually use Colgate Total which makes similar claims as far as what it does. I noticed this tooth paste is a gel, which I normally don&#x27;t like, but figured I&#x27;d give it a try. I really like the texture,  taste and the way my mouth felt after using it. I&#x27;ve been using it now for a few weeks and although it doesn&#x27;t whiten as much as whitening strips, my teeth do look whiter. I will definitely be making the switch to Crest ProHealth.</li>
            <li> I received a full size tube of the Crest Pro-Health Whitening for free a couple of weeks ago from Smiley360. I really like the fresh minty taste of my mouth after brushing. Not only do my teeth feel clean they are clean and it doesn&#x27;t take a lot either. The freshness lasts a long time too. It does feel a little grainy when you begin brushing for once it foams up that feeling disappears. I have used  other brands of toothpaste for sensitive teeth before,however Crest Pro-Health is by far the best yet. I also like the design of the top it stands well on the counter. I have used the Crest brand for many years and Crest Pro-Health proves that I can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. I am also an avid coffee drinker but with the use of this product you can&#x27;t tell. The health of my teeth is very important and to find a product for sensitivity, gingivitis, plaque, tartar that whitens and freshens your breath all in one is fantastic. I would recommend to anyone to try this product for themselves I believe they will be glad that they did. This product was also recommended by my dentist before I received my free one. This review is 100% my own opinion. Love this product!</li>
            <li> I received a full size tube of the Crest Pro-Health Whitening for free a few weeks ago from Smiley360.com&lt;br /&gt;never really tried this toothpaste before I would highly recommend this product to everyone it does a great job and the taste is good.</li>
            <li> I got this as a mission from smiley 360 and i use it every morning! I love it. Gives me a fresh tase in my mouth</li>
            <li> I received a tube of Crest Pro-Health toothpaste from Smiley360. my teeth and mouth feel clean and fresh after using it.</li>
            <li> This product was provided to me by Smiley360 to try and then provide a review based on my personal opinion. I love Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste-Whitening in the Fresh Clean Mint.  My teeth feel clean and smooth after brushing.  I am a big coffee drinker and appreciate the fact that the whitening factor in the toothpaste really works!</li>
            <li> i liked the taste and feel of the Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste - Whitening . i can tell it has made my teeth whiter and I&#x27;ve only used it about 7 times so far. i would recommend it to my friends.  i like the way it sets in my cabinet in a package that is ready to use. just flip the cap and its ready. I received this product for free, and this is my review 100%</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this toothpaste.  This toothpaste has elevated my feeling of clean and fresh oral care.  My mouth feels so incredibly clean after using it that it gives me that boost of confidence to start my day.  A high quality product such as this toothpaste makes me feel that I am making the best choice possible in taking care of my oral health.  I will continue to purchase this product!</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro-Health toothpaste for free to review. I must say, it definitely left my mouth feeling clean and fresh. I even got a compliment when kissing my fiancé! (Blushing) this is a great brand that I will go out and purchase when I run out!</li>
            <li> I received the crest pro health from smiley 360 and I have used it everyday for a month.  I did not feel as though my teeth stayed clean.  The toothpaste did not clean nor keep my teeth as clean as my normal brand.  It also made my gums feel dry.</li>
            <li> I am a member of Smiley360 and I got to try this for free! One thing I am picky about is the taste of the toothpaste. I have had some whitening ones that left a weird after taste but Crest Pro health whitening didn&#x27;t. It had a nice mint taste and left my breath refreshed. I def. recommend this product! It is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Surprised when I tried this, I always buy sensitive toothpaste.  This said it was sensitive but, it wasn&#x27;t considered a sensitive toothpaste.  I was concerned.  But, both my husband and I tired it and it was great.  It tasted like the Crest I remembered as a kid.  I would definitely buy this toothpaste again.</li>
            <li> My new favorite toothpaste. All the great taste and cleaning power of Crest Pro-Health with the added plus of whitening! I already bought Crest Pro-Health so it will be replaced with this! Nothing else for me. Thank you Crest!</li>
            <li> Started using CrestProHealth whitening tooth for about a week now &amp; my teeth are much more white then they were beforem. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I just received my sample of crest pro health toothpaste tried it today for the first time. the taste is nice and yes I will try it again. The minty  taste was nice, well tell all friends and family</li>
            <li> This is the best whitening toothpaste I have ever tried.  All of the whitening toothpaste I have tried did not give me the clean feeling and this one does!  It scrubs the surface of my teeth really well, they feel really smooth and do look whiter.  The taste is mild, not overly powderful which I like.  It melts better than their blue toothpaste so you don&#x27;t have anything stuck on your toothbrush.  But don&#x27;t think this is a miracle paste that your teeth will turn pearly white the next day.  Because it just doesn&#x27;t happen like that.  However, it helps get stains out everyday for you and I am very happy with this product.  The only thing I do not like is the closure.  It does not &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; when I close and the shape of the tip can easily get toothpaste stuck around it.  However, based on performance I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product for free, from smiley360. The opinion of this product is 100% my own!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample from Smiley 360 to try.  The product overall is good but I don&#x27;t like how gritty it is.  It has a good flavor and leaves your mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> After struggling with stains from a lifetime of drinking tea and using tobacco in the past, Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste has made a visible difference within the 2 weeks I have been using the product. The flavor and texture are pleasant and feel thorough in their cleansing power. I have been a Crest user for years and will now be using the Pro-Health line.&lt;br /&gt;I received Crest Pro-Health as a free sample &amp; opinions expressed here are solely mine.</li>
            <li> I received this toothpaste as a free sample from smiley360 to try out. I have used it, i enjoy the clean feelin after brushing my teeth that lasts for a long time. My only issue is the grit in the toothpaste. But i will continue to use this for my whole family. We like it.</li>
            <li> : \\&quot;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great taste and amazing clean feeling that really lasts</li>
            <li> I am a Smiley360 member and received this product for free to review. I really like the texture of this toothpaste and the flavor. My teeth feel very clean and my mouth very fresh after using this toothpaste. Some toothpastes actually make my teeth feel more sensitive but this toothpaste does not. I do like that not only does it whiten, but it also protects against sensitivity. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro-Health Whitening Toothpaste free from Smiley360 to sample and review.  It works well, tastes great, would recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste because it cleans my teeth so well and leaves my mouth tasting and feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.  I have been using this toothpaste for about 3 weeks now and love it.  I have tried previous brands and the taste was bitter and bleachy.  But, the Crest ProHealth Whitening has a great taste.  I drink a lot of tea each day and my teeth have a slight stain, but I have noticed the stains getting lighter since using this toothpaste.  Also, I only use a small amount of the toothpaste as it is very strong and bubbly.  Overall great product.</li>
            <li> I received Crest pro health whitening fluoride toothpaste for free to give my 100% opinion.  I absolutely love Crest pro health whitening fluoride toothpaste!  I have alway&#x27;s been a Crest girl &amp; it&#x27;s keeps on getting better.  Makes my teeth so white, also leaves my mouth so fresh &amp; clean.  I recommend this to everyone for a fresh &amp; clean mouth &amp; pearly whites :)</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Crest Pro Health &amp; have been very impressed with it! I love the fresh feeling after I use it &amp; my teeth feel very clean. I love their whole line of Pro Health products and also use the oral rinse on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try this product for free from Smiley360 and I&#x27;m really glad I did. This is a really great tooth paste that leaves your mouth feeling really  clean and healthy. I&#x27;ve replaced my regular tooth paste with Crest Pro Health Whitening. My daughter and fiancé really like the flavor. It is minty without being over powering. Combine it with the Pro Health tooth brush for maximum health and whitening. (I purchased the ACrest Pro Health tooth brush on my own to pair it with the sample I received from Skiley360.) The views expressed in this review are my own and were not influenced by the free product I received.</li>
            <li> This is a great tasting toothpaste.  Normally I use the sensitive Crest toothpaste but since I got this free sample for my opinion I decided to try it.  It leaves a great fresh taste in your mouth.  You don&#x27;t even need mouthwash after using it.  It leaves your breath minty fresh.  My whole mouth feels cleaner after I use it.</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste I have ever used!!</li>
            <li> this is truly a great toothpaste. i received a free tube through smiley360.com, but that is not why i am praising this product. It works great and leaves a clean, just brushed feeling that lasts and lasts. My teeth are also noticeably whiter. Just hope that when i go to the dentist, i dont have any new cavities, but i&#x27;m feeling pretty confident that i won&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> I received this from Smiley 360 to test. These opinions are 100% my own. I absolutely love this toothpaste. It does a great job of cleaning and my mouth feels fresh. I went to my dentist for a checkup and it was the best I have ever had. She told me to keep using it. I have a new toothpaste and will not use anything else.</li>
            <li> I received a free tube of crest pro health from smiley360, great product I recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I received a tube of Crest Pro Health whitening toothpaste to try. What a way to wake your mouth up and brighten your smile. Tastes good and leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh...lasts for hours! A little gritty, but does the job. Crest has definitely come a long way. Not the Crest I used as a child! http://h5.sml360.com/-/4x76</li>
            <li> I received a tube of Crest Pro-Health a few weeks ago from Smiley.  I love this stuff.  My teeth feel like I just visited the dentist for a cleaning every time I use it.  From now on Crest Pro-Health is the only toothpaste for me!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this toothpaste and I&#x27;ve used it now for a couple of weeks. I really like the fresh minty flavor that is not too strong.</li>
            <li> I am a Smiley360 member and received this product for free to review. My opinion of the product is my own.&lt;br /&gt;This was my first time using a Crest Pro-Health product. I was a little hesitant because I normally do not like a &#x27;whitening&#x27; toothpaste and I usually choose a &#x27;gel&#x27; over a &#x27;paste&#x27;. Three people in my family used the product and we were all very happy with it. The toothpaste has a little &#x27;grit&#x27; to it, but it was nothing to complaint about. The paste has a wonderful flavor, cleaned our teeth very well and worked exceptionally well on stains. My son had a stain on his tooth for several years from wearing braces. After using this product for a few weeks, the stain that would not go away is now completely gone. We all love this product, would definitely recommend to others for purchase and we will be using this in our family from now on. Thank You Crest for providing the best products in oral care.</li>
            <li> I was lucky to receive a full size tube of Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste- Fresh Clean Mint for free from Smiley 360. I wanted to share my opinion of the product to give insight into how effective it has been for me personally. I am a huge advocate for amazing dental hygiene and strive to always get a thumbs-up at each and every dentist appointment. This toothpaste is actually the multi-tasker of all toothpastes without a doubt. Many toothpastes will claim they can whiten teeth or help with sensitivity or help with tartar or keep your breath fresh and more. This toothpaste does all of these things and exceeded my expectations. I have sensitive teeth and this absolutely worked better than the brand I was using prior to this.  I had no problems eating anything that was too cold at all so it filled my need for sensitivity protection. In my profession I always need to make a great impression and because I smile a lot I value the ability to whiten my teeth with a toothpaste that covers my other needs too. I enjoy my two cups of coffee each day and Crest Pro-Health made it possible that I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about any lasting coffee stains on my teeth. The fact that Crest Pro-Health was inspired by dentists just adds another feather to its cap. Ooh and I don&#x27;t want to forget to mention that it&#x27;s Triclosan-free. Triclosan is being further reviewed by the FDA because it may actually help make bacterias resistant to antibiotics. It has also been shown to alter hormone regulation in animals. It is not proven to actually be a danger to people at this point but, the FDA is definitely looking into it further. I prefer to avoid products with Triclosan in them just to stay on the safe side. Thank you so much Crest for your awesome multi-tasking Crest Pro-Health. I received this product for free for the purpose of my review and all of my opinions are  100% my own.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product and within a few days I could see a difference.  I have a problem with tarter and this so far has been the best product for me.  I feel that when I brush with it, I am getting the most from my toothpaste. The taste is just right, not overpowering and the texture is gritty enough that I know it is cleaning.  I am very satisfied with the product and the price is just right.  I also like the fact that I have looked in several stores that I shop and it seems to always be in stock.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste and that it does not have triclosan.</li>
            <li> I Love Smiley 360 I received a tube of Crest Pro-Health Whitening and it is working great so far.  I have only been using for two weeks!  Hoping for more improvement as I continuing use.  I am a heavy sweet tea/coffee drinker too and have lessening of stains..my breath is fresh and it I like the flavor.  I found it not to be grainy or drying.  My boyfriend who smokes has been using and having an even better result.  I have shared what is happening too my smile with many people!  I live in a high rise condo in south Florida with over 150 units.  Many people have asked what am I doing different with my smile/teeth and I have told them..that I have started using Crest 3D whitening ..that is it! I will buy this product again.  Oh, I also like that the product is for whole health mouth including gingivitis and gum disease. Thanks. If you want to join the program and get free full size products too, here is the link.  These are my opinions and thoughts.  http://h5.sml360.com/-/1761</li>
            <li> Cleans teeth well, doesn&#x27;t take too much on toothbrush to do the work. I was given a free sample to give my own personal opinion  I enjoy the way my mouth feels after brushing. I have now changed to Crest ProHealth for the great job it does in my mouth and the mouths of my family.</li>
            <li> I am a Smiley360 member and received this product for free to review. This synopsis of my opinion of the product is my own.  I am a life long Crest Original fan.  I have been fairly certain that no other product would make me as happy as that one. Then along came Crest ProHealth Whitening. I was glad it was a paste and not a gel (personal preference) and found it much thicker than the Original formula. It also had a pretty powerful minty flavor that left my mouth super fresh and lasted a long time. A little gritty, but I didn&#x27;t mind that. It reminded me of the stuff the dental hygienist uses when I get my teeth cleaned.  I might have found a new toothpaste!</li>
            <li> i received a free sample of this tooth paste and it was great left my mouth really clean. will buy this product in the future</li>
            <li> I received this as a free sample to try and I love it.</li>
            <li> I received a tube of crest pro health for free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I did not feel like this toothpaste got my teeth as clean as my normal toothpaste. It didn&#x27;t freshen my breath, which is something I expect from my toothpaste. Even brushing twice it still wasn&#x27;t great. I would not purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product,my new toothpaste.not expensive leaves your mouth healthy and clean</li>
            <li> Received this as a free sample and so glad I did.  Love the texture, the taste and how clean it makes my mouth feel.  Will def buy this in the furture</li>
            <li> I got to try the new Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste for free and review it by giving my own 100% honest opinion.  I have been a Crest lover of all their products since I have been a child, and they just keep improving their products all the time.  The Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste is no exception.  My teeth, mouth and gums feel so clean and fresh.....just like I came from the dentist.  I would highly recommend this product to everyone, along with all the other Crest Pro-Health products they make!  Love them all!</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro-Health Whitening Toothpaste, free from Smiley360 to try and review. I usually use natural toothpaste so the mint is a little strong for me. I did like and notice my teeth seemed whiter after only a weeks use. while the mint is strong it does keep your mouth feeling fresh and is long lasting. overall I really like this toothpaste and will keep using it along with my natural toothpaste to keep my teeth whiter, I highly recommend giving it a try!</li>
            <li> I was excited to get my free sample of crest pro-health toothpaste to review from crest and smiley360.  At first, it took me by surprise, with the crunching, but then I realized it&#x27;s just like getting your teeth cleaned at the dentist.  It makes my mouth feel fresh for a long time.  much longer than the other brands.  Ever since I started using the Crest Pro-health toothpaste,  my mouth has felt fresher and less sensitive to cold and heat.  I&#x27;ve also noticed them getting whiter.  This toothpaste works great.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I am a part of smiley360 and was chosen to participate in this mission.  This was free and much appreciated.  Crest has great product and this as well is up on the list.  Thanks again for having me a part of this. Smiley360 and crest pro health.  All free and this is done on my own.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product from Smiley360.  I was hesitant because I don&#x27;t usually care for the texture Crest has.  This product was great.  No grittiness afterwards.</li>

            <li> I love the new crest pro health!! as me being a member of the smile 360 program I got a free sample of a full size bottle. I am so glad that I got to try this before I buy it. love this product and would recommend it to everyone. made my teeth and mouth feel clean all day long. such a great product</li>
            <li> I received a full tube of toothpaste totally free of charge to try and review , and any ideas , opinions are solely my own. I like this tooth paste a lot as another had said it doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive teeth and gums , I like the fact it&#x27;s not gritty like other whitening toothpastes and that it leaves your mouth smelling great , very minty and refreshing and also makes my teeth sparkle and , I can see my teeth getting whiter each time  I use it which is amazing since I&#x27;ve only been using for 3 days so far!</li>
            <li> Has great taste as it whitens teeth. Makes teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Crest Pro Health from Smiley360.  I have been a Crest user since childhood.  BUT, this Crest Pro Health is terrific!  It has whitening action added and I am confident it prevents stains and discoloration from all the sodas and coffee I drink.  My smile is brighter and my teeth feel cleaner!  The gel leaves a great taste in my mouth and gives me confidence that I have fresh breath for quite a long time after brushing!  I think anyone that wants a great whitening toothpaste that leaves your mouth fresh and clean should definitely use Crest Pro Health!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product for free, so this opinion is 100% my own!  My teeth felt very clean and it really freshened my breath.  My teeth are very sensitive to whitening toothpastes and after using for a couple weeks I needed to alternate between this and a toothpaste specifically for sensitive teeth other than that I really liked this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My favorite toothpaste!  My breath stays fresher longer and my teeth seem several shades whiter after about a month of use.</li>
            <li> Received a free Crest Pro Health Whitening sample from Smiley360. I was impressed with how it didn&#x27;t hurt my teeth like some other toothpastes did. After using for 4 days, I noticed my teeth felt cleaner and started to look like they were getting whiter. I really liked the flavor too. I would recommend this toothpaste as it is now my favorite.</li>
            <li> I received Crest ProHealth toothpaste free for the purposes of my review. This opinion is 100% my own. I like this toothpaste...makes my mouth feel clean and my teeth feel smooth. They are a little whiter after using one tube, which to me is good &amp;#34;cause I am leary of using whitening strips. The only drawback, and this may seem petty, is the texture. It has a little grittiness to it, but I guess that&#x27;s what helps whiten your teeth and rid them of plaque. I will continue to use this toothpaste, but not all the time as I am concerned about the whitening agents on a prolonged basis.</li>
            <li> I received a free full size tube from Smiley360. I have been using Crest on and off for years and this toothpaste does the trick. It taste fine and it cleans.</li>
            <li> I love the Crest Pro Health toothpaste. Since I&#x27;ve started using this line, I&#x27;ve gotten great feedback from my dentist. So, it really works! I won&#x27;t use anything else, now, because of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the flavor. It&#x27;s not overpowering like some super minty toothpastes. I also love that it whitens teeth, protects against tartar, gingivitis, etc.! Most whitening toothpastes make my sensitive-prone teeth even more sensitive. This toothpaste never did that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I am a Smiley360 member and received this product for free to review. The opinions expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> I got this free sample from smiley360. I was excited to try it. I liked the taste, but didn&#x27;t care for the after taste so much. It did leave my teeth feeling clean. I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in my teeth being whiter.</li>
            <li> I received this sample for free and my opinions are 100% my own. I love everything about this toothpaste! The texture is pleasant and my teeth do feel Dentist clean after I brush. The mint flavor is good and not too strong. I have noticed after using this toothpaste for the last few weeks that my teeth are whiter. I would definitely recommend this toothpaste to everyone!</li>
            <li> I RECIEVED My Crest pro health Free W Smiley 360..And We All Love the Toothpaste!! I WILL ALWAYS Buy Crest Pro Health Whitening!!!</li>
            <li> I love it, didn&#x27;t leave a chalky after taste.  Got my mouth clean and refreshing.  would recommend it to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> This product leaves your mouth feeling fresher for longer than any other product I have ever tried!</li>
            <li> My husband is really picky about his toothpaste and he thoroughly loved this one. The taste was great and the added benefits of whitening and tartar control were great. I&#x27;ll be purchasing this brand from now on. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I received this full size trial as a member of Smiley.com free! This was the best toothpaste ever. Within a week I could see how my teeth were getting whiter. The best part was the taste! A lot of the so called &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried left a slimy feel in my mouth afterwords. The flavor was fresh and clean, and my mouth felt clean, not slimy after I was done. I went out and bought this, and plan to continue using it. Thanks for the opportunity Smiley360!!!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this from Smiley 360. This product is absolutely amazing. It works so well &amp; leaves my mouth feeling so clean &amp; fresh. I definitely found a new toothpaste. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love the Crest pro-health line of products ! This toothpaste is my favorite, by far. Ive tried many different toothpastes and this one, by far, gets the job done. The paste is not gritty or overly abrasive at all. The mint flavor is strong, but not overpowering and it foams nicely- no so little thst it&#x27;s ineffective,  but not so much that it leaves you looking like a rabid dog. My mouth feels refreshed and my teeth smooth and clean after brushing. It doesn&#x27;t leave my mouth feeling raw or burning,  like  other toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried in the past. My problem with tartar and plaque build up are non-existent now, thanks to my extended use of Crest Pro health toothpaste. ..and my dentist LOVES it ! I highly recommend the Crest Pro-health toothpaste..it has improved my dental health &amp; tastes great .  I received a free product from Smiley360 for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I really love this toothpaste!  I felt a deeper clean and the whitening helped keep my recently ZOOM whitening procedure looking sparkly white.  The taste is enjoyable for a toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a creature of habit. I have been using Arm and Hammer toothpaste for YEARS occasionally trying other things, but always going back. I received a complimentary sample of Crest Pro Health Whitening. Not only does it taste great, it whitens and keeps my breath really fresh. I LOVE IT and will change my go-to.</li>
            <li> I am a Smiley360 member and received my free trial of Crest pro health whitening toothpaste!! The flavor was really good and my teeth felt really clean. It did have a gritty texture, but all in all I was pleased with it! This is just my opinion and I will def. be using it as my toothpaste!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rating the crest pro toothpaste  a 5.I love how it made my mouth fresh and clean.And my kids love it to</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Crest Pro-Health Whitening Toothpaste for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I have extremely sensitive teeth that causes me to experience severe sensitivity pain to cold air or cold liquid and a old root canal. After using Crest Pro-Health gel toothpaste for few days, I have not experienced any sensitivity pain whatsoever. Plus, the taste is a refreshing cool mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product for controlling my sensitive teeth, the taste and whitening (I guess if used long enough) are added bonuses. I give it five stars.</li>
            <li> I am a Smiley360 member and received this product for free to review. The following is my own opinion of the product.  The toothpaste has a strong but not overpowering flavor.  It freshens your breath and whitens your teeth.  I definitely will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> All my family ever used when I was a kid was Crest but I had not tried it in a while. This came to me as a free trial and I was pleasantly surprised. I like the whitening and the taste. My husband did not like it as much, saying it had an aftertaste, but overall, I think it&#x27;s a good toothpaste for our family.</li>
            <li> I am pretty picky when it comes to toothpaste and I really like this Crest ProHealth toothpaste.  Like many have said, it does have a grittiness to it but it is great for getting my teeth super clean.  I also love how minty fresh it makes my breath. I also have very sensitive teeth and gums and have noticed a big improvement since I started using this toothpaste.  My teenage son has declared this his new favorite.  I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is wonderful!  It leaves your teeth feeling smooth and clean.  The taste is fresh and minty.  It is great for adults .My kids don&#x27;t like the taste very well though. As for the whitening, it seems to help.  I have been Crest customer for many years, but this is one of the best.</li>
            <li> I really like the taste of this toothpaste and like how clean my mouth feels after using. I received a free sample from smiley 360, but this is my own opinion.</li>
            <li> received this product for free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.”</li>
            <li> I recently received a tube of this toothpaste for free for testing purposes (opinions are my own, however), but this is actually toothpaste I already buy regularly for my sensitive teeth. I&#x27;ve had to use special toothpaste for my sensitive teeth for a few years now but switched to Pro-Health a few months ago. It doesn&#x27;t have as bad of a taste as other toothpastes made for sensitive teeth, so I appreciate that. The texture isn&#x27;t as chalky as others, either (though it definitely has a bit of &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; to it compared to a regular toothpaste). In regards to the whitening formula, I honestly can&#x27;t tell if it makes a difference in the color of my teeth even though I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now so I can&#x27;t speak to that. But for all the other benefits it provides, it is definitely worth it to me!</li>
            <li> I have used this toothpaste for two weeks now and have noticed how brighter my smile is.  The taste is great and I feel that I am getting the best bang for my buck. I received one tube of this product for free for the purpose of my review. I have since purchased additional tubes for my family.  My opinion on Crest pro health whitening fluride toothpaste is 100 per cent my own.  While I feel this product is perfect for myself and my family it might not be for yours.  All in all, great product from a company you can trust.</li>
            <li> I received this as a free product for review.  While the produce worked well, I think I would need more then one tube (and use the other products in the line) to try to achieve the full effect wanted.  I liked the taste and feel of the toothpaste while using it :)</li>
            <li> I received the Crest Pro-Health toothpaste for free to sample and review from Smiley 360.The toothpaste had a great refreshing taste and it made my mouth feel  completely clean. My teeth felt like they had been polished! I really loved this product and would recommend it for everyone!</li>
            <li> I received a free tube of this to try and this is by far the best toothpaste my family and I have tried we will be purchasing this in the future. great taste and leaves your mouth feeling fresh</li>
            <li> I love Crest products and was happy to be able to try Crest Pro Health for FREE to review. I really like the Fresh Clean Minty taste it brings when brushing my teeth. My husband normally only uses one certain brand but I got him to try this one and he likes it as well. It really makes my mouth feel extra clean.</li>
            <li> I tried this product thanks to Smiley360!  I got the product sample in return for my review.  Crest Pro Health has a nice minty flavor that bubbles a little in your mouth.  My mouth felt really clean after using this product.  I feel that Crest Pro Health is a super product well worth the money you spend.  The minty flavor is long lasting, even after brushing has been completed.</li>
            <li> I was lucky to get picked for this mission form smiley 360 to review this product for free I would recommend this toothpaste to anyone because it&#x27;s great it cleans your teeth really good doesn&#x27;t have a bad  after teast just leaves your mouth feeling great</li>
            <li> I tried the new Crest Pro-Health Whitening toothpaste that I received for free from Smiley 360. I have to say, I was not as impressed as I wanted to be. It works, I will give it that. The whitening effect takes a good week to be really noticeable but it does eventually whiten your teeth. The toothpaste is a little runny so you have to use twice the normal amount to feel like you are really brushing. The first few times I used it seemed to really burn my gums, I guess from peroxide. It whitens dental work a lot faster than natural teeth. Considering it is much more expensive than regular toothpaste and you have to use twice as much, it is something I would use for a special occasion, not as everyday toothpaste.</li>
            <li> teeth felt very clean &amp; loved that it was good for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I  received this product for free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own; Toothpaste arrived two days ago. So far, so good, has not caused any sensitivity in my gums, I brush twice daily with this, intend to use for a month &amp; then I&#x27;ll post another review.</li>
            <li> I received a tube of Crest Pro-health to try in order to review it.  Well, I&#x27;ve tried it and love it.  Crest Pro-health makes my mouth feel clean and tastes great.  It leave my mouth feeling fresh and clean.  I&#x27;ll be using it from now on.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste. Flavor is pleasant, and does a great job of cleaning teeth. My teeth feel clean, and are getting whiter. Love this toothpaste</li>
            <li> my mouth feels so fresh and clean.  even after just a few days my teeth are whiter</li>
            <li> I liked it had my teeth white in no time</li>
            <li> Began using #CrestProHealth a week ago after receiving a free sample from @mysmiley360. Tho the product was free, my opinion is my own and I really love it.  I&#x27;m using fresh clean mint flavor and my mouth feels clean like I just left my hygienist. I have sensitive teeth and this toothpaste really helps with that issue. I will continue to use CrestProHealth.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste, it cleans wonderfully and after I brush I can tell that my teeth are much cleaner than with any other toothpaste. It helps to keep my teeth white and healthy and leaves my mouth tasting fresh and clean. This will be my new regular brand from now on</li>
            <li> I received a free tube of Crest Pro-Health Whitening Fluoride toothpaste to review. This is my honest opinion. Crest Pro-Health is a decent toothpaste. I prefer a bit more of a strong mint flavor in my toothpaste though. As far as doing a great job of whitening my teeth, not anything noticeable. I appreciated the free toothpaste to try but wouldn&#x27;t be able to recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Smiley360 I was able to get a sample of Crest Pro Health and try it out.  I really enjoy using this toothpaste and you can tell a difference after a few days of using it.  My teeth are whiter and feel really clean after I have used Crest Pro Health.  My only problem and it may seem picky but I think it is too runny compared to other toothpastes that I use.  It seems to fall off the toothbrush easily.  I guess this could be caused by a warmer room temperature but my other toothpaste do not seem to have this problem.  I have always used Crest for almost all of my toothpaste needs so I have never really had an issue with any of their products.  Thanks again to Smiley360 for letting me try it out for free.</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.  I received it from www.smiley360.com http://h5.sml360.com/-/3l4u&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been an avid Crest user for most of my life.  I had to change to a different brand because my teeth have become more sensitive and brittle.  I liked the clean feeling of this toothpaste.  I gave the rest of the sample to my coworker and her 2 kids.  I think many people will be happy with how clean your teeth feel after using this product.</li>
            <li> I am a member of Smiley 360 and received a free sample of Crest Pro-Health toothpaste.  The opinion is my own and is not influenced by any other party.  I have always been a faithful user of Crest dental products.  So when I received this sample of Crest Pro-Health toothpaste I was excited to try it!  I am a little obsessed about my teeth as I have worked in an orthodontic office in the past.  First impression: It tasted so good!  The mint wasn&#x27;t overpowering and I absolutely love that it has the granules.  It makes me feel like I&#x27;m really getting my teeth clean.  Plus, it has so many benefits including whitening.  Something that I always look for when I purchase toothpaste.  I would highly recommend this toothpaste to anyone.  With all the benefits it provides it would be perfect for anyone.</li>
            <li> I received a free full size sample of this product to review. The opinions expressed in this review are 100% my own. I LOVE this toothpaste! I have been using Crest Pro-Health toothpaste for years now, and it remains my favorite toothpaste. I have tried Colgate and the other competitors and have not liked them near as much. What I most is that Crest Pro-Health toothpaste makes my mouth actually feel clean! I would and have recommended this toothpaste long before I was given the product to test for free.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this toothpaste.  It left a clean and fresh taste in your mouth.  After brushing, I felt that I had cleaned my entire mouth and that my teeth had become whiter!  I feel that my teeth have lightened a shade since the completion of the entire bottle.  I would recommend this bottle to those who want a clan, fresh and whiter mouth!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste, just unsure about the whitening level of it compare to the other Crest Product. No aftertaste which is unique to this product. I use the mouthwash to go a long with it.</li>
            <li> My teeth never felt cleaner and my mouth healthier. I received a tube free from Smiley360 for review, and I&#x27;m glad I did. The minty flavor freshens, yet isn&#x27;t overpowering and the clean freshness is invigorating.</li>
            <li> I received a free product from smiley 360 for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. i don&#x27;t like the gritty texture but for the most part this product does what it says. I am a coffee drinker and a cigarette smoker and the difference in my teeth is amazing! no strong aftertaste or burning sensation.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday use. Could definately use more flavors. Other than it done the job.</li>

            <li> Experience a more healthy, beautiful smile with #CrestProHealth products.  I received a free product for the purpose of my review. I loved the way the toothpaste left my mouth clean and refreshed for the majority of the day.  As a smoker that is something I look for in toothpaste and mouthwash products.  Opinions are 100% my own but I suggest trying Crest ProHealth.</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.  I really liked this toothpaste and would buy again.  It made my mouth/teeth feel clean and fresh after using and it seemed to last longer than other toothpaste I have tried.  I like that it is a paste and not a gel.  The &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; is not overpowering and even my kids liked using it.</li>
            <li> I got to try the Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste for free from Smiley360, and these opinions are all my own and unbiased.  I love this toothpaste.  Its got a great minty flavor and really makes my teeth and whole mouth feel clean.  As for the whitening I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve really seen a difference yet but if I keep using it I hope it starts to be more noticeable, if not at least I have a clean mouth!</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro-Health Whitening Toothpaste from Smiley360 to sample and review.  The opinions here are one hundred percent my own. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and I enjoy using it very much. The fresh clean mint flavor is very smooth and not overpowering. My teeth feel very clean for hours along with keeping my breath fresh.  I have noticed a bit of  whitening on my teeth but nothing too dramatic.  The scrubbing particles help polish and whiten my teeth more so when compared to other whitening toothpastes  I I would recommend this toothpaste for overall effectiveness in all areas that you would expect from a toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I am a smiley360 member, and I received a free product for review. I was excited to try this out for myself and see if it was any good.

            <li> I was given this product 100% free by Smiley360, for the sole purpose of a written review after testing. I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for a while now and My Family Loves it,  it does have a gritty texture But it removes All The Stains and Dirt Leaving Your Teeth Shiny and Smooth (Kinda like an Exfoliation But for Your Teeth) It&#x27;s Minty But Not Over powering So My 10yr old daughter can use it Without It Being Overly Minty, She Calls it Being&amp;#34; TooHot&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m going to continue to Be A Loyal Customer</li>
            <li> I got a free sample from Smiley 360, to try the pro-health toothpaste. I like crest products and had been using Crest Complete. I found Pro-Health to be a little gritty and my mouth wasn&#x27;t as fresh as with the complete series. Even though my teeth did look better, they just didn&#x27;t seem as fresh. So what I started doing was using the pro health at night and my other in the morning! I also use Pro Health mouthwash and that with the toothpaste seemed to make my mouth fresher.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;This product REALLY DOES make a difference. After using the free toothpaste AND toothbrush, I had a VERY VISIBLE difference!!!</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review.  Opinions are 100% my own.  I think this product is ok.  I prefer the crest 3d whitening to this product.</li>
            <li> I tried Crest Pro Health toothpaste for the first time a week or so ago.  I have been using it daily since then.  It certainly leaves you mouth fresher and cleaner for a MUCH longer time than other toothpastes.  I am pick about my toothpastes.  I would recommend this whole-heartedly!</li>
            <li> I received this full size product for free from smiley360 for the purpose of my review. My opinions are 100 percent my own. I really like this product as it works as described. My teeth look whiter and feel cleaner. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I received a free trial of this toothpaste.  It has a great flavor and leaves teeth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a week and I have to say I&#x27;ve gotten great results. My teeth are very sensitive and I constantly experience discomfort with hot or cold food. My gums tend to become swollen due to it. I was using another toothpaste and it used to help somewhat. With this Crest toothpaste my sensitivity has diminished and my gums are less swollen and less red as well. I also love the fresh and clean feeling in my mouth after using it. I will continue to use it and see how it works in the long run. I received this toothpaste for free for testing purposes, but my review expresses the results I&#x27;ve personally experience after using it.</li>
            <li> You get the best clean mouth you can hope for while at the same time helping with teeth sensitivity. My 14 year old son said his mouth feels cleaner after using this for a week than it did after his last tooth cleaning at the dentist. I notice that my teeth weren&#x27;t as sensitive to cold after only the second use and it has whitened my teeth really well.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Crest Pro Health and it really left my mouth feeling fresh, clean and really good. After trying it I am seriously considering switching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste feels like the special cleaning toothpaste you use at the dentist office. It seems to really deep clean in between your teeth and leave you feeling so fresh. The flavor has a bit of an anise taste, but it is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This was a good toothpaste! It left your mouth refreshed, and feeling clean, long after you brushed! I would recommend to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> this crest pro health is fresh tasting.keeps breath fresh the mint is not stingy but you know it is there.good stuff.i got to try a free sample from smiley 360.</li>
            <li> I liked this product. It was a bit gritty but I did like the taste. My son also used it and loved it.I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE Crest Pro Health Whitening Fluoride Toothpaste.  The Fresh clean mint flavor is a definite boost in the morning.  Love waking up to this taste.  Definitely gets me going in the morning.  Can&#x27;t wait to talk to people and have them tell me how fresh my breath smells.  I love passing this product on to people whether they ask or not.  Always loved Crest products.  This is just one more item to add to my &amp;#34;LOVE&amp;#34; list.  Remember Oprah has a list of things she loves.  This is on mine.  &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;  My product came from Smiley 360  Survey.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toothpaste! It makes my teeth feel real clean, freshens my breath. I would definitely recommend it to all of my friends and family!</li>
            <li> I have nothing to say but good things about this toothpaste! It made my teeth squeaky clean and I did notice my teeth were whiter.  I usually have no preference on toothpaste and buy whatever&#x27;s on sale, but I&#x27;ll go out of my way for this toothpaste. It does have a bit of grit to it, but I actually felt that was key to making my teeth feel so clean. My husband liked it too. received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Although we have been using this toothpaste for a while, I did recieve a free full sized product to review from Smiley 360. After all this time, it is still my families favorite toothpaste! A pleasant taste, with a great texture. You can feel the exfoliating agent in the toothpaste, and it shows results quickly. We are coffee drinkers, and also enjoy red wine, but you wouldn&#x27;t know from our white teeth!</li>
            <li> I was able to test this product for free via Smiley360.  [[ASIN:B003CP12MA Crest Pro-Health Whitening Fresh Clean Mint Toothpaste 4.2 Oz (Pack of 6)]] I liked how within the toothpaste you could see the little whitening crystals.  I liked how after every use of brushing your entire mouth felt just so clean &amp; fresh.</li>
            <li> I am a Smiley360 member and received this product for free to review. I have been a huge fan of the Colgate Optic White since it came out and I thought I wouldn&#x27;t find another toothpaste I liked as much. Since I have received this, I have been using it and have been very happy with it. I do find that my Colgate may whiten my teeth a little more but this one makes my teeth feel so clean and my mouth so fresh I can almost overlook that! It really is a great toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I prefer and am used to a natural toothpaste so this was a &#x27;new&#x27; experience for me.  I felt i could taste the chemicals and it left my mouth sort of dried out feeling. The mint was mild and pleasing, texture was great and even had a little texture to it.  It did clean my teeth quite well and i honestly did notice my nice white teeth actually get whiter!  Someone who is used to chemical-based toothpaste would probably love this product, i however will stick with my natural brands!  I received this free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I received the toothpaste from Smiley360 for free to try it out. Opinions are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;As the Toothpaste arrived, i was very excited to try the new Crest Pro-Health. I brushed my teeth and noticed that it wasn&#x27;t overwhelmingly minty, as i don&#x27;t like that. After a week of use, i noticed improvement. As a former smoker, i had some staining and yellowing, plus i am wearing a dental flipper, which has a very light white color to it, so it stood out and differed from the other teeth. I must say i am very pleased. My other teeth have a lighter whiter to them now, and my dental flipper doesn&#x27;t stand out as much anymore! I am overall very happy with the outcome and love this toothpaste. I will buy this one from now on! Thanks for letting me try this !</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try this product for free.  Both my husband and myself are heavy coffee drinkers.  Over the years, our teeth show signs of discoloration.  We started using the product and loved it right away.  This toothpaste leaves your teeth clean and your breath minty fresh.  It does not have that unpleasant aftertaste you often get with whitening toothpastes.  It only took about a week of use before we were able to see a noticeable difference in the color of our teeth.  I will continue to use this toothpaste in the future.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Crest Pro-Health Whitening toothpaste and started using it right away.  It has the ideal combination of freshening your mouth and breath, and being good for your teeth.  It leaves my mouth and teeth feeling smooth and clean and fresh.  I love the minty flavor!  I also prefer the gel texture to other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is one of the first whitening toothpaste I could use for more than a day with my sensitive teeth.  I love the flavor and how clean it leaves my mouth feeling.  It really leaves it feeling clean for longer than I have ever had a toothpaste do.  I can&#x27;t say that I really have noticed any type of whitening in the past few weeks.  I really like how great my teeth and gums feel since I&#x27;ve been using this.  If you have sensitive teeth and would like to use a whitening product I would certainly recommend giving this stuff a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product 100% free by Smiley360, for the sole purpose of a written review after testing.</li>
            <li> I received a sample from #Smiley360 to try out.  This is my own opinion about this product. I really liked it and so did my kids. It cleaned really well; had a nice flavor and I loved the tube that it came in. I am so tired of the tooth paste tubes where the toothpaste hardens and get stuck in the tube. Crest Pro Zhealth had a easy dispenser.</li>
            <li> Just happened to have a Dentist appointment just a few days, before receiving my FREE sample, &amp; he suggested that I use this product ( and Mouth Wash) in order to alleviate , a few of my problems: Tartar buildup, Staining ( Smoker &amp; coffee drinker), &amp; Sensitivity.  I liked the taste and it made my mouth feel extremely clean, Both products tasted good. The wide top was welcome as well, (toothpaste), however upon opening within 3 days, it snapped off ( No big deal, but those things bother me, lol). I didn&#x27;t see a great deal of Whitening, however, I have only used the product for 2 weeks and as for the Tartar buildup, will have to wait until go back to Dentist in October.  The one thing that I Did not enjoy is that the toothpaste was gritty, I kept thinking about the Lil scrubbing bubbles, which is probably what it is supposed to do. I would purchase this product again, if the price was right, but it is no miracle cure. If my opinion changes after I finish the tube, I will repost further.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It made my mouth feel fresh and clean and my teeth were very smooth!  Would recommend to all. Crest is the best!</li>
            <li> I received a full size tube of the Crest Pro-Health Whitening for free from Smiley360. I loved the mint taste and noticed some whitening after just a week of use. Going to continue to use the whole tube. This toothpaste does help to whiten teeth and tastes great</li>
            <li> I received a free tube of Crest Pro Health whitening toothpaste to try.  I have used the toothpaste and like it.  It makes my mouth feel fresh and clean.  The little beads or whatever it is in the toothpaste helps to clean, I think.  I will buy this product in the future, maybe not always, but I do use Crest toothpaste a lot, so this will be another one to add to my list!  I was not paid to endorse this product, but I do think it is worth a try, if you never tried it before.</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m always looking for new products to help give me cleaner, whiter teeth, so I was very excited to try this toothpaste.  The first thing I noticed when using it was that it has a gritty texture, which I personal like.  I feel like I&#x27;m polishing my teeth and getting them really clean.  I also enjoyed the minty taste and I found this toothpaste leaves my teeth and mouth feeling clean and fresh.  Unfortunately, after using this for a while I haven&#x27;t found my teeth to be any whiter than before.  With that being said, I have yet to find any toothpaste that makes my teeth whiter even if they claim to do so.  Overall, I really did enjoy this toothpaste and would buy it in the future.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste!  It made my mouth feel amazingly clean and my teeth are healthy and white!  I would definately recommend this toothpaste and it will be the only toothpaste I purchase and use from now on.  I received a free product for the purpose of my review.  Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I was given a free sample of this toothpaste from Smiley360.com. My personal experience with it in my household was not very favorable as it did not make your mouth feel very clean. This may be due to the mild mint flavor that some people would really enjoy, but I prefer a stronger flavor. As far as how the toothpaste works overall, it would rank around mid level for me. My family members would not use it after a few tries.</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not like this toothpaste and after trying for a week returned to my Colgate Total.  I didn&#x27;t care for the little bursts of flavor while brushing and I did not get the refreshing, clean feeling that I do from Colgate</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste! Love the flavor. My dentist recommends me to use this all the time.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve had some time to really use this toothpaste, I can tell you that I love it!! Firstly, the fact that helps with sensitivity on top of the fact that it fights cavities, gingivitis, plaque, tartar &amp; whitening is just amazing - usually separate from everything else!  I like the way it makes my mouth/teeth feel so clean &amp; minty after brushing. Also, I had some dental work done and it hasn&#x27;t affected any of the work negatively at all and as a matter of fact has only benefited my mouth/teeth.  This by far is the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve used thus far! I would recommend it to everyone!!  I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I am a Smiley360 member and received this product for free to review. This synopsis of my opinion of the product is my own. I am a life long Crest Original fan. I have been fairly certain that no other product would make me as happy as that one. Then along came Crest ProHealth Whitening. I was glad it was a paste and not a gel (personal preference) and found it much thicker than the Original formula. It also had a pretty powerful minty flavor that left my mouth super fresh and lasted a long time. A little gritty, but I didn&#x27;t mind that. It reminded me of the stuff the dental hygienist uses when I get my teeth cleaned.</li>
            <li> I received this Crest Pro-Health free from Smiley360 a couple weeks ago. I was a Colgate user prior to trying this product. My entire family gives this 2 thumbs up. Leaves mouth feeling clean and refreshed. I will definitely be making the permanent switch to Crest Pro-Health.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothpaste I have ever used,it leaves my mouth and teeth clean and fresh. My teeth have become so much whiter and I didn&#x27;t even realize they were dingy looking until I started using Crest Pro Health.I smile more now because I want people to see my pearly whites.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Crest Pro Health toothpaste to try and write a review.  I do like the toothpaste in regards to the taste and its ability to clean my teeth and make them feel refreshed.  However, the toothpaste has small grandules of some sort in it and it feels like sand which I do not like.  If it did not have the grandules then the toothpaste would be perfect.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this. It had a great taste and did a good job with whitening.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with my free Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste that I received for the purpose of this review. I&#x27;ve used Crest Pro-Health toothpaste for about 3 weeks and my teeth are whiter and my breathe is mintier.  I was having problems with my gums and now after using the toothpaste I have healthier gums.  I gave this product 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This is a good toothpaste! I really like the taste which is an important factor when choosing a toothpaste and it makes my mouth feel fresh and clean. This is a toothpaste everyone in my family likes to use! It&#x27;s also affordable so it&#x27;s great when you&#x27;re on a budget. I would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I am a member of Smiley360 &amp;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I just love this toothpaste! It dissolves easily in my mouth instead of staying in a clump in my mouth or on my toothbrush. It helps with my sensitive teeth as good as a sensitive teeth toothpaste. It has made my teeth look a lot brighter &amp; whiter. I highly recommend Crest Pro Health Whitening Toothpaste!!</li>
            <li> I recieved this product from smiley 360 and I love it. Product is great tasting and excellent whitening. I soon bought another tube for my hosuehold.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this toothpaste to give my opinion through Smiley 360.  I found the taste to be gritty but tolerable.  I also have to admit that I prefer gel over paste though.  It did whiten my teeth better than others I have tried.  I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34; I recently received a free Crest pro health product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34; My teeth feel really clean after using this product. I would recommend it to anyone wanting a fresh clean mouth.</li>
            <li> I received a full tube of this for free via smiley360, my opinions are my own. Was pleasantly surprised by the very fresh taste a great way to wake up your mouth in the morning. Did not notice much of a difference in the whiteness of my teeth though and I brush three times a day. I have about 1/8 of the tube left, so I thought I would see results by now. I am not a coffee drinker at all. The toothpaste left a little bit of grittiness behind that I didn&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li> I received a free full size sample of this product to review. The opinions expressed in this review are 100% my own. Tastes better than Sensodyne but the grittiness takes a little bit to get used to. I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for over two weeks now and have noticed it helps my sensitivity in the same way that Sensodyne does, but it definitely tastes better. My husband stole some and he said it cleans well but he doesn&#x27;t like the taste. I guess that&#x27;s a matter of preference. You definitely need the classic &amp;#34;pea-sized&amp;#34; portion to get the best use out of it - otherwise, it&#x27;s too much toothpaste and the experience is not so great.</li>
            <li> I received a free tube of Crest pro health whitening fluoride toothpaste from Smiley360 and overall I thought that it was an ok toothpaste. I do not like the after taste&lt;br /&gt;I does however, leaves your breath fresh-according to husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a recommended toothpaste - just a quick fix&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best whitening toothpaste I have ever tried! I noticed a difference within a week of using this toothpaste! I have tried many other so-called whitening products before, but this one really is worth the extra cost. I am a regular coffee drinker, and this toothpaste works wonders! I am happy to show off my smile! :) I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Minty fresh breath!!&lt;br /&gt;I received the Crest Pro Health Whitening Toothpaste as part of a Smiley 360 mission. I have used the toothpaste for a total of 10 days and I&#x27;m quite pleased with the results. I have sensitive teeth and this toothpaste did not cause me any irritation at all. My teeth also felt very clean and I experienced minty fresh breath. The only reason that I did not give this product five stars is simply because of the taste, but that&#x27;s a matter of personal preference. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I received the crest pro health as a free sample for smile360 and 100%of my opinions are my own... I absolutely love this toothpaste and will keep using it. The taste is great and smooth and it leaves my mouth feeling perfect.. I have an all day crest feeling in my even after eating....</li>
            <li> I am a Smiley360 member and received this product for free to review. This synopsis of my opinion of the product is 100% my own. I am an older person who has very sensitive teeth. I am also an avid coffee and tea drinker,so you can imagine just how stained my teeth are. I loved the taste of this toothpaste and the way it has brightened my smile without damaging it. It left my mouth feeling very fresh and I know because it a crest product my teeth will be protected from cavities.</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I didn&#x27;t like the grittiness of the gel, felt like I was brushing with sand. I also felt like it left my mouth so dry after use. I didn&#x27;t see much whitening difference but I have white teeth anyway. The flavor is typical so I didn&#x27;t mind that. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product personally.</li>
            <li> I received this toothpaste from Smiley 360 for free to try and I really like it! My mouth feels cleaner and the feeling lasts for a long time. I love the way Crest Pro Health toothpaste made my mouth feel. I&#x27;m not sure that my teeth are any whiter, but they sure feel cleaner and that&#x27;s all I can ask for at this point. I can&#x27;t wait to go for my next dental check-up to see if there is less plaque build-up. It sure feels like there is a difference. Guess time will tell!</li>
            <li> The taste of this was very pleasant and it felt like my teeth were getting clean. The shape of the tube and cap were very convenient as I like to set my toothpaste tube upside down on the cap. The cap began not to close correctly after a few uses but it wasn&#x27;t a big deal to me. The immediate aftertaste was enjoyable but after a few minutes, I felt like I had residue in my mouth and had a chalky feeling. I would purchase it in the future but it wouldn&#x27;t be my first choice. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this toothpaste!  It will be my toothpaste of choice from now on.  I noticed the my teeth were whiter only after using for a few days.  I will definitely recommend to my family and friends.  I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34; I received the crest pro-health toothpaste to try and review form Smiley and could not have been happier with the opportunity. The product was awesome, left my teeth feeling super- clean and my whole mouth refreshed. I have only been using for about 10 days but already notice that my teeth look whiter and feel better. Would recommend!!!https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/21U8%2BalXa4L._SS300_.jpg</li>
            <li> I rec&#x27;d a sample of this toothpaste free from Smiley 360. It is a great toothpaste that really cleans and whitens your teeth. It leaves your teeth feeling clean all day long.  I highly recommend it .</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro-Health Whitening Toothpaste from Smiley360 to sample and review,opinions are 100% my own.  I have been using Crest Pro-Health Whitening toothpaste for about a month now, and I have really enjoyed it.  It leaves my mouth feeling fresh, and I feel like my teeth look whiter.  It has a nice minty flavor that isn&#x27;t too overpowering. Perhaps my favorite part though is the stand up cap, it takes up less space on my already crowded bathroom counter.  If I have one complaint it is that it is a bit gritty. Overall, I think it is a great toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toothpaste, my teeth feel so clean and so much whiter. There isn&#x27;t a bad aftertaste like other toothpaste that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have tried many toothpastes, but I&#x27;ve found that this has been some of the best I&#x27;ve used. It has become a staple in our bathroom for a while now. If you&#x27;re looking for a change of product look no further. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34; I really liked the the Crest Pro-Health toothpaste. It left my mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health toothpaste is my family&#x27;s favorite brand - we like it because it has everything to meet each person&#x27;s unique dental care needs. It has the cavity and gingivitis prevention that&#x27;s critical for my kids, but also works great on my sensitive teeth. I do prefer the Clean Cinnamon non-whitening variety personally, though, as it&#x27;s a little gentler. (I think maybe I&#x27;m sensitive to the whitening ingredients, perhaps?) This is a product that we&#x27;ve been using for years, and none of my kids (four boys) have ever had a cavity.</li>
            <li> Toothpaste was pretty good. I didn&#x27;t so much like the texture. BUT, I would purchase the toothpaste in the future because it actually did a wonderful job on cleaning my teeth. Guess, the texture part I can work with :) Received this toothpaste for free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> This is great, love the way it makes my teeth feel clean and refreshing!</li>
            <li> I just got my tube, and was pleased with the design of the package.  It is easy open for the kids, and the paste itself is sparkly.  It makes your mouth tingle as you use it, so you know which areas you need to get better.  Best of all I had just eaten blueberries, and the toothpaste completely got rid of remaining color, and left my teeth looking as good as a dentist cleaning.  Rather than a lingering mint taste, there is just a clean feeling...and a bit of remaining tingle in my tongue around my piercing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, for first use I would say this is one of the best products I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I received this as a free sample and I love the taste and the fresh, clean feeling. I think this toothpaste is definitely worth the money. It gets the job done! I also have sensitive teeth and this does not affect them so that it is a big plus.</li>
            <li> Works great! Made my teeth feel very clean and fresh :)</li>
            <li> i received a free tube from smiley360 to use and review.  love how clean this toothpaste makes my mouth feel.</li>
            <li> great product!  really  makes your mouth feel clean and your teeth bright</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Crest Pro-Health Whitening Gel Toothpaste from Smiley360 for the purpose of review.  My opinions are my own.  I am very happy with this product.  I am thrilled that it is in gel form and has a fresh minty taste.  I noticed a difference in the whiteness of my teeth within a week.  My teeth and mouth feel clean and fresh.  I would recommend this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of this toothpaste. I received a tube of this toothpaste for free to try it and review it.  I feel that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long while brushing with it, it gets too watery instead of staying paste-like. The taste was way too strong, almost burns my tongue.</li>
            <li> I received a tube of Crest ProHealth Toothpaste from Smiley360. Crest ProHealth Toothpaste made my teeth and mouth feel much cleaner than my old paste. My breath was amazing and gave me some added confidence. I can&#x27;t get over how long my teeth feel clean!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Crest Pro-Health toothpaste from Smiley360.  These opinions are 100% my own.  The toothpaste has a great, refreshing flavor and I like that it is a whitening product. I will definitely consider purchasing this product!</li>
            <li> I received crest pro health as a free sample to try. and I love it. it get&#x27;s my teeth so clean and my breath so fresh. and definitely tell it is whitening my teeth. and teeth sensitivity gone!</li>
            <li> I was sent this toothpaste, for free, to try, and I have to say...I wanted to like this, but I had a pretty bad reaction to it.  It gave my mouth a chemical burn, leaving me with terrible blisters.  They developed a couple of days after using this toothpaste, and cleared up within a week of my stopping usage.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure this is not common, and I love everything else Crest does, so I&#x27;m sure this is a rare occurrence!  Thank you for letting me try this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste tastes minty but is not too overpowering.  It has a mint flavor and an aftertaste of baking soda but without your mouth feeling too gritty or chalky.  I think the taste is nice and pleasant.  Crest is a brand we have trusted for dental care for years.  I like that this toothpaste helps whiten your teeth while still providing the type of quality dental care that we have come to expect from a brand like Crest.  Oral health is very important and I see Crest Pro Health trying to help us take care of our teeth!  I recieved  Crest Pro Health through Smiley 360 for free for the purpose of my review but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste. it leaves my mouth fresh and very clean. great flavor and seems to be making my teeth somewhat whiter.</li>
            <li> I got this product free of purchase to review and rate it.  It was awesome :) and this is totally my opinion but the tooth paste didn&#x27;t taste to over barring for a whitening tooth paste like most others do.  My breath felt clean and fresh and my teeth are looking white.</li>
            <li> Great tasting!  My mouth tasted fresh and totally clean!  Also it whitens my teeth. I would definitely recommend it for a great smile.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample from Smiley360.  I have sensitive teeth, I drink a lot of coffee and I also grind my teeth....so I usually stick with another brand of toothpaste to help alleviate the pain from sensitivity.  I was skeptical of this toothpaste at first as I thought its whitening agent may irritate my gums and teeth but not only does it contain ingredients to help with sensitive teeth it also whitens, pain free.  It is not chalky and it has a nice flavor.  My teeth are noticeably whiter after 1 week of use 2x day.</li>
            <li> I received the Crest Pro-Health toothpaste to sample and review from Smiley360. This opinion is 100% mine. It&#x27;s only been a week, but I can already start to tell a difference in my smile.  I&#x27;m prone to tooth sensitivity and Crest Pro-Health seems to provide some relief. I&#x27;ve tried many toothpastes over the years and I feel like this one is far the best. My mouth feels clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> I was surprise by how fast my teeth started to turn white, I love this product.. will buy more crest products</li>
            <li> I received this  product for free to review. My review is my own opinion. This is a great toothpaste. It makes your whole mouth feel clean.</li>
            <li> Great taste and my teeth feel so clean afterwards!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is the best ever! I received this toothpaste in the mail from Smiley360 so I can try and review this toothpaste. It really helps my teeth stay nice and clean and mouth feel refreshing. I recently had gum surgery due to receding gums and was told to use an electric toothbrush. this toothpaste really helps with the toothbrush as well. I highly recommend this toothpaste to others!</li>
            <li> I did the Smiley 360 mission to receive this product free to try it out and this is 100% my own opinion. I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past few weeks. This products works great! I love the fresh mint taste and my teeth seem to be a tad bit whiter. I would definitely buy this product.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Crest Pro-Health Whitening Toothpaste for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. The taste is a refreshing cool mint. It is nice and foamy which I like. My teeth are clean after brushing. I don&#x27;t see any whitening effects at this time, but it has only been 8 days. This is a paste and I prefer gel, most paste make me gag but this paste did not.  I give it four stars because I don&#x27;t see any whitening effects at this time.</li>
            <li> I received a free full size sample of this product to review. The opinions expressed in this review are 100% my own. After using Crest-Pro health toothpaste for two weeks, my teeth definitely feel much cleaner and more polished. It leaves my breath fresh and clean feeling for hours after using it. However, I don&#x27;t prefer the taste over other brands. The taste is somewhat strong and a bit too minty for me (even if not a lot of tooth paste is used). I prefer a spearmint type taste over the taste of this toothpaste. My fiancé is also using the toothpaste and he has commented that his teeth also feel more polished after using it. He prefers the taste of this toothpaste over other brands. So as for taste, it&#x27;s all a matter of preference. As for sensitivity protection, I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference between this and Sensodyne, so I suppose it&#x27;s pretty good. I also use Crest Classic Whitestrips, so my teeth are already very white. The toothpaste seems to maintain the whiteness of my teeth really well. I have a dentist appointment in less than a week for a 6 month cleaning...we&#x27;ll see what the dental hygienist has to say about my teeth then!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Smiley360 and the opportunity to try #Crest pro health toothpaste.  The flavor is so fresh and clean not overpowering and you can feel the toothpaste working on your teeth and my idea of an easy way to whiten naturally well this is a good start.</li>
            <li> Experience a more healthy, beautiful smile with #CrestProHealth products.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I tried the Crest Pro Health Whitening toothpaste. It does clean your teeth better than other brands of whitening Toothpaste. It does not have the burning taste that most of them have. It is better tasting than other whitening toothpaste. The only negative side of this toothpaste is that it does not foam up like most Toothpaste brands do. It&#x27;s like I have to add more during my brushing. That is the only reason I gave it a 4 star rating. Other than that, I am completely satisfied with this toothpaste and would recommend it to anyone that wants a whitening toothpaste that actually works.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m a member of Smiley360.com, where I qualify to try brands for free in exchange for sharing my authentic feedback.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of the crest pro health whitening from smiley360. I love it. I can see the difference in my teeth they look a lot whiter. Breath smells fresh..I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I recently received crest as a free sample from smiley 360.  I was surprised by the pleasant taste.  It made my family&#x27;s mouths tingle.  It has cleaning, whitening and sensitivity.  We all loved this product.  I found this reasonably priced and have already picked some up.  All our parents have found this a great product.  I would definitely recommend this.  We are pretty picky as a family and for us to find a product we all like is reassuring.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I received a free tube of Crest Pro Health Whitening paste recently from Smiley 360. The taste is just &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;. I like a stronger mint flavor that leaves me feeling fresh and clean. This toothpaste does not do that. As far as whitening, I do not drink coffee, tea or wine and I have fairly white teeth to begin with. I have not noticed a difference in color.</li>
            <li> First, know that I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. Overall, I like Crest Pro-Health Whitening. Initially, the taste is good and it foams up well. I don&#x27;t think that the mint freshens breath for a long period  of time. Also, I&#x27;d like for the clean feeling would last longer, however, I have noticed my teeth look whiter and brighter since I&#x27;ve used Crest Pro-Health Whitening. I&#x27;d recommend Crest Pro-Health.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical after writing off Crest Complete recently.  When I received the toothpaste I was beyond surprised with the outcome.  The aftertaste was fresh and minty.  While brushing the \\&quot;grit\\&quot; reminded me of a step up from the 6-month cleanings we get when we go to the dentist.  You can feel that you are truly cleaning your teeth every time you brush with Crest Pro Health Whitening.  I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own!</li>
            <li> I received crest pro health whitening fluoride  toothpaste from Smiley360. I really love the taste, minty like just swishing with mouth wash. I really will be buying more of it after a couple of days I could see the difference in my teeth. They starting to get whiter and whiter. After two weeks people started asking me if I had my teeth bleached(LOVED IT)! There is no doubt that it really works. You with feel like you came from a cleaning from the dentist every time you brush your teeth. I would recommend this to friends and family, Go buy some its that good!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I loved the way this product left my teeth feeling clean and fresh.  I will continue to use this product.  I also enjoyed the fresh taste of this product. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Good taste as well as a good value</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the product. It did not leave a after taste or too much of a minty feel.  my teeth looked great even after just a few days.love the taste and smile look great.</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums feel healthier since I began using my Crest Pro-Health toothpaste. My teeth look whiter too.</li>
            <li> I also received Crest ProHealth toothpaste free  and this opinion is mine. I liked this toothpaste, I typically don&#x27;t use a lot of toothpaste on my brush so that is how I used this product as well. I felt it left my mouth very clean and fresh, I also used the mouth rinse made by Crest pro health which I purchased myself.</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I use the Crest Pro Health toothpastes fairly regularly and this one was the same quality product that I am used to getting from Crest.  It has a fresh minty flavor and leaves my mouth feeling clean.  It&#x27;s hard to gauge how much whitening happened because of my use of this product so I docked it a star for that.  I plan on using this product in the future!</li>
            <li> My 10 year old, who hates to brush his teeth, loves this toothpaste!  His favorite element is the grit.  He says that this causes his mouth to feel super clean.  He also loves the fresh clean taste.  I never have to ask him twice to brush his teeth.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;  I received this as a trial and have enjoyed it.  I have sensitive teeth and it seems to work well.  I really like the clean taste it has.  I plan to continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I received the Crest Pro Health free from Smiley 360 my opinion is 100% my own.  I love this product, it did not have a strong after taste.  My kids who are always complaining about toothpaste are using it without complaining (miracle).  I love the taste and the fresh clean feeling after you brush your teeth.  It has helped to improve the color of my teeth and I have already started purchasing to add to my toothpaste stockpile.  As always an excellent product from Crest.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste. I usually use baking soda toothpaste but, I love the after mint of refreshment after brushing. My teeth feel clean.. I&#x27;m so glad I got chosen to try Crest Pro Health. Thank you Smiley 360!</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. This stuff is great and it did lighten my teeth in like 4 days. I will buy it again. I am so buying this from now on. The cap does not break off.</li>
            <li> Great taste. Makes a difference in the appearance of your teeth.</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own, but I have to say that I was extremely happy with this toothpaste.  The mint flavor was not overwhelming and left my mouth feeling super clean for an extended amount of time.</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I received this from smiley 360 to review. The opinions here are mine and mine alone. This toothpaste blows every other toothpaste I&#x27;ve used out of the water. My mouth has never felt cleaner, my breath has never been fresher.  I love how it thoroughly scrubs my teeth. It feels amazing! It is, by far, my favorite toothpaste ever!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34; I received a full size tube from Smiley 360. I was a little skeptical when I first tried this, but once I tasted it, I was ok. It has a &#x27;good tingle&#x27; to your mouth and immediately knew the ingredients were working. Your mouth feels very refreshed during and after brushing. I was hoping my teeth would get brightened using the product. However, I cannot see a difference. I am a little disappointed in that aspect, but otherwise, I am sold on the way it gets my teeth and gums cleaned and refreshed. I do recommend this and will continue to use it to see if there will be a delayed change in the whitening of my teeth. I truly like it.</li>
            <li> The crest pro health toothpaste is a very good toothpaste. It leaves my mouth minty fresh and does as the product advertises. It is definately worth the pricing. I would continue buying this.</li>
            <li> Fluoride and No Tea Tree Oil - So HOW is this different?    I am a Smiley360 member and received this product for free to review.     This opinion is my own.  For many years I used Crest.    Then I started using Melaleuca cinammon toothpaste (I do NOT sell Melaleuca products), with Tea Tree oil and NO FLUORIDE, and my dentist kept telling me, twice a year when he cleaned my teeth, that there was almost no work for him.  Unfortunately, that was years ago and the new version is not as good.    Crest ProHealth Whitening is an ok commercial toothpaste.  Period.  Good flavor, nice taste in my mouth, but I do NOT need or want fluoride (haven&#x27;t had a cavity in over 20 years) and although I do see whitening, I don&#x27;t feel putting fluoride in my system is worth it.    Sorry, Smiley 360 and Crest -</li>
            <li> I am a smiley360 member and received a free tube of this toothpaste to try.  It made my teeth brighter. I like the look of them. I did not like the gritty feeling of the toothpaste at first but I did get used to it.</li>
            <li> This product is superior to all others I have tried and would highly recommend this product! And I received this free from smiley 360 for this review!</li>
            <li> I have never had a toothpaste that makes my mouth feel this way, such a refreshing felling. Fells like a bubbles in your mouth and no after taste, plus it is a whitener. If you want to feel great after brushing your teeth then give it a try, i know you will just love it.</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I tried Crest Pro Health Whitening with fluoride about 2 weeks after i received my free 4.2 oz size product. I like the snap top and even after use after use, I was still able to snap it closed. The toothpaste has a nice smell to it. It is a bit stronger of a smell than I am use to. I think the fact that it a strong smell, allows for your fresh breath to last longer, so i really liked that! In regards to the whitening action, i do not feel that it did much to improve the shades of my teeth. But I do feel that It did a great job of removing the plague better than other brands i have tried. Overall, i would recommend the toothpaste to other users.</li>
            <li> It is a great toothpaste. I have used it over the years with good check ups and a healthier  mouth. It is not gritty, mild taste that is good and leaves my mouth fresh &amp; happy</li>
            <li> I was using crest sensitive shield when I was asked to review crest prohealth whitening.  I figured it would be almost the same formula, but I agreed to receive a tube to try and review.  I thought I noticed a whiter smile after the first use, but I thought that was a little too good to be true.  I normally use bleaching trays from my dentist when my teeth look stained, so I don&#x27;t expect a toothpaste to keep them white.  I drink coffee every morning.  Thus formula was effective at polishing that coffee stain off so I didn&#x27;t need to bleach.  Makes me want to switch from the paste I was using!  I did receive a tube of this toothpaste for free to evaluate, but I have tried to offer an objective evaluation ;)</li>
            <li> I really like Crest pro health toothpaste. It combines all of the good things in all of the crest toothpastes in one. The flavor and texture are good. I also like the packaging, I can stand the tube up instead of laying it down.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;  This toothpaste really surpised me.  It works better then i thought and i love how it doesnt leave a strong after minty taste.  I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I enjoy Crest products and liked this toothpaste.  I often see it on sale at major retailers and there are always coupons available.  The texture made me feel like it was gentle enough on the enamel of your teeth but also powerful to clean away stains and plaque off of your teeth.  I also enjoyed the flavor but it had the right amount of minty flavor.  It wasn&#x27;t too strong but left my mouth with a minty flavor.  I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I received this from Smiley360 to try for free. I have been using colgate white for a couple years and probably never would have tried this if not offered to test it out.&lt;br /&gt;The first day I used it I honestly didnt read the directions...most toothpastes say use a pea size. This one says about an inch, so I didnt like my first experience because of the amount I used. It didnt foam up as much as other toothpastes and made my teeth feel weird.&lt;br /&gt;I felt like my teeth weren&#x27;t getting cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for 1 week now and following the instructions, it lathers better with the right amount. The taste is still very mild, I wish there was more minty-ness. However, I have noticed a great deal of improvement. I have VERY sensitive gums and use an electric toothbrush that more times out of not makes them sore or even bleed a little. My front teeth also hurt a bit from time to time when I drink sodas or have sweet things, I have noticed an improvement on that as well. Out of this whole week I have not had either of those problems at all! I didnt change any of my habits except for using this paste. I dont feel it has whitened my teeth any within the week, but i really didnt expect to see that by using just one tube of this stuff. Even though I received this for free all of my opinions are 100 percent my own!</li>
            <li> I am a member of smiley 360 and got to review the product for free this made my teeth feel clean and healthier I plan on buying this in the future</li>
            <li> I really liked the way this toothpaste felt from the moment I tried it. It felt exfoliation for my teeth. Although I can not say for sure, I felt like after using this toothpaste for a short period of time my gums felt and looked (to me) healthier, this fact I plan on confirming with my dentist on my next visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Crest Pro-Health Whitening Toothpaste from Smiley360 and loved it. It works ery good and makes my teeth feel very clean and look whiter.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste!  My teeth feel very clean and appear to be whiter after using it for 14 days!</li>
            <li> I was able to try Crest Pro-Health Whitening Gel Toothpaste. At first I wasnt sure about it cause of the grit feeling. But soon i realize the grit was a good thing it was cleaning working away grim on my teeth. It  is really good and works well, it helps whitening the teeth and removes the stains for me I also have sensitive teeth so this product was great for it. Over all its great! \\&quot;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I love the way this toothpaste makes my teeth feel and look.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample from Smiley360 for my opinion. Opinions are 100% my own. I loved this product. My mouth felt so clean afterwards. This would be the toothpaste I would use, but I need something for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I was on a mission for Smiley360 and that I got a free full-size product of Crest Pro-Health whitening.  The toothpaste really gave my mouth a good washing.  I could feel the deep cleaning the very first time I used it, and this clean feeling continued throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Crest Pro-Health Clinical for Gum Health very much helped my husband with his gingivitis and accompanying bad breath.  The difference is night and day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both my husband and I agree that Crest Pro-Health Gum Health Clinical and the one I got Crest Pro-Heath whitening was really helping our teeth.</li>
            <li> Great product! Gives me a refreshed and clean mouth every time. I drink tea and coffee every day and my smile at its best.</li>
            <li> Tasty, cool, tingly, and oh so refreshing. I love this toothpaste. It was like having daily microdermabrasion for my teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.However; my opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was chosen by smiley360 to participate in this mission and am sharing my own opinion about Crest Pro-Health Whitening gel toothpaste.  I have always used Colgate, but I think I will be a permanent Crest Pro-Health user from now on. It really whitened my teeth visibly within 4 days of using it. I really like how fresh my breath is and how long my mouth and teeth feel clean, even hours after brushing. I highly recommend this product.  It does what it says it will!</li>
            <li> I received a free tube of Crest pro health whitening fluoride toothpaste recently and I liked the&lt;br /&gt;taste, but not the gritty particles. I feel like I may be doing my teeth more harm than good.&lt;br /&gt;Really leaves your breath fresh though. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this toothpaste for prolonged use.</li>
            <li> The whole family uses it &amp; loves it!!</li>
            <li> I love the new Crest Pro Health Whitening Fluoride toothpaste. It does it all in one awesome toothpaste...complete mouth care.  Plus it makes your teeth feel awesome.  I am also already noticing my teeth becoming whiter after just one week as well as less sensitivity!  But what else is almost as awesome as this toothpaste is that I received it for free from Smiley 360 however all of what I am telling you is true and of my own free will...</li>
            <li> I went on a mission for Smiley360 and received this Crest free to try out.  The toothpaste is a nice minty gel so there is no gritty taste as you brush your teeth.  The mint flavor leaves my mouth feeling clean and refreshed after brushing.  It last for about an half hour if I eat something or drink something.  It has made my teeth whiter than they where.  I am very pleased with this product and thanks to Smiley360 I got to complete the mission.</li>
            <li> I received a free tube of Crest pro health from smiley 360. It is an awesome product. Makes your teeth feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> When I received a sample of Crest Pro-Health toothpaste from Smiley360, I was skeptical. I ended up pleasantly surprised! It had a better taste than I was used to and DID whiten my teeth a couple of shades.  It really helps considering my teeth are really stained up! The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it was a little gritty. I was able to look past that since I had no sensitivity while brushing like I normally do. Overall, I would highly recommend this toothpaste to anyone!</li>
            <li> I love having great feeling teeth and crest pro health toothpaste does this over and over.</li>
            <li> I tried Crest pro health whiitening toothpaste . It works great cleaning teeth and makes your teeth whiter.</li>
            <li> I received this toothpaste for free for the purpose of reviewing it.  This is 100% my true opinion.  I LOVE this toothpaste.  My teeth feel like I just got back from the dentist.  The taste is great, even my kids like it.  I will be buying this kind for my family from now on.  thank you!!</li>
            <li> I am a member of Smiley360 thus received this product free of charge, and am writing this review based on my own opinion.  Honestly I wasn&#x27;t sure when I first started trying it, because it was something completely different than anything I have ever tried in the past.  That has turned out to be a GREAT thing ... sometimes change is needed, and that is the case here.  My teeth and entire mouth feel cleaner.  I am in my mid 40s, so I am concerned about my teeth in general.  I believe my overall mouth is healthier and cleaner, less &amp;#34;germier&amp;#34;.  I really like the smaller size of tube also, perfect for travel, when going for a camping trip or week long trip.  I look forward to using this product every day, thank you!  Jennifer F.</li>
            <li> This tooth paste works great tastes great and is great!</li>
            <li> I am a member of Smiley 360 and received this product for free to try and review.  All opinions are 100% mine. I have been a huge fan of Crest for years. It is my go to toothpaste.  I love Crest Pro Health Whitening Toothpaste.  The minty flavor leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh. I am not sure yet if my teeth are getting whiter.  It is hard to tell from day to day.</li>
            <li> I am and always have been a Crest user..but i was given the chance to try and review Crest Pro health. I used Crest pro for ten days and I love it. I love the way it made my teeth feel and the taste was bold and great. I have a serious problem with other tooth paste that burn and irritate my mouth, but Crest pro didn&#x27;t do that. I see where some are writing about a gritty feeling...I didn&#x27;t have that problem because i always brush my teeth in luke warm water and always follow the instruction on the amount to use. I am very pleased and happy with my results from using Crest Pro Health Tooth Paste and will continue to use it and the rest of the matching products. I received a sample for free for the purpose of my review, My opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I received this toothpaste from Smiley 360. I really like Crest Pro Health. I noticed within a week my teeth looked whiter. I am Love the taste ans I would recommend this to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I tried this product when I received it for free in a test trial. I am very happy with the results. I&#x27;m always hoping that my tooth paste will keep my breath fresh and clean for a long period of time. Crest Pro health does this. My teeth feel cleaner and are less sensitive to cold and hot beverages. I also noticed a slight whitening effect after having used it for a few weeks.    \\&quot;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> My family has been using Crest Pro-Health for years. This is the only toothpaste that I have found that my whole family can agree on and I feel that provides the fluoride protection that we all need. I love the fact that there are many types of flavors and different protections. We have used the whitening fluoride and the gum protection in our home. They both taste and feel great. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro-health for testing purposes. I found this to be pretty tasty for a whitening toothpaste. It did not have a strong baking soda taste that you tend to find with whitening toothpastes and it was not gritty. The only downside was the it had a loose texture. It was soupy on the toothbrush. I would definitely purchase this in the future.</li>
            <li> Trying this toothpaste was a little different for me but I soon realized that I liked it.  This is an effective whitening toothpaste and I really have noticed a difference in how white my teeth look.  I would recommend this to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> THIS TOOTHPASTE REALLY GOT MY TEETH SQUEAKY CLEAN. MY WHOLE MOUTH FELT FRESH AND CLEAN FOR HOURS AFTER BRUSHING. I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FREE TO REVIEW AND THE OPINIONS ARE 100% MY OWN.</li>
            <li> Flavor of toothpaste was great and made my teeth feel very clean. I would use this product again and use as part of my daily brushing routines.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It works awesome.</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro-Health Whitening Toothpaste for free from Smiley360 to test. The opinions here are my own. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks and I like it very much. The taste (fresh clean mint flavor) is very nice and my teeth feel wonderfully clean for hours.  I&#x27;ve started to notice a slight whitening, hopefully that will continue. I would recommend this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste, doesn&#x27;t have a very minty flavor although I have noticed my teeth became whiter.</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I absolutely loved this toothpaste. My mouth and teeth feel clean for a long time after brushing. Very good flavor and smell.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample, but these are my own personal opinions. I love this toothpaste. It tastes great and really gets my teeth clean. Leaves my whole mouth feeling fresh and clean. Crest always has high quality products and this definitely fits right in with the rest of them.</li>
            <li> I received a free full size sample of this product to review, all opinions are honest and my own. I have grown up on Crest toothpaste and have always loved their products. I received the  Crest-Pro health toothpaste to review and can tell you that after using it for about 2 weeks my teeth feel much cleaner. I can even notice a difference from my generic Crest toothpaste I was using to the Pro-Health. I love how strong the minty flavor is - strong a long lasting that is! It leaves my mouth feeling clean and minty fresh for hours after use. The gritty parcels take a little getting used too...but as soon as you realize how awesome they effectively clean your mouth you will learn to love them!</li>
            <li> I received a free Crest Pro White toothpaste from Smiley 360. The opinions I express are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt; I have been using Crest toothpastes for a number of years. I never tried the Pro White one until I got&lt;br /&gt;the free sample.I liked it very much, I like the minty flavor and I like the gritty texture because  I think&lt;br /&gt; it helps clean my teeth better.I was also surprised at how well it worked since I have sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt; I recommened it to my friend who was leary of using a whitening product on her sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I am loving Crest Pro-Health toothpaste. It is such a complete toothpaste for me as I need something that works on coffee and soda stains as well as effective for the sensitivity of my teeth. This toothpaste does both of those things as well as protect my teeth and gums and leaves my breath minty fresh. It really does leave your teeth feeling clean and tingly. Definitely a hit with me. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Received this product for free and am overall happy with it.  It left my teeth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I got to try it for free from Smiley360 and I love the taste and texture.  It is a little gritty to me but overall I like it.</li>
            <li> I began using Crest Pro Health a couple of weeks ago, and I have already got a brighter smile. This is an amazing product, and I highly recommend it.  This product is inspired by dentists and leaves your mouth and breath very fresh.  The taste is very refreshing as well, and it kept my breath fresh for several hours. I like the way there is some little gritty like substance in the toothpaste that work extra hard to clean my teeth.  I received a free product for the purpose of my review.

            <li> I love this product! I have a whiter smile and it helps maintain the rest. It has everything you need in toothpaste and more. I received a full tube from smiley360</li>
            <li> Received this product free from Smiley for my review.  And I guess your thinking since I got it free that i would give them a awesome review.But to be honesty this is a great product.  Clean and fresh tasting, no bitter afterward, no chalky taste. Would keep it in our bathroom.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to try Crest Pro-Health Whitening toothpaste for free.  We had been using Colgate toothpaste exclusively for the past year and had been happy with price and quality.  The first thing I noticed with the Crest Pro-Health Whitening toothpaste was the taste, it made me want more. I&#x27;ve been very happy with the Crest Pro Health toothpaste and think Crest is a high quality brand.  I can&#x27;t say that I would exclusively switch to the Crest Pro Health but for the right price you can&#x27;t go wrong with this toothpaste. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample from Smiley 360. I love this product. I like the way my teeth feel after brushing. I also like the &amp;#34;bubbles&amp;#34; you feel as you brush. Taste is great. And your breath smells fantastic. This is a fantastic toothpaste and one that I will buy going forward.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste..its excellent on whitening and sensitivity.I have very sensitive teeth and I had no pain while brushing or for the rest of the day while using this product. It got my teeth really clean and didn&#x27;t leave a film. It was was even good on tarter build-up. The only thing that did not impress me was the flavor. It was a little too sweet for me. I prefer a more natural mint flavor. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.  I love the strong flavor and how squeaky clean my mouth feels after brushing my teeth with this toothpaste.</li>
