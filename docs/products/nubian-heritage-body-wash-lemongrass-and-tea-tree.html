            <li>Nubian Heritage Body Wash is a great product.</li>
            <li>So the product is great but the packaging needs some work.</li>
            <li>Good smelling soap.</li>
            <li>The bottle is a good size too.</li>
            <li>Body wash cleans nice and this brand is great</li>
            <li>Love the scent and my sensitive skin is responding well to this wonderful wash.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Nubian Heritage.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Need to get more</li>
            <li>I love Nubian Heritage products.</li>
            <li>always love using this product to shower and bathe</li>
            <li>I like all of the Nubian Heritage body washes, but the lemongrass and tea tree is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very clean and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I like this body wash -- the smell is clean but not too strong.  </li>
            <li>It left my skin smelling good and feeling clean!</li>
            <li>On a positive note:  It smells good and shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Has a very mild smell (my husband says he can&#x27;t smell it at all) which is great for those with allergies or other sensitivities.</li>
            <li>Since it is lemongrass, not lemon, it does not have a cloyingly sweet, grandmotherly scent.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes that get irritated from many body washes that are too strong or perfumey.  </li>
            <li>Plus the product came pretty quick!</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the clean yet not dry feeling it leaves my skin!</li>
            <li>While using them, they have all lathered pretty well.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great for leaving skin feeling totally clean and soft without any residue or thick creamy ingredients.</li>
            <li>Not sure how good it kills bacteria/fungus yet.</li>
            <li>Very viscous consistency</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m often in pain nd found this product to be very soothing.</li>
            <li>I really dislike the consistency of the body wash.</li>
            <li>After using them, they have a pleasant and subtle after smell on the skin.</li>
            <li>It smells great, and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>not good - doesn&#x27;t smell good, lather up well, or rinse well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used quite a few of them at this point and each one has it&#x27;s own specific smell and purpose as stated on the bottle.</li>
            <li>It has a thick more like gel texture, but lathers really well.</li>
            <li>The wash is too thick to come out of the flip top</li>
            <li>so the entire top must to screwed off each time the product is used, which is a negative.</li>

            <li> Good smelling soap. Not sure how good it kills bacteria/fungus yet.</li>
            <li> not good - doesn&#x27;t smell good, lather up well, or rinse well.  I wont buy it again.</li>
            <li> Smells neither like tea tree nor lemongrass.  I&#x27;m not sure exactly what the scent is, but it is definitely unpleasant.  Lathers like crazy and a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> nice body wash, not the best smelling if you want a perfumed soap.  Very viscous consistency, I can squeeze a foot long string of it out of the bottle and it will just hang there.</li>
            <li> Smells great but not moisturizing at all. Not good for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Nubian Heritage. Every one of their body washes smell great when using in the shower. I&#x27;ve used quite a few of them at this point and each one has it&#x27;s own specific smell and purpose as stated on the bottle. For example, some are hydrating, others are aching fighting, and then combinations of various traits. While using them, they have all lathered pretty well. After using them, they have a pleasant and subtle after smell on the skin.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the clean yet not dry feeling it leaves my skin! It has a thick more like gel texture, but lathers really well. The bottle is a good size too. Plus the product came pretty quick!</li>
            <li> Scent is less than desirable. Body wash cleans nice and this brand is great but this one &amp;#34;stinks&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m often in pain nd found this product to be very soothing. It does not get to sudsy, however still soothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this body wash for a couple years and it&#x27;s great for leaving skin feeling totally clean and soft without any residue or thick creamy ingredients. Has a very mild smell (my husband says he can&#x27;t smell it at all) which is great for those with allergies or other sensitivities.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Need to get more</li>

            <li> I love Nubian Heritage products. This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried the body wash; I usually buy the bar soaps. I really dislike the consistency of the body wash. It&#x27;s thick, difficult to lather and difficult to squeeze out of the bottle. I was very surprised and disappointed. I&#x27;ll go back to the bars. On a positive note:  It smells good and shipped fast. Received it earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference in my skin</li>
            <li> Lemongrass and Tea Tree Body was is a great product. It smells great, and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> always love using this product to shower and bathe</li>
