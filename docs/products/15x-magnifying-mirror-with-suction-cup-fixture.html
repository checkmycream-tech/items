            <li>lol</li>
            <li>Good sturdy mirror.</li>
            <li>This is a very handy and practical item, fitting easily in my hand.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this mirror thinking it would be of better quality.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even sure it&#x27;s 15x</li>
            <li>, it looks more like 10x.</li>
            <li>It is scratch free and the suction cups work well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact enough to keep in my purse and has good visibility.</li>
            <li>Mirror is just right.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hard to get a good view without it looking warped, I ended up buying one a few inches bigger and it works perfect!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so cheap cost as much in gas and time just to send the piece of garbage back</li>
            <li>This was a mini mirror and doesn&#x27;t stick very well and magnified image is distorted.</li>
            <li>mostly use it for plucking eyebrows, and I can see hairs I didn&#x27;t see in other</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a handy little mirror!</li>
            <li>Location of suction cups and materials used provide less holding power- be sure to reapply every 2 days</li>
            <li>Still a decent buy.</li>
            <li>The quality of the mirror is cheap, not crisp and really clear,  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying one.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t as clear a mirror as the 15x that WalMart sold several years ago, but it will certainly do.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money.would have returned but didn&#x27;t want to waste any more $ on shipping.</li>
            <li>The magnification is minimal, almost like a normal mirror.</li>
            <li>This mirror is ridiculous, it has one sweet spot that&#x27;s about the size of a dime</li>

            <li> This mirror is ridiculous, it has one sweet spot that&#x27;s about the size of a dime</li>
            <li> Warps view should have really listen to the other reviewers this product is not worth a penny</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much magnification on this - or at least there is less than I thought there would be.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected this product to be.</li>
            <li> It is small enough to keep in my bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li> It is extremely helpful to me, since I can&#x27;t see up close to do eyebrows, etc.</li>
            <li> The magnification is useless as the reflection is completely distorted.  </li>
            <li> Broke after a few uses because the suction cups didn&#x27;t hold it up.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> use it everyday so I can see my eyes and eyebrows without my contacts or glasses...and it travels well</li>
            <li> because it&#x27;s so small</li>
            <li> I learned the hard way</li>
            <li> The plastic rim is lightweight but poorly constructed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really difficult to find 15x anywhere; the stores never seem to carry them.</li>
            <li> I can see all my pores... perhaps not a good thing on those bad days!</li>
            <li> Was disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> This mirror is awful!  </li>

            <li> The quality of the mirror is cheap, not crisp and really clear,  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying one. Was disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this mirror thinking it would be of better quality.  The mirror is no bigger than the palm of your hand.  The plastic rim is lightweight but poorly constructed.  The suction cups that are supposed to keep the mirror upright don&#x27;t hold support it upright.  You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This is a very handy and practical item, fitting easily in my hand.  It is small enough to keep in my bathroom cabinet.</li>

            <li> This mirror is awful!  The magnification is useless as the reflection is completely distorted.  I have used 15x magnifying mirrors before and this is junk!</li>
            <li> Suction cups broke within a week</li>
            <li> If you are using this mirror for tweezing, it&#x27;s not going to work well.  The magnification is minimal, almost like a normal mirror.</li>
            <li> because it&#x27;s so small it&#x27;s hard to get a good view without it looking warped, I ended up buying one a few inches bigger and it works perfect!</li>
            <li> Everything I expected this product to be. It is extremely helpful to me, since I can&#x27;t see up close to do eyebrows, etc. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> This mirror is ridiculous, it has one sweet spot that&#x27;s about the size of a dime and the rest is distorted. I&#x27;m not even sure it&#x27;s 15x, it looks more like 10x. Save your money!</li>
