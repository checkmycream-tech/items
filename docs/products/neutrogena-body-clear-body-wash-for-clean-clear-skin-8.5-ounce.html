    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>and I think the three pack is excellent value for your money.  </li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Works great for body acne</li>
            <li>smell, does a great job at keeping acne at bay.  </li>
            <li>For me this product worked amazing!</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, it&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>it clears the skin good.</li>
            <li>Love this body wash!</li>
            <li>I love it because it has SA in it!  </li>
            <li>Not objectionable and SOOOOO effective.  </li>
            <li>The smell is nice, it&#x27;s not too strong nor does it have a feminine smell to it.</li>
            <li>I used to love the scent of it, but they have since changed it</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s more antiseptic smelling.</li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>I have now been using the product for about 10 days and my skin is a billion times better.</li>
            <li>I feel a lot more confident about wearing summer tops now.</li>
            <li>but (a) it costs $1 more at the drugstore, just for the scent alone and</li>
            <li>I will make sure our son who seems to have his dad&#x27;s skin use this if he starts to have any problems.</li>
            <li>Why would anyone pay more for this product?  </li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for a better soap since I have a problem with itching skin from the perfume used by others.  </li>
            <li>(b) more importantly, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well.  </li>
            <li>Yes, the product doesnt have a great smell, compared to other shower gels, but that is easily rectified with a good mosituriser, and damn worth it to have such beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of just keeping potential acne at bay and for cleansing bacteria from the skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not yet available on amazon, but I&#x27;m hoping to try it when it is.  </li>
            <li>Firstly i&#x27;d like to just say I love all neutrogena products.</li>
            <li>This product rinses clean and helps with the acne.</li>
            <li>I have heard Neutrogena is coming out with a special body wash using their Microclear Technology called the Power Cream Wash or something like that.  </li>
            <li>Of course, no acne product can stop every instance and it takes a week or so to have full effect.  </li>
            <li>I have smooth skin;)</li>
            <li>This is a good product as long as you use it every day.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great, I have been using it to clear my skin on my back, chest and face and noticed an improvement after about 2-3 days.</li>
            <li>Hands down this stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even easy on my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>This was a wish list item and the receiver was very pleased with the gift and the price spent for the multi-pack</li>
            <li>After using, I actually had more of a problem with breakouts than before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure he wishes he&#x27;d had this as a teenager as he had acne all over his face, back, shoulders and arms.  </li>
            <li>Also, don&#x27;t get it in your eyes -- it really stings!</li>
            <li>This is a good product been using it for a few days and it works well</li>
            <li>It makes my body soft and clean.    </li>
            <li>It easily cleared up my acne in about a week, and with constant use, kept it that way!</li>
            <li>Not really what I expected, again it did nothing for me, but maybe a great product for someone else.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have an acne problem, per se.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This stuff really does work.</li>
            <li>It is very medicine-y.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>To be honest, it should be even less when you buy quantity, but they don&#x27;t appear to sell it bulk where I live.  </li>
            <li>I live in Hawaii and even here Wally sells it around $5-6 per bottle.  </li>
            <li>I convinced my husband, who has very sensitive skin, to try this to help with his psoriasis.  </li>
            <li>So I went back to the original since it apparently works better (at least for me.)    </li>
            <li>I had mild to moderate acne on my back and shoulders for a while, but since I have started using this product I don&#x27;t any problems at all with breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I havent tried this on my face, i&#x27;m a little bit scared because I have senstivie facial skin, but I no doubt think this would be ok to use.</li>
            <li>It is clear, smoother, and the pores and reduced.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to see if it can actually clear my bacne.</li>
            <li>It has really helped clear up my back.</li>
            <li>so I thought, that&#x27;s probably a lot of irritation on already sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>the acne on my shoulders and neck is almost completely gone too.</li>
            <li>The bottles must have gotten too hot or been stored too long.</li>
            <li>Rarely am I compelled enough to order something (in such quantities) online by what the review tells me.</li>
            <li>I have been using all kinds of products and body washes with only minimal success for 4 years.     </li>
            <li>It drys just a bit, not much though, and most other products dry my skin.</li>
            <li>I use it daily and have seen a marked improvement.</li>
            <li>Be careful though, I accidentally purchased the scrub once (they are a similar color and packaging on the computer screen) which I didn&#x27;t like nearly as much.</li>
            <li>I use all kinds of body wash but most feel as if there is a film left behind.  </li>
            <li>This order was disappointing, that wonderfful fresh clean smell had faded.  </li>
            <li>After just a couple days, he notices the dry patches he&#x27;d had on his knees for two years started to clear up.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> His back rarely breaks out anymore, no more dry, itchy patches, he loves it!  </li>
            <li> all the acne that was spread all over my entire back is 90% gone only thing remaining is little darkish spots where the old pimples were that are now healing up!</li>
            <li> My prior winner, Oilatum soap, is a somewhat distant second place.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Note that it can irritate some people&#x27;s skin, so go slow at first (perhaps use it only once every other day) until you see how your skin reacts to it.</li>
            <li> After a weeks use the acne is gone, and I have seen no new breakouts.</li>
            <li> After reading so many postive comments on this product (which seems impossible to find in the uk)</li>
            <li> His scars from his acne even seem less obvious.  </li>
            <li> I got a few compliments on the smell, but never saw any progress after coming into the fourth month.</li>
            <li> The other day before getting in bed I was thinking and what popped in my head was something I heard while reading about body acne and heat rashes (since I get both)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It leaves some sort of slick coating behind that I assume is responsible.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a problem with skin issues and it even calmed down my irritated legs after shaving.</li>
            <li> As a result I have looked long and hard for skin soaps that do not promote itching.  </li>
            <li> I bought it thinking it&#x27;d clear up my chest and arm acne, but sadly it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> and it just seems to make my back worse........</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try sleeping without a shirt for a few days and see what happens since I have tried literally every thing else.</li>
            <li> I bought this after experiencing cystic acne in my inner thighs, and bad acne on my back, and around my chest.</li>
            <li> I used to work in conditions that made scratching oneself rather hard.</li>
            <li> First I have to tell you that I have had very bad body acne, especially on my back, shoulders and neck, but the worst is my back.</li>
            <li> , I remember reading that clothing can irritate skin and make acne and rashes worse and it occurred to me that I am wearing clothing every hour of the day except when in the shower because I wear shirts even when sleeping,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too expensive.  </li>
            <li> The gym is a dirty place with everyone sweating and then sitting on machines, etc.</li>
            <li> I was SHOCKED, and that&#x27;s an understatement, After 5 days</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great for body acne</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and it just seems to make my back worse........</li>
            <li> Love this body wash! It&#x27;s even easy on my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have an acne problem, per se. If I do break out, it&#x27;s one or two. But I do go to the gym every day and I use this wash ALL the time, afterwards. It does a great job of just keeping potential acne at bay and for cleansing bacteria from the skin. The gym is a dirty place with everyone sweating and then sitting on machines, etc. I haven&#x27;t had a problem with skin issues and it even calmed down my irritated legs after shaving. I used to love the scent of it, but they have since changed it and it&#x27;s more antiseptic smelling. Just an FYI!</li>
            <li> I have always used this product and I definitely believe it works.  I had mild to moderate acne on my back and shoulders for a while, but since I have started using this product I don&#x27;t any problems at all with breakouts.  I love the smell and I think the three pack is excellent value for your money.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Firstly i&#x27;d like to just say I love all neutrogena products. I bought this after experiencing cystic acne in my inner thighs, and bad acne on my back, and around my chest. After a weeks use the acne is gone, and I have seen no new breakouts. I havent tried this on my face, i&#x27;m a little bit scared because I have senstivie facial skin, but I no doubt think this would be ok to use.</li>
            <li> After using, I actually had more of a problem with breakouts than before. Maybe I&#x27;m allergic to something in the product.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work. Rarely am I compelled enough to order something (in such quantities) online by what the review tells me. After reading so many postive comments on this product (which seems impossible to find in the uk) I purchased this online through amazon.com.  This stuff is great, I have been using it to clear my skin on my back, chest and face and noticed an improvement after about 2-3 days. I have now been using the product for about 10 days and my skin is a billion times better. It is clear, smoother, and the pores and reduced. I feel a lot more confident about wearing summer tops now. Yes, the product doesnt have a great smell, compared to other shower gels, but that is easily rectified with a good mosituriser, and damn worth it to have such beautiful skin. This product needs to get it&#x27;s ass over to ENGLAND!!!</li>
            <li> I have cystic bacne and this product has helped control it.  I can&#x27;t say it has eliminated it for me, but it does seem to keep it under control which is an improvement, and because of that, I continue to buy it.    On a superficial note, I can&#x27;t stand the smell.  It is very medicine-y.  I tried the grapefruit wash but (a) it costs $1 more at the drugstore, just for the scent alone and (b) more importantly, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well.  I have no idea why since it should be the same product with just a different fragrance.  So I went back to the original since it apparently works better (at least for me.)    I have heard Neutrogena is coming out with a special body wash using their Microclear Technology called the Power Cream Wash or something like that.  It&#x27;s not yet available on amazon, but I&#x27;m hoping to try it when it is.  I&#x27;d like to see if it can actually clear my bacne.</li>
            <li> For me this product worked amazing! It easily cleared up my acne in about a week, and with constant use, kept it that way! It drys just a bit, not much though, and most other products dry my skin.</li>
            <li> I shower twice a day with this stuff. I love it because it has SA in it!  I use a loofa and scrub in circles all over my body. I spend an extra min or two on my legs with KP. It makes my body soft and clean.    I then soak my skin with Sea Breeze toner (it also have SA).let it airdry, then apply some AHA. I have smooth skin;)</li>
            <li> This is a good product been using it for a few days and it works well, I would recommend it to anyone with body blemishes. This product however is not the only reason for my review, I have had a breakthrough with my body acne and I have to let people know so they can see if it works for their problem like it did me. First I have to tell you that I have had very bad body acne, especially on my back, shoulders and neck, but the worst is my back. I have been using all kinds of products and body washes with only minimal success for 4 years.     The other day before getting in bed I was thinking and what popped in my head was something I heard while reading about body acne and heat rashes (since I get both), I remember reading that clothing can irritate skin and make acne and rashes worse and it occurred to me that I am wearing clothing every hour of the day except when in the shower because I wear shirts even when sleeping, so I thought, that&#x27;s probably a lot of irritation on already sensitive skin. So I figured what the heck I&#x27;ll try sleeping without a shirt for a few days and see what happens since I have tried literally every thing else. Three days later I kid you not 50% of my entire body acne disappeared! I was SHOCKED, and that&#x27;s an understatement, After 5 days all the acne that was spread all over my entire back is 90% gone only thing remaining is little darkish spots where the old pimples were that are now healing up! Not only that but the acne on my shoulders and neck is almost completely gone too. This is such a breakthrough that I HAD to get on here and tell my fellow bacne sufferers about this so they see if it helps them too. If you wear shirts while sleeping, try sleeping shirtless for a week just to see what happens I bet you will be amazed. This may be mildly more difficult for woman (for obvious reasons) but for you lady&#x27;s, maybe try sleeping in a sports bra or something of the like.     If this helps you too, please write a review and let everyone knowso the word can get out.</li>
            <li> I use all kinds of body wash but most feel as if there is a film left behind.  This product rinses clean and helps with the acne.</li>
            <li> Takes some time to work but it works.</li>
            <li> I convinced my husband, who has very sensitive skin, to try this to help with his psoriasis.  After just a couple days, he notices the dry patches he&#x27;d had on his knees for two years started to clear up.  Now after using this produce exclusively his skin is clearer then I&#x27;ve ever seen it.  His back rarely breaks out anymore, no more dry, itchy patches, he loves it!  I&#x27;m sure he wishes he&#x27;d had this as a teenager as he had acne all over his face, back, shoulders and arms.  His scars from his acne even seem less obvious.  I will make sure our son who seems to have his dad&#x27;s skin use this if he starts to have any problems. Great product!</li>
            <li> This was a wish list item and the receiver was very pleased with the gift and the price spent for the multi-pack</li>
            <li> I used to work in conditions that made scratching oneself rather hard. As a result I have looked long and hard for skin soaps that do not promote itching.  Hands down this stuff is amazing!  My prior winner, Oilatum soap, is a somewhat distant second place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves some sort of slick coating behind that I assume is responsible.  Not objectionable and SOOOOO effective.  BUT, I would recommend to avoid using this on the bottoms of your feet or it is slip sliding time in the bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely switching to this.</li>
            <li> I bought it thinking it&#x27;d clear up my chest and arm acne, but sadly it didn&#x27;t. The smell is nice, it&#x27;s not too strong nor does it have a feminine smell to it. I got a few compliments on the smell, but never saw any progress after coming into the fourth month.</li>
            <li> This is a good product as long as you use it every day.  Of course, no acne product can stop every instance and it takes a week or so to have full effect.  Nevertheless, it&#x27;s good.  So, why a 1-star review?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issue I have it buying it from here.  It&#x27;s way too expensive.  I live in Hawaii and even here Wally sells it around $5-6 per bottle.  Why would anyone pay more for this product?  To be honest, it should be even less when you buy quantity, but they don&#x27;t appear to sell it bulk where I live.  Shop around before you purchase here.</li>
            <li> I love this. I use it on my face and body. It has really helped clear up my back. Be careful though, I accidentally purchased the scrub once (they are a similar color and packaging on the computer screen) which I didn&#x27;t like nearly as much.</li>
            <li> This order was disappointing, that wonderfful fresh clean smell had faded.  The bottles must have gotten too hot or been stored too long.</li>
            <li> This is basically the same as the Neutrogena face wash -- a 2% salcylic (sp?) acid formulation. You can save a bit of money by using this instead -- I just refill the face wash pump dispenser with the body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice smell, does a great job at keeping acne at bay.  I use it daily and have seen a marked improvement. Note that it can irritate some people&#x27;s skin, so go slow at first (perhaps use it only once every other day) until you see how your skin reacts to it. Also, don&#x27;t get it in your eyes -- it really stings!</li>
            <li> it clears the skin good.</li>
            <li> Not really what I expected, again it did nothing for me, but maybe a great product for someone else.</li>
            <li> Terrific product. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for a better soap since I have a problem with itching skin from the perfume used by others.  Thanks</li>
