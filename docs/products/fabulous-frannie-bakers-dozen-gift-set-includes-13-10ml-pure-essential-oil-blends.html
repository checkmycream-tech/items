            <li>Awesome essential oils.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful essential oil mixtures for all kinds of ailments.</li>
            <li>I found Fabulous Frannie after reading through many reviews, and ordered.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m more acquainted with the many uses for essential oils, I&#x27;m kinda wishing I had got the set that wasn&#x27;t pre-blended; so I could use them more often.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for such a great product that has helped me and my family improve our healthier lifestyle!</li>
            <li>and my muscles felt better after a good long soak!</li>
            <li>First of all I give Fabulous Frannie an A++++++ for customer service!</li>
            <li>I love these oils, and this type of set so much!</li>
            <li>Amazing service plus even better essential oils!</li>
            <li>Double the size bottles of the Young Living oils, 2 more bottles than the YL starter kit and $120 CHEAPER!!!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to order more Essential Oils from Fabulous Frannie!  </li>
            <li>so this set was a nice starting part!</li>
            <li>So far I have not tried any other oils but these but the smell great</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to wait 2-7 days for shipping and hope I was still interested in the project or whatever I was doing with it when it got here.</li>
            <li>The oils came to me low and with label damage as one or more of them leaked during transit.  </li>
            <li>Wish I had bought individual scents rather than this, but it is okay for what it is.</li>
            <li>Therefore, for the money, I think this a very decent set.  </li>
            <li>I really love this company and have been very pleased with the quality of these oils compared with other more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to use much of it.  </li>
            <li>There was one bottle where you have to be careful from it dropping too many drops.</li>
            <li>I bought another similar set of Fabulous Frannie oil sets that was fulfilled by Amazon.</li>
            <li>so I really enjoy the mixed blends!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li>Thanks for fast shipping.</li>
            <li>They are just as good as the more expensive company!</li>
            <li>The thieve&#x27;s oil is great during flu and cold season, it helps everyone from catching the other family member&#x27;s yuck.</li>
            <li>High quality oils.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely turned from the other company, and using Fabulous Frannie.</li>
            <li>Im pretty new to using essential oils</li>
            <li>I will never ever ever buy doTerra or Young Living oils again because they are WAY too overpriced.</li>
            <li>These are by far my favorite oils, have only used a few but</li>
            <li>I did tons of research and wanted to really give oils a try with my family, but I just couldn&#x27;t afford to get started with all the other brands.</li>
            <li>Have only used the cold one all smell good to me</li>
            <li>The blends are wonderful and 4 Thieves and Cold and Flu have been a life saver for me in the past month!  </li>

            <li> Oils have been growing popularity fast for the past coupe years.</li>
            <li> This time, I decided to expand on the other set, so I went directly through Frannie&#x27;s storefront and received this product in a few days.</li>
            <li> We have battled colds and flus in this record bitter winter in the midwest, and by using these oils, both continuously in a tealight burner, and breathing them in directly in a steamer inhaler, I have overcome some serious bronchial and lung issues and am on the road to recovery.</li>

            <li> The scents themselves seem slightly off to me.  </li>
            <li> After using the mainstream expensive brands, I found myself in a financial burden, and HAD TO HAVE my oils as I use them daily, but couldn&#x27;t afford what I was using usually.</li>
            <li> I have also used the aches and pains and calm and anger in the bath tub, I am a runner</li>
            <li> We have used them all in several different ways ( message, diffuser, bath) and have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I tell you its so much better than spraying that nasty spray on!</li>
            <li> The price is fantastic - you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Anxious to try the rest of them!</li>
            <li> I live where the mosquitos are nasty</li>

            <li> Awesome product. None of them leaked or have leaked and they work well in our diffuser and topical.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super new to the essential oil game so this set was a nice starting part! I chose to get this because they were preblended so I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about looking up recipes. I&#x27;ve used a few of these, I really like the one called &amp;#34;Happy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new with Aromatherapy but everything I&#x27;ve learned taught me these are some of the best and great price. I‘ll be buying again.</li>
            <li> Great oil set, no complaints with the quality. Have had these for 8 months and they are handy. Now that I&#x27;m more acquainted with the many uses for essential oils, I&#x27;m kinda wishing I had got the set that wasn&#x27;t pre-blended; so I could use them more often.

            <li> I bought another similar set of Fabulous Frannie oil sets that was fulfilled by Amazon. Prime shipping took almost a week, but that is Amazon&#x27;s issue, not Frannie&#x27;s. This time, I decided to expand on the other set, so I went directly through Frannie&#x27;s storefront and received this product in a few days. I love these oils. The blends are delicious smelling and I look forward to using them. We have battled colds and flus in this record bitter winter in the midwest, and by using these oils, both continuously in a tealight burner, and breathing them in directly in a steamer inhaler, I have overcome some serious bronchial and lung issues and am on the road to recovery.

These are by far my favorite oils, have only used a few but the ones I have used are wonderful! I live where the mosquitos are nasty and I used the bug away and I tell you its so much better than spraying that nasty spray on! I have also used the aches and pains and calm and anger in the bath tub, I am a runner and it was so relaxing and my muscles felt better after a good long soak! Highly recommend this product to anyone! Anxious to try the rest of them!</li>
            <li> Beautifully packaged and high quality. The blends are unique and smell wonderful. I could not be happier with this set.</li>

            <li> Such an awesome set!!! Double the size bottles of the Young Living oils, 2 more bottles than the YL starter kit and $120 CHEAPER!!! Great quality oils! Very strong. I&#x27;ll continue to order!</li>
            <li> These smell great and work very well. I&#x27;ll be getting my diffuser soon and can&#x27;t wait!</li>
            <li> Awesome essential oils.  They are just as good as the more expensive company!</li>
            <li> Nice starter set.  High quality oils.</li>
            <li> Oils have been growing popularity fast for the past coupe years. I did tons of research and wanted to really give oils a try with my family, but I just couldn&#x27;t afford to get started with all the other brands. I also just wanted to jump in and go, I didn&#x27;t want to build up my supply one by one. I found that amazing pack by Faboulous Frannie! I an so grateful I did! Getting the packs was the best idea ever! I would start something with oils, or see something on Facebook and almost always already had the oil on hand from buying the pack! I didn&#x27;t have to wait 2-7 days for shipping and hope I was still interested in the project or whatever I was doing with it when it got here. The oils have worked great! My biggest concern was if they were truly the oil without fillers or carrier oils added. I am very confident that these oils work great and aren&#x27;t mostly fillers! Thanks for such a great product that has helped me and my family improve our healthier lifestyle!</li>
            <li> The oils came to me low and with label damage as one or more of them leaked during transit.  Fabulous Frannie&#x27;s customer service was great and they are sending replacements.  I haven&#x27;t received them yet but trust that I&#x27;ll get them without issue.  The scents themselves seem slightly off to me.  I suppose it&#x27;s a you get what you pay for sort of thing.  Therefore, for the money, I think this a very decent set.  I probably won&#x27;t purchase again but I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this to someone who doesn&#x27;t want to break the bank when buying essential oils.</li>
            <li> Wonderful essential oil mixtures for all kinds of ailments. Fabulous Frannie makes good products and have excellent customer service to boot.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a novice or beginner with essential oils this would be a perfect place for you to start.</li>
            <li> I love my Baker&#x27;s Dozen Gift set!  Can&#x27;t wait to order more Essential Oils from Fabulous Frannie!  The blends are wonderful and 4 Thieves and Cold and Flu have been a life saver for me in the past month!  I made salt dough discs and have them hanging by my chair.  Depending on what I need, a drop on the back of the disc is all I need!</li>
            <li> All the bottles have the same scent.</li>
            <li> Wish I had bought individual scents rather than this, but it is okay for what it is.</li>
