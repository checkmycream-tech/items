            <li> What a nice delicate oil, I like it very much, the aroma is very nice</li>
            <li> The oil absorbs well but does not smell like rose--it smells like tea. I imagine it may have been the batch. I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> Not as strong of a smell as I&#x27;d like but its nice!</li>
            <li> Great product, could be more on the parfume, but it is really good!</li>

            <li> I love the oil itself. It works exactly as proclaimed. The only complaint I have is that to me this doesn&#x27;t smell like anything at all, let alone roses, and I&#x27;m a connoisseur of rose scents because it&#x27;s my favorite flower. Great oil, but please don&#x27;t sell something as being all about roses when it&#x27;s anything but.</li>
            <li> Love the prosuct and use daily. I am ready  to order more</li>
            <li> I really like the nice light scent and the oil keeps my skin moist for a while.</li>
            <li> I use it for my face, hair and hands. Absorbs quickly. Leaves skin soft. I like the smell too. Plus it s all organic!!!</li>
            <li> Hello Friends,&lt;br /&gt;So I am writing an honest  review after using this oil for 4 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil does not smell like fresh  roses .

            <li> I did not like this at all. I thought it smelled mainly like olive oil, with only a slight hint of rose that was barely detectable. It reminded me of salad dressing -- yuck. The oil itself was very thick. Not something you&#x27;d want to put on under clothes.</li>
