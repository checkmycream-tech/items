            <li>well now let me say I don&#x27;t own sigma brushes</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t own any</li>

            <li>They&#x27;re great quality for the price and the flat brush makes my foundation look flawless.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend if you are looking for some good foundation brushes, very good quality.</li>

            <li>Not as cheap as ELF but an amazing deal compared to MAC or Sigma!</li>
            <li>Love them - they apply foundation very lovely</li>
            <li>The brushes are very dense which is a good thing because it gives me more control and it aids in making my make-up look smooth and flawless.</li>
            <li>They are so dense and so soft and are perfect for powder or liquid makeup application.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re amazingly soft and work wonderfully!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping to get the 12 &amp; 15 piece brushes that go with these sets....would be nice to have one gifted to me...</li>
            <li>I opened the package &amp; all four brushes were in perfect condition &amp; they are really soft.</li>
            <li>No shedding has occurred so far, and makeup goes on flawless.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Its been 4 months and the brushes are still going strong!</li>
            <li>I LOVE these brushes they leave my liquid foundation looking flawless and natural.</li>
            <li>I plan on ordering more and distributing them to the people in my area who don&#x27;t have access to them but would love to own a set of quality kabuki brushes.</li>
            <li>i thought it was too good to be true and thses would be crappy brushes.</li>
            <li>are quite strong kind of smells like permanent marker.</li>
            <li>I Loved them so much I ordered three sets!!</li>

            <li>Most of my brushes are of the Studio Line from ELF Cosmetics.</li>
            <li>and I love the quality.</li>
            <li>I have to agree with  others, they do come with a marker smell, but so do many brushes that I have bought.</li>

            <li>I purchased these brushes six months ago and I am still using them and enjoying them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I came across</li>
            <li>considering its rather grand price.</li>
            <li>yay! :)</li>
            <li>I love my sigma f80 kabuki and many reviews</li>
            <li>I will buy this product more often.</li>
            <li>I love the product and the brushes</li>
            <li>I only wish I knew about this line before purchasing so many others!!!</li>
            <li>their soft good prize!</li>
            <li>flat top leaves a beautiful streak-free finish and applied the perfect amount, leaving your skin looking natural.</li>
            <li>Great applying foundation and concealer, I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft and easy to use, it&#x27;s incredible.</li>
            <li>The flat top kabuki is Flimsy and it sheds  a lot!!!</li>
            <li>They are so soft and apply my make up beautifully.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are soft yet dense and apply foundation/powder beautifully.</li>
            <li>Love love...had a strong odor...</li>
            <li>Great quality, they are soft and I love the handles.</li>
            <li>My makeup looks great and they are so soft.</li>
            <li>, the tapered one didn&#x27;t really work as good as i thought it would</li>
            <li>In love with these brushes no smell very soft feels good on my skin</li>
            <li>THEY FEEL EXACTLY LIKE SIGMAS OR EVEN BETTER!</li>
            <li>Do not let the economical price fool you, they are full, lush and exquisite brushes!  </li>
            <li>They are well made, soft but dense, easy to clean and blend in my face products beautifully.</li>
            <li>They arrived very quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li>When they arrived they did have the strong permanent marker smell.</li>
            <li>there was a strong factory type scent that wafted out.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t have a strong smell from the packaging and the bristles weren&#x27;t bend or damaged in any way.</li>
            <li>to me not to strong but noticeable, after looking at them</li>
            <li>Well, they did come with that strong smell</li>
            <li>They do have a strong permanent marker type smell</li>
            <li>was that the handles have a strong sharpie/marker smell</li>
            <li>Although these were pretty cheap they are absolutely fantastic!!</li>
            <li>The flat top kabuki brush is great for blending foundation.</li>
            <li>(I used to use my fingers mostly to apply liquid foundation and sometimes a sponge that wasted so much of my foundation), and now I can honestly say my make up has never looked this great!</li>
            <li>but honestly I have been washing and using them more than some of my high end brushes(like tarte).</li>
            <li>and it was a good as new.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine.  </li>
            <li>but wash it and its fine.</li>
            <li>just like high end brushes love them easy to use for powder or liquid foundation!</li>
            <li>and the handle is huge which I also</li>
            <li>These brushes are great; they are similar to the Sigma ones but unexpensive.</li>
            <li>The concealer kabuki does a fantastic job of blending as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Okay...after two months of watching YouTube reviews and Amazon comments I came into a few dollars and decided to up grade from ELF brushes which are awesome also</li>
            <li>Cheap</li>
            <li>It is smooth</li>
            <li>They work with a variety of products and produce a smooth finish on my skin.</li>
            <li>Good brushes, practical and soft</li>
            <li>But to my suprise these brushes were really good dense and soft and blended like a dream.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to order these, I figured that for the price it wasn&#x27;t going to be good as far as quality was concerned.</li>
            <li>Royal Care Cosmetics offers these for 15 dollars, Freaking Sweet Deal!!!</li>
            <li>and i really like it!!!</li>
            <li>but that is just because I have other brushes I like better, the brushes are still very nice and don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>They are high end quality &amp; work amazing.</li>
            <li>They are high quality and quite honestly...</li>
            <li>They smell kinda funny but its ok.</li>
            <li>I love it ;)</li>
            <li>and I was so excited, then I opened and I couldnt have been happier with the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the flat top kabuki one but it applied my liquid foundation smoothly and flawlessly.</li>
            <li>I just recently purchased these brushes after reading some reviews, and I can honestly say I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li>we&#x27;re  clean</li>
            <li>These brushes are perfect for beginner and come on for the fantastic price there is nothing to complaint about to even the smell(which goes away)</li>
            <li>flat top kabuki brush is amazing for foundation.</li>
            <li>However overall good quality/ feel and budget friendly</li>
            <li>These are just as good as the other brand name brushes that you guys love to pay for.</li>
            <li>I especially liked the flat top and round top for foundation</li>
            <li>These brushes are very good quality, minimal loss of hairs when washing or using, I use them for blush and foundation mostly and they are nice and soft for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>These are a great look a like to the sigma ones but did last the first use.</li>
            <li>I was looking for affordable makeup brushes to try the kabuki ones, the quality of the bristles are amazing, they are dense and soft.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about them.</li>
            <li>but this is my true thoughts as soon as I opened them</li>
            <li>I love them they work really well</li>
            <li>I did not see no shedding no hair on my face nothing at all  and by the way they are super soft nice</li>
            <li>Other than that I am very pleased, thank you!</li>
            <li>Overall pretty nice brushes for the price!</li>
            <li>a beautiful application especially with the tapered and flat top kabuki&#x27;s!&lt;br /&gt;Affordable and awesomeeee&lt;br /&gt;Raving on these brushes..</li>
            <li>I would even say that they have been better than some high end brushes that I have purchased.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad that I purchased these brushes!&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the brushes can be compared to high end.</li>
            <li>overall Im very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>My favorite of the four is the flat top.  </li>
            <li>I fell in love with the flat top kabuki brushes because they&#x27;re so versatile</li>
            <li>They are so nice I can&#x27;t believe want good quality I got for such a low price</li>
            <li>Overall, I LOVE THEM!</li>
            <li>They are worth the money</li>
            <li>They are supper soft and thick which I really like, my makeup looks Flawless I like them better than my Clinque brushes which I payed lots of money for.</li>
            <li>, they are worth it.</li>
            <li>The quality of these brushes is honestly almost comparable to the Sigma face kabuki collection for only a fraction of its price!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t compare it to Sigma because I don&#x27;t own Sigma brushes, but these brushes are not apart of my daily routine.</li>
            <li>how is it that they charged me $200 worth of brushes</li>
            <li>These brushes are well made soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I deff think they are worth their price</li>
            <li>The brushes are definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Flat top kabuki is fantastic for liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>If I didn&#x27;t put 5 stars in these brushes is because the first day I used it the handle came off, but I glued it with super glue</li>
            <li>They are affordable and super soft!!!!</li>
            <li>I jumped right on my computer when I got home to do a haul and review on them...</li>
            <li>Right up there with Sigma for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These brushes are everything right now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using them every single day &amp; my makeup application couldn&#x27;t get any better!</li>
            <li>super soft,dry fast and too much.product doesnt get inside the brush.</li>
            <li>they clean up easily using a standard brush cleaner.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>Ended up receiving them SUPER fast</li>
            <li>When I received them I was pleasantly surprised at how strong and durable they felt and looked.</li>
            <li>Make sure to clean them before you use and let them dry fully.  </li>
            <li>they are a good dup for sigma makeup brushes for half the</li>
            <li>They have an odd smell when you get them, but after a good wash or 2, the smell was gone.</li>
            <li>These came SUPER FAST, it was supposed to be 5 days before they delivered</li>
            <li>Just as good as the higher end version, but much much less.</li>
            <li>These brushes are comparable to Sigma brushes, as they are not as firm as most Sigma brushes are, but definitely get the job done at a very affordable price, I would recommend them to my friends and family that are looking for great affordable brushes.</li>
            <li>but I can say that the quality of these brushes are very high!</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing, the quality of these brushes is beyond what I could have ever expected.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these four brushes!!</li>
            <li>They blend my makeup very well!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an aspiring artist and have been looking for dupes of higher end products that I could use while learning and discovering without sacrificing quality.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t used the rounded yet because I also own the Real Techniques Expert Face Brush (pretty much the same).</li>
            <li>This is the first time i used this brush</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather spend more next time to avoid the annoyance of all this shedding.</li>
            <li>Okay for the price you pay if you want low grade brushes.</li>
            <li>They do have a hint of factory smell when you first get them, but just give them a wash and the smell will go away.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>At first the brushes smell like plastic but after washing them the smell went away.</li>
            <li>As of today, there is no weird smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>they blend and pick up a great amount of product.&lt;br /&gt;the only minor thing i didn&#x27;t like</li>
            <li>I love how each brush is shaped differently.</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with this purchase and will definitely order from RC again.</li>
            <li>they do have a permanent marker odor but that fades after the first wash.</li>
            <li>Theyre very soft, no shedding so far and the they make it super easy to apply liquid foundation onto your face.</li>
            <li>Very thick and good for blending!</li>
            <li>Brushes are full, very soft, and haven&#x27;t shed on me yet.</li>
            <li>I use the flat top for liquid/mousse foundation, tapered for blending concealer, angled for contour</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very dense, yet soft (I don&#x27;t pet them), so your makeup goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>The brushes are super soft and still dense.</li>
            <li>the only problem I found with them is the strong permanent marker smell that they have.</li>
            <li>However the only downfall it might be is the smell, it has a strong smell to these brushes never bothered me though.</li>
            <li>They are super soft and don&#x27;t shed to much.</li>
            <li>The bristles are super soft, don&#x27;t shed, and fit my facial features like they were made just for me.</li>
            <li>Love every single brush and no shedding!</li>
            <li>So far really impressed with theses brushes, washed them twice so far and a few stray hairs have fallen out but very minimal.(only when washed) definitely would recommend these brushes!!</li>
            <li>but very dense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to these brushes.</li>
            <li>FAST SHIPPING</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the stippling brush!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another thing I noticed when washing them is that you have to really rinse them well....</li>
            <li>They perform really well.</li>
            <li>SOOOO soft, ive had these for a year now, totally worth it</li>
            <li>Then I came across this and couldn&#x27;t find much reviews</li>
            <li>The hairs also come off more than expected.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve really held up.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>They apply product very</li>
            <li>we&#x27;ll makes blending so much easier.</li>
            <li>All stars for product performance, quality of brushes and  fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and i find I can&#x27;t really do that with sponges .</li>
            <li>I brought these brushes as an add on to another set of brushes; wish I had purchased these first, they are very soft and work really well</li>
            <li>Overall worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Big whoop right?!</li>
            <li>They blend so well and hold up amazing, very little shedding</li>
            <li>These brushes are reallly soft and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>but they where still good n soft as usual u have 2 wash brand new brushes before using them</li>
            <li>But with regular washing and use they ware out rather quickly.</li>
            <li>I purchased the smaller brushes from this line and had to order these bigger brushes and boy am I glad that I did.</li>
            <li>I use them mainly for blush, bronzer or powder foundation.</li>
            <li>but it did a decent job I still had to go in with my finger after words and</li>
            <li>They are very soft!  </li>
            <li>They never shed &amp; are very soft!</li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast (which is a major PLUS).</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend them.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>This brushes I would say It works as well as High end makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend them to anyone</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I considered buying to Sigma flat top kabuki brush for the same price as this set, because Jaclyn swears by it (as well as their concealer brush).</li>
            <li>I must admit these are the nicest by far!!  </li>
            <li>I feel as though they are a great dupe for the expensive kabuki brush</li>
            <li>The bristles are so soft and gentle.</li>
            <li>SO soft, haven&#x27;t shedded, came fast, and I would buy these again and even as gifts.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised at how fast that took.</li>
            <li>like I normally do I buy something online</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that are a few days the scent will go away.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure that will fade after a few washes.</li>
            <li>When I first touched it they were extremely soft, however the fragrance of these when you first open the package</li>
            <li>The other ones Shedd to but not as much as the flat top.</li>
            <li>except I would say the flat top kabuki I expected it to be a little more denser</li>
            <li>but I was looking for a new way to apply foundation and one of my friends recommended these brushes.</li>
            <li>I bought these brushes because I needed some new face brushes.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft and are a lot like my sigma brushes.</li>
            <li>They are very soft to the touch and DENSE.  </li>
            <li>Very soft.</li>
            <li>Very very soft, and no shedding.  </li>
            <li>Very surprised at the quality for the price.</li>
            <li>Ive had mine about 4 months and no loss of bristles, very soft, no problems.  </li>
            <li>Very very soft bristles, would recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li>Very soft</li>
            <li>Soft yet dense enough to do the job right.</li>
            <li>THESE BRUSHES ARE SO SOFT AND WELL MADE!</li>
            <li>they are so soft and you cannot beat the price!</li>
            <li>Each brush is so soft!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not small</li>
            <li>I have purchased many makeup brushes in the past.  </li>
            <li>This set is amazingly soft!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t go a day without using these brushes and they are so soft!</li>
            <li>said it&#x27;s exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to replace them several times due to issues with the brush ferrule such as ungluing and shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading many positive reviews I decided to purchase these &#x27;Sigma Knockoff&#x27; face brushes.</li>
            <li>highly recommend these brushes for anyone that isn&#x27;t a brand snob and wants to save a bundle of money on virtually the same product.</li>
            <li>VERY fast delivery, came a week early actually.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for those looking for high quality at a low price in foundation brushes/ powder brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are very soft but at the same time firm enough so your makeup goes on nicely.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft yet</li>
            <li>The size and shape are nearly identical.</li>
            <li>I got the Professional 12 piece MU brushes and they shed also...</li>
            <li>These brushes are soft keeps</li>
            <li>So much shedding after 6 months of use and definitely not daily use.</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft and dense.</li>
            <li>If u use it its soft</li>
            <li>But so soft and dense.</li>
            <li>These are completely comparable to Sigma at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so soft, I like to pet them in my spare time.</li>
            <li>Soft and dense.</li>
            <li>The brushes are incredibly SOFT and feathery to the touch.</li>
            <li>The flat brushes glue is a little lose now, but that is probably because I use it the most</li>
            <li>Definitely comparable to high end brushes (MAC, Sigma, etc.)</li>
            <li>Also, there is no shedding which is a major plus!</li>
            <li>Works fine, some shedding and I had to superglue the handles back on for a few of the brushes</li>
            <li>It gets the job done but expect major shedding.</li>
            <li>I am so peeved It has taken me so long to find out about this particular line of brushes.</li>
            <li>There is a slight smell when you initially open the package, but it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>the only very bad thing is that there&#x27;s a very very strong odor from the brushes it smells like chemicals or a very strong plastic smell.</li>
            <li>Each brush came individually wrapped in a clear plastic sleeve.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft and get the job done for only $3 each.</li>
            <li>I would definitely get a professional 24 pcs.</li>
            <li>The only bad thing I can say about these brushes were the plastic smell they have; however, if you clean them before you use them you will be ok.</li>
            <li>Considering these four brushes combined cost a little less than one Sigma kabuki brush, I figured I didn&#x27;t have much to lose by giving them a shot before plunking down money for more Sigma brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, they are hard to get clean.</li>
            <li>i cant wait to use other techniques so i can use this whole set.</li>
            <li>I used these for my face this morning but just the flat kabuki brush, it was so soft, and my  foundation and concealor came out looking like my actual skin.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made.2 brushes broke in half in less than a month.</li>
            <li>yes, so you get what you pay for but expect no more than a few ok months for the price.</li>
            <li>Second time i purchase , the first batch was bad these were better</li>
            <li>I was really wondering if I should buy these brushes or not, there were not very many reviews</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I don&#x27;t own any</li>
            <li> but I feel that they stand on their own even if it wasn&#x27;t a dupe they do the job</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great quality for the price and the flat brush makes my foundation look flawless.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend if you are looking for some good foundation brushes, very good quality.</li>
            <li> High quality AND great price too!</li>
            <li> Not as cheap as ELF but an amazing deal compared to MAC or Sigma!</li>
            <li> Love them - they apply foundation very lovely</li>
            <li> The brushes are very dense which is a good thing because it gives me more control and it aids in making my make-up look smooth and flawless.</li>
            <li> They are so dense and so soft and are perfect for powder or liquid makeup application.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re amazingly soft and work wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping to get the 12 &amp; 15 piece brushes that go with these sets....would be nice to have one gifted to me...</li>
            <li> I opened the package &amp; all four brushes were in perfect condition &amp; they are really soft.</li>
            <li> No shedding has occurred so far, and makeup goes on flawless.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Its been 4 months and the brushes are still going strong!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these brushes they leave my liquid foundation looking flawless and natural.</li>
            <li> I plan on ordering more and distributing them to the people in my area who don&#x27;t have access to them but would love to own a set of quality kabuki brushes.</li>
            <li> i thought it was too good to be true and thses would be crappy brushes.</li>
            <li> are quite strong kind of smells like permanent marker.</li>
            <li> I Loved them so much I ordered three sets!!</li>
            <li> I WILL BE PURCHASING MORE BRUSHES FROM RC COSMETICS(:</li>
            <li> and i do love how it blended my makeup.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have bought better ones.</li>

            <li> Most of my brushes are of the Studio Line from ELF Cosmetics.</li>
            <li> and I love the quality.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with  others, they do come with a marker smell, but so do many brushes that I have bought.</li>

            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> I find I like using these brushes more than I like using my Beauty Blender.</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes six months ago and I am still using them and enjoying them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I came across</li>
            <li> considering its rather grand price.</li>
            <li> yay! :)</li>
            <li> I love my sigma f80 kabuki and many reviews</li>
            <li> I will buy this product more often.</li>
            <li> I love the product and the brushes</li>
            <li> I only wish I knew about this line before purchasing so many others!!!</li>
            <li> their soft good prize!</li>
            <li> flat top leaves a beautiful streak-free finish and applied the perfect amount, leaving your skin looking natural.</li>
            <li> Great applying foundation and concealer, I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and easy to use, it&#x27;s incredible.</li>
            <li> The flat top kabuki is Flimsy and it sheds  a lot!!!</li>
            <li> They are so soft and apply my make up beautifully.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are soft yet dense and apply foundation/powder beautifully.</li>
            <li> Love love...had a strong odor...</li>
            <li> Great quality, they are soft and I love the handles.</li>
            <li> My makeup looks great and they are so soft.</li>
            <li> , the tapered one didn&#x27;t really work as good as i thought it would</li>
            <li> In love with these brushes no smell very soft feels good on my skin</li>
            <li> THEY FEEL EXACTLY LIKE SIGMAS OR EVEN BETTER!</li>
            <li> Do not let the economical price fool you, they are full, lush and exquisite brushes!  </li>
            <li> They are well made, soft but dense, easy to clean and blend in my face products beautifully.</li>
            <li> They arrived very quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li> When they arrived they did have the strong permanent marker smell.</li>
            <li> there was a strong factory type scent that wafted out.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t have a strong smell from the packaging and the bristles weren&#x27;t bend or damaged in any way.</li>
            <li> to me not to strong but noticeable, after looking at them</li>
            <li> Well, they did come with that strong smell</li>
            <li> They do have a strong permanent marker type smell</li>
            <li> was that the handles have a strong sharpie/marker smell</li>
            <li> Although these were pretty cheap they are absolutely fantastic!!</li>
            <li> The flat top kabuki brush is great for blending foundation.</li>
            <li> (I used to use my fingers mostly to apply liquid foundation and sometimes a sponge that wasted so much of my foundation), and now I can honestly say my make up has never looked this great!</li>
            <li> but honestly I have been washing and using them more than some of my high end brushes(like tarte).</li>
            <li> and it was a good as new.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be fine.  </li>
            <li> but wash it and its fine.</li>
            <li> just like high end brushes love them easy to use for powder or liquid foundation!</li>
            <li> and the handle is huge which I also</li>
            <li> These brushes are great; they are similar to the Sigma ones but unexpensive.</li>
            <li> The concealer kabuki does a fantastic job of blending as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Okay...after two months of watching YouTube reviews and Amazon comments I came into a few dollars and decided to up grade from ELF brushes which are awesome also</li>
            <li> Cheap</li>
            <li> It is smooth</li>
            <li> They work with a variety of products and produce a smooth finish on my skin.</li>
            <li> Good brushes, practical and soft</li>
            <li> But to my suprise these brushes were really good dense and soft and blended like a dream.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order these, I figured that for the price it wasn&#x27;t going to be good as far as quality was concerned.</li>
            <li> Royal Care Cosmetics offers these for 15 dollars, Freaking Sweet Deal!!!</li>
            <li> and i really like it!!!</li>
            <li> but that is just because I have other brushes I like better, the brushes are still very nice and don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> They are high end quality &amp; work amazing.</li>
            <li> They are high quality and quite honestly...</li>
            <li> They smell kinda funny but its ok.</li>
            <li> I love it ;)</li>
            <li> and I was so excited, then I opened and I couldnt have been happier with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the flat top kabuki one but it applied my liquid foundation smoothly and flawlessly.</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased these brushes after reading some reviews, and I can honestly say I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li> we&#x27;re  clean</li>
            <li> These brushes are perfect for beginner and come on for the fantastic price there is nothing to complaint about to even the smell(which goes away)</li>
            <li> flat top kabuki brush is amazing for foundation.</li>
            <li> However overall good quality/ feel and budget friendly</li>
            <li> These are just as good as the other brand name brushes that you guys love to pay for.</li>
            <li> I especially liked the flat top and round top for foundation</li>
            <li> These brushes are very good quality, minimal loss of hairs when washing or using, I use them for blush and foundation mostly and they are nice and soft for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> These are a great look a like to the sigma ones but did last the first use.</li>
            <li> I was looking for affordable makeup brushes to try the kabuki ones, the quality of the bristles are amazing, they are dense and soft.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about them.</li>
            <li> but this is my true thoughts as soon as I opened them</li>
            <li> I love them they work really well</li>
            <li> I did not see no shedding no hair on my face nothing at all  and by the way they are super soft nice</li>
            <li> Other than that I am very pleased, thank you!</li>
            <li> Overall pretty nice brushes for the price!</li>
            <li> a beautiful application especially with the tapered and flat top kabuki&#x27;s!&lt;br /&gt;Affordable and awesomeeee&lt;br /&gt;Raving on these brushes..</li>
            <li> I would even say that they have been better than some high end brushes that I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad that I purchased these brushes!&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the brushes can be compared to high end.</li>
            <li> overall Im very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> My favorite of the four is the flat top.  </li>
            <li> I fell in love with the flat top kabuki brushes because they&#x27;re so versatile</li>
            <li> They are so nice I can&#x27;t believe want good quality I got for such a low price</li>
            <li> Overall, I LOVE THEM!</li>
            <li> They are worth the money</li>
            <li> They are supper soft and thick which I really like, my makeup looks Flawless I like them better than my Clinque brushes which I payed lots of money for.</li>
            <li> , they are worth it.</li>
            <li> The quality of these brushes is honestly almost comparable to the Sigma face kabuki collection for only a fraction of its price!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare it to Sigma because I don&#x27;t own Sigma brushes, but these brushes are not apart of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> how is it that they charged me $200 worth of brushes</li>
            <li> These brushes are well made soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I deff think they are worth their price</li>
            <li> The brushes are definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Flat top kabuki is fantastic for liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t put 5 stars in these brushes is because the first day I used it the handle came off, but I glued it with super glue</li>
            <li> They are affordable and super soft!!!!</li>
            <li> I jumped right on my computer when I got home to do a haul and review on them...</li>
            <li> Right up there with Sigma for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These brushes are everything right now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them every single day &amp; my makeup application couldn&#x27;t get any better!</li>
            <li> super soft,dry fast and too much.product doesnt get inside the brush.</li>
            <li> they clean up easily using a standard brush cleaner.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Ended up receiving them SUPER fast</li>
            <li> When I received them I was pleasantly surprised at how strong and durable they felt and looked.</li>
            <li> Make sure to clean them before you use and let them dry fully.  </li>
            <li> they are a good dup for sigma makeup brushes for half the</li>
            <li> They have an odd smell when you get them, but after a good wash or 2, the smell was gone.</li>
            <li> These came SUPER FAST, it was supposed to be 5 days before they delivered</li>
            <li> Just as good as the higher end version, but much much less.</li>
            <li> These brushes are comparable to Sigma brushes, as they are not as firm as most Sigma brushes are, but definitely get the job done at a very affordable price, I would recommend them to my friends and family that are looking for great affordable brushes.</li>
            <li> but I can say that the quality of these brushes are very high!</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing, the quality of these brushes is beyond what I could have ever expected.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these four brushes!!</li>
            <li> They blend my makeup very well!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an aspiring artist and have been looking for dupes of higher end products that I could use while learning and discovering without sacrificing quality.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t used the rounded yet because I also own the Real Techniques Expert Face Brush (pretty much the same).</li>
            <li> This is the first time i used this brush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather spend more next time to avoid the annoyance of all this shedding.</li>
            <li> Okay for the price you pay if you want low grade brushes.</li>
            <li> They do have a hint of factory smell when you first get them, but just give them a wash and the smell will go away.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> At first the brushes smell like plastic but after washing them the smell went away.</li>
            <li> As of today, there is no weird smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they blend and pick up a great amount of product.&lt;br /&gt;the only minor thing i didn&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> I love how each brush is shaped differently.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this purchase and will definitely order from RC again.</li>
            <li> they do have a permanent marker odor but that fades after the first wash.</li>
            <li> Theyre very soft, no shedding so far and the they make it super easy to apply liquid foundation onto your face.</li>
            <li> Very thick and good for blending!</li>
            <li> Brushes are full, very soft, and haven&#x27;t shed on me yet.</li>
            <li> I use the flat top for liquid/mousse foundation, tapered for blending concealer, angled for contour</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very dense, yet soft (I don&#x27;t pet them), so your makeup goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> The brushes are super soft and still dense.</li>
            <li> the only problem I found with them is the strong permanent marker smell that they have.</li>
            <li> However the only downfall it might be is the smell, it has a strong smell to these brushes never bothered me though.</li>
            <li> They are super soft and don&#x27;t shed to much.</li>
            <li> The bristles are super soft, don&#x27;t shed, and fit my facial features like they were made just for me.</li>
            <li> Love every single brush and no shedding!</li>
            <li> So far really impressed with theses brushes, washed them twice so far and a few stray hairs have fallen out but very minimal.(only when washed) definitely would recommend these brushes!!</li>
            <li> but very dense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to these brushes.</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPING</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the stippling brush!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing I noticed when washing them is that you have to really rinse them well....</li>
            <li> They perform really well.</li>
            <li> SOOOO soft, ive had these for a year now, totally worth it</li>
            <li> Then I came across this and couldn&#x27;t find much reviews</li>
            <li> The hairs also come off more than expected.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve really held up.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> They apply product very</li>
            <li> we&#x27;ll makes blending so much easier.</li>
            <li> All stars for product performance, quality of brushes and  fast shipping.</li>
            <li> and i find I can&#x27;t really do that with sponges .</li>
            <li> I brought these brushes as an add on to another set of brushes; wish I had purchased these first, they are very soft and work really well</li>
            <li> Overall worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Big whoop right?!</li>
            <li> They blend so well and hold up amazing, very little shedding</li>
            <li> These brushes are reallly soft and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> but they where still good n soft as usual u have 2 wash brand new brushes before using them</li>
            <li> But with regular washing and use they ware out rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I purchased the smaller brushes from this line and had to order these bigger brushes and boy am I glad that I did.</li>
            <li> I use them mainly for blush, bronzer or powder foundation.</li>
            <li> but it did a decent job I still had to go in with my finger after words and</li>
            <li> They are very soft!  </li>
            <li> They never shed &amp; are very soft!</li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast (which is a major PLUS).</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend them.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> This brushes I would say It works as well as High end makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend them to anyone</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I considered buying to Sigma flat top kabuki brush for the same price as this set, because Jaclyn swears by it (as well as their concealer brush).</li>
            <li> I must admit these are the nicest by far!!  </li>
            <li> I feel as though they are a great dupe for the expensive kabuki brush</li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft and gentle.</li>
            <li> SO soft, haven&#x27;t shedded, came fast, and I would buy these again and even as gifts.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised at how fast that took.</li>
            <li> like I normally do I buy something online</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that are a few days the scent will go away.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure that will fade after a few washes.</li>
            <li> When I first touched it they were extremely soft, however the fragrance of these when you first open the package</li>
            <li> The other ones Shedd to but not as much as the flat top.</li>
            <li> except I would say the flat top kabuki I expected it to be a little more denser</li>
            <li> but I was looking for a new way to apply foundation and one of my friends recommended these brushes.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes because I needed some new face brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft and are a lot like my sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> They are very soft to the touch and DENSE.  </li>
            <li> Very soft.</li>
            <li> Very very soft, and no shedding.  </li>
            <li> Very surprised at the quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Ive had mine about 4 months and no loss of bristles, very soft, no problems.  </li>
            <li> Very very soft bristles, would recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Very soft</li>
            <li> Soft yet dense enough to do the job right.</li>
            <li> THESE BRUSHES ARE SO SOFT AND WELL MADE!</li>
            <li> they are so soft and you cannot beat the price!</li>
            <li> Each brush is so soft!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not small</li>
            <li> I have purchased many makeup brushes in the past.  </li>
            <li> This set is amazingly soft!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t go a day without using these brushes and they are so soft!</li>
            <li> said it&#x27;s exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to replace them several times due to issues with the brush ferrule such as ungluing and shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading many positive reviews I decided to purchase these &#x27;Sigma Knockoff&#x27; face brushes.</li>
            <li> highly recommend these brushes for anyone that isn&#x27;t a brand snob and wants to save a bundle of money on virtually the same product.</li>
            <li> VERY fast delivery, came a week early actually.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for those looking for high quality at a low price in foundation brushes/ powder brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are very soft but at the same time firm enough so your makeup goes on nicely.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft yet</li>
            <li> The size and shape are nearly identical.</li>
            <li> I got the Professional 12 piece MU brushes and they shed also...</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft keeps</li>
            <li> So much shedding after 6 months of use and definitely not daily use.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and dense.</li>
            <li> If u use it its soft</li>
            <li> But so soft and dense.</li>
            <li> These are completely comparable to Sigma at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so soft, I like to pet them in my spare time.</li>
            <li> Soft and dense.</li>
            <li> The brushes are incredibly SOFT and feathery to the touch.</li>
            <li> The flat brushes glue is a little lose now, but that is probably because I use it the most</li>
            <li> Definitely comparable to high end brushes (MAC, Sigma, etc.)</li>
            <li> Also, there is no shedding which is a major plus!</li>
            <li> Works fine, some shedding and I had to superglue the handles back on for a few of the brushes</li>
            <li> It gets the job done but expect major shedding.</li>
            <li> I am so peeved It has taken me so long to find out about this particular line of brushes.</li>
            <li> There is a slight smell when you initially open the package, but it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> the only very bad thing is that there&#x27;s a very very strong odor from the brushes it smells like chemicals or a very strong plastic smell.</li>
            <li> Each brush came individually wrapped in a clear plastic sleeve.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft and get the job done for only $3 each.</li>
            <li> I would definitely get a professional 24 pcs.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing I can say about these brushes were the plastic smell they have; however, if you clean them before you use them you will be ok.</li>
            <li> Considering these four brushes combined cost a little less than one Sigma kabuki brush, I figured I didn&#x27;t have much to lose by giving them a shot before plunking down money for more Sigma brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , they are hard to get clean.</li>
            <li> i cant wait to use other techniques so i can use this whole set.</li>
            <li> I used these for my face this morning but just the flat kabuki brush, it was so soft, and my  foundation and concealor came out looking like my actual skin.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made.2 brushes broke in half in less than a month.</li>
            <li> yes, so you get what you pay for but expect no more than a few ok months for the price.</li>
            <li> Second time i purchase , the first batch was bad these were better</li>
            <li> I was really wondering if I should buy these brushes or not, there were not very many reviews</li>
            <li> And the pointed brush hairs feel very plastic and stiff.</li>
            <li> I use the other two for blush and contouring, which it does so seamlessly because it picks up color</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any smell  as mentioned in other reviews,and I am sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li> Plus their super small compare to other brushes i have....</li>
            <li> Brushes are nice but two of my handles completely broke before I even used them:( won&#x27;t purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li> I do like the fullness of the brushes but who knows how long that will last</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of money on individual brushes of equal or inferior quality.</li>
            <li> Only one of them came loose whrn</li>
            <li> Excuse me while I go play with some makeup...</li>
            <li> While washing their was minimal shedding, but I&#x27;ve washed them several times since with no shedding.</li>
            <li> Was really surprised at how fluffy and well made these brushes are.&lt;br /&gt;Such</li>
            <li> Only problem is my flat one became loose after only having them for less than two months.</li>
            <li> Love them, BUT the smell is bad i totally recommend them.</li>
            <li> and they wash and dry well.</li>
            <li> And I use the Benjabelle brush tree to dry them</li>
            <li> but I let it dry and</li>
            <li> let them dry overnight after thy</li>
            <li> Since, I&#x27;ve washed them a few times and they held well and dried fast.</li>
            <li> This brushes are so soft, they smell a little weird at first but with a wash they won&#x27;t smell anymore!</li>
            <li> one of my handles where loose</li>
            <li> I washed them thoroughly twice &amp; aloud them to dry BEFORE using!</li>
            <li> There was a slight smell to them but after washing them and even using Elf&#x27;s daily brush spray cleaner, they no longer have a smell.</li>
            <li> The RC brushes are ever so slightly less dense than the Sigma brushes, but only a negligible amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have two other sets similar to this set from other companies and these are basically dups for them but beyond cheaper in price.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is the horrible smell they carry when you first open the package, but that quickly goes away once you wash the brushes.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re big fluffy brushes.</li>
            <li> But yes they do have a weird smell at first</li>
            <li> I would buy them again and recommend them over any other brushes.</li>
            <li> and thought I could use the other brushes just as well.</li>
            <li> The other brushes I use on occasion</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s like crazy, had to stop using the flag top because all the hairs where being left behind on my face.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t notice an odor like other people said.</li>
            <li> im not willing to buy $24 brushes when I can get all four for this price.</li>
            <li> Only complaint I have is that one of them already seems loose after washing.</li>
            <li> It does have a permanent marker scent but after a few washes it&#x27;ll fade, it&#x27;s still worth it and much better than some brand name brushes I&#x27;ve owned in the past that shed terribly and weren&#x27;t up to the hype</li>
            <li> I have dark eye circles</li>
            <li> For starters I ordered these brushes with the mini face brushes of the same shape late on a Thursday evening and received my order on Monday.  </li>
            <li> Other than that I have no complaints!</li>
            <li> But...hey, I guess that&#x27;s what happens when you get tightly packed brushes like these.</li>
            <li> With shipping the brushes work out to be a little over $5 each.</li>
            <li> They did smell a little funky when they arrived, but you&#x27;re supposed to wash them before use anyway</li>
            <li> Just wash them a few times and that is it.</li>
            <li> I am completely obsessed these brushes they are so soft and work</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it never sheds and hairs never break off.</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes on a Friday &amp; it said that the approximate delivery date would be the following Thursday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them a few times and still haven&#x27;t changed my mind.</li>
            <li> These have become my everyday go to brushes.  </li>
            <li> Another thing is that they seem a little small.</li>
            <li> others have said they do smell pretty bad after opening but once washed they don&#x27;t smell at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a little scared when I read a review about them smelling badly, but when mine arrived straight out of the box..</li>
            <li> I did notice a little shedding like  5 hairs on one of them and 2 or 3 on the others and I notice a smell !</li>
            <li> when dry I twisted the brush and pushes it down a bit</li>
            <li> There is very little fall out of the bristles when cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Buy</li>
            <li> AND..... I never even got the other brushes that they charged me 5 times !!!</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I had one small issue with one of the brushes and Royal Care Cosmedics took care of me promptly.</li>
            <li> set that Beauty bloggers usually rave about.</li>
            <li> If you have knowledge of makeup, consider yourself an amateur artist or even ARE a makeup artist, buy these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been the biggest makeup fanatic</li>
            <li> complaint (and had this with the sigma as well)</li>
            <li> The negative to them is the permanent marker smell everyone complained about</li>
            <li> Spent a lot of money on expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> While disappointing, it wasn&#x27;t that big of a deal.</li>
            <li> thick brushes&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical given that all four brushes costed less than one MAC or Sigma brush...but cue the Hallelujah chorus...</li>
            <li> Have washed them like I wash all of my other brushes and these are by far the worst in terms of shedding.</li>
            <li> but I was a little skeptical.</li>
            <li> I figured, if they are terrible I only lost a few dollars.</li>
            <li> 1 HANDLE BROKE OFF IMMEDIATELY NOT HAPPY ABOUT THAT</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any shedding with these brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously considering buying the eye shadow brushes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other brushes offline and was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> they smell a little but nothing to bad.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that it didn&#x27;t come in a case</li>
            <li> However, the ones I&#x27;ve owned in the past shed badly and cost a lot.</li>
            <li> Upon opening the packaging i noticed that the brushes had a weird smell to them.</li>
            <li> I know the drill I never write my address wrong or anything like that</li>
            <li> I was so angry.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of these brushes because of the price.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with these....</li>
            <li> i wanted brushes that arent too expensive.</li>
            <li> Just kidding, because that would be weird.</li>
            <li> I was proven wrong.</li>
            <li> They stink so bad and half of them shed so bad</li>
            <li> poorly made brushes :(</li>
            <li> Me Crazy set</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t shed like crazy, but I do have to pluck out hairs before a makeup application so they don&#x27;t end up stuck to my foundation, etc.</li>
            <li> They look and feel very expensive.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> The brushes are bad quality.</li>
            <li> GRRRR...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy these, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> HATE</li>
            <li> but sadly i hate to say this</li>
            <li> but i hate the smounds came from it</li>
            <li> She loves them and since shes a teenager, whom is almost impossible to please that is a relief!  </li>
            <li> and I had horrible brushes.</li>
            <li> I have had a terrible time trying to find brushes that offer all of these qualities.  </li>
            <li> , they come with no brushes bag which is terrible and they had  a permanent marker smell</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The flat top kabuki is Flimsy and it sheds  a lot!!! The other ones Shedd to but not as much as the flat top. Plus their super small compare to other brushes i have.... I do Not recommend  this set! :/ the quality is so LOW!!!! The brushes look like toys! HATE THIS PRODUCT WANT MY MONEY BACK!! Im trying to upload a picture but it&#x27;s not letting me!</li>
            <li> Awesome ! But yes they do have a weird smell at first</li>
            <li> so I ordered these on May 30th and got them on the 1st so it took no time to get here.! They smell kinda funny but its ok. They are worth the money and I will be buying more soon! They are supper soft and thick which I really like, my makeup looks Flawless I like them better than my Clinque brushes which I payed lots of money for.</li>
            <li> The best brushes,b better than sigma &amp; way cheaper!&lt;br /&gt;The flat top kabuki brush is amazing for foundation.</li>
            <li> THESE BRUSHES ARE SO SOFT AND WELL MADE! THEYRE AMAZING FOR THE PRICE THEY FEEL EXACTLY LIKE SIGMAS OR EVEN BETTER! THEY DO HOWEVER HAVE A LIKE A WAREHOUSE SMELL BUT I WASHED THEM AND THE SMELL WENT AWAY..I TOTALLY RECOMEND THEM I WILL BE PURCHASING MORE BRUSHES FROM RC COSMETICS(:</li>
            <li> I loved these brushes way more than I thought.  They&#x27;re soft yet durable-- but very dense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t seen any shedding after deep cleaning the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little scared when I read a review about them smelling badly, but when mine arrived straight out of the box.. I did not notice any odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with my purchase and plan on trying more Royal Care brushes.</li>
            <li> this is an amazing product! I just purchased this. The brushes are very soft and are a lot like my sigma brushes. Perfect dupe for the sigma brushes</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to these brushes. Upon opening the packaging i noticed that the brushes had a weird smell to them. Not a fan of the smell. I have already washed the brushes 3 times and still can not get rid of smell. I have however used 1 brush and i do love how it blended my makeup.</li>
            <li> These brushes rock! They are so dense and so soft and are perfect for powder or liquid makeup application. I was a bit skeptical given that all four brushes costed less than one MAC or Sigma brush...but cue the Hallelujah chorus...these brushes are amazing. I would buy them again and recommend them over any other brushes.Excuse me while I go play with some makeup...</li>
            <li> Cheaply made.2 brushes broke in half in less than a month.</li>
            <li> ive used them for about a year now...ITS a must to get they are holding up like a champ</li>
            <li> These brushes are great; they are similar to the Sigma ones but unexpensive. I couldn&#x27;t have bought better ones. I totally recommend them to make-up lovers that don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great and very inexpensive. I would definetly recommend these brushes for beginners. The only bad thing I can say about these brushes were the plastic smell they have; however, if you clean them before you use them you will be ok. It does what they are supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all about beauty on a budget! Most of my brushes are of the Studio Line from ELF Cosmetics. They&#x27;re soft and get the job done for only $3 each. But with regular washing and use they ware out rather quickly. I&#x27;ve had to replace them several times due to issues with the brush ferrule such as ungluing and shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading many positive reviews I decided to purchase these &#x27;Sigma Knockoff&#x27; face brushes. I&#x27;m so happy I did! With shipping the brushes work out to be a little over $5 each. Not as cheap as ELF but an amazing deal compared to MAC or Sigma! When they arrived they did have the strong permanent marker smell. I washed them thoroughly twice &amp; aloud them to dry BEFORE using! While washing their was minimal shedding, but I&#x27;ve washed them several times since with no shedding. They&#x27;re amazingly soft and work wonderfully! I&#x27;m seriously considering buying the eye shadow brushes!</li>
            <li> These brushes work wonders. Got here on time and I love the quality. Amazing!</li>
            <li> These brushes are reallly soft and exactly what I was looking for. I orginally was going to by the Sigma Kabuki brushes because I have the Making Me Crazy set and thought I could use the other brushes just as well. The price of the Sigma Kabuki brushes run around 56 or 60 dollars for this set. Royal Care Cosmetics offers these for 15 dollars, Freaking Sweet Deal!!! I have to agree with  others, they do come with a marker smell, but so do many brushes that I have bought. Just wash them a few times and that is it. Not a deal breaker for me.  I also youtubed the video to see how to use each brush.Very happy with the fast delivery, I ordered on Sunday and got them Wed, which is today.  Anyways, these are awesome!!&#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to update, I just washed the brushes last night and there was no shedding at all!! Still awesome!</li>
            <li> I purchased the smaller brushes from this line and had to order these bigger brushes and boy am I glad that I did. These brushes are AMAZING with a capital A.  I would even say that they have been better than some high end brushes that I have purchased.  There has been no shedding at all. There was a slight smell to them but after washing them and even using Elf&#x27;s daily brush spray cleaner, they no longer have a smell. Great brushes!</li>
            <li> just like high end brushes love them easy to use for powder or liquid foundation! excellent results with these brushes</li>
            <li> Although these were pretty cheap they are absolutely fantastic!! They haven&#x27;t shed at all and applies foundation flawlessly! I highly recommend these four brushes!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought these, they&#x27;re great, work amazing, and are so affordable!&lt;br /&gt;Like others have said they do smell pretty bad after opening but once washed they don&#x27;t smell at all. Also I haven&#x27;t had any problems with shedding.</li>
            <li> In love with these brushes no smell very soft feels good on my skin I&#x27;m going to Order the 12piece set</li>
            <li> I love these brushes for flawlessly applying foundation. I&#x27;ve never used anything better. And the cost was actually afordable! I had one small issue with one of the brushes and Royal Care Cosmedics took care of me promptly. Will but again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> Best brushes to apply foundation and conceal or and I even apply my powders with these! I can interchange them as we&#x27;ll. they are so soft and you cannot beat the price! I HIGHLY recommend them. Great quality brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been the biggest makeup fanatic but I was looking for a new way to apply foundation and one of my friends recommended these brushes. They&#x27;re great quality for the price and the flat brush makes my foundation look flawless. Only problem is my flat one became loose after only having them for less than two months. It seems the metal came apart from the wood handle a bit, but its bearable.</li>
            <li> I am stunned by how good these brushes are! If you are looking for that runway/airbrushed look, these are the brushes for you. They are high quality and quite honestly...identical to Sigma brushes...but a fraction of the price (can I get am amen??).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking about trying these (I went back and forth for a while myself), trust me, they are worth it. You will love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint (and had this with the sigma as well), they are hard to get clean. But...hey, I guess that&#x27;s what happens when you get tightly packed brushes like these.</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with these brushes. Just as good as the higher end version, but much much less. I use these every day that I put makeup on. SO GLAD I bought them.</li>
            <li> Amazing product just as good or better than sigma! They blend so well and hold up amazing, very little shedding</li>
            <li> These are the best brushes I have ever used !! I Loved them so much I ordered three sets!! Love Love</li>
            <li> I just love these brushes,  it was an excellent choice. Woild recommend this to any body looking for good quality at the perfect price.</li>
            <li> I brought these brushes as an add on to another set of brushes; wish I had purchased these first, they are very soft and work really well</li>
            <li> one of my handles where loose but they where still good n soft as usual u have 2 wash brand new brushes before using them</li>
            <li> These brushes are just like Sigma brushes.  They are very soft!  They blend my makeup very well!  I love these brushes and I plan on buying more of them!!</li>
            <li> Great brushes for the price. I feel as though they are a great dupe for the expensive kabuki brush set that Beauty bloggers usually rave about. Love them - they apply foundation very lovely I use them everytime!</li>
            <li> Great brushes at a fab. price!  Flat top kabuki is fantastic for liquid foundation. Blends the foundation with out soaking it up.  The concealer kabuki does a fantastic job of blending as well.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li> The quality of these brushes is honestly almost comparable to the Sigma face kabuki collection for only a fraction of its price!</li>
            <li> I have Sigma brushes F80 and F82, but wanted the F84 and F86. Considering these four brushes combined cost a little less than one Sigma kabuki brush, I figured I didn&#x27;t have much to lose by giving them a shot before plunking down money for more Sigma brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the package there was a strong factory type scent that wafted out. But after being out of the package for a while, the smell went away some. And I figure with washing the smell will go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, but are these brushes like the Sigma brushes, you ask? Why yes, yes they are. The size and shape are nearly identical. The handles of these brushes are a more matte finish than the glossy Sigma handles. Big whoop right?! I agree. The RC brushes are ever so slightly less dense than the Sigma brushes, but only a negligible amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these brushes for anyone that isn&#x27;t a brand snob and wants to save a bundle of money on virtually the same product.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! I use them every time I wear makeup. They never shed &amp; are very soft! The flat top kabuki brush is great for blending foundation. I get an even all over look each time. I would recommend these brushes to anyone!</li>
            <li> I saw reviews and had mixed feelings for these. Didnt know what.to expect but honestly I have been washing and using them more than some of my high end brushes(like tarte). They are super soft,dry fast and too much.product doesnt get inside the brush.Best quality for.your money.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! They are super soft and don&#x27;t shed to much. They do need to be washed as soon as you get them bc they smell a little but nothing to bad. Overall worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I am so peeved It has taken me so long to find out about this particular line of brushes. These brushes are an awesome dupe to Sigma brushes in my opinion, Also with an amazing price. The bristles are so soft and gentle. They distribute makeup flawlessly and are so easy to clean. I only wish I knew about this line before purchasing so many others!!!</li>
            <li> This brushes are so soft, they smell a little weird at first but with a wash they won&#x27;t smell anymore! And let&#x27;s talk about the price, SO AFFORDABLE!</li>
            <li> I am completely obsessed these brushes they are so soft and work so well I am glad I purchased these.</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPING BUT AS SOON AS I GOT MY BRUSHES I WASHED THEM AND 1 HANDLE BROKE OFF IMMEDIATELY NOT HAPPY ABOUT THAT AT ALL!!!!!!!!!! However overall good quality/ feel and budget friendly so I will repurchase</li>
            <li> If you have knowledge of makeup, consider yourself an amateur artist or even ARE a makeup artist, buy these. I&#x27;m an aspiring artist and have been looking for dupes of higher end products that I could use while learning and discovering without sacrificing quality. These are my best purchase yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watch Jaclyn Hill YouTube videos (my favorite artist) and she uses these brushes but from Sigma. I considered buying to Sigma flat top kabuki brush for the same price as this set, because Jaclyn swears by it (as well as their concealer brush). Well, I am so happy I stumbled upon these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flat top leaves a beautiful streak-free finish and applied the perfect amount, leaving your skin looking natural. The concealer brush applies concealer FLAWLESSLY. I have dark eye circles so I apply a corrector as well as a concealer and sometimes the concealer will settle, but NOT with this brush. I use the other two for blush and contouring, which it does so seamlessly because it picks up color so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could go on forever. Buy these.</li>
            <li> Brushes are full, very soft, and haven&#x27;t shed on me yet. VERY fast delivery, came a week early actually. There is a slight smell when you initially open the package, but it goes away quickly. Only downside for me is that I wish they came in some type of holder. Other than that I am very pleased, thank you!</li>
            <li> good quality i love them</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare it to Sigma because I don&#x27;t own Sigma brushes, but these brushes are not apart of my daily routine. I use the flat top for liquid/mousse foundation, tapered for blending concealer, angled for contour and I haven&#x27;t used the rounded yet because I also own the Real Techniques Expert Face Brush (pretty much the same). Great buy for the price!</li>
            <li> So I bought the Royal Care Cosmetics here on amazon, like I normally do I buy something online I know the drill I never write my address wrong or anything like that, so the reason I gave this item 1 star is because I get an email saying that the seller had charged me 5 times and that the order was processed already and I cant make any changes, but I only ordered 1 of the Kabuki Brush set!!! it was literally over $200 bucks that they charged me I was so angry. so I called amazon an they said that &amp;#34;they never charged me $200 dollars&amp;#34; ( WHAT THE HECK!!!!) But my bank account shows that $200 dollars was charged from my account . I called royal care I contacted the seller and he/she wouldn&#x27;t write back! so I was lost and I couldn&#x27;t do anything. I&#x27;ve never had to go though this before so I was lost. AND..... I never even got the other brushes that they charged me 5 times !!! how is it that they charged me $200 worth of brushes but they couldn&#x27;t even send me the brushes that was charged, I only got the 1 of the 4 piece synthetic kabuki set.. GRRRR... also the brushes SUCKKKKKK!!! They stink so bad and half of them shed so bad I just threw them away... so I lost $200 dollars and I had horrible brushes. I got the Professional 12 piece MU brushes and they shed also...</li>
            <li> Theyre very soft, no shedding so far and the they make it super easy to apply liquid foundation onto your face. I guess they could also work for powder foundations but overall Im very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the first time i used this brush and i really like it!!! :) i might get another set of this :)</li>
            <li> Love all these brushes. Perfect for blending in liquid foundation . Flawless  A+++</li>
            <li> I order these april27 and received april30th so shipping was GREAT!  They sell aweful and she&#x27;d as soon as I pulled them out of the sleeve. I may return and order a different set. I do like the fullness of the brushes but who knows how long that will last and the handle is huge which I also like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros thick brushes&lt;br /&gt;Cons stink and shed</li>
            <li> They are so nice I can&#x27;t believe want good quality I got for such a low price I will tell every one how nice theses brushes are</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the stippling brush! I use it everyday and it never sheds and hairs never break off. The other brushes I use on occasion but that is just because I have other brushes I like better, the brushes are still very nice and don&#x27;t shed. Overall pretty nice brushes for the price!</li>
            <li> High quality AND great price too! I was amazed. I have spent a lot of money on individual brushes of equal or inferior quality. No shedding and they clean up easily using a standard brush cleaner. I may purchase more brushes in this line.</li>
            <li> SO soft, haven&#x27;t shedded, came fast, and I would buy these again and even as gifts. I don&#x27;t need any more. Perfect. I want to buy a ton</li>
            <li> The brushes are bad quality. The handles on three of my brushes are falling apart already. Now I have to glue the metal and the woud back together in order to use the brushes.</li>
            <li> Okay...after two months of watching YouTube reviews and Amazon comments I came into a few dollars and decided to up grade from ELF brushes which are awesome also but I wanted something with a larger handle.  For starters I ordered these brushes with the mini face brushes of the same shape late on a Thursday evening and received my order on Monday.  AWESOME....you have to pay for Amazon prime to get that type of service and mine has expired.  The brushes smell like a warehouse our factory....after washing them I realize it&#x27;s the handles that smell...perhaps the paint or wood. I&#x27;m sure that are a few days the scent will go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I noticed when washing them is that you have to really rinse them well....maybe invest in a low suds formula when washing them.  They are very soft to the touch and DENSE.  I don&#x27;t have sigma nor Mac to compare this product to...but for the price...I cannot complain...I&#x27;m hoping to get the 12 &amp; 15 piece brushes that go with these sets....would be nice to have one gifted to me... I jumped right on my computer when I got home to do a haul and review on them...Good job Royal Care I hope your makeup is just as good....haven&#x27;t found any reviews on line for it yet.</li>
            <li> AMAZING! these are JUST like the Sigma Cosmo Brushes! But wayyyyyy cheaper! These will soon be all over the beauty community!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a freelance makeup artist and I bought these just to try since they look a lot like sigma brushes. They perform really well. I&#x27;ve had them for over a year and they get a lot of use and they wash and dry well. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and easy to use, it&#x27;s incredible. Definitely comparable to high end brushes (MAC, Sigma, etc.) I cannot say enough good things about them. Must buy!</li>
            <li> This brushes I would say It works as well as High end makeup brushes. The brushes are soft and easy to work with. The price is great!! for a good quality brushes and a good deal price. CAN&#x27;T BEAT THAT!!! I love it ;)</li>
            <li> After the second or third wash they started to she&#x27;s like crazy, had to stop using the flag top because all the hairs where being left behind on my face.</li>
            <li> Oh god they were just amazing!! I love each and every one of those brushes, they applied my foundation *yas I mostly used them to apply my foundation* and every application was flawless I love it! It&#x27;s a must buy for the price of them!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are very good quality, minimal loss of hairs when washing or using, I use them for blush and foundation mostly and they are nice and soft for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of these brushes because of the price.  No longer will I have to lust after the Sigma or Sedona Lace over priced Kabuki brushes.  They are so soft and apply my make up beautifully.  They did have a smell but wash them and you&#x27;ll be fine.  Don&#x27;t even smell them because you might inhale some powder.  Very happy with and excited about this purchase.</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes on a Friday &amp; it said that the approximate delivery date would be the following Thursday. Today is Monday &amp; I just received them in the mail! I was so surprised at how fast that took. I opened the package &amp; all four brushes were in perfect condition &amp; they are really soft. The negative to them is the permanent marker smell everyone complained about but I&#x27;m sure that will fade after a few washes. Another thing is that they seem a little small. I haven&#x27;t applied my makeup with them yet but when I do, I&#x27;ll make another review.</li>
            <li> BUY IT. Veteran makeup artist. Spent a lot of money on expensive brushes. These are better.</li>
            <li> I Love the quality of the brushes. My makeup looks great and they are so soft. Would repurchase these brushes.</li>
            <li> I have had these brushes for 5 months and I will say that they are amazing. Great quality. they are sturdy and do not shed at all.</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes. Only complaint I have is that one of them already seems loose after washing. Other than that I have no complaints! They get the job done and they are great for contouring and highlighting!</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality brushes. Right up there with Sigma for a fraction of the price. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased them.</li>
            <li> The best brushes ever! Great price for great quality! I will buy more just to have in my collection. Very thick and good for blending!</li>
            <li> Loved these brushes very good quality they dont shed and easy to clean</li>
            <li> Good brushes, practical and soft</li>
            <li> I used these for my face this morning but just the flat kabuki brush, it was so soft, and my  foundation and concealor came out looking like my actual skin. Its 6 hours later and i do not see my foundation moving at all. i cant wait to use other techniques so i can use this whole set.</li>
            <li> Works well and had no issues. The hairs don&#x27;t fall out and I didn&#x27;t notice an odor like other people said. Love them and use them every day.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the speedy delivery of this brush set. Each brush came individually wrapped in a clear plastic sleeve. As soon as I removed them, all four ferrules fell off the handles. While disappointing, it wasn&#x27;t that big of a deal. I just glued them all back on. Some reviewers mentioned a smell and no shedding. I had the opposite experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had my brushes for five months now. For the price, they&#x27;re a very good deal. After a couple of washes though they have begun to shed. They don&#x27;t shed like crazy, but I do have to pluck out hairs before a makeup application so they don&#x27;t end up stuck to my foundation, etc. And I use the Benjabelle brush tree to dry them so water in the ferrule isn&#x27;t the issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, they&#x27;re good brushes, and I&#x27;d recommend them for beginners. I use them mainly for blush, bronzer or powder foundation. But for liquid foundation I prefer my Sigma F80 or the MakeUp Geek buffing brush.</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft keeps it shape, no shedding after multiple washes. These brushes are comparable to Sigma brushes, as they are not as firm as most Sigma brushes are, but definitely get the job done at a very affordable price, I would recommend them to my friends and family that are looking for great affordable brushes.</li>
            <li> AMAZING BRUSHES. SOOOO soft, ive had these for a year now, totally worth it</li>
            <li> So much shedding after 6 months of use and definitely not daily use. Have washed them like I wash all of my other brushes and these are by far the worst in terms of shedding. They are not usable anymore because of all the shedding. Cheap yes, so you get what you pay for but expect no more than a few ok months for the price. I&#x27;d rather spend more next time to avoid the annoyance of all this shedding.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and dense. They look and feel very expensive. The price is great. I didn&#x27;t notice any smell  as mentioned in other reviews,and I am sensitive to fragrances. They arrived in 4 days. I would definately buy more brushes from them.</li>
            <li> So far really impressed with theses brushes, washed them twice so far and a few stray hairs have fallen out but very minimal.(only when washed) definitely would recommend these brushes!!</li>
            <li> It is smooth but sadly i hate to say this but i dont like the product. If u use it its soft but i hate the smounds came from it</li>
            <li> The brushes are OK quality the only very bad thing is that there&#x27;s a very very strong odor from the brushes it smells like chemicals or a very strong plastic smell.</li>
            <li> Was really surprised at how fluffy and well made these brushes are.&lt;br /&gt;Such a beautiful application especially with the tapered and flat top kabuki&#x27;s!&lt;br /&gt;Affordable and awesomeeee&lt;br /&gt;Raving on these brushes.. I would definitely get a professional 24 pcs. kit if they had one! Let me know Royal Cosmeticsss</li>
            <li> I was on the market for some good pro synthetic brushes but I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled on spending the money for it. Then I came across this and couldn&#x27;t find much reviews so I went ahead and ordered some for myself. I don&#x27;t own any sigma brushes but I can say that the quality of these brushes are very high! When I first touched it they were extremely soft, however the fragrance of these when you first open the package are quite strong kind of smells like permanent marker. But who cares??? You wash your brushes anyways and nothing that soap and water can&#x27;t fix. When I washed it I would say about 2 hairs came out from the 4 brushes, but thats because they were sticking out and I literally plucked them out. The seller is also great to keep in contact with and will answer and of your questions. Oh and these brushes are quite dense if you were wondering... except I would say the flat top kabuki I expected it to be a little more denser but it still does the job. Anyways, thank you RC!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes for their variety of uses, softness &amp; NON-SHEDDING!!!  I have had a terrible time trying to find brushes that offer all of these qualities.  Very impressed!</li>
            <li> The hairs on the brush do not fall of which i love!!! I now have a powder brush, foundation brush and blush brush!! i love these four brushes!! :) DEFF A GOOD DEAL!</li>
            <li> Works fine, some shedding and I had to superglue the handles back on for a few of the brushes but it is okay.</li>
            <li> Second time i purchase , the first batch was bad these were better</li>
            <li> They were a gift for my daughter, she rated them 4 stars.</li>
            <li> She loves them and since shes a teenager, whom is almost impossible to please that is a relief!  I would highly recommend them to anyone</li>
            <li> These are very good quality brushes. Good stiffness. Very soft. And no shedding! Love these. Would buy them again. Planning on giving them as gifts. They seem very high quality for a great price!!</li>
            <li> I love them great brushes</li>
            <li> Excellent foundation brushes, but I also use for cream concealer, highlighter, and blushes.  Very very soft, and no shedding.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with these....you won&#x27;t find better brushes at this pricepoint.</li>
            <li> In love with this four piece set of brushes. It&#x27;s a must have complexion brush set for anyone to add to their brush collection. Soft yet dense enough to do the job right. I have two other sets similar to this set from other companies and these are basically dups for them but beyond cheaper in price. I ordered two sets of these and I&#x27;m glad I did. Get this set if you can.</li>
            <li> The brush head came off from handle of the brush. The hairs also come off more than expected. Okay for the price you pay if you want low grade brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes are well made soft and easy to clean. Very surprised at the quality for the price. I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased these brushes after reading some reviews, and I can honestly say I&#x27;m glad that I did. I&#x27;ve purchased other brushes offline and was really disappointed. So when I got these brushes I was more than impressed. The brushes are super soft and still dense. I didn&#x27;t have any problem with the brushes picking up product or anything. They didn&#x27;t have a strong smell from the packaging and the bristles weren&#x27;t bend or damaged in any way. Over all I would recommend these brushes. I&#x27;ve used them a few times and still haven&#x27;t changed my mind.</li>
            <li> These brushes are GREAT!!&lt;br /&gt;They were shipped the same day of purchase and literally came two days later! I am so glad that I purchased these brushes!&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the brushes can be compared to high end. They do have a hint of factory smell when you first get them, but just give them a wash and the smell will go away. There is very little fall out of the bristles when cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Buy these brushes and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely satisfied with my purchase! These brushes are well made and are a great bang for your buck. I have used each of these brushes and I am happy with all of them. Each brush is so soft! I especially love the stippling brush because it makes putting on my make up so effortless, and my liquid foundation looks flawless! Before using these brushes my make up looked ok (I used to use my fingers mostly to apply liquid foundation and sometimes a sponge that wasted so much of my foundation), and now I can honestly say my make up has never looked this great! This brush set is a great set to start out with or a great addition to any existing brush set you may have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the only problem I found with them is the strong permanent marker smell that they have. Good news is after washing the brushes and having them air out, the smell seems to fade in about a week or two. The smell isn&#x27;t unbearable, so don&#x27;t let that deter you from making this purchase :) I have had these for about  2 months and I have had no problems. Also, there is no shedding which is a major plus! I would highly recommend this product for those looking for high quality at a low price in foundation brushes/ powder brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Its been 4 months and the brushes are still going strong! LOVE THEM! Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy these, you will not be disappointed. I am now looking into buying their eye shadow brushes since I am so satisfied with this brands quality.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. They are deff the doupes for the sigma brushes. I use them almost every day. They do the job.</li>
            <li> These are gorgeous brushes. They are very soft but at the same time firm enough so your makeup goes on nicely. These are just as good as the other brand name brushes that you guys love to pay for. Dont get it twisted, most of the brushes are made in asia, they have offices in the US...but they are not made here. They stink like factory, so i shampooed them and no shedding occured. I will update you after a couple months.</li>
            <li> Love love...had a strong odor...but wash it and its fine.No shedding....same as sigma brushes....plz get&lt;br /&gt;Worth the buy....I think you&#x27;re getting as a steal..</li>
            <li> I was really wondering if I should buy these brushes or not, there were not very many reviews but I figured why not. Ended up receiving them SUPER fast and I was so excited, then I opened and I couldnt have been happier with the product. Absolutely amazing, the quality of these brushes is beyond what I could have ever expected. Not to mention using these brushes for liquid foundation they dont lie when they say it looks amazing. The brushes blend in the makeup so well, will be purchasing AGAIN and AGAIN !</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes because I needed some new face brushes. I had purchased the coastal scents brush set and I gave the face brushes in that set to my mom. I wanted brushes that were of equal quality to the coastal scents face brushes, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money. I came across these but I was a little skeptical. The shipping was very fast (which is a major PLUS). When I received them I was pleasantly surprised at how strong and durable they felt and looked. I was a little disappointed that it didn&#x27;t come in a case but it wasn&#x27;t a big deal. When I applied my make-up I was so impressed at how flawless the application was and how smooth it made my make-up look. The brushes are very dense which is a good thing because it gives me more control and it aids in making my make-up look smooth and flawless. The only thing I wouldn&#x27;t mind is if the brush size was a tad bit bigger. They&#x27;re not small but I like bigger sized brushes. Overall, I LOVE THEM!</li>
            <li> I have purchased many makeup brushes in the past.  I must admit these are the nicest by far!!  Do not let the economical price fool you, they are full, lush and exquisite brushes!  Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. They do tend to shed. Could be the way I wash them.  But so soft and dense. Packs on the product well.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes they work very well as a makeup artist you always want to find great quality brushes to use.</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes cause i wanted brushes that arent too expensive. i thought it was too good to be true and thses would be crappy brushes. But to my suprise these brushes were really good dense and soft and blended like a dream. However the only downfall it might be is the smell, it has a strong smell to these brushes never bothered me though. The quality of these brushes made up for it!</li>
            <li> I would suggest these brushes to anyone. These are completely comparable to Sigma at a fraction of the cost. Great in every way.</li>
            <li> They were good I especially liked the flat top and round top for foundation, the tapered one didn&#x27;t really work as good as i thought it would but it did a decent job I still had to go in with my finger after words and the angled on I love for contouring 😊</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re big fluffy brushes. They&#x27;re so soft, I like to pet them in my spare time. Just kidding, because that would be weird. They are however excellent brushes. They&#x27;re very dense, yet soft (I don&#x27;t pet them), so your makeup goes on smoothly. I have not experienced any shedding with these brushes. They did smell a little funky when they arrived, but you&#x27;re supposed to wash them before use anyway and that took care of any unwanted funkiness. All this and affordable too...I&#x27;ll take it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is actually my second set. I bought a backup. Unless there&#x27;s an emergency gift giving situation, then the backup may become a gift.</li>
            <li> This set is amazingly soft! My foundation comes out flawless everytime. I did have to wash the scent out but, hey, can&#x27;t beat the price.  Since, I&#x27;ve washed them a few times and they held well and dried fast. I would totally recommend this set. A wonderful substitute for sigma brushes. I will be ordering another set!</li>
            <li> These have become my everyday go to brushes.  They are perfect for foundation, concealer, blush...they are just perfect. Make sure to clean them before you use and let them dry fully.  The bristles are super soft, don&#x27;t shed, and fit my facial features like they were made just for me. My favorite of the four is the flat top.  You will get FLAWLESS application of foundation.  Check these brushes out, they&#x27;re great and really cheap.</li>
            <li> These are a great look a like to the sigma ones but did last the first use. The metal handle breaks away from the rest of the brush. Please invest in something else.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t go a day without using these brushes and they are so soft!</li>
            <li> Will buy again! They&#x27;ve really held up.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these brushes they leave my liquid foundation looking flawless and natural. Only one of them came loose whrn I washed them but that was my fault bc I let some water get in the ferrule but I let it dry and when dry I twisted the brush and pushes it down a bit and it was a good as new. I deff think they are worth their price bc im not willing to buy $24 brushes when I can get all four for this price.</li>
            <li> These are great brushes.  Ive had mine about 4 months and no loss of bristles, very soft, no problems.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> The brushes met my expectation, like them a lot. They are great for the price, the quality is fine you won&#x27;t regret buying them. The shipping was fast. At first the brushes smell like plastic but after washing them the smell went away. These brushes are perfect for beginner and come on for the fantastic price there is nothing to complaint about to even the smell(which goes away) I</li>
            <li> I have been using these every day since I got them. They work with a variety of products and produce a smooth finish on my skin. Great for contouring, blush, bronzer and foundation application.</li>
            <li> Love them, BUT the smell is bad i totally recommend them. I guess I&#x27;ll get over it.. Hope it helps(:</li>
            <li> they are a good dup for sigma makeup brushes for half the cost.&lt;br /&gt;they are great!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I used them as soon as i got them</li>
            <li> Wonderful quality for a sensational price! Very satisfied! Love to use them for bronzer and blush and for setting powder.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend if you are looking for some good foundation brushes, very good quality. They apply product very we&#x27;ll makes blending so much easier. Haven&#x27;t washed them so i can&#x27;t say about shedding but for the price they are amazing. All stars for product performance, quality of brushes and  fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Just as good as sigma!!! And way cheaper. I use these daily. Bit bulky that&#x27;s why I am giving 4and not 5 stars</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product. Great de the money but it&#x27;s not that soft as I expected. It takes a lil while to buff in the product.</li>
            <li> It took only 3 days to get my brushes! well now let me say I don&#x27;t own sigma brushes but this is my true thoughts as soon as I opened them I did notice a little shedding like  5 hairs on one of them and 2 or 3 on the others and I notice a smell ! to me not to strong but noticeable, after looking at them I washed them let them dry overnight after thy we&#x27;re  clean I did not see no shedding no hair on my face nothing at all  and by the way they are super soft nice if their a dupe for sigma it looks like it by the pics cause I don&#x27;t own any but I feel that they stand on their own even if it wasn&#x27;t a dupe they do the job their soft good prize!</li>
            <li> I took a risk on these brushes because, come on... kabuki brushes for 5 bucks? I figured, if they are terrible I only lost a few dollars. I didn&#x27;t at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are everything right now. My make up hasn&#x27;t looked this great, unless I was using the beauty blender. The brushes are definitely worth the money. Great quality, they are soft and I love the handles. They are perfection for blending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I purchased them, I did read that someone mentioned they smelled like sharpies, and the smelled didn&#x27;t go away after several washes. Well, they did come with that strong smell but I washed them with the beauty blender shampoo before use, and it did diminish the smell. As of today, there is no weird smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I can&#x27;t say enough about these. If you are a make up artist, or even a make up lover (and would know how to use these brushes), YOU NEED THESE IN YOUR LIFE, STAT! :)</li>
            <li> Very very soft bristles, would recommend to friends and family. They do have a strong permanent marker type smell but I know that will fade in time, not unbearable by any means.</li>
            <li> these brushes work great! they blend and pick up a great amount of product.&lt;br /&gt;the only minor thing i didn&#x27;t like was that the handles have a strong sharpie/marker smell but it went away in a week or so...&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend to everyone!!! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I was looking for affordable makeup brushes to try the kabuki ones, the quality of the bristles are amazing, they are dense and soft. If I didn&#x27;t put 5 stars in these brushes is because the first day I used it the handle came off, but I glued it with super glue and I haven&#x27;t have a problem ever since. If you are looking for great brushes for an amazing price you may want to purchase these.</li>
            <li> I love them they work really well</li>
            <li> These brushes are AMAZING!! They arrived very quickly and packaged well. They have an odd smell when you get them, but after a good wash or 2, the smell was gone. No shedding has occurred so far, and makeup goes on flawless. My makeup has NEVER looked better!! Very happy!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing! And for 15$ you can&#x27;t beat it! They are high end quality &amp; work amazing. I&#x27;ve been using them every single day &amp; my makeup application couldn&#x27;t get any better! I love RC cosmetics</li>
            <li> Soft and dense. Those are the key words for this set. No fallout either. I love them. No complaints. I have already used them with my concealer and liquid foundation and oddly enough at time I find I like using these brushes more than I like using my Beauty Blender. I feel like I get a smoother finish. It also helps me push in products around my wrinkle aroeas and i find I can&#x27;t really do that with sponges .</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes six months ago and I am still using them and enjoying them. They work great and evenly apply the products I use. The flat brushes glue is a little lose now, but that is probably because I use it the most and I wash my brushes every two weeks. I would recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes and for the prices they are incredibly amazing, they come with no brushes bag which is terrible and they had  a permanent marker smell, I had to wash them like 3 times and after that the smell sorta went away but I like them eitherway, they apply makeup really nicely!</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of kabuki brushes. I fell in love with the flat top kabuki brushes because they&#x27;re so versatile and it&#x27;s a dream to apply liquid and cream foundations with them. However, the ones I&#x27;ve owned in the past shed badly and cost a lot. I&#x27;m glad I came across Royal Care Cosmetics kabuki brush set. I love how each brush is shaped differently. I&#x27;ve only used the flat top kabuki one but it applied my liquid foundation smoothly and flawlessly. The brushes are incredibly SOFT and feathery to the touch. I ordered three sets and I&#x27;ll be keeping them. I plan on ordering more and distributing them to the people in my area who don&#x27;t have access to them but would love to own a set of quality kabuki brushes. It does have a permanent marker scent but after a few washes it&#x27;ll fade, it&#x27;s still worth it and much better than some brand name brushes I&#x27;ve owned in the past that shed terribly and weren&#x27;t up to the hype considering its rather grand price.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order these, I figured that for the price it wasn&#x27;t going to be good as far as quality was concerned. I was proven wrong. These brushes are soft yet dense and apply foundation/powder beautifully. The only downfall is the horrible smell they carry when you first open the package, but that quickly goes away once you wash the brushes. I am extremely pleased with this purchase and will definitely order from RC again.</li>
            <li> These are AMAZING. They are well made, soft but dense, easy to clean and blend in my face products beautifully. Great for liquid or powder products. I have used these every day since I bought them, and I am already thinking I will buy a back up set. I especially love the pointed tip brush, its excellent for setting under eye concealer. These came SUPER FAST, it was supposed to be 5 days before they delivered but they were at my house in 2 days. I am in love with these brushes, I also bought the 4 piece face set which are equally as awesome.</li>
            <li> I love them! They are affordable and super soft!!!! I would recommend these brushes to anyone starting out in make up!</li>
            <li> This brushes are really good! just had to wash them really good a couple of times, they have a funky smell. But after that they are amazing! Great applying foundation and concealer, I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Brushes are nice but two of my handles completely broke before I even used them:( won&#x27;t purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li> they do have a permanent marker odor but that fades after the first wash. Love every single brush and no shedding! yay! :)</li>
            <li> I love my sigma f80 kabuki and many reviews said it&#x27;s exactly the same. It&#x27;s not as dense and it constantly sheds. The hairs that are falling out stab you and it&#x27;s very uncomfortable. And the pointed brush hairs feel very plastic and stiff. It gets the job done but expect major shedding.</li>
            <li> poorly made brushes :(</li>
            <li> I bought this product and was very pleased. Very soft and it works for me. I will buy this product more often.</li>
            <li> I just purchased a 2nd set of these brushes and 3 additional sets from the actual royal care site. I love the product and the brushes feel amazing. I would recommend these brushes to everyone.</li>
