    <ol>
            <li> This is the second Pendant I have ordered.  I bought this one cause I was looking for an angel.  I will have to say, the scent from the Essential Oil comes out more.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE this.</li>
            <li> I love my necklace. I plan to buy a few more for my love ones. It came with the incerts and i love that. Ive seen this necklace a few other places but this one was the cheapest ive seen it and the only on i seen with incerts can&#x27;t wait to do business again. My necklace came in three days</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 14 yr old Grand-daughter. She&#x27;s loves it..</li>
            <li> Loved the aroma therapy necklace/.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful diffuser, unfortunately it only has two holes so you can&#x27;t smell it unless you put it close to your nose. You also have to take the pendent off of the chain in order to add oil to it. It looks very nice though and I have gotten many compliments on the look. The chain is a nice, sturdy chain and overall the entire necklace feels sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made. Waited too long to return, not able to get refund. Stuck with useless item that I will never use  :-(</li>
            <li> The way this item is made the pad falls out within minutes. How can it be aromatherapy if there is no aroma. And watch who you buy it from, I returned it since it does not work. They refused to give me a refund and to send the product back to me. So I&#x27;m just out the money. Terrible product.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. Good value. Never disappointed with this company&#x27;s products!</li>
            <li> This necklace is perfect for diffusing!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful little necklace/diffuser.  The quality is good, chain is very adequate and sturdy.  Like the way it opens where you must take the chain off.  No chance of it coming open accidentally and losing the pad inside that holds the oils.  Pretty, stylish, and worth the money.</li>
            <li> Big and bulky. The small scent oafs fall out. You have to take the chain off daily to add a scent</li>
            <li> Gave this to my daughter as a present she loves it!</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser necklace.  Priced right and I never leave home without it.  It is a little tricky to fill with essential oils you have to take the pendant off of the chain and slide the back and front out to apply the oils.  I love it but I thought I would throw that in.</li>
            <li> Love these diffuser pendant&#x27;s. I bought them for my daughters for Christmas and they wear them daily. I have bought ones previously that did not stay closed and the pad would fall out of - these do not have that problem. High quality and look great too.</li>
            <li> It arrived in 7 days. It was a gift for my daughter, however I would love to keep it for myself. I love the fact that you must remove the chain to load your pads into the chamber. You can add the oils through the small hole if you have a small dropper as I do. That way one is not losing the pads. The quality is fantastic for the price. Thank you so much. I will be buying more of them as gifts. The only thing it doesn&#x27;t have any oils to get one started. Not all of people I would love to give as a gift doesn&#x27;t used essential oils.</li>
            <li> The chain broke after 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the Diffuser Pendant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not looking for a replacement chain so I can wear it again.</li>
            <li> Nice, has a antiquist look to it.works great!</li>
            <li> The pendant is wonderful, but i was alergic to the necklace when sweating</li>
            <li> Very nice, good quality.  I bought 4 for gifts and they were a hit!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and was as described. I bought 3. On for me and 2 friends. I have been pretty stressed and having my oils around my neck to take a big whiff when needed is a big help</li>
            <li> Very nice - not big enough for most crystals though - great for aromatherapy.</li>
            <li> I wear this every day with my favorite essential oil.  People ask me where I got it all the time and think that I paid a lot of money for it.</li>
