            <li>Awesome product.  </li>
            <li>I bought these for my boyfriend and he loved them!</li>
            <li>Worked great.  </li>
            <li>Lathers very nice.</li>
            <li>Holds in the soap great, lathes great and has a good lock to keep the soap in.</li>
            <li>Well built, great quality, nice colors.</li>
            <li>Feels good on skin.</li>
            <li>I have always used an exfoliating scrubber, but my husband loved this exfoliating scrubber.</li>
            <li>They stand the test of time, close well, feel good, and lather up quite nicely.  </li>
            <li>I have so many nice soaps but never get to use them  </li>
            <li>I should have asked for better description.</li>
            <li>I like that you can close the top of this broker so that nothing can fall out.  </li>
            <li>Was considering soap-on-a-rope, but we have a favorite soap bar or two, so this was the solution.</li>
            <li>Maybe another soap would work better</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for, at a good price</li>
            <li>Wow it works great.</li>
            <li>They were cheap, so I probably wont return them.</li>
            <li>When I saw these on Amazon, I was so excited to order these for him.</li>
            <li>These are certainly worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li>I now get to use my nice soaps and takes the same amount of time in the shower</li>
            <li>These are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the yellow</li>
            <li>the texture is too soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Great scrubby feeling, but too harsh on my skin, wish there was a soft version of this.</li>
            <li>Also, if you buy these, be aware that it&#x27;s kind of rough on certain sensitive parts of the body, whether your a man or a woman.</li>
            <li>One day someone will start making the net &amp;#34;poufs&amp;#34; with an elastic closure, but in the meantime this works fine.</li>
            <li>Bar soap is much cheaper and lasts longer..</li>
            <li>These scrubbers are very well made and do a descent job at exfoliating.</li>
            <li>lathers fast</li>
            <li>I use it with Ivory soap and it doesn&#x27;t suds up very well.</li>
            <li>Mainly, because he is the one to use the soap scraps.</li>
            <li>One thing, before you hang on a hook, make sure the knot on the rope is tight.</li>
            <li>When I used one for the first time the closure string unraveled almost immediately, but it didn&#x27;t really affect the performance, just made the string like 5 feet long.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t love the fact that they are so tightly woven that it takes a little more work to get the foam going, but the tighter weave means they will probably last longer, so</li>
            <li>They are able to hold a small to medium sized bar of soap.</li>
            <li>Inside the pouch was too much of the material tied off, didn&#x27;t leave enough room for soap.  </li>
            <li>He loves the idea of this scrubber, but it should last much longer.</li>
            <li>My only gripe is I wish it was a little larger in size but for the price not bad.</li>
            <li>I have been using these scrubbers for the last 3 months, and they barely show any wear and tear.</li>
            <li>This works great for all those little soaps that U really can&#x27;t use but u hate to throw away.</li>

            <li> Smaller pouch than expected</li>
            <li> Smaller than other versions of Scrubbing Pouches.  </li>
            <li> Just as expected and what I wanted</li>
            <li> I bought these a few weeks ago and a week later it was falling apart.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other brands before.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a single complaint about them and these are the scrubbers I&#x27;ll stick to and recommend for as long as I can get my hands on them.</li>
            <li> I bought a couple of these a few years ago from Wal-Mart and they lasted forever.</li>
            <li> Once it gets wet its very slick.</li>
            <li> String used for closing was the wrong type of fabric, would not shut properly, soap continually fell out while bathing.</li>
            <li> If they have one flaw, it&#x27;s that they are too small.</li>
            <li> Well, I guess I am complaining, but hopefully the complaint is offset by the longevity factor.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the string that holds it closed fell apart after 2 - 3 uses.</li>
            <li> Way too thick.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get the soap to even come through its so thick.</li>
            <li> Fabric too thick.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m in the shower I hate taking the extra time to lather it on a wash cloth.</li>
            <li> Came apart after 3 uses. :(</li>
            <li> I hate the Knot in the bottom.</li>
            <li> And I hate using wash cloths</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like those soaps with all the nasty chemicals and fragrances.</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED!</li>

            <li> Exactly what I was looking for, at a good price</li>
            <li> These scrubbers do the job quite well for the inexpensive nature of them.  They stand the test of time, close well, feel good, and lather up quite nicely.  I don&#x27;t have a single complaint about them and these are the scrubbers I&#x27;ll stick to and recommend for as long as I can get my hands on them.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my boyfriend and he loved them!</li>
            <li> Came apart after 3 uses. :(</li>
            <li> Worked great.  Just as expected and what I wanted</li>
            <li> I should have asked for better description.</li>
            <li> Way too thick.  I can&#x27;t get the soap to even come through its so thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to put some stitching into these to make them last -- just like the ones I bought before.  One day someone will start making the net &amp;#34;poufs&amp;#34; with an elastic closure, but in the meantime this works fine.</li>
            <li> I hate the Knot in the bottom. I bought 4 of them and will not use them. They were cheap, so I probably wont return them.</li>
            <li> I bought a couple of these a few years ago from Wal-Mart and they lasted forever. I bought these a few weeks ago and a week later it was falling apart. I found a different brand at CVS so I&#x27;ll stick with those from now on.</li>
            <li> The drawstring to mine scrubber broke within days. Not the greatest product I&#x27;ve ever used...</li>
            <li> I like using these pouches rather than buying liquid soap. Bar soap is much cheaper and lasts longer.. Also scrubbing with these pouches make me feel cleaner. One thing, before you hang on a hook, make sure the knot on the rope is tight. You may even want to double knot it.</li>
            <li> Smaller than other versions of Scrubbing Pouches.  Inside the pouch was too much of the material tied off, didn&#x27;t leave enough room for soap.  String used for closing was the wrong type of fabric, would not shut properly, soap continually fell out while bathing.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I was looking for. If they have one flaw, it&#x27;s that they are too small. They should be 50-100% larger.</li>
            <li> I like these scrubber pouches a lot. I&#x27;ve bought other brands before. I don&#x27;t love the yellow and I don&#x27;t love the fact that they are so tightly woven that it takes a little more work to get the foam going, but the tighter weave means they will probably last longer, so I&#x27;m not complaining. Well, I guess I am complaining, but hopefully the complaint is offset by the longevity factor. When I used one for the first time the closure string unraveled almost immediately, but it didn&#x27;t really affect the performance, just made the string like 5 feet long. These are certainly worth the price I paid. Wish they came in white.</li>
            <li> Smaller pouch than expected</li>
            <li> These scrubbers are very well made and do a descent job at exfoliating. They are able to hold a small to medium sized bar of soap. You can put a larger bar of soap in them, but it will be a tight fit and you might have a hard time lathering it up. I have been using these scrubbers for the last 3 months, and they barely show any wear and tear. I would definitely consider buying these pouches again in the future!</li>
            <li> Great scrubby feeling, but too harsh on my skin, wish there was a soft version of this.</li>
            <li> Holds in the soap great, lathes great and has a good lock to keep the soap in. You can leave the soap in the bag too without getting mushy.</li>
            <li> Fabric too thick. Soap never dries</li>
            <li> Just what I&#x27;ve been looking for. I have so many nice soaps but never get to use them  When I&#x27;m in the shower I hate taking the extra time to lather it on a wash cloth. And I hate using wash cloths I like using the scunchie ball putting some shower gel on it and be done in no time. Well when I came across these I thought for the price it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try it.  Wow it works great. I now get to use my nice soaps and takes the same amount of time in the shower lathers fast an is the same material as the scunchie balls. My only gripe is I wish it was a little larger in size but for the price not bad.</li>
            <li> These are some of the best bar soap scrubbers. I like that you can close the top of this broker so that nothing can fall out.  I will definitely keep ordering this item.</li>
            <li> This works great for all those little soaps that U really can&#x27;t use but u hate to throw away.</li>
            <li> Well built, great quality, nice colors. Lathers very nice. Feels good on skin.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for the person who keeps dropping soap in the shower or while bathing.  Awesome product.  Was considering soap-on-a-rope, but we have a favorite soap bar or two, so this was the solution.</li>
            <li> I use it with Ivory soap and it doesn&#x27;t suds up very well. Maybe another soap would work better but I don&#x27;t like those soaps with all the nasty chemicals and fragrances. Also, if you buy these, be aware that it&#x27;s kind of rough on certain sensitive parts of the body, whether your a man or a woman. It&#x27;s something akin to rubbing brillo on those areas and you will feel it later in the day.</li>
            <li> I found one of these at a garage sale and bought it for my husband. Mainly, because he is the one to use the soap scraps. I have always used an exfoliating scrubber, but my husband loved this exfoliating scrubber. His eventually wore out. When I saw these on Amazon, I was so excited to order these for him. Unfortunately, the string that holds it closed fell apart after 2 - 3 uses. He loves the idea of this scrubber, but it should last much longer.</li>
            <li> No this did not meet my or my husbands expectations. It does not Exfoliate anything. the texture is too soft and smooth. Once it gets wet its very slick. It won&#x27;t even an itch. VERY DISAPPOINTED!</li>
