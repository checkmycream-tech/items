            <li>Great item but be warned that seller ships via USPS and required signature in person for delivery.  </li>
            <li>Great product, thank you.</li>
            <li>Good product as described.</li>
            <li>Good value for the price.</li>
            <li>I love these!  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it.  </li>
            <li>Comes in assorted colors that make make-up sessions more pleasurable.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>There are better ones out there</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re OK, kinda like the ones in the stores, you need them to hold in your fingers.</li>
            <li>The longer applicator handles help apply the shadow more consistently and with good control..</li>
            <li>Perfect for me, I don&#x27;t like the little ones that come with most eyeshadow and they are easy to find with the colored ends.</li>
            <li>they break really easily...</li>
            <li>These eye shadow brushes feel fantastic when rubbing against my skin.</li>
            <li>These pick up shadow well, apply it smoothly, and don&#x27;t disintegrate and crumble.  </li>
            <li>its really cheap and working wellll.....</li>
            <li>These are soft and do a good job.  </li>
            <li>These are very cheap but they are exactly that, cheap.</li>
            <li>Goes on super smooth and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyelid</li>
            <li>They look cheap but they are working fine so far.</li>
            <li>They are too long to fit in most compacts.</li>
            <li>Spreads eye shadow pretty well.</li>
            <li>When I first bought them,  they were over $7 for the package.</li>
            <li>However, within a week of using the first applicator from this pack, the tip became separated from the handle.</li>
            <li>that will actually last more than one or 2 uses.</li>
            <li>At that price, I would be willing to buy another package and look at them more as long term disposable applicators.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame that this keeps happening because I do like everything else about them, but they really should last more than a week each.</li>
            <li>These are really nice and long enough, only problem is the sponge tips come off to easy.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re perfect - long enough so you&#x27;re not struggling with the teeny tiny applicators that come with your eyeshadow and cheap enough that I can buy a bunch to use with any and all different colors I might want to use.  </li>
            <li>These are ok but don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>Which for me was on the first and second use.</li>
            <li>A lot of applicators have cheap sponges that are dry and rough.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected</li>

            <li> Great item but be warned that seller ships via USPS and required signature in person for delivery.  Excessive and inconvenient!</li>
            <li> These eye shadow brushes feel fantastic when rubbing against my skin. It&#x27;s a ticklish situation that makes me extend my make-up sessions sometimes.</li>
            <li> just what I needed for powder eye shadow application!!...better than great!</li>
            <li> The longer applicator handles help apply the shadow more consistently and with good control..</li>

            <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> These pick up shadow well, apply it smoothly, and don&#x27;t disintegrate and crumble.  They are sturdy too.  A lot of applicators have cheap sponges that are dry and rough.  These are soft and do a good job.  Recommend.</li>
            <li> Good product as described. Good value for the price. I will definitely order again. But it. You&#x27;ll love it.  I do.</li>
            <li> Spreads eye shadow pretty well. Comes in assorted colors that make make-up sessions more pleasurable.</li>
            <li> they break really easily...the sponge just falls out.</li>
            <li> I love these!  They&#x27;re perfect - long enough so you&#x27;re not struggling with the teeny tiny applicators that come with your eyeshadow and cheap enough that I can buy a bunch to use with any and all different colors I might want to use.  Apply color evenly too.</li>
            <li> Perfect for me, I don&#x27;t like the little ones that come with most eyeshadow and they are easy to find with the colored ends.</li>
            <li> These are ok but don&#x27;t last very long. I was a little disappointed given the price - was hoping for something a little sturdier than dollar stare applicators. They do the job but are overpriced in my opinion.</li>
            <li> These are awesome.  I love them.</li>
            <li> i loveeeeee it .... its really cheap and working wellll.....</li>
            <li> They do work well. Until they fall apart.  Which for me was on the first and second use. When I first bought them,  they were over $7 for the package. Currently they have dropped to $4. At that price, I would be willing to buy another package and look at them more as long term disposable applicators.</li>
            <li> I like the color and length of these applicators as well as the texture of the applicator tip. However, within a week of using the first applicator from this pack, the tip became separated from the handle. I thought maybe it was just a defect, but the same thing happened with the second one a week later. It&#x27;s a shame that this keeps happening because I do like everything else about them, but they really should last more than a week each.</li>
            <li> Goes on super smooth and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyelid</li>
            <li> Great product, thank you.</li>
            <li> These are very cheap but they are exactly that, cheap. One broke after one use....the sponge part came off from the brush and I couldn&#x27;t put it back, so I just trashed it. I don&#x27;t recommend these brushes. There are better ones out there that will actually last more than one or 2 uses. I shouldn&#x27;t have to superglue a product I just bought after only using it once....</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re OK, kinda like the ones in the stores, you need them to hold in your fingers.</li>
