            <li>The outer, thicker, plastic bag packaging is resealable and nicely contains the mango butter which is in another baggie.</li>
            <li>The packaging was nice, but I wish they could produce it in 1 pound blocks instead of placing chunks into plastic bags because it gets stuck on the bags</li>
            <li>Nice butter to use in body butters.</li>
            <li>and I am loving this mango butter.  </li>
            <li>and I thought they were all really nice.  </li>

            <li>and I love the way it&#x27;s packaged.</li>
            <li>Pleased with product.  </li>
            <li>No scent, melts easily.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to find another butter that was softer than shea but also didn&#x27;t have as strong of a scent as cocoa butter</li>
            <li>This brand is really nice, the entire product looks flawless - very smooth, same color consistency...  </li>
            <li>It arrived chunky in the bag, which is fine by me.</li>
            <li>I got it to mix with other stuff to make a butter, but it is nice on its own!  </li>
            <li>It rubs on so smooth.</li>
            <li>I put some on my lips and it felt like the nicest smooth lip balm, it didn&#x27;t feel like an oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I enjoy putting it on my face at night.</li>
            <li>Loved how soft this butter was.</li>
            <li>This Mango Butter is far superior to the brands I&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
            <li>I purchased the raw mango butter to make body butter; it&#x27; absolutely wonderful!!!!</li>
            <li>a repeat customer I can safely say that their product has always been consistent and has never given me</li>
            <li>and it melted cleanly when I made lotion today.  </li>
            <li>Great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I use it to make body butter and it feels amazing on your skin.. soft and silky!</li>
            <li>I liked that the mango butter has a barely there scent as it did not deter from the fragrance oil added to the whipped body butter that I made.</li>
            <li>Hair and body soft and smooth, no chemicals!  </li>
            <li>Zero smell melts nicely and takes on an essential oil.</li>
            <li>Definitely the real deal and you get a good amount for the price.</li>
            <li>Great stiff.</li>
            <li>White and no scent so very easy to incorparate in my cosmetic products.</li>
            <li>Smooth and refreshing on my dry, northern skin!</li>
            <li>This was my first time to try Mango Butter</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very excited to incorporate this into my next batch of body butter.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pliable rich soft textured mango butter</li>
            <li>Wish I could get a bigger size :) very moisturizing in my body butters.</li>
            <li>What I love the most about this butter is if l use it just straight it feels like a thick cream on my skin rather than a melted oil.  </li>
            <li>However, it melts back to an easily spreadable lotion when warmed in the hands in just seconds.  </li>
            <li>Had to melt it down with high temp but it feel really nice melted with carrier oils.</li>
            <li>Price is reasonable for quantity received and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>But this brand really had a smoother consistency.  </li>
            <li>Took about 10 minutes to whip into a nice fluffy consistency in a blender.  </li>
            <li>and this will be my new go to butter!</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend this mango butter from this company.</li>
            <li>Wow!!  </li>

            <li>I purchased this product and shea butter and this product far exceeds the feel of shea butter on the skin.</li>
            <li>Soft and can use as is.  </li>
            <li>but isn&#x27;t as soft as shea butter.  </li>
            <li>Melted them together in a double boiler (a stainless steel mixing bowl over a pot of boiling water)</li>
            <li>I then added 7 drops (I don&#x27;t like much fragrance) of tea tree essential oil and blended it with a hand mixer for about 4 minutes until it turned creamy.  </li>
            <li>I have used for facial moisturizer and as a main ingredient for homemade deodorant.</li>
            <li>When mango butter is mixed with essential and carrier oils it changes in texture but not by much.</li>
            <li>As expected, fast shipping</li>

            <li> and my skin actually soaks it in rather than just feeling greasy a few hours later.</li>
            <li> I have ordered a few different mango butters</li>
            <li> If melting down using the double broiler method if can take a bit of time to melt down depending on quantity that is being used.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use it in other products.</li>
            <li> It did not seem to have a scent at all, although I would not mind if it smelled a little like mangos.  </li>
            <li> Keeps the skin lubed without a greasy mess!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t expect it to be hard.</li>
            <li> Mango butter is a hard butter that isn&#x27;t any where as hard as coco butter</li>
            <li> but it is hard as a rock.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a bit unappealing.</li>

            <li> This arrived today and I used it to make homemade lip balm with my kids. This product is  lovely and velvety The outer, thicker, plastic bag packaging is resealable and nicely contains the mango butter which is in another baggie. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t expect it to be hard. Worked well after mixing with oils.</li>
            <li> Feels amazing on the skin... I combined this with Shea butter and cocoa butter for my skin mix and it feels amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Mango Butter. I&#x27;ve ordered it a few times, as I go through it fast. Wish I could get a bigger size :) very moisturizing in my body butters. Love it!</li>
            <li> Great stiff. Keeps the skin lubed without a greasy mess!!</li>
            <li> Loved how soft this butter was. Will order from seller again.</li>
            <li> Great amount for the price. Will be using this in home made skincare products.</li>
            <li> Very nice mango butter.  I will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> The quality of this product is great. It rubs on so smooth. I purchased this product and shea butter and this product far exceeds the feel of shea butter on the skin. I rub it on my skin like 5 times in one day just because it felt so good. It feels almost silky. The packaging was nice, but I wish they could produce it in 1 pound blocks instead of placing chunks into plastic bags because it gets stuck on the bags and it&#x27;s a bit unappealing. Nonetheless, the product was great and it measured exactly 1 pound. When I run out, I will order again and hopefully the quality will be the same.</li>

            <li> Arrived on time.  Nice butter to use in body butters.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality mango butter!  I recently purchased shea and cocoa butter to make homemade body butters and I wanted to find another butter that was softer than shea but also didn&#x27;t have as strong of a scent as cocoa butter and I am loving this mango butter.  It did not seem to have a scent at all, although I would not mind if it smelled a little like mangos.

            <li> Perfect for homemade body butter</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! Whips up nicely, melts easily and solidifies with no problem. Works great in my lotions I make or alone. I enjoy putting it on my face at night. It is somewhat oily at night, but when I wake up in the morning my face looks and feels great!</li>

            <li> Mango butter is to be used in cosmetic products. I bought mine to whip into body and hair  butters. This is a staple in my butters. When mango butter is mixed with essential and carrier oils it changes in texture but not by much. My butter arrived in tact and looked like a brick that was very easy to utilize.  I didn&#x27;t have to melt or place into another jar for storage like I did with another companies mango butter.  Price is reasonable for quantity received and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 1/2/2016&lt;br /&gt;As a repeat customer I can safely say that their product has always been consistent and has never given me problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Mango butter is a cosmetic product and should only be used in skin and hair care&lt;br /&gt;- Mango butter is a hard butter that isn&#x27;t any where as hard as coco butter but isn&#x27;t as soft as shea butter.  It has a middle ground in that it&#x27;s hard but same time sort of soft when squeezing it in the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;- If melting down using the double broiler method if can take a bit of time to melt down depending on quantity that is being used.&lt;br /&gt;- Onbeauty the company that produces this butter has information regarding the use of mango butter on their packaging.&lt;br /&gt;- Mango butter has at least a year&#x27;s worth of shelf life&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great buy and I highly recommend this mango butter from this company.</li>
            <li> Great product! I have used for facial moisturizer and as a main ingredient for homemade deodorant. It makes my face feel wonderful and my skin actually soaks it in rather than just feeling greasy a few hours later. No scent, melts easily. Would def recommend.</li>
            <li> Pure creamy white, mixes well in homemade lotions.  No offensive odors.  Absorbs well.</li>
            <li> I have ordered a few different mango butters and I thought they were all really nice.  I use them in daily hair and body creams.  But this brand really had a smoother consistency.  I whipped it with an immersion blender with coconut oil, almond oil, vit E oil and fragrance.  LOVE IT.  Hair and body soft and smooth, no chemicals!  I will make sure I get this brand again!!</li>
            <li> Perfect. Not grainy, mixed well with oils. Very good product.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT, WEIGHED AS DESCRIBED, GOES ON SMOOTH. CANT WAIT TO TRY IN MY RECIPES!</li>
            <li> This mango butter is perfect and silky smooth! I use it to make body butters and it feels wonderful. It&#x27;s a good price and delivery was on time.</li>
            <li> Beautifully white. Zero smell melts nicely and takes on an essential oil. It arrived chunky in the bag, which is fine by me. I recieved one pound. Smooth and refreshing on my dry, northern skin! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I like it but it is hard as a rock. Had to melt it down with high temp but it feel really nice melted with carrier oils. Will check to see if there are any better brands.</li>
            <li> Love this butter, awesome for lotions, exactly as pictured and what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I purchased the raw mango butter to make body butter; it&#x27; absolutely wonderful!!!! It&#x27;s a must have. Can&#x27;t wait to use it in other products.</li>
            <li> Great Product!! Love this mango butter. Very light and non oily. I liked that the mango butter has a barely there scent as it did not deter from the fragrance oil added to the whipped body butter that I made. Did not have to melt this before using. Took about 10 minutes to whip into a nice fluffy consistency in a blender.  I will be ordering a larger size on my next purchase.</li>
            <li> Great butter! Love it!</li>
            <li> This was my first time to try Mango Butter and I&#x27;m impressed.  This has virtually no fragrance and it melted cleanly when I made lotion today.  I used a very simple recipe of 1/2 cup mango butter and 1 Tbsp each of Avocado oil and Apricot oil.  Melted them together in a double boiler (a stainless steel mixing bowl over a pot of boiling water) then cooled the mixture in the refrigerator until it set and turned translucent.  I then added 7 drops (I don&#x27;t like much fragrance) of tea tree essential oil and blended it with a hand mixer for about 4 minutes until it turned creamy.  Pour it in to a jar and it will set up to a firmer consistency.  However, it melts back to an easily spreadable lotion when warmed in the hands in just seconds.  Great stuff!!  I&#x27;m delighted with how moisturizing it feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m allergic to shea butter and this will be my new go to butter!</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin. I love how it softens as you rub it between your hands. Definitely the real deal and you get a good amount for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using mango butter for years. What I didn&#x27;t realize is that theres a big a difference in quality. This Mango Butter is far superior to the brands I&#x27;ve used for years. It&#x27;s a pliable rich soft textured mango butter and I love the way it&#x27;s packaged.</li>
            <li> Pleased with product.  Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great product. White and no scent so very easy to incorparate in my cosmetic products.</li>
