    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I would have given it 5 stars if it was overpriced but still perfect, but</li>
            <li>I want to get these for gifts they were so great!</li>
            <li>Perfect for what it&#x27;s used for.</li>
            <li>Great for cleaning my brushes!  </li>
            <li>It also reshapes the brushes for perfect drying.</li>
            <li>Loved it!!!</li>
            <li>Absolutely wonderful product!</li>
            <li>but mine had already been ordered when I stumbled upon the video - he said it best - it&#x27;s an overpriced oven mitt!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I love this mitt/glove!!!</li>
            <li>I just purchased this glove and am so happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>but I was hoping that for $40.00 it would be something wonderful and amazing.  </li>
            <li>My foundation brush has never been so happy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>A good investment for someone already investing in pricey brushes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as good as the beauty mags claim.</li>
            <li>My brushes are happy, I&#x27;m happy, my make up applies great with clean brushes.  </li>
            <li>I love the brand!</li>
            <li>It cleans soooo much better than just using soap alone!</li>
            <li>Also is very effective in getting my brushes squeaky clean!</li>
            <li>BUT it all depends on what kind of product you use with that brush (liquid, cream or powder).  </li>
            <li>It makes cleaning your brushes easy and convenient, not a chore anymore!</li>
            <li>I use a range of brush brands but have mostly sigma.</li>
            <li>While the idea is ingenious, it is over priced.</li>
            <li>Cleans my brushes better than they have ever been cleaned before.</li>
            <li>I felt I could have done a better job with my hands for those types.</li>
            <li>LOVE these,  </li>
            <li>Essentially okay</li>
            <li>Sure, it squeezes out the excess water</li>
            <li>and there is nothing better to clean your brushes!</li>
            <li>Now I won&#x27;t dread when it&#x27;s time to clean my brushes. :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use</li>
            <li>and I can comfortably fit both of my hands in the glove.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was able to get this at a discounted price that I felt was much more reasonable than the MSRP, so I can&#x27;t complain about the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anyway, the main thing that I love about it is that you can say goodbye to prune-y hands forever!  </li>
            <li>Works fine to clean the brushes but still think is too pricey.</li>
            <li>This product makes cleaning makeup brushes super easy.</li>
            <li>but I feel still worth the money!</li>
            <li>but when I do it seems to take me forever to get them clean.  </li>
            <li>The little nodules on the glove are nice for getting out the product from your brushes and giving you a slightly better clean.  </li>
            <li>I am able to clean all of my brushes extremely fast and they come out almost brand new!</li>
            <li>I tried the DIY your own makeup cleaning glove projects and even purchased one of those facial cleaning rubber things to avoid buying this.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>you do NOT need to spend this kind of money for a big, bulky albatross on your ...hand!</li>
            <li>My brushes clean up really nice &amp; don&#x27;t loose their shape.</li>
            <li>This helps me clean my brushes much faster and easier.</li>
            <li>I thought the idea was awesome, but the price made me angry at Sigma.</li>
            <li>you can wash more than brush at the same time.</li>
            <li>It took nearly 30 minutes to clean them</li>
            <li>It makes cleaning my brushes a little more fun.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Got what I expected :)</li>
            <li>The glove helps get my brushes so much cleaner in a shorter time.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really shape it very well.  </li>
            <li>but I just don&#x27;t find it very effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li>negative is that I didn&#x27;t feel like the glove did a good job of cleaning my denser kabuki face brushes.</li>
            <li>and it has transformed the way I clean my brushed but</li>
            <li>You live and learn!</li>
            <li>I would love to see them make it in different sizes for smaller people.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to help you in your upkeep and cleanliness of your makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend tis to everyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>They make the whole process tolerable when you have a brush collection spanning 20+ yrs of professional.  </li>
            <li>still think it is cool and would recommend it for those willing to pay for a little help with cleaning their makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>Gets everything like new again.</li>
            <li>WORKS WONDERFULLY and Sigma&#x27;s exorbitantly priced gadget is left in a box under the sink now because I have MUCH LESS cumbersome items that not only cost a few bucks, but work equally well.&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
            <li>but I think it takes just about as much time to do it the traditional way than with this glove.  </li>
            <li>While before I used to dread the process, now I get a little excited about using this glove.</li>
            <li>Quickly cleanse my brushes, and cuts my time in half.</li>
            <li>Again, the nodules on the glove do help a bit with getting that grime out of the inner portion of the brushes but I don&#x27;t know that I would recommend people go out and spend this kind of money on something so silly.  </li>
            <li>Really cuts down on brush cleaning.</li>
            <li>I know some people bash this cleaning glove because it&#x27;s either pricey or doesn&#x27;t really cut down cleaning</li>

            <li> /&gt;CON:&lt;br /&gt;The only minor thing about this is the brush is the &amp;#34;shaping&amp;#34; area between the thumb and forefinger area of this glove.</li>
            <li> It took a long time to get all of the product out that had gotten in close to the ferrule.</li>
            <li> It also helps my dry hands from suffering under the water and soap for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t necessarily think that it cut down on my cleaning time.  </li>
            <li> put some baby shampoo on the glove, swish slightly wet brushes on the glove, rinsed it out, squeeze and dry.</li>
            <li> However, I think the several different textures for &#x27;depth of cleanliness&#x27; is pretty gimmicky and silly.  </li>
            <li> OK, this looks silly and unnecessary, but I tell you: if you have hundreds of brushes to wash at the same time, this is sent from the heavens!</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s not like I use them on other people.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t cut down cleaning time</li>
            <li> This glove does everything it is supposed to do in half the time.</li>
            <li> I literally cleaned my brushes in half the time.</li>
            <li> I was even sent this little half egg looking brush cleaner from a subscriber/viewer</li>
            <li> I waste less cleaning solution using this glove.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I still have to shape it a little bit.</li>
            <li> For comparison purposes - I purchased a few knock offs from diff.</li>
            <li> I have small hands</li>
            <li> Cuts my brush washing in half!!</li>
            <li> Because it is so oversized on me it can be difficult to use a little bit.</li>
            <li> using the backside of the glove is a little awkward and the glove does not always stay on.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a game changer.</li>
            <li> I feel this produce was Too expensive</li>
            <li> They were really dirty this time</li>
            <li> I hate cleaning my brushes</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A good investment for someone already investing in pricey brushes. I use a range of brush brands but have mostly sigma. This helps me clean my brushes much faster and easier. It also helps my dry hands from suffering under the water and soap for a long period of time. It makes cleaning my brushes a little more fun. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Its like an oven mitt. It includes a cloth glove inside the rubber glove. Works fine to clean the brushes but still think is too pricey. I would pay $10-$15 instead.</li>
            <li> I feel this produce was Too expensive but I feel still worth the money! Cuts my brush washing in half!! I love the brand! And I will continue to buy their products from amazon because I have amazon prime and don&#x27;t pay for shipping and on their website you have to pay for shipping!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an overpriced rubber glove, but it does what it says it&#x27;s supposed to do. It makes washing brushes a lot easier and quicker, and it feels cleaner using the glove than washing it on the palms of my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put some baby shampoo on the glove, swish slightly wet brushes on the glove, rinsed it out, squeeze and dry.</li>
            <li> I did not want to splurge on this because I used to think, and still think, this rubber glove is way over priced. I thought the idea was awesome, but the price made me angry at Sigma. I tried the DIY your own makeup cleaning glove projects and even purchased one of those facial cleaning rubber things to avoid buying this.&lt;br /&gt;Well I finally bit the bullet and bought it and it has transformed the way I clean my brushed but especially the way I feel about cleaning them. While before I used to dread the process, now I get a little excited about using this glove. While the idea is ingenious, it is over priced. I would have given it 5 stars if it was overpriced but still perfect, but using the backside of the glove is a little awkward and the glove does not always stay on. So there is a design flaw and definitely room for improvement.&lt;br /&gt;I still think it is cool and would recommend it for those willing to pay for a little help with cleaning their makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> Cleans my brushes better than they have ever been cleaned before. I want to get these for gifts they were so great!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t survive without it. it save your time in cleaning. you can wash more than brush at the same time.</li>
            <li> This glove does everything it is supposed to do in half the time. My brushes were cleaner than if I had hand washed them. I waste less cleaning solution using this glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was able to get this at a discounted price that I felt was much more reasonable than the MSRP, so I can&#x27;t complain about the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only negative is that I didn&#x27;t feel like the glove did a good job of cleaning my denser kabuki face brushes. It took a long time to get all of the product out that had gotten in close to the ferrule. I felt I could have done a better job with my hands for those types.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as good as the beauty mags claim.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing! I literally cleaned my brushes in half the time.</li>
            <li> Perfect for what it&#x27;s used for. Quickly cleanse my brushes, and cuts my time in half.</li>
            <li> I like the product. Got what I expected :)</li>
            <li> I just purchased this glove and am so happy with my purchase. The glove helps get my brushes so much cleaner in a shorter time. I highly recommend this product to help you in your upkeep and cleanliness of your makeup brushes. This is definitely a game changer.</li>
            <li> Great for cleaning my brushes!  Gets everything like new again.</li>
            <li> This product makes cleaning makeup brushes super easy. It also reshapes the brushes for perfect drying. Sigma takes pride in their products.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what I would do without this cleaning glove! My brushes are happy, I&#x27;m happy, my make up applies great with clean brushes.  A must have! Shipping was fast</li>
            <li> Loved it!!! My brushes clean up really nice &amp; don&#x27;t loose their shape. Now I won&#x27;t dread when it&#x27;s time to clean my brushes. :)</li>
            <li> LOVE these,  They make the whole process tolerable when you have a brush collection spanning 20+ yrs of professional.  Hence the 3 stars.  However, I think the several different textures for &#x27;depth of cleanliness&#x27; is pretty gimmicky and silly.  For comparison purposes - I purchased a few knock offs from diff. brands and oh hey!  guess what?  They work JUST as well!  I was even sent this little half egg looking brush cleaner from a subscriber/viewer (in fact, I&#x27;ve been sent several diff. knock offs) that sits in your palm...WORKS WONDERFULLY and Sigma&#x27;s exorbitantly priced gadget is left in a box under the sink now because I have MUCH LESS cumbersome items that not only cost a few bucks, but work equally well.&lt;br /&gt;Look around folks.  Check out BH Cosmetics.  RC Cosmetics...you do NOT need to spend this kind of money for a big, bulky albatross on your ...hand!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use and there is nothing better to clean your brushes! It cleans soooo much better than just using soap alone! It makes cleaning your brushes easy and convenient, not a chore anymore! I highly recommend tis to everyone. You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> OK, this looks silly and unnecessary, but I tell you: if you have hundreds of brushes to wash at the same time, this is sent from the heavens! If you have lots of brushes, buy this, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful product! I am able to clean all of my brushes extremely fast and they come out almost brand new! The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because of the size. I have small hands and I can comfortably fit both of my hands in the glove. Because it is so oversized on me it can be difficult to use a little bit. I would love to see them make it in different sizes for smaller people.</li>
            <li> Really cuts down on brush cleaning. Also is very effective in getting my brushes squeaky clean! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Yes this product does work but it&#x27;s essentially a $40.00 oven mitt!  The little nodules on the glove are nice for getting out the product from your brushes and giving you a slightly better clean.  I didn&#x27;t necessarily think that it cut down on my cleaning time.  I hate cleaning my brushes and I don&#x27;t do it as often as I should but when I do it seems to take me forever to get them clean.  They were really dirty this time but I cleaned about 30 of them and I have to say that it still took me what seemed like forever.  It took nearly 30 minutes to clean them so that&#x27;s about a minute each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works but I think it takes just about as much time to do it the traditional way than with this glove.  It&#x27;s overpriced.  Again, the nodules on the glove do help a bit with getting that grime out of the inner portion of the brushes but I don&#x27;t know that I would recommend people go out and spend this kind of money on something so silly.  I know that when I purchased it I was torn about the price and I knew essentially what I was getting but I was hoping that for $40.00 it would be something wonderful and amazing.  I wish I would have watched Gossmakeupartist video on YouTube prior but mine had already been ordered when I stumbled upon the video - he said it best - it&#x27;s an overpriced oven mitt!  Essentially okay but I wouldn&#x27;t make this mistake twice!  You live and learn!</li>
            <li> I know some people bash this cleaning glove because it&#x27;s either pricey or doesn&#x27;t really cut down cleaning time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I love this mitt/glove!!! My sister and I share it and take turns washing our makeup brushes with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;True, it doesn&#x27;t cut down cleaning time BUT it all depends on what kind of product you use with that brush (liquid, cream or powder).  Obviously, creams or liquids tend to set so whether you have the mitt or not, it takes longer to wash those brushes especially if you tend to go weeks between washings. I know that&#x27;s gross but some of us don&#x27;t have time to wash every after use.  Plus, it&#x27;s not like I use them on other people. Anyway, the main thing that I love about it is that you can say goodbye to prune-y hands forever!  If you&#x27;re like me who is a makeup brush hoarder, you know what I&#x27;m talking about!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON:&lt;br /&gt;The only minor thing about this is the brush is the &amp;#34;shaping&amp;#34; area between the thumb and forefinger area of this glove. It doesn&#x27;t really shape it very well.  Sure, it squeezes out the excess water but I still have to shape it a little bit. It&#x27;s not a deal-breaker but I just don&#x27;t find it very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still would definitely recommend this to a friend or fellow makeup enthusiast!</li>
            <li> y&#x27;all jealous haters can suck on both of my titties, the Sigma Spa brush cleaning glove is next level. My foundation brush has never been so happy.</li>
