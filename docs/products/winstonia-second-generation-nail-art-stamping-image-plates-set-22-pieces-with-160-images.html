            <li>Love the designs easy for me to do on my nails</li>
            <li>The depth of the etching is great and so far, a lot of my creme polishes work with these stamp plates.  </li>
            <li>Great product crystal clear images</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Winstonia nail stamps from the very first set I got because their designs are different from most others and the stamping quality is great.</li>
            <li>Designs are unique and fun, just love them!  </li>
            <li>There are so many cute stamping designs with this set that I didn&#x27;t know which to try first.  </li>
            <li>My grand daughter and I have had a lot of fun with these</li>
            <li>Fabulous Designs</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far so good.</li>
            <li>I tested all the plates and was not disappointed with the images.  </li>
            <li>They work very well and have original images that i love.  </li>
            <li>There are some cool images but not a must have set, got it just to add to my collection of plates.</li>
            <li>Several good plates.</li>
            <li>I tried out several designs from differnt plates and all of them have been good.</li>
            <li>The full nail images arent large enough for my thumbs, thats why the 4 stars instead of five, but it&#x27;s a very nice set.</li>
            <li>Winstonia was my very first nail stamping set.</li>
            <li>Great crisp lines and a wide variety of themes.</li>
            <li>The plates are small, but nice quality and transfer nicely too.</li>
            <li>The images are MUCH larger than most nail stamp images, which is great for people like me with long nails and wider nail beds.  </li>
            <li>I own the 1st and 2nd generation plates.</li>
            <li>Just received my second generation plates and wow, they are amazing, better than the first, can&#x27;t wait for the third,  The images are bigger than the first, and they print up beautiful.  </li>
            <li>The image never fails to transfer well and the designs are nice and different.</li>
            <li>Nice and big to fit most of my fingers, except my thumbs which are oddly</li>
            <li>I like the set, I wish it contained more full nail images instead of single item ones</li>
            <li>Would definitely buy from winstonia again and love these plates,</li>
            <li>I have Winstonia&#x27;s first generation stamping plates</li>
            <li>The images are clear and detailed.  </li>
            <li>Definitely going to buy more.</li>
            <li>No problems and they ship so fast!</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I paid for.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t decide between the 1st &amp; 2nd generation plates, so I got both, and I love them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my 5th set, but my first from winstonia.</li>
            <li>Most of the images are too large to cover even your big toe</li>
            <li>This are of high quality and she had super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I have large nails</li>
            <li>Only thing I want to suggest is to, on the 3rd gen set, have a chevron pattern and more St. Patties day patterns!</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t care so much for some images.</li>
            <li>The images are larger on these plates so they easily fit on all nails.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast.</li>
            <li>worked very well.</li>
            <li>The plates work very well.</li>
            <li>While this is a very versatile set</li>
            <li>Very fun and different designs</li>
            <li>If you are a fan of nail stamping, this new collection is an absolute necessity!</li>
            <li>Have used these stamps almost weekly since getting them (I&#x27;m not a professional, only do my own nails and friends and family&#x27;s).</li>
            <li>LOVE the extra large stamp size, it actually fits my nails!</li>
            <li>One thing I LOVE is that the full nail images are a bit larger than the previous gen (and Konad as well).</li>
            <li>A few are too thin to pick up well, but the number of good plates still makes it worthwhile.</li>
            <li>when I saw they had their second gen set, i picked them up right away.</li>
            <li>The images are large enough without being too large.</li>
            <li>more often than not, I find that the &amp;#34;full size&amp;#34; images do not completely cover my nails, especially my thumb and middle finger.  </li>
            <li>At first I couldn&#x27;t get the large white side of the stamp to work but after reading some online reviews I saw that trying the to pick up the image you go straight down and then roll to apply.</li>
            <li>They are seriously some of my favorite plates.</li>
            <li>It covers all the major holidays, besides other fun designs.</li>
            <li>Really nice designs, flat enough that my scraper doesn&#x27;t get caught on the designs but deep enough that the stamps are sharp and clear when picked up by the stamper.</li>
            <li>They are deep set and clear stamps.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a huge fan of every single image, but I know I&#x27;m going to have a ton of fun playing with these!</li>
            <li>Not particularly interested in the fairies, and quite frankly, having a Native American plate is really racist.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> These stamp great. Lots of great images.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get them to work.</li>
            <li> I like the set, I wish it contained more full nail images instead of single item ones, I didn&#x27;t care so much for some images.</li>
            <li> Have used these stamps almost weekly since getting them (I&#x27;m not a professional, only do my own nails and friends and family&#x27;s). Great crisp lines and a wide variety of themes.</li>
            <li> Great packaging and super fun!! Love that they all had separate protective film on each of them!! Get them ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰</li>
            <li> Beautiful clear art for your nails! Works great!</li>
            <li> These plates are awesome.  They stamp very well and are of very good quality.  Had one plate that was scratched or chipped and contacted winstonia and their customer service was excellent they sent replacement plate no questions asked.  Would definitely buy from winstonia again and love these plates, so many great designs that are unique!! Keep making more great plates!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have Salon Express plates and I thought when I bought these Wistonia plates they would be as deeply etched, but they&#x27;re not.  They do still work though!  I am happy with them, I just wish they were etched a bit deeper.</li>
            <li> I bought these plates after I purchased their 1st Generation set. The images are larger on these plates so they easily fit on all nails. The only problem I had was one plate wasn&#x27;t etched well enough to stamp but I contacted Winstonia and they are sending me a replacement plate. Wonderful customer service and high quality, detailed plates. You definitely get the bang for your buck here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Winstonia&#x27;s nail products, but this stamp collection exceeded my expectations!  The images are MUCH larger than most nail stamp images, which is great for people like me with long nails and wider nail beds.  Thank you, Winstonia, for designing the larger images!  I have hundreds of stamping plates, and more often than not, I find that the &amp;#34;full size&amp;#34; images do not completely cover my nails, especially my thumb and middle finger.  But that is not a problem with these stamps at all.  Even the stand-alone images are larger than before.  And of course, these are high-quality and deeply etched designs so transferring the images to my nails was a breeze.  If you are a fan of nail stamping, this new collection is an absolute necessity!</li>
            <li> GREAT quality!  Haven&#x27;t had a bad stamp yet!  LOVE the extra large stamp size, it actually fits my nails! (esp my thumb!)  Designs are unique and fun, just love them!  NOT ONE REGRET!</li>
            <li> I have Winstonia&#x27;s first generation stamping plates and I love the designs, so when I saw they had their second gen set, i picked them up right away. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of every single image, but I know I&#x27;m going to have a ton of fun playing with these! One thing I LOVE is that the full nail images are a bit larger than the previous gen (and Konad as well). I have large nails and I like that I don&#x27;t have to try and match up the edges to cover my nail (which never works!). Great job Winstonia! Only thing I want to suggest is to, on the 3rd gen set, have a chevron pattern and more St. Patties day patterns! I don&#x27;t think I will ever buy the Konad plates again!</li>
            <li> My grand daughter and I have had a lot of fun with these</li>
            <li> Love the designs easy for me to do on my nails so I wasn&#x27;t have to keep of spending money at the nail place</li>
            <li> Love! Arrived fast. Great quality!</li>
            <li> Really nice designs, flat enough that my scraper doesn&#x27;t get caught on the designs but deep enough that the stamps are sharp and clear when picked up by the stamper.</li>
            <li> Most of the images are too large to cover even your big toe but the designs are great.  Can&#x27;t wait to use them all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Winstonia nail stamps from the very first set I got because their designs are different from most others and the stamping quality is great. I would recommend these to others. I&#x27;m very happy with them</li>
            <li> There are some cool images but not a must have set, got it just to add to my collection of plates. They stamp well and are of good quality.</li>
            <li> Just received my second generation plates and wow, they are amazing, better than the first, can&#x27;t wait for the third,  The images are bigger than the first, and they print up beautiful.  They are very good quality.  I am so in love with these plates.  I tested all the plates and was not disappointed with the images.  These are a must for your collections.</li>
            <li> Winstonia was my very first nail stamping set. I like that you get 22 pieces for an affordable price. It covers all the major holidays, besides other fun designs. The plates are small, but nice quality and transfer nicely too. I use my Winstonia plates often. I own the 1st and 2nd generation plates.</li>
            <li> Several good plates. Not particularly interested in the fairies, and quite frankly, having a Native American plate is really racist. A few are too thin to pick up well, but the number of good plates still makes it worthwhile.</li>
            <li> Love this set!  There are so many cute stamping designs with this set that I didn&#x27;t know which to try first.  The images are clear and detailed.  The depth of the etching is great and so far, a lot of my creme polishes work with these stamp plates.  I have about 3 or 4 different brands of stamping plates and the quality of these is comparable to BM or Pueen.  Lovely stuff!</li>
            <li> wish i could find more of these</li>
            <li> I love the product! Very satisfied with the purchase, it is exactly what i was looking for! Would recommend to others</li>
            <li> Love these stamping plates. I have had no problems stamping with them and I don&#x27;t use stamping polish. Love that there is a design for almost every holiday. Definitely going to buy more.</li>
            <li> I love my Winstonia image plates, they are good quality and they stamp great.  Great buy  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> worked very well. I am sold on winstonia plates. No problems and they ship so fast!</li>
            <li> My winstonia stamping plates and stamp/scraper kit came today. At first I couldn&#x27;t get the large white side of the stamp to work but after reading some online reviews I saw that trying the to pick up the image you go straight down and then roll to apply. Works perfect! So happy! The images are so nice and clean and full coverage for my thumb!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t quite get the hang of these stamps ðŸ˜“</li>
            <li> Did not transfer well at all! I will never purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is a good price a very good quality stamping plates</li>
            <li> The plates work very well. It took a bit for me to get used it stamping but once I got the hang of it I can&#x27;t stop. I even got my daughter to do it and she loves it more than I do. The plates give a great variety of choices which I like. I&#x27;m going to order Winstonia again.</li>
            <li> Great!!!!! Fabulous Designs</li>
            <li> This are of high quality and she had super fast shipping. They are deep set and clear stamps. Very fun and different designs then I have seen any where lately.</li>
            <li> once again Winstonia has come out with a great set of plates. Wonderful designs and the stamp marvelously! I look forward to more sets soon.</li>
            <li> Not the best designs but i guess thats my fault because i should&#x27;ve seen them all before.</li>
            <li> I have not used them yet because my stamper hasn&#x27;t arrived in the mail. I got exactly what I paid for. Some of them looked like they were scratched up on the blue film but not on the actual plates. I cannot wait to try them out :) ðŸ’™</li>
            <li> While this is a very versatile set and I will get some use out of it I find that some of the images are a little shallow and don&#x27;t stamp as well as some other brands I&#x27;ve had.  However for beginners and people who are on a budget this is a nice set.  The images are large enough without being too large.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t decide between the 1st &amp; 2nd generation plates, so I got both, and I love them. They are seriously some of my favorite plates.</li>
            <li> They work very well and have original images that i love.  The full nail images arent large enough for my thumbs, thats why the 4 stars instead of five, but it&#x27;s a very nice set.</li>
            <li> winstonia&#x27;s plates are great. The image never fails to transfer well and the designs are nice and different. I hope they are working on the next generation of plates.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a licensed nail technician, and I could not get these images plates to stamp correctly! I tried 3 different brands of polish, 2 different scrapers, 2 different stampers, recleaning the plates and nothing worked. The stampers would not pick the image up. I have several other brands of stamping plates and have never had a problem like with these plates. I bought the set specifically for the dinosaur plate, and neither I or another nail technician could get an image. I am very disappointed in the quality of these plates. I finally got a decent image with a third brand of stamper, but it should not be that difficult!</li>
            <li> I can not get the design on the stamper to put on my nails.</li>
            <li> I just got these plates and I am in love with them. It&#x27;s my 5th set, but my first from winstonia. All of my others have been bundle monster (which I love too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far so good. I tried out several designs from differnt plates and all of them have been good. And the full size designs are great. Nice and big to fit most of my fingers, except my thumbs which are oddly wide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But other then that I love them and am going to get the 1st gen soon.</li>
            <li> I only wanted the one with the dinos, because my son LOVES dinos. I have used almost all of them and they all work GREAT!</li>
            <li> Cannot make these things work. Have tried and tried and tried and tried. Followed instructions that came with them. Didn&#x27;t work. Googled and tried watching YouTube videos. Couldn&#x27;t get it to work. Really really wanted them to work and tried hard. Gave up.</li>
            <li> They do not work. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Great product crystal clear images</li>
