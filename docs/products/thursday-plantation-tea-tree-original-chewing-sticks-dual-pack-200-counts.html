            <li>nice guys.</li>
            <li>Good taste for the most part.  </li>
            <li>kind of thing.  </li>
            <li>Both the cinnamon and original flavors are great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with how convenient it is to pop a toothpick in my mouth and gain healthy results.</li>
            <li>Good taste and they strong</li>
            <li>Tea tree oil is good and strong, as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are a good strong toothpick and have some sort of taste, however, its taste is unidentifyable and it is not cinammon.  </li>
            <li>The flavor is very VERY strong.  </li>
            <li>but it is very strong so some people may be turned off by that.</li>
            <li>These Plantation chewing sticks are very strong.</li>
            <li>The mint is very strong and takes some getting used to</li>
            <li>They also seem to cure coffee breath better than gum, which I think kind of masks the smell.</li>
            <li>They are a great stress reliever and my breath always feels so fresh afterwards.</li>
            <li>Strong flavor gives great fresh breath.</li>
            <li>You taste the menthol more then the cinnamon.</li>
            <li>but these would be best if you were a former menthol smoker.</li>
            <li>A friend bought the cinnamon version, and I like the cinnamon more.</li>
            <li>These are very \\&quot;tea tree\\&quot; and minty, and are really a great way to freshen your breath when you don&#x27;t have a chance to brush your teeth.</li>
            <li>These latest toothpicks tend to splinter and disintegrate if you chew with abandon.</li>
            <li>I would prefer more of a cinnamon taste.</li>
            <li>I know of no one who hasn&#x27;t enjoyed them.  </li>
            <li>but, overall, great stick!</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>I have since bought more and continue to do so.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these things.</li>
            <li>I love it though.</li>
            <li>Love em.</li>
            <li>They have an excellent (and strong) flavor and work well to freshen breath and fight the oral fixation left over from smoking.</li>
            <li>They do leave your teeth and mouth feeling very clean.  </li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t had tea-tree oil flavored things before, it might be wise to taste it first before buying a couple of boxes.</li>
            <li>so if your looking for something to keep your moth busy, i think these will be great for you..</li>
            <li>Great for after a meal, they really leave your mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>They break easily though.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t shatter easily.</li>
            <li>Some of the sticks had a tendency to splinter easily</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing, clean, and botanical in flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Strong flavor</li>
            <li>Strong flavor.</li>
            <li>and it helped keep him distracted and the flavor is strong as well.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly strong taste.  </li>
            <li>for non-smokers, the flavor is way too strong, imho.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t very useful for picking stuff out of your teeth because they break easily.  </li>
            <li>Tea tree flavor can be overwhelming, and they splinter off a bit too easily, but overall a good product.</li>
            <li>For first time users they will prolly seem very strong...</li>
            <li>These toothpicks have been instrumental in my ability to both quit, and remain cigarette free.  </li>
            <li>The price available here on Amazon beats what you&#x27;d pay for these at health food</li>
            <li>so I have them available when I need them after eating something.</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>Overall, really really happy with them.</li>
            <li>NOM NOM NOM, chew on these all day, they are packed with flavor and are uber fun to chew :)</li>
            <li>Great alternative to a standard toothpick or gum!</li>
            <li>I really enjoy these chewing sticks.</li>
            <li>These things are very powerful.  </li>
            <li>After about 15 minutes my teeth feel clean, free of plague.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li>originally called them, \\&quot;Cuban Walking Sticks.\\&quot; Took me a while to find these chew sticks.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>leaves your mouth feeling clean</li>
            <li>They were a bit too intense at first, but I soon got used to it and now love these thing!</li>
            <li>Overall, a good product for oral fixation.</li>
            <li>They are well-made, aesthetically pleasing, classy understated aroma and taste and effective.  </li>
            <li>they&#x27;re not unpleasant smelling at all, but sort of intense when you&#x27;re chewing them :)</li>
            <li>At first I though the flavor was odd, but have liked it more and more as I&#x27;ve continued to chew these.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t actually buy these to help with quitting smoking, more to be able to help me curb my habit of biting my fingernails.  </li>
            <li>These chewing sticks have reduced my finger biting tremendously.</li>
            <li>The wood is nice and solid and doesn&#x27;t splinter, and the tea tree and other oils make for a great, clean taste and sensation.</li>
            <li>The cinnamon sticks are very hot and may bother some.</li>
            <li>Overall, pretty good.  </li>
            <li>It works pretty well when you want to keep your mouth busy and gives you that nice menthol-ly taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They wood is of better quality than your average toothpick and the flavor is very strong.  </li>
            <li>great sticks they are a great way to break a bad habit and</li>
            <li>I would recommend these over the standard mint toothpick, but not as the amazing party-in-your-mouth you are desiring.</li>
            <li>Fresh peppermint patty feeling stays for a 1/2 hour or so after you&#x27;re done with the stick.</li>
            <li>These are worth the price for their intended use and as toothpicks.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s generally kind of minty and spicy (like cinnamon) at the same time.</li>
            <li>my experience these toothpicks are entirely worth the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used mine while travelling and at work, and in some cases have gone a good 8 hours (carefully)</li>
            <li>Many were very pricey and didn&#x27;t really give recommendations on how to use them; like the oil.</li>
            <li>It leaves a fresh taste in my mouth and feels soothing.</li>
            <li>must be useful for folks who are trying to quit smoking.  </li>
            <li>I do not typically see myself as the type of guy that would write a toothpick review, but I love these things.</li>
            <li>You may be wondering why you are reading a toothpick review right now.</li>
            <li>They also make very nice little presents even!</li>
            <li>Flavor is VERY strong, but it also lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>Also would like to say that the flavor is strong at first but is mild enough.</li>
            <li>But after that initial shock, I really enjoyed them.  </li>
            <li>Everybody wants one!</li>
            <li>I must admit that they hold up pretty well when I&#x27;m chewing on them, but I just can&#x27;t seem to get used to the flavor.</li>
            <li>i expected some kind of minty flavor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Beware - it&#x27;s exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>The regular flavour has a bit of cinnamon taste to it already, so I&#x27;m glad that I didn&#x27;t go for the cinnamon variety.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most toothpicks you might find to be dried out and crack easily,</li>
            <li>One lasts for a good while, until the wood becomes chewy and wet and gross, but I got 200 of them for $10, and if it keeps me from eating as much, it&#x27;s way worth it.</li>
            <li>this is very strong and petrochemically active.  </li>
            <li>Not only are these incredibly tasty but also have a long lasting flavor that really refreshes your mouth.</li>
            <li>I used to purchase these little sticks &#x27;o&#x27; joy at the local vitamin shop, until they stopped carrying them.  </li>
            <li>They do seem to help when I remember to bring them along with me, and though the tea tree oil can be a little powerful and can make your lips tingle, it&#x27;s a refreshing flavor that I&#x27;ve started to look forward to.  </li>
            <li>At the very least your breath will be better :)</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a huge hit, and could possibly be your &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; if no one else is doing it.</li>
            <li>I really like the tea tree flavor</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a newly former smoker and enjoy these as a substitute</li>
            <li>Everyone who bums one off of me always wants to know where I purchased them.</li>
            <li>thank you fast shipping</li>
            <li>They really did help both times.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve been using them too and really like them.</li>
            <li>the flavor.&lt;br /&gt;The toothpick is also very sturdy and won&#x27;t fall apart.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of things to quit smoking and nothing really works.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;But if you rest it in your mouth and just lightly chew it, or turn it and occasionally give it a squeeze to release some more oils, this will last you an entire day with room to spare.</li>
            <li>The only real problem I might have with these is that they splinter too quickly.</li>
            <li>They are not just to get the odd thing out of your teeth, they&#x27;re much better for long periods where you&#x27;d like to have the flavor, or something to lightly chew.</li>
            <li>Wish I would&#x27;ve ordered more - the shipping was almost half the tab.</li>
            <li>He has yet to actually quit, but we have both tried and like these chewing sticks, and I am glad to have them on hand for when he finally takes the plunge.</li>
            <li>That being said they last forever depending on how quickly you chew them to bits.</li>
            <li>However, they do have more flavor and (probably) more natural ingredients than your average mint toothpick, which is more than enough for me to recommend them if you&#x27;re looking for an above average toothpick.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend</li>
            <li>and I love that I am not cleaning up little pieces of chewed wood all the time.  </li>
            <li>Whenever I need a little pep I use chew one and they are refreshing.</li>
            <li>And they&#x27;re durable, so my coolness lasts longer than with normal toothpicks.</li>
            <li>I always kept a pack in my car and a pack in the office and after a meal I would use them as you would use a normal toothpick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure you&#x27;ll like them if you&#x27;re even interested to begin with, and then it&#x27;s just a matter of seeing how long you can make the toothpick last before you&#x27;ve worn it down to splinters.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to explain in words how these are worth so much more than normal toothpicks if you&#x27;re unfamiliar with what teat tree oil is like, so again: see if you can sample some, or buy a single box.</li>
            <li>Also, I like the minty, homeo-mediciny natural flavor.</li>
            <li>They are also a natural antiseptic and reduce bacteria in the mouth.</li>
            <li>but with the infused tea tree oils in these, you can chew on them for a considerable time without breakage.  </li>
            <li>Tea tree is a natural antibiotic, besides.</li>
            <li>Back then they stayed whole after moderate chewing.</li>
            <li>main thing you have to watch out for the first time you try these, is that the flavor is REALLY HARSH!  </li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t really what I expected.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t like to chew gum for long (my neck and jaw tense up), and when travelling these can be a real comfort, and they are easily discarded responsibly since they end up as an old toothpick or a small pile of splinters.</li>
            <li>I subconsciously bite really hard on them occasionally, and can&#x27;t get them to last more than an hour or two w/o splintering.    </li>
            <li>It seems to add moisture to my lips and mouth, relieving me of a &#x27;dry mouth&#x27; feeling that is a frequent occurrence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t bad, it was just really strong right off of the bat, and almost sort of burned, until I got used to it.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> They aren&#x27;t very useful for picking stuff out of your teeth because they break easily.  </li>
            <li> Tea tree flavor can be overwhelming, and they splinter off a bit too easily, but overall a good product.</li>
            <li> For first time users they will prolly seem very strong...</li>
            <li> These toothpicks have been instrumental in my ability to both quit, and remain cigarette free.  </li>
            <li> The price available here on Amazon beats what you&#x27;d pay for these at health food</li>
            <li> so I have them available when I need them after eating something.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li> Overall, really really happy with them.</li>
            <li> NOM NOM NOM, chew on these all day, they are packed with flavor and are uber fun to chew :)</li>
            <li> Great alternative to a standard toothpick or gum!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy these chewing sticks.</li>
            <li> These things are very powerful.  </li>
            <li> After about 15 minutes my teeth feel clean, free of plague.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li> originally called them, \\&quot;Cuban Walking Sticks.\\&quot; Took me a while to find these chew sticks.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> leaves your mouth feeling clean</li>
            <li> They were a bit too intense at first, but I soon got used to it and now love these thing!</li>
            <li> Overall, a good product for oral fixation.</li>
            <li> They are well-made, aesthetically pleasing, classy understated aroma and taste and effective.  </li>
            <li> they&#x27;re not unpleasant smelling at all, but sort of intense when you&#x27;re chewing them :)</li>
            <li> At first I though the flavor was odd, but have liked it more and more as I&#x27;ve continued to chew these.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t actually buy these to help with quitting smoking, more to be able to help me curb my habit of biting my fingernails.  </li>
            <li> These chewing sticks have reduced my finger biting tremendously.</li>
            <li> The wood is nice and solid and doesn&#x27;t splinter, and the tea tree and other oils make for a great, clean taste and sensation.</li>
            <li> The cinnamon sticks are very hot and may bother some.</li>
            <li> Overall, pretty good.  </li>
            <li> It works pretty well when you want to keep your mouth busy and gives you that nice menthol-ly taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They wood is of better quality than your average toothpick and the flavor is very strong.  </li>
            <li> great sticks they are a great way to break a bad habit and</li>
            <li> I would recommend these over the standard mint toothpick, but not as the amazing party-in-your-mouth you are desiring.</li>
            <li> Fresh peppermint patty feeling stays for a 1/2 hour or so after you&#x27;re done with the stick.</li>
            <li> These are worth the price for their intended use and as toothpicks.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s generally kind of minty and spicy (like cinnamon) at the same time.</li>
            <li> my experience these toothpicks are entirely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used mine while travelling and at work, and in some cases have gone a good 8 hours (carefully)</li>
            <li> Many were very pricey and didn&#x27;t really give recommendations on how to use them; like the oil.</li>
            <li> It leaves a fresh taste in my mouth and feels soothing.</li>
            <li> must be useful for folks who are trying to quit smoking.  </li>
            <li> I do not typically see myself as the type of guy that would write a toothpick review, but I love these things.</li>
            <li> You may be wondering why you are reading a toothpick review right now.</li>
            <li> They also make very nice little presents even!</li>
            <li> Flavor is VERY strong, but it also lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Also would like to say that the flavor is strong at first but is mild enough.</li>
            <li> But after that initial shock, I really enjoyed them.  </li>
            <li> Everybody wants one!</li>
            <li> I must admit that they hold up pretty well when I&#x27;m chewing on them, but I just can&#x27;t seem to get used to the flavor.</li>
            <li> i expected some kind of minty flavor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Beware - it&#x27;s exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> The regular flavour has a bit of cinnamon taste to it already, so I&#x27;m glad that I didn&#x27;t go for the cinnamon variety.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most toothpicks you might find to be dried out and crack easily,</li>
            <li> One lasts for a good while, until the wood becomes chewy and wet and gross, but I got 200 of them for $10, and if it keeps me from eating as much, it&#x27;s way worth it.</li>
            <li> this is very strong and petrochemically active.  </li>
            <li> Not only are these incredibly tasty but also have a long lasting flavor that really refreshes your mouth.</li>
            <li> I used to purchase these little sticks &#x27;o&#x27; joy at the local vitamin shop, until they stopped carrying them.  </li>
            <li> They do seem to help when I remember to bring them along with me, and though the tea tree oil can be a little powerful and can make your lips tingle, it&#x27;s a refreshing flavor that I&#x27;ve started to look forward to.  </li>
            <li> At the very least your breath will be better :)</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a huge hit, and could possibly be your &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; if no one else is doing it.</li>
            <li> I really like the tea tree flavor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a newly former smoker and enjoy these as a substitute</li>
            <li> Everyone who bums one off of me always wants to know where I purchased them.</li>
            <li> thank you fast shipping</li>
            <li> They really did help both times.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been using them too and really like them.</li>
            <li> the flavor.&lt;br /&gt;The toothpick is also very sturdy and won&#x27;t fall apart.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of things to quit smoking and nothing really works.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;But if you rest it in your mouth and just lightly chew it, or turn it and occasionally give it a squeeze to release some more oils, this will last you an entire day with room to spare.</li>
            <li> The only real problem I might have with these is that they splinter too quickly.</li>
            <li> They are not just to get the odd thing out of your teeth, they&#x27;re much better for long periods where you&#x27;d like to have the flavor, or something to lightly chew.</li>
            <li> Wish I would&#x27;ve ordered more - the shipping was almost half the tab.</li>
            <li> He has yet to actually quit, but we have both tried and like these chewing sticks, and I am glad to have them on hand for when he finally takes the plunge.</li>
            <li> That being said they last forever depending on how quickly you chew them to bits.</li>
            <li> However, they do have more flavor and (probably) more natural ingredients than your average mint toothpick, which is more than enough for me to recommend them if you&#x27;re looking for an above average toothpick.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend</li>
            <li> and I love that I am not cleaning up little pieces of chewed wood all the time.  </li>
            <li> Whenever I need a little pep I use chew one and they are refreshing.</li>
            <li> And they&#x27;re durable, so my coolness lasts longer than with normal toothpicks.</li>
            <li> I always kept a pack in my car and a pack in the office and after a meal I would use them as you would use a normal toothpick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure you&#x27;ll like them if you&#x27;re even interested to begin with, and then it&#x27;s just a matter of seeing how long you can make the toothpick last before you&#x27;ve worn it down to splinters.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to explain in words how these are worth so much more than normal toothpicks if you&#x27;re unfamiliar with what teat tree oil is like, so again: see if you can sample some, or buy a single box.</li>
            <li> Also, I like the minty, homeo-mediciny natural flavor.</li>
            <li> They are also a natural antiseptic and reduce bacteria in the mouth.</li>
            <li> but with the infused tea tree oils in these, you can chew on them for a considerable time without breakage.  </li>
            <li> Tea tree is a natural antibiotic, besides.</li>
            <li> Back then they stayed whole after moderate chewing.</li>
            <li> main thing you have to watch out for the first time you try these, is that the flavor is REALLY HARSH!  </li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t really what I expected.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like to chew gum for long (my neck and jaw tense up), and when travelling these can be a real comfort, and they are easily discarded responsibly since they end up as an old toothpick or a small pile of splinters.</li>
            <li> I subconsciously bite really hard on them occasionally, and can&#x27;t get them to last more than an hour or two w/o splintering.    </li>
            <li> It seems to add moisture to my lips and mouth, relieving me of a &#x27;dry mouth&#x27; feeling that is a frequent occurrence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad, it was just really strong right off of the bat, and almost sort of burned, until I got used to it.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if all the other stuff is true</li>
            <li> If you just bite through them, they&#x27;ll get destroyed just like any other toothpick, and they&#x27;ll leave behind a lot of strong flavor (which I like just fine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The original flavor one is a little weird but a decent mix with the cinnamon.    </li>
            <li> Also these are not standard toothpicks as only one end is pointed and the other end is rounded off.</li>
            <li> tucked that same pick behind my ear, and revisited it later after it had dried out, only to find it was still full of flavor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keep their flavor for a long time</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I will try some of the other flavors next time.</li>
            <li> The cinnamon is a lot stronger than I expected but it lasts really long.</li>
            <li> My biggest issue I&#x27;ve come across has been that they don&#x27;t seem to be sanded down well enough sometimes and some start to flake off bits of wood which can aggravate the tongue.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that if you don&#x27;t use them frequently and have them for a long time they tend to dry out a little and lose the flavor potency.</li>
            <li> Just as I expected.</li>
            <li> Bitter mint.</li>
            <li> I get some duds (brittle or bendy), but that&#x27;s expected considering I went through 4 packs.</li>
            <li> The flavor lasts a very long time and they are durable; they last a couple hours if you don’t chew on them too hard.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Have tried other flavored toothpicks and nothing stacks up to these.</li>
            <li> I imagine this taste might overwhelm extreme cravings, so in that respect they may be helpful.</li>
            <li> If you need to use these as actual toothpicks, you&#x27;re in for a rude awakening as chunks of wood splinter off in your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Perhaps they are not chopping down high-quality old-growth forest for these?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like these,the only bad thing I can say about these is there price</li>
            <li> These were a little disappointing, but that may be my own fault for hyping these up to myself by reading some of the exaggerated reviews.</li>
            <li> Freshens the breath a little.</li>
            <li> If noticed my lips get a little swollen for a few days after trying one of these, as it seems to make micro cuts on them.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing I have to say about these is that I was surprised by how they splintered.</li>
            <li> I use my sticks everyday.</li>
            <li> I chew when I want something mindless to do while I walk, or do work.</li>
            <li> If you are expecting to put one of these bad boys in your mouth and get a rush of mouth-thrilling refreshment, you will most likely be disappointed too.</li>
            <li> use these all the time and carry them in a small metal container in my pocket</li>
            <li> No better toothpick out there.</li>
            <li> Birchwoodbis hard, so they last a while and are difficult to splinter.</li>
            <li> Weird flavor - kinda like crushed up aspirin with mint.</li>
            <li> picks are just too weak, however.</li>
            <li> u cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> I will say that I may have gotten a bad batch or something because the sticks themselves seem rather stale and splintery.</li>
            <li> Nothing like cliche bad ass chewing on a toothpick.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my boyfriend to chew on while he was kicking the nasty habit of smoking</li>
            <li> but I think they leave a horrible after smell.</li>

            <li> I like them.  They help me avoid tobacco products.  They aren&#x27;t very useful for picking stuff out of your teeth because they break easily.  But that doesn&#x27;t matter because they are meant for chewing.  Overall, a good product for oral fixation.</li>
            <li> Started using these when I wanted to stop biting my nails, and they were great.  One will last for hours!</li>
            <li> Great product! They were a bit too intense at first, but I soon got used to it and now love these thing!</li>
            <li> I bought these for a habitual toothpick chewer.  He seems to like the taste of them and I love that I am not cleaning up little pieces of chewed wood all the time.  I will try some of the other flavors next time.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t really what I expected.  The flavor is very VERY strong.  However, it could just be my taste.  I&#x27;ll be \\&quot;donating\\&quot; these to someone else.</li>
            <li> I used to purchase these little sticks &#x27;o&#x27; joy at the local vitamin shop, until they stopped carrying them.  These toothpicks have been instrumental in my ability to both quit, and remain cigarette free.  They also make my breath smell nice, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> leaves your mouth feeling clean</li>
            <li> These are great sturdy toothpicks with a refreshing tea tree flavor. Great for after a meal, they really leave your mouth feeling fresh. The flavor lasts a very long time and they are durable; they last a couple hours if you don’t chew on them too hard. I really like the tea tree flavor but it is very strong so some people may be turned off by that. Also these are not standard toothpicks as only one end is pointed and the other end is rounded off. I use them to chew on instead of snacking and they work well for that.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t actually buy these to help with quitting smoking, more to be able to help me curb my habit of biting my fingernails.  They do seem to help when I remember to bring them along with me, and though the tea tree oil can be a little powerful and can make your lips tingle, it&#x27;s a refreshing flavor that I&#x27;ve started to look forward to.  My biggest issue I&#x27;ve come across has been that they don&#x27;t seem to be sanded down well enough sometimes and some start to flake off bits of wood which can aggravate the tongue.</li>
            <li> Strong flavor, You wouldn&#x27;t want a smoke after chewing on one of these. It will help with my goal to stop smoking, quit date soon.</li>
            <li> You taste the menthol more then the cinnamon. I&#x27;m a newly former smoker and enjoy these as a substitute but these would be best if you were a former menthol smoker. Fresh peppermint patty feeling stays for a 1/2 hour or so after you&#x27;re done with the stick. I&#x27;m a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> i must say these sticks are great.. so my friend says.. yup i bought it for my friend... doesn&#x27;t stop chewing them.. and he doesn&#x27;t smoke either.... so if your looking for something to keep your moth busy, i think these will be great for you.. also&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HEALTHY SELF is the seller i bought from. nice guys. look for them. u cant go wrong. i emailed them and they replied and i misunderstood your email. 6 star service... just gotta figure out how to change seller feedback thingy.</li>
            <li> Good taste for the most part.  They break easily though.</li>
            <li> Taste good. Not sure if all the other stuff is true LOL!</li>
            <li> Not a smoker, I just got them to have something to do with my fingers and teeth and to look like Steve McQueen. It worked, this product made me arguably 10% more awesome. Also, I like the minty, homeo-mediciny natural flavor. Freshens the breath a little. And they&#x27;re durable, so my coolness lasts longer than with normal toothpicks.</li>
            <li> I really like these,the only bad thing I can say about these is there price it is a bit steep compared to my local health food store.Other than that these have \\&quot;helped\\&quot; me quit smoking and are pleasure to have after a meal.</li>
            <li> At first I though the flavor was odd, but have liked it more and more as I&#x27;ve continued to chew these. A friend bought the cinnamon version, and I like the cinnamon more. If you like cinnamon, buy the cinnamon flavor.</li>
            <li> These Plantation chewing sticks are very strong. I haven&#x27;t tried the cinnamon variety but I have heard those are even stronger. These are very \\&quot;tea tree\\&quot; and minty, and are really a great way to freshen your breath when you don&#x27;t have a chance to brush your teeth. I always kept a pack in my car and a pack in the office and after a meal I would use them as you would use a normal toothpick. Doing so left me with cleaner feeling teeth and fresher breath.    Others have recommended these chewing sticks to help cope with smoking cessation but I can not comment on this usage as I don&#x27;t smoke. If you do smoke and you&#x27;d like to stop, it&#x27;s worth a try! At the very least your breath will be better :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these flavored toothpicks since I quit smoking three months ago. They have an excellent (and strong) flavor and work well to freshen breath and fight the oral fixation left over from smoking. Everyone who bums one off of me always wants to know where I purchased them. I&#x27;m a fan of the tea tree flavor, although this company also makes a cinnamon variety. The cinnamon sticks are very hot and may bother some. Have tried other flavored toothpicks and nothing stacks up to these.</li>
            <li> Great chew sticks. Keep their flavor for a long time</li>
            <li> I quit smoking two years ago. After I went off the nicotine gum, I found I still needed something to chew on. These complement my mint/wintergreen gums. The tea-tree taste has a great but not overpowering kick. The price available here on Amazon beats what you&#x27;d pay for these at health food stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why not five stars? How does anyone give toothpicks 4 stars? I used these years ago during an abortive quit-smoking campaign that lasted for about 3 months. Back then they stayed whole after moderate chewing. These latest toothpicks tend to splinter and disintegrate if you chew with abandon. Perhaps they are not chopping down high-quality old-growth forest for these?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, I recommend these; they&#x27;ve helped me stay smoke-free for two years.</li>
            <li> use these all the time and carry them in a small metal container in my pocket so I have them available when I need them after eating something.</li>
            <li> Used these to stop smoking a pipe in 2010.  Have smoked it since.  Still like to use the Tea Tree toothpicks regularly. They are also a natural antiseptic and reduce bacteria in the mouth.</li>
            <li> thank you fast shipping</li>
            <li> I use these throughout the work-day to keep me focused. Whenever I need a little pep I use chew one and they are refreshing. The peppermint and tea tree have actually helped with coughing, headaches and being thirsty.</li>
            <li> Toothpicks are good quality.  Don&#x27;t shatter easily. They do leave your teeth and mouth feeling very clean.  Taste is not the most pleasant.  I would prefer more of a cinnamon taste.</li>
            <li> And they make your breath smell so much better!</li>
            <li> I feel like the dude from &amp;#34;Drive&amp;#34; when chewing on these mo-fo&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I purchased these to help my son quit smoking. I had used them myself to do so. They really did help both times. It helps with the oral fixation.</li>
            <li> my husband loves these, especially when trying to quit smoking. they&#x27;re not unpleasant smelling at all, but sort of intense when you&#x27;re chewing them :)</li>
            <li> Not only are these incredibly tasty but also have a long lasting flavor that really refreshes your mouth. Would recommend after eating or anytime you want a breath freshening. Also would like to say that the flavor is strong at first but is mild enough. Some of the sticks had a tendency to splinter easily Im guessing from being soaked in oil but still would purchase again to keep on hand.</li>
            <li> I bought these to try to support my husband&#x27;s plans to stop smoking. He has yet to actually quit, but we have both tried and like these chewing sticks, and I am glad to have them on hand for when he finally takes the plunge.</li>
            <li> You may be wondering why you are reading a toothpick review right now. I do not typically see myself as the type of guy that would write a toothpick review, but I love these things. I have gotten all of my coworkers hooked on these and will probably buy stock in the company soon. Both the cinnamon and original flavors are great. They also seem to cure coffee breath better than gum, which I think kind of masks the smell. I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> Overall, pretty good.  They wood is of better quality than your average toothpick and the flavor is very strong.  Most toothpicks you might find to be dried out and crack easily, but with the infused tea tree oils in these, you can chew on them for a considerable time without breakage.  My only complaint is that if you don&#x27;t use them frequently and have them for a long time they tend to dry out a little and lose the flavor potency.</li>
            <li> These are great as breath fresheners. I buy them as stocking stuffers for my husband every year.</li>
            <li> Got this to quit smoking.  It works pretty well when you want to keep your mouth busy and gives you that nice menthol-ly taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of advice: It kinda burns after a while, so use sparingly.</li>
            <li> These are worth the price for their intended use and as toothpicks.  They are well-made, aesthetically pleasing, classy understated aroma and taste and effective.  I know of no one who hasn&#x27;t enjoyed them.  They also make very nice little presents even!</li>
            <li> great sticks they are a great way to break a bad habit and they taste good too! highly recommend</li>
            <li> So I got these as a &amp;#34;hunger suppressant&amp;#34; kind of thing.  I&#x27;ve never smoked, but I know that when someone stops smoking, they overeat, because of some &amp;#34;oral fixation&amp;#34;, that sounds dirtier than it actually is.  I figured that if smokers use these as hunger deterrents, than so can I!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main thing you have to watch out for the first time you try these, is that the flavor is REALLY HARSH!  It wasn&#x27;t bad, it was just really strong right off of the bat, and almost sort of burned, until I got used to it.  But after that initial shock, I really enjoyed them.  One lasts for a good while, until the wood becomes chewy and wet and gross, but I got 200 of them for $10, and if it keeps me from eating as much, it&#x27;s way worth it.</li>
            <li> I used to smoke a pack a day. I quit about two years ago, but every now and then I get the urge to buy my fingernails, or the skin on my fingertips. These chewing sticks have reduced my finger biting tremendously. I will be buying these from here on out.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! I use my sticks everyday. They are a great stress reliever and my breath always feels so fresh afterwards. The mint is very strong and takes some getting used to but, overall, great stick!</li>
            <li> These are tea tree oil and menthol infused toothpicks. They have a cooling effect when chewed on. Great alternative to gum. Keeps me entertained for hours. That being said they last forever depending on how quickly you chew them to bits.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Lasts a long time. Strong flavor. Great packaging. This is  NOT a toothpick.  It&#x27;s a  chew-stick!  Love them.</li>
            <li> These are my obsession. I chew when I want something mindless to do while I walk, or do work.</li>
            <li> Bought these when I quit smoking.  Flavor is VERY strong, but it also lasts a long time.  I have since bought more and continue to do so.</li>
            <li> these are tooth picks.</li>
            <li> These things are very powerful.  I&#x27;ve tried them a few times and each time i have to take it out of my mouth as it burns too much.  If noticed my lips get a little swollen for a few days after trying one of these, as it seems to make micro cuts on them.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic. Strong flavor gives great fresh breath. Birchwoodbis hard, so they last a while and are difficult to splinter. Everybody wants one! Ill be buying more.</li>
            <li> I buy these and give them to friends and coworkers. They&#x27;re a huge hit, and could possibly be your &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; if no one else is doing it.</li>
            <li> Tea tree flavor can be overwhelming, and they splinter off a bit too easily, but overall a good product.</li>
            <li> Great.  I bought them for my son who chews his nails but I&#x27;ve been using them too and really like them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been smoke-free for 5 days, but these have been a help, both for having something to focus on orally, and for the taste. The cinnamon is a lot stronger than I expected but it lasts really long. The original flavor one is a little weird but a decent mix with the cinnamon.    The only bad thing I have to say about these is that I was surprised by how they splintered. A friend that recommended them to me raved about how he could chew on them all day, 8+ hours. I must have stronger teeth. I subconsciously bite really hard on them occasionally, and can&#x27;t get them to last more than an hour or two w/o splintering.    Overall, really really happy with them. Wish I would&#x27;ve ordered more - the shipping was almost half the tab.</li>
            <li> These here chewin sticks are the best i ever did chew on.  Good taste and they strong so I&#x27;s can bite em up.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my boyfriend to chew on while he was kicking the nasty habit of smoking and it helped keep him distracted and the flavor is strong as well. Good buy.</li>
            <li> NOM NOM NOM, chew on these all day, they are packed with flavor and are uber fun to chew :)</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t had tea-tree oil flavored things before, it might be wise to taste it first before buying a couple of boxes. But it&#x27;s generally kind of minty and spicy (like cinnamon) at the same time. It&#x27;s refreshing, clean, and botanical in flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my experience these toothpicks are entirely worth the price. They are not just to get the odd thing out of your teeth, they&#x27;re much better for long periods where you&#x27;d like to have the flavor, or something to lightly chew. If you just bite through them, they&#x27;ll get destroyed just like any other toothpick, and they&#x27;ll leave behind a lot of strong flavor (which I like just fine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you rest it in your mouth and just lightly chew it, or turn it and occasionally give it a squeeze to release some more oils, this will last you an entire day with room to spare. I&#x27;ve used mine while travelling and at work, and in some cases have gone a good 8 hours (carefully) tucked that same pick behind my ear, and revisited it later after it had dried out, only to find it was still full of flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like to chew gum for long (my neck and jaw tense up), and when travelling these can be a real comfort, and they are easily discarded responsibly since they end up as an old toothpick or a small pile of splinters. It&#x27;s hard to explain in words how these are worth so much more than normal toothpicks if you&#x27;re unfamiliar with what teat tree oil is like, so again: see if you can sample some, or buy a single box. I&#x27;m pretty sure you&#x27;ll like them if you&#x27;re even interested to begin with, and then it&#x27;s just a matter of seeing how long you can make the toothpick last before you&#x27;ve worn it down to splinters.</li>
            <li> No better toothpick out there.</li>
            <li> Great alternative to a standard toothpick or gum! The only real problem I might have with these is that they splinter too quickly.</li>
            <li> Good size, thickness, and flavor.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these things. My buddy had some a while back and I&#x27;ve been looking for them ever since.&lt;br /&gt;He originally called them, \\&quot;Cuban Walking Sticks.\\&quot; Took me a while to find these chew sticks.&lt;br /&gt;Love the menthol.&lt;br /&gt;Love the flavor.&lt;br /&gt;The toothpick is also very sturdy and won&#x27;t fall apart.</li>
            <li> I did not like the taste at all was not cinnamon!</li>
            <li> For first time users they will prolly seem very strong... after a while I got used to them. I use them along with chantix as quit smoking aids and they work well.</li>
            <li> I am trying to quit smoking, and I have heard from people that Tea Tree chewing sticks would help.  I must admit that they hold up pretty well when I&#x27;m chewing on them, but I just can&#x27;t seem to get used to the flavor.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of things to quit smoking and nothing really works.  These chewing sticks together with the Nicoderm CQ patch works wonders.  The tea tree oils and the menthol takes away the cravings.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly strong taste.  I imagine this taste might overwhelm extreme cravings, so in that respect they may be helpful.</li>
            <li> Nothing like cliche bad ass chewing on a toothpick. and too boot, I have a cylinder holder. Although a customer of mine did comment &amp;#34;do you talk to your mother with that in your mouth?!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> After reading an article on the benefits of Tea Tree Oil I went looking for products that contain it. Many were very pricey and didn&#x27;t really give recommendations on how to use them; like the oil. Since I have some dental issues and had read about the properties in tea tree oil that guard against bacteria I thought this would be a good experiment for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with how convenient it is to pop a toothpick in my mouth and gain healthy results. After about 15 minutes my teeth feel clean, free of plague. It leaves a fresh taste in my mouth and feels soothing. It seems to add moisture to my lips and mouth, relieving me of a &#x27;dry mouth&#x27; feeling that is a frequent occurrence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with the results and will keep purchasing them.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery. My fiancée and I used these to help us quit smoking cigarettes a year ago. Excellent choice for those looking to scratch that itch when quitting cigarettes.</li>
            <li> Great for quitting a habit or just keeping up with oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> Good toothpicks. Tea tree is a natural antibiotic, besides.</li>
            <li> fall apart in my mouth</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil is good and strong, as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picks are just too weak, however. If you need to use these as actual toothpicks, you&#x27;re in for a rude awakening as chunks of wood splinter off in your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> These were a little disappointing, but that may be my own fault for hyping these up to myself by reading some of the exaggerated reviews. If you are expecting to put one of these bad boys in your mouth and get a rush of mouth-thrilling refreshment, you will most likely be disappointed too. However, they do have more flavor and (probably) more natural ingredients than your average mint toothpick, which is more than enough for me to recommend them if you&#x27;re looking for an above average toothpick.  I will say that I may have gotten a bad batch or something because the sticks themselves seem rather stale and splintery. They come all the way from Australia so this shabbiness is not too surprising. I would recommend these over the standard mint toothpick, but not as the amazing party-in-your-mouth you are desiring.</li>
            <li> i had a gum problem some time ago.i stopped chewing gums and taking candies.this is the chewing stick that i use since.it actually helps my teeth and freshens my mouth.</li>
            <li> not at all what I was expecting.  i expected some kind of minty flavor.  this is very strong and petrochemically active.  like pine tar flavor would taste maybe?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware - it&#x27;s exactly as advertised.  must be useful for folks who are trying to quit smoking.  for non-smokers, the flavor is way too strong, imho.</li>
            <li> I bought these chewing sticks as a gift, but had to try just 1. No disappointments here. Just as I expected.</li>
            <li> My partner loves these but I think they leave a horrible after smell.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy these chewing sticks. The wood is nice and solid and doesn&#x27;t splinter, and the tea tree and other oils make for a great, clean taste and sensation. The regular flavour has a bit of cinnamon taste to it already, so I&#x27;m glad that I didn&#x27;t go for the cinnamon variety.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d reccomend them to any regular toothpick-chewer or anyone trying to replace an oral fixation with something healthier.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for cinammon toothpicks, don&#x27;t buy these.  I searched for &amp;#34;cinammonr toothpicks&amp;#34; on this site.  This product came up.  They are a good strong toothpick and have some sort of taste, however, its taste is unidentifyable and it is not cinammon.  This product should not be in the results of a cinammon toothpick search.</li>
            <li> These things are great. Weird flavor - kinda like crushed up aspirin with mint. Bitter mint. I love it though. I get some duds (brittle or bendy), but that&#x27;s expected considering I went through 4 packs. Love em.</li>
