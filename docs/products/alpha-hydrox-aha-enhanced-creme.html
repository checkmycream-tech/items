            <li>My wife has been using the product successfully for over 10 years</li>
            <li>Alpha Hyrox is PHENOMENAL, amazing stuff!!!</li>
            <li>I learned years ago when I first started using it that the best concentration for an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) is between 8% to 12% and the ideal</li>
            <li>Happily, there is a notable difference in my skin!  </li>
            <li>A good cream to wear at night, or if you do not wear foundation.</li>

            <li>This is a good seller, the product comes on time, wrapped well.  </li>
            <li>Do as instructed, its a good product used with Enhanced Lotion.</li>
            <li>Good for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for Alpha Hydroxy cream for sometime and was delighted to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>At 68 that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li>Feels good on the face but doesn&#x27;t do any miracles</li>
            <li>I bought this because the reviews were good.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes people even remark that my skin looks good .</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>This product arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li>Good Luck</li>
            <li>I have read many good things about this product, that it is a great wrinkle reducer, and a great exfoliate.</li>
            <li>Alpha Hydrox Optimum Series, Retinol Night ResQ,</li>
            <li>Once upon a time, I went in search of my Skin Charming.</li>
            <li>Unlike Prince Charming, however, my Skin Charming needed to be proven scientifically before I&#x27;d accept a dinner invitation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my Skin Charming.</li>
            <li>Great and effective product.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so smooth and it works wonderfully with my vitamin c serum.</li>
            <li>It is really good as a foot cream.</li>
            <li>I follow up with a good moisturizing product to avoid dryness.</li>
            <li>and I want to be sure it keeps doing good for my skin and isn&#x27;t just a fluke!</li>
            <li>Like Prince Charming, it had to be perfect: effective, affordable, and easily accessible.</li>
            <li>and I am very satisfied with the results of using it.</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with my purchase of Alpha Hydrox AHA Enhanced Creme, Anti-Wrinkle Exfoliant.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love it !</li>
            <li>THIS IS ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY THE BEST</li>
            <li>Works great and makes your skin feel so smooth..</li>
            <li>Alpha Hydroxy is amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing what it does.</li>
            <li>Now I sound like Dr. Suess lol.</li>
            <li>so in my pursuit I have stopped using this cream and then realize that my skin just does not look as nice as it used to..  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen a lot of results but to be honest, I use the product sporadically.</li>
            <li>Too soon to tell if it is effective.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t expect a mimerical but some improvement would be nice.....</li>
            <li>It is a nice cream that feels good on your face, but it&#x27;s not any magic cream or highly effective, life changing product.</li>
            <li>I really liked it.  </li>
            <li>It keeps blemishes (monthly hormone kind) under control and smooths out my skin.</li>
            <li>I thought by law if not by a company&#x27;s own prudence that a safety seal and expiration date should be placed on all cosmetic product.  </li>
            <li>and I do have nice skin.</li>
            <li>nice and creamy plus exfoliating is agreat bonus.</li>
            <li>Be sure and use a good moisturizer with any retinol product</li>
            <li>Nice products, lightens spots, improves texture, helps with wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I have been using this lotion for more than a year, and I love it!</li>
            <li>This is a very good product for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Great product for the price and high in AHA that is good for your aging skin.</li>
            <li>offers the best deal I can find.</li>
            <li>Love love love it!</li>
            <li>and it is so reasonably priced and of course it is available on Amazon, bless them â™¥</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s effective for more than just skin tone, though that&#x27;s the most immediate effect.</li>
            <li>The store brand I tried just didn&#x27;t absorb as well as this product which is very important so that it does not get into your eyes while you sleep.    </li>
            <li>I was pretty sure that this cream would not work, but it had some great reviews</li>
            <li>product spreads nicely on your skin without any greasy residue or the strong scent I can&#x27;t handle.</li>
            <li>I purchased both together because I had some large pores that I wanted to get rid of and had read that glycolic acid was the safe thing to use.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this product.</li>
            <li>sure</li>
            <li>I have used Alpha Hydrox AHA Cream for many years</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>two thumbs up :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying the cream.</li>
            <li>giving this a one star because of no expiration date..it helps somewhat, but I quit using, I find Eo&#x27;s of more benefit</li>
            <li>I have tried every cream out there and this one is like most of them.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and love how it keeps the wrinkles at bay.  </li>
            <li>and it seemed OK, started putting it on my face and it burned my skin</li>
            <li>Two more nights of this and</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen many changes on that front yet, but I didn&#x27;t purchase it for that anyway.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have used t his product for many years and my complexion has stayed unwrinkled.  </li>
            <li>Love the tingling sensation your get upon application.</li>
            <li>I really love this product i notice when i have a pimple</li>
            <li>I just love it</li>
            <li>I think they should be more patient.</li>
            <li>Now i am glad that i gave it a try.</li>
            <li>So glad to find it here.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>that does a better job for the price.</li>
            <li>Not even sure it moisterizes well.  </li>
            <li>I just ordered two more bottles of cleanser, and two additional bottles of toner.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product, however, I stepped out from \\&quot;fulfilled by Amazon\\&quot; or</li>
            <li>However, I still suggest that one choose a reputable seller to purchase this product.</li>
            <li>I Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This is a great product it really work</li>
            <li>My complexion is more even.</li>
            <li>what more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the AH Retinol Night ResQ at bedtime and just put some Vitamin E oil on top of that after about 15 or 20 min.  </li>
            <li>I just love the stuff...</li>
            <li>And it is better to use it in the night i believe</li>
            <li>The night replenishing cream is much better.</li>
            <li>Love it and love the price.</li>
            <li>I am sure I will reorder.</li>
            <li>I used a better moisturizer over this when I used this (now I use Paulas Choice).</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s because of this product, though I mostly use this on my hands, and the lighter cream on my face.</li>
            <li>Love this product, use it for sun spots and sun damage after being in the sun all summer.</li>
            <li>I use it on my neck, too, and my neck looks better.</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t many things that work for everyone, so don&#x27;t be discouraged by any contrary reviews.</li>
            <li>One caution is to make sure to use sun screen with this product as it can make your skin more susceptible to the sun.</li>
            <li>Would order more now</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what happened because twenty years ago they had amazing products for a cheap price.  </li>
            <li>I have reordered this product more than once.</li>
            <li>I love Alpha Hydrox.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I saw results the first day!!!</li>
            <li>Since using this cream I have been able to wake and feel pretty good about walking around without using something to cover my blemishes.</li>
            <li>The price is great too, I&#x27;m so happy I found such an effective product at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li>I am 76 yrs old and everybody always remarks how beautiful my skin looks</li>
            <li>Besides, the information says it is good on all kind of skins but sensitive.</li>
            <li>If you find that you wear heavier stuff (like foundations and powders), I&#x27;d say try the Oil Free Treatment, as it&#x27;s more of a gel than a cream, so it soaks in even more...</li>
            <li>switched from the Oil Free Treatment (which is great, soaks in fast and easy to wear under makeup...</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about 2 months now, and have noticed more of a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to my skin, and a reduction of fine lines.</li>
            <li>This is a very cool product.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I&#x27;m a premed student so most of my research was covered in my chem classes already, but I still made some mistakes when using it out of impatience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since using this product I have noticed the scars flattening out and becoming softer.</li>
            <li>Does just what it sais it does for real, and good price.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this cream!</li>
            <li>My skins soaks it up very quickly, and it appears to soften lines.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li>so I tend to scar easily and get spots.</li>
            <li>I think this was just too strong for my skin.</li>
            <li>If you are someone who will not go out without makeup, this can really help you feel more comfortable in your own skin.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I use this kind of product.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t notice any improvements with fine skin texture changes.</li>
            <li>It has not made a difference in fine lines or wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t help with any fine lines at all.  </li>
            <li>This consistency is much better and absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>definitely recommend this product, it&#x27;s a great, truly effective creme, and you can&#x27;t really beat the price!</li>
            <li>It is fine, but I&#x27;d stick to the Lotion, which is fantastic for clearing skin, making it brighter, helping even skin tones, and diminishing the look of wrinkles</li>
            <li>I just hope it does not mess with my very clear and flawless complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and now my skin is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, not oily, and I use it day and night.  </li>
            <li>(oil free- has hyaluronic acid) and it helps with milia.</li>
            <li>The formula was gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li>I actually notice my skin getting firmer with this product and it is a great price.  </li>
            <li>They give you a free Alpha Hydrox face wash free with every purchase</li>
            <li>it is cheap</li>
            <li>It works and it&#x27;s cheap.  </li>
            <li>Trader Joe&#x27;s sells it cheap, but I bet you can find it here on Amazon, too...</li>
            <li>The AHA&#x27;s are great, the moisturizer is only so-so.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a light skinned multi racial woman and the pigment in my skin marks every scar and bump.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t creamy  or smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is the best Anti-Wrinkle crÃ¨me you could ever use in your whole life - especially if you are over 40!  </li>
            <li>Quickly balanced my skin, and hands down, it has been the best for reducing (and dare I say, eliminating???)</li>
            <li>The best thing is they are high in concentrate and low in price that is an A+++ in my book.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it in awhile, but everytime I do, it diminishes fine lines on my face quickly.</li>
            <li>Low price point, effective, and accessible: I cannot recommend more.</li>
            <li>Everything is pH balanced, my skin has never felt so incredibly clean, and I always use the Alpha Hydrox Foaming Cleanser with a washcloth.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t advise using an astringent to clean your skin beforehand, but I do recommend using it after an hour or so.</li>
            <li>In the morning I rinse it off and it leaves my skin looking great, neither dry nor greasy.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s ok purely as a moisturizer).</li>
            <li>Neoteric&#x27;s website I&#x27;ve signed up for monthly special alerts.</li>
            <li>The jar still looks full which means I probably haven&#x27;t used it a lot either.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good product for what I use it for</li>
            <li>This product was a  good deal for the actual price.</li>
            <li>It took a good 5 to 6 weeks to see results, but my skin definitely is smoother and the wrinkles are not as &amp;#34; deep&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve used this for about a month my skin is MUCH smoother and is much more clear, I can even skip the foundation, but if I do use foundation it goes on nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Alph Hydrox nourishing cleanser with this.</li>
            <li>This is not a bad price for this stuff..trust me.</li>
            <li>When I was in high school, I used the Alpha Hydrox Oil Free Treatment to help stave off some acne, but like most things around that time, I was flighty and quickly forgot about it....</li>
            <li>really quick</li>
            <li>and since you&#x27;re probably using this to improve the overall quality, it would be in your best interest to avoid an actual sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Of course, stay out of the sun for long periods of time &amp; use lotion that has good protection.</li>
            <li>Love it, easy to take away dead skin, bit tickle at first, but get it over very soon, nice stuff!</li>
            <li>Im lazy, so once my skin is flawless I just don&#x27;t worry as much.</li>
            <li>and then once it&#x27;s gone, I&#x27;m left with beautiful clear skin.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>If you have any doubts, go to the Neoteric website, and read the actual blog for why Alpha Hydrox products are so amazing.</li>
            <li>I see an improvement in my smile wrinkles.</li>
            <li>best kept secret.</li>
            <li>Would advise anyone who uses this to also use a moisturizer that contains sunscreen because this isn&#x27;t a moisturizing cream and it will make your skin more sensitive to sunlight.  </li>
            <li>but I am pleased with it thus far.</li>
            <li>Just lots of fun stuff going on!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Now they cost twice what they did then, understandable with inflation, but don&#x27;t work worth a darn.  </li>
            <li>I hope it as good as other products I purchased from you.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because of all the other good reviews, however, I have been using it for about 3 weeks</li>
            <li>I think this product is a winner and priced right.</li>
            <li>Right now I just want to cry, can&#x27;;t go out like I planned...</li>
            <li>The concentration is just right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a difference after using this product - especially right out of show or after exfoliating.</li>
            <li>My laugh lines are completely erased and my skin feels super smooth when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li>But I used this every night and eventually my skin was just super smooth and really soft.</li>
            <li>It certainly does what its supposed to do...renews your skin!  </li>
            <li>I am in my early 50&#x27;s and haven&#x27;t always taken good care of my skin, especially protecting it from the sun.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite sight to shop, so I really wasn&#x27;t too surprised to find it there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since started applying it to my entire face and rubbing in because I read further that glycolic acid is great for acne scarring as well.  </li>
            <li>Luckily,  I found it at Amazon at reasonable prize.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough great things about the entire line of AH!  </li>
            <li>Great product, really works to exfoliate dead skin cells.</li>
            <li>The wash worked very very well and the cream has done just as well.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so soft (but not greasy), and it diminishes the appearance of my fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Alpha product lines tend to fly low in an already over stimulated market of commercials and new product wonders that appear in constantly in an ever changing money making industry devoted to our own vanity (present company included).  </li>
            <li>ON YOUR FACE AND CONSISTENTLY USE THIS PRODUCT.....</li>
            <li>My skin may need more adjusting, so I will update this review later.</li>
            <li>I still love the way it makes me feel on the next morning</li>
            <li>Be sure to use moisturizer  ten minutes after applying  the AHA.  </li>

            <li>;)</li>
            <li>On my first jar</li>
            <li>Glad to have found it on Amazon - been looking locally for years.  </li>
            <li>really like how this makes my skin feel!</li>
            <li>it goes on like silk your skin feels so soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>Make my face soft, smooth &amp; helps with wrinkles.</li>
            <li>and I remember having a tinkling feeling for the first 3-4 days.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>Love this cream, I actually think is works!!!!!</li>
            <li>Lays nicely, and oddly enough, because it helps my skin stay balanced, my makeup (which is only the tinted moisturizer, eye shadow/powder liner/mascara and light blush) stays put all day.</li>
            <li>and this is really working now!</li>
            <li>It keeps my face smooth and soft and helps with the blackheads.  </li>
            <li>I tried out many different brands, looked into retinol, and did my research in hopes of finding my one acne-cure all.</li>
            <li>My skin was softer after the first use.</li>
            <li>I do not constantly run to a mirror to make sure my cover up is staying put.</li>
            <li>However, when I apply my liquid foundation over the top it doesn&#x27;t blend easily, and results in little flakes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a great treatment for stretchmarks, old and new, if continued for a *long* period of time, promoting collagen production in the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to see it on Amazon as I have had to order it directly from the company before, since it&#x27;s not carried in stores around where I live.</li>
            <li>Love it, Been using for 10 years and it lightly sloughs dead skin,</li>
            <li>This is an excellent high quality product that has prompted this regular amazon customer but never before reviewer to come back and actually leave a review!</li>
            <li>I also use their skin lightener and the two products working together are making a positive difference.  </li>
            <li>This one shows real improvement  quickly and doesn&#x27;t make me suffer through a drying or flaking stage like so many other products that claim to boost collagen.</li>
            <li>It was not expensive at all, and I figured that if it didn&#x27;t work, it was a cheap enough moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I would recommend for people with large pours.</li>
            <li>the pure Alpha-Hydrox pictured here.  </li>
            <li>I have hereditary large pores.</li>
            <li>just plain ol look better!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m super sensitive to smells).&lt;br /&gt;It stings quite a bit when you first start using it, and my skin looked pretty red too, but that doesn&#x27;t last more than 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>I wear this nearly every night and in the morning my skin feel sooo soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t anything else to say about this.</li>
            <li>So needs some time to see if it really works.</li>
            <li>i didnt really see much of a difference with this product.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>This makes a real difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>Very disappointed.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>but it is very bothersome.</li>
            <li>It really does help keep the wrinkles away.</li>
            <li>I really want to try their 12% AHA body lotion and their foot cream.</li>
            <li>Note: this product has really gone up in price,</li>
            <li>n fast too</li>
            <li>I never got a break, haha...</li>
            <li>B000052YM8 Alpha Hydrox Oil Free Treatment 10 Percent AHA 1.7 fl oz.]]), to this cream simply because Ulta was out of it when I went to pick some up about a year ago.  </li>
            <li>But I need to say it is really really irreated.</li>
            <li>I really won&amp;#34;t</li>
            <li>You need to approach this product with respect for the fact that it&#x27;s an acid or you&#x27;ll turn yourself into one very burned lizard. &#x27;</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re running out before then, you&#x27;re either a conehead (can I get your autograph?) or using too much on your face/neck.</li>
            <li>As described, fast shipping</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, not the best cutting edge moisturizer around.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>(I sound like a commercial).</li>
            <li>This creme does make skin much smoother, and much fresher.</li>
            <li>I had expected this product to be more moisturizing than the other Alpha Hydrox products I&#x27;ve tried and loved, especially the Alpha Hydrox Enhanced Lotion.</li>
            <li>I found their products, and ordered the foaming facial cleaner, toner/astringent, oil free moisturizer, and their heavier 2 oz jar of moisturizer for normal skin.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed a dramatic improvement in my skin, but it was in pretty good shape to begin with.</li>
            <li>I previously purchased the gel from acne skin and had not such good results.</li>
            <li>This is the best AHA for mature skin...not too harsh and I wear it everyday.  </li>
            <li>I does not smell good; however, I think it is real AHA, and I can feel it soften my skin, even few days after starting.</li>
            <li>I feel like this cream really helps my skin to not only appear healthy but also to actually be healthier.</li>
            <li>I actually have stuck with the cream ever since because I find I like the feel of it a little better, and it seems you have a little more wiggle room than with the oil free treatment...</li>
            <li>and of course I&#x27;m getting older.  </li>
            <li>so maybe I&#x27;d have to be a bit older to see a difference.  </li>
            <li>makes the face look &amp; feel vibrant.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine having better results with much more expensive products.</li>
            <li>Will continue using this and most likely will repurchase when it gets low.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use much of this stuff for it to work well,so one small supply will last a good while.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for men &amp; women.</li>
            <li>(that&#x27;s important b/c Alpha-Hydroxy alone will dry out your skin) and in a couple of month you will be amazed at the difference!  </li>
            <li>Thought the product will work a little better.</li>
            <li>I see fewer lines and my face is soft and much smoother.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for years and find it really keeps my skin young looking.</li>
            <li>Im am 33 years old, don&#x27;t drink much water...</li>
            <li>When I first started using  this years ago, I went through the rough part before the calm.</li>
            <li>From what I know, this product removes top layer &#x27;dead&#x27; cells.</li>
            <li>but it should subside shortly after it is absorbed.  </li>
            <li>The instructions say that is normal, though.</li>
            <li>After washing, I used my normal witch hazel toner, and</li>
            <li>While the cover says it is for normal skins.</li>
            <li>IF you have normal skin, you can get away with this for a day-time moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I usually put this on before my facial moisturizer (I actually use a different brand, Boots Botanics Organic day cream, but use whatever you find works best for you...) and tinted moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>This is important for those with thin easy to tear or stretchy skin.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin, and I even used to have dry patches on my cheeks, which didn&#x27;t look good at all, especially with makeup.</li>
            <li>I love this because it is not harsh, but I can&#x27;t use it after a scrub or it burns a little.</li>
            <li>Who can live without it?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other alpha hydroxy acids in the past with a higher concentration of AHA but the pH was too high to make it effective.</li>
            <li>I have been using for 20+ years and after shaving, it really helps my general complexion and has gotten rid of redness/irritation on my neck.</li>
            <li>I just left my first review ever for the foaming face wash in this product line, and I wanted to come here and leave a review for this cream too.  </li>
            <li>but the cream is cheaper and works exactly the same.</li>
            <li>Nothing else has worked for me thus far!</li>
            <li>I am always getting compliments on my skin and I am 64 years old!</li>
            <li>It has a very strong smell of sour milk for the first couple of minutes and since I need this especially for the dry skin around my nose, it was unavoidable.</li>
            <li>not sure if this does much for lines and wrinkles- first, I don&#x27;t have many, and I haven&#x27;t used this long enough, but this creme does a wonderful job for dry skin with patches, and for uneven skin, through faster renewal, and dead skin cell removal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The oil free moisturizer I use in the daytime, this one I typically use at night.</li>
            <li>Useful inexpensive addition to my drawer of creams to treat my dry skin both day and night.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 59 year old male who has been using Alpha Hydroxy on my face since 1995.I first discovered it in a dollar store in a 12 ounce bottle for 1 buck plus tax.</li>
            <li>After a week of use, I had a noticeable reduction of fine lines, dull patches and large pores.</li>
            <li>A lot of small cream containers seem to empty so quickly, so it&#x27;s great that this product has a silky glide that seems to cover your entire face in no time.</li>
            <li>The redness on my forehead did get a little better the next day.</li>
            <li>This cream is so effective that I had to cut back on it a little and mix it in with some regular face cream.</li>
            <li>Now I am afraid to use mine lol</li>
            <li>(MINE WAS), IT TAKES ABOUT TWO OR THREE WEEKS BEFORE YOUR SKIN BEGINS TO REALLY CLEAR UP, AND</li>
            <li>It helped clear all my acne scars and is keeping wrinkles at bay.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use it to keep my face clear.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin prone to breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 51 years old.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s never too early to start</li>
            <li>The old skin sloughing off.</li>
            <li>I use it daily under my foundation and it keeps me skin moist without being greasy...and that is really saying something when you have combination skin.</li>
            <li>I have combo sensitive skin</li>
            <li>/I&#x27;ve even been &#x27;accused&#x27; of being somewhere between 39 and early 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>then I spot treated my problem areas with this and didn&#x27;t rub it in completely immediately.  </li>
            <li>Have been using this product for over a year and it has helped reduce the amount of adult cystic acne on my face.  </li>
            <li>If you get it anywhere near your eyes it burns.  </li>
            <li>So I have not comment  so far.</li>
            <li>She is 57 now, and does look young for her age, so if your looking for the fountain of youth, don&#x27;t know if this is it, but I know she swears by it.</li>
            <li>but after awhile, my skin feels soft.</li>
            <li>but when I do tell people I&#x27;m 55 years old, their jaws literally drop.</li>
            <li>so far I see no changes in my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 44 years old, I&#x27;ve never been a sun-worshiper.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve retired my benzoyl peroxide gel completely since switching to this product.  </li>
            <li>Put to much on and my face went lobster red.</li>
            <li>Give it a month, not a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.waiting for the wrinkles to disappear.</li>
            <li>have young, sensitive, acne prone skin and would rather take mayo to my face than ever use this again.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This might work for more mature, drier, thick</li>
            <li>when I ran out of my last bottle( this is my second this time around), I noticed the difference right away.</li>
            <li>Oh, and I agree with other reviews, has definitely helped smooth out some scarring, too...</li>
            <li>But shortly after that I would occasionally use it and after just a single use the results were visible: clear, smooth, porcelain skin.  </li>
            <li>The higher the pH, the greater the buffer and that reduces the strength of the AHA and renders it useless.</li>
            <li>I believe this is my third time purchasing this cream since I first bought it to help some facial scars</li>
            <li>This very jar should last over a month and possibally two or more,depending on how often depending on how much yo use(full facial or wrinkles only)I use it on my face and neck once daily</li>
            <li>I used to use this product years ago, and came back to it when my skin needed TLC as I got older.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I checked the other products, which are much more expensive, but I wasn&#x27;t convinced they were better for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Value - I have found a very small amount of this cream goes  a LONG way, which is nice.</li>
            <li>I have not had massive breakouts like I normally would</li>
            <li>Product produces a little reddening of my skin and some mild peeling, no stinging.</li>
            <li>It diminishes large wrinkles and erases totally the smaller ones</li>
            <li>A thin layer of this and a little under eye concealer could be all you need and what a great feeling that is.    </li>
            <li>I have not been using it for very long though, so I can&#x27;t really say how it works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use, because it&#x27;s certainly not doing any harm, but I probably won&#x27;t repurchase (unless my skin all of a sudden takes a sharp turn for the better).</li>
            <li>For daytime use, I apply just a thin layer of this creme, wait for about 5-10 minutes, and apply my spf moisturizer, and then makeup (sunblock is  a must after this product, cause AHA is an exfoliator, and makes your skin more sensitive to UVA/UVB).</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended AHA moisturizers, and this cream is so thick and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed a significant reduction in the number of breakouts I usually have.</li>
            <li>This is a better way to go than ProActive, which will usually tend to over dry the skin with salicylic acids and benzoyl peroxides.</li>
            <li>For the past two years, I&#x27;ve been dealing with mild adult acne.</li>
            <li>This company makes FABULOUS AHA products, but they are hard to find...</li>
            <li>I am 36 years old, so I thought if I caught the problems early, I would be saving my skin in the long run.  </li>
            <li>Also, if you have sensitive skin, this cream may sting when you initially apply it</li>
            <li>The next morning I noticed a marked difference in the size of the pores.  </li>
            <li>Often your skin will get worse before its gets better, when you are exfoliating like this.</li>
            <li>And if your skin gets a bit worse before it gets better, remember what I&#x27;ve said.</li>
            <li>I believe by using this first, it closes my pores letting less foundation clog.</li>
            <li>It does improve the \\&quot;look\\&quot; of my skin but can&#x27;t say much about the long term benefits as I haven&#x27;t used it that long.  </li>
            <li>AFTER BEGINNING TO USE IT, YOUR SKIN MAY HAVE A SHORT PERIOD OF GETTING WORSE BEFORE IT GETS BETTER.</li>
            <li>but this product is worth the few dollars extra.  </li>
            <li>As four weeks went by, I am down to the last of my first bottle of cleanser, and ran out of toner.</li>
            <li>but i might tingle a little bit when you first start using it</li>
            <li>, I picked up this little product for the first time when I was around 19.</li>
            <li>I am in my thirties and was starting to get fine lines and a dull complexion, even though I still had occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li>Also, the first week or two after I started using this moisturizer I started to break out a little-</li>
            <li>It takes awhile to work, but the results were long lasting - new location of spots now need attention.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately not for my few spots.</li>
            <li>Had success with it in the past at  diminishing age spots on my face.  </li>
            <li>It would tingle the first few times I put it on</li>
            <li>a few months ago I was getting pretty discouraged by my skins condition.</li>
            <li>It does burn/sting when you first put it on, I have sensitive skin and definitely felt the prickles the first time I have used this - nothing intense or painful, but you should be aware.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has really helped the appearance of the scars to where I hardly notice them anymore and also helps out with any new breakouts.</li>
            <li>Keep away from eyes, including the corners/your temples, as it can be very drying and make the muscles feel *too* tight at times.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years, and while I&#x27;m not sure how many wrinkles it has taken care of, it does make my face feel smoother, and less dry.</li>

            <li> So I put them on to the GREAT product line.</li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> Works great</li>
            <li> This produt did a great job of smoothing and brightening my skin, evening my tone, unclogged pores, and even fading acne scars.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!  </li>
            <li> Very effective.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  </li>
            <li> Best of all, this seller always makes sure I receive the product in just a couple of days.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using the product successfully for over 10 years</li>
            <li> Alpha Hyrox is PHENOMENAL, amazing stuff!!!</li>
            <li> I learned years ago when I first started using it that the best concentration for an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) is between 8% to 12% and the ideal</li>
            <li> Happily, there is a notable difference in my skin!  </li>
            <li> A good cream to wear at night, or if you do not wear foundation.</li>
            <li> Amazon price is fair.</li>
            <li> This is a good seller, the product comes on time, wrapped well.  </li>
            <li> Do as instructed, its a good product used with Enhanced Lotion.</li>
            <li> Good for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for Alpha Hydroxy cream for sometime and was delighted to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> At 68 that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> Feels good on the face but doesn&#x27;t do any miracles</li>
            <li> I bought this because the reviews were good.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes people even remark that my skin looks good .</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li> Good Luck</li>
            <li> I have read many good things about this product, that it is a great wrinkle reducer, and a great exfoliate.</li>
            <li> Alpha Hydrox Optimum Series, Retinol Night ResQ,</li>
            <li> Once upon a time, I went in search of my Skin Charming.</li>
            <li> Unlike Prince Charming, however, my Skin Charming needed to be proven scientifically before I&#x27;d accept a dinner invitation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my Skin Charming.</li>
            <li> Great and effective product.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so smooth and it works wonderfully with my vitamin c serum.</li>
            <li> It is really good as a foot cream.</li>
            <li> I follow up with a good moisturizing product to avoid dryness.</li>
            <li> and I want to be sure it keeps doing good for my skin and isn&#x27;t just a fluke!</li>
            <li> Like Prince Charming, it had to be perfect: effective, affordable, and easily accessible.</li>
            <li> and I am very satisfied with the results of using it.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with my purchase of Alpha Hydrox AHA Enhanced Creme, Anti-Wrinkle Exfoliant.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love it !</li>
            <li> THIS IS ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY THE BEST</li>
            <li> Works great and makes your skin feel so smooth..</li>
            <li> Alpha Hydroxy is amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing what it does.</li>
            <li> Now I sound like Dr. Suess lol.</li>
            <li> so in my pursuit I have stopped using this cream and then realize that my skin just does not look as nice as it used to..  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a lot of results but to be honest, I use the product sporadically.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell if it is effective.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect a mimerical but some improvement would be nice.....</li>
            <li> It is a nice cream that feels good on your face, but it&#x27;s not any magic cream or highly effective, life changing product.</li>
            <li> I really liked it.  </li>
            <li> It keeps blemishes (monthly hormone kind) under control and smooths out my skin.</li>
            <li> I thought by law if not by a company&#x27;s own prudence that a safety seal and expiration date should be placed on all cosmetic product.  </li>
            <li> and I do have nice skin.</li>
            <li> nice and creamy plus exfoliating is agreat bonus.</li>
            <li> Be sure and use a good moisturizer with any retinol product</li>
            <li> Nice products, lightens spots, improves texture, helps with wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for more than a year, and I love it!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Great product for the price and high in AHA that is good for your aging skin.</li>
            <li> offers the best deal I can find.</li>
            <li> Love love love it!</li>
            <li> and it is so reasonably priced and of course it is available on Amazon, bless them â™¥</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s effective for more than just skin tone, though that&#x27;s the most immediate effect.</li>
            <li> The store brand I tried just didn&#x27;t absorb as well as this product which is very important so that it does not get into your eyes while you sleep.    </li>
            <li> I was pretty sure that this cream would not work, but it had some great reviews</li>
            <li> product spreads nicely on your skin without any greasy residue or the strong scent I can&#x27;t handle.</li>
            <li> I purchased both together because I had some large pores that I wanted to get rid of and had read that glycolic acid was the safe thing to use.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product.</li>
            <li> sure</li>
            <li> I have used Alpha Hydrox AHA Cream for many years</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> two thumbs up :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying the cream.</li>
            <li> giving this a one star because of no expiration date..it helps somewhat, but I quit using, I find Eo&#x27;s of more benefit</li>
            <li> I have tried every cream out there and this one is like most of them.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and love how it keeps the wrinkles at bay.  </li>
            <li> and it seemed OK, started putting it on my face and it burned my skin</li>
            <li> Two more nights of this and</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen many changes on that front yet, but I didn&#x27;t purchase it for that anyway.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have used t his product for many years and my complexion has stayed unwrinkled.  </li>
            <li> Love the tingling sensation your get upon application.</li>
            <li> I really love this product i notice when i have a pimple</li>
            <li> I just love it</li>
            <li> I think they should be more patient.</li>
            <li> Now i am glad that i gave it a try.</li>
            <li> So glad to find it here.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> that does a better job for the price.</li>
            <li> Not even sure it moisterizes well.  </li>
            <li> I just ordered two more bottles of cleanser, and two additional bottles of toner.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, however, I stepped out from \\&quot;fulfilled by Amazon\\&quot; or</li>
            <li> However, I still suggest that one choose a reputable seller to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is a great product it really work</li>
            <li> My complexion is more even.</li>
            <li> what more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the AH Retinol Night ResQ at bedtime and just put some Vitamin E oil on top of that after about 15 or 20 min.  </li>
            <li> I just love the stuff...</li>
            <li> And it is better to use it in the night i believe</li>
            <li> The night replenishing cream is much better.</li>
            <li> Love it and love the price.</li>
            <li> I am sure I will reorder.</li>
            <li> I used a better moisturizer over this when I used this (now I use Paulas Choice).</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s because of this product, though I mostly use this on my hands, and the lighter cream on my face.</li>
            <li> Love this product, use it for sun spots and sun damage after being in the sun all summer.</li>
            <li> I use it on my neck, too, and my neck looks better.</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t many things that work for everyone, so don&#x27;t be discouraged by any contrary reviews.</li>
            <li> One caution is to make sure to use sun screen with this product as it can make your skin more susceptible to the sun.</li>
            <li> Would order more now</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened because twenty years ago they had amazing products for a cheap price.  </li>
            <li> I have reordered this product more than once.</li>
            <li> I love Alpha Hydrox.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I saw results the first day!!!</li>
            <li> Since using this cream I have been able to wake and feel pretty good about walking around without using something to cover my blemishes.</li>
            <li> The price is great too, I&#x27;m so happy I found such an effective product at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li> I am 76 yrs old and everybody always remarks how beautiful my skin looks</li>
            <li> Besides, the information says it is good on all kind of skins but sensitive.</li>
            <li> If you find that you wear heavier stuff (like foundations and powders), I&#x27;d say try the Oil Free Treatment, as it&#x27;s more of a gel than a cream, so it soaks in even more...</li>
            <li> switched from the Oil Free Treatment (which is great, soaks in fast and easy to wear under makeup...</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 months now, and have noticed more of a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to my skin, and a reduction of fine lines.</li>
            <li> This is a very cool product.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I&#x27;m a premed student so most of my research was covered in my chem classes already, but I still made some mistakes when using it out of impatience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since using this product I have noticed the scars flattening out and becoming softer.</li>
            <li> Does just what it sais it does for real, and good price.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this cream!</li>
            <li> My skins soaks it up very quickly, and it appears to soften lines.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li> so I tend to scar easily and get spots.</li>
            <li> I think this was just too strong for my skin.</li>
            <li> If you are someone who will not go out without makeup, this can really help you feel more comfortable in your own skin.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I use this kind of product.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t notice any improvements with fine skin texture changes.</li>
            <li> It has not made a difference in fine lines or wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help with any fine lines at all.  </li>
            <li> This consistency is much better and absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this product, it&#x27;s a great, truly effective creme, and you can&#x27;t really beat the price!</li>
            <li> It is fine, but I&#x27;d stick to the Lotion, which is fantastic for clearing skin, making it brighter, helping even skin tones, and diminishing the look of wrinkles</li>
            <li> I just hope it does not mess with my very clear and flawless complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and now my skin is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, not oily, and I use it day and night.  </li>
            <li> (oil free- has hyaluronic acid) and it helps with milia.</li>
            <li> The formula was gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li> I actually notice my skin getting firmer with this product and it is a great price.  </li>
            <li> They give you a free Alpha Hydrox face wash free with every purchase</li>
            <li> it is cheap</li>
            <li> It works and it&#x27;s cheap.  </li>
            <li> Trader Joe&#x27;s sells it cheap, but I bet you can find it here on Amazon, too...</li>
            <li> The AHA&#x27;s are great, the moisturizer is only so-so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a light skinned multi racial woman and the pigment in my skin marks every scar and bump.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t creamy  or smooth.  </li>
            <li> This is the best Anti-Wrinkle crÃ¨me you could ever use in your whole life - especially if you are over 40!  </li>
            <li> Quickly balanced my skin, and hands down, it has been the best for reducing (and dare I say, eliminating???)</li>
            <li> The best thing is they are high in concentrate and low in price that is an A+++ in my book.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it in awhile, but everytime I do, it diminishes fine lines on my face quickly.</li>
            <li> Low price point, effective, and accessible: I cannot recommend more.</li>
            <li> Everything is pH balanced, my skin has never felt so incredibly clean, and I always use the Alpha Hydrox Foaming Cleanser with a washcloth.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t advise using an astringent to clean your skin beforehand, but I do recommend using it after an hour or so.</li>
            <li> In the morning I rinse it off and it leaves my skin looking great, neither dry nor greasy.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s ok purely as a moisturizer).</li>
            <li> Neoteric&#x27;s website I&#x27;ve signed up for monthly special alerts.</li>
            <li> The jar still looks full which means I probably haven&#x27;t used it a lot either.</li>
            <li> Overall, a good product for what I use it for</li>
            <li> This product was a  good deal for the actual price.</li>
            <li> It took a good 5 to 6 weeks to see results, but my skin definitely is smoother and the wrinkles are not as &amp;#34; deep&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve used this for about a month my skin is MUCH smoother and is much more clear, I can even skip the foundation, but if I do use foundation it goes on nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Alph Hydrox nourishing cleanser with this.</li>
            <li> This is not a bad price for this stuff..trust me.</li>
            <li> When I was in high school, I used the Alpha Hydrox Oil Free Treatment to help stave off some acne, but like most things around that time, I was flighty and quickly forgot about it....</li>
            <li> really quick</li>
            <li> and since you&#x27;re probably using this to improve the overall quality, it would be in your best interest to avoid an actual sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Of course, stay out of the sun for long periods of time &amp; use lotion that has good protection.</li>
            <li> Love it, easy to take away dead skin, bit tickle at first, but get it over very soon, nice stuff!</li>
            <li> Im lazy, so once my skin is flawless I just don&#x27;t worry as much.</li>
            <li> and then once it&#x27;s gone, I&#x27;m left with beautiful clear skin.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> If you have any doubts, go to the Neoteric website, and read the actual blog for why Alpha Hydrox products are so amazing.</li>
            <li> I see an improvement in my smile wrinkles.</li>
            <li> best kept secret.</li>
            <li> Would advise anyone who uses this to also use a moisturizer that contains sunscreen because this isn&#x27;t a moisturizing cream and it will make your skin more sensitive to sunlight.  </li>
            <li> but I am pleased with it thus far.</li>
            <li> Just lots of fun stuff going on!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Now they cost twice what they did then, understandable with inflation, but don&#x27;t work worth a darn.  </li>
            <li> I hope it as good as other products I purchased from you.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of all the other good reviews, however, I have been using it for about 3 weeks</li>
            <li> I think this product is a winner and priced right.</li>
            <li> Right now I just want to cry, can&#x27;;t go out like I planned...</li>
            <li> The concentration is just right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a difference after using this product - especially right out of show or after exfoliating.</li>
            <li> My laugh lines are completely erased and my skin feels super smooth when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li> But I used this every night and eventually my skin was just super smooth and really soft.</li>
            <li> It certainly does what its supposed to do...renews your skin!  </li>
            <li> I am in my early 50&#x27;s and haven&#x27;t always taken good care of my skin, especially protecting it from the sun.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite sight to shop, so I really wasn&#x27;t too surprised to find it there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since started applying it to my entire face and rubbing in because I read further that glycolic acid is great for acne scarring as well.  </li>
            <li> Luckily,  I found it at Amazon at reasonable prize.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough great things about the entire line of AH!  </li>
            <li> Great product, really works to exfoliate dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> The wash worked very very well and the cream has done just as well.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so soft (but not greasy), and it diminishes the appearance of my fine lines.  </li>
            <li> Alpha product lines tend to fly low in an already over stimulated market of commercials and new product wonders that appear in constantly in an ever changing money making industry devoted to our own vanity (present company included).  </li>
            <li> ON YOUR FACE AND CONSISTENTLY USE THIS PRODUCT.....</li>
            <li> My skin may need more adjusting, so I will update this review later.</li>
            <li> I still love the way it makes me feel on the next morning</li>
            <li> Be sure to use moisturizer  ten minutes after applying  the AHA.  </li>
            <li> I first got my hands on my mom&#x27;s when I was about 10 and managed to burn the h</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> On my first jar</li>
            <li> Glad to have found it on Amazon - been looking locally for years.  </li>
            <li> really like how this makes my skin feel!</li>
            <li> it goes on like silk your skin feels so soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> Make my face soft, smooth &amp; helps with wrinkles.</li>
            <li> and I remember having a tinkling feeling for the first 3-4 days.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> Love this cream, I actually think is works!!!!!</li>
            <li> Lays nicely, and oddly enough, because it helps my skin stay balanced, my makeup (which is only the tinted moisturizer, eye shadow/powder liner/mascara and light blush) stays put all day.</li>
            <li> and this is really working now!</li>
            <li> It keeps my face smooth and soft and helps with the blackheads.  </li>
            <li> I tried out many different brands, looked into retinol, and did my research in hopes of finding my one acne-cure all.</li>
            <li> My skin was softer after the first use.</li>
            <li> I do not constantly run to a mirror to make sure my cover up is staying put.</li>
            <li> However, when I apply my liquid foundation over the top it doesn&#x27;t blend easily, and results in little flakes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a great treatment for stretchmarks, old and new, if continued for a *long* period of time, promoting collagen production in the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to see it on Amazon as I have had to order it directly from the company before, since it&#x27;s not carried in stores around where I live.</li>
            <li> Love it, Been using for 10 years and it lightly sloughs dead skin,</li>
            <li> This is an excellent high quality product that has prompted this regular amazon customer but never before reviewer to come back and actually leave a review!</li>
            <li> I also use their skin lightener and the two products working together are making a positive difference.  </li>
            <li> This one shows real improvement  quickly and doesn&#x27;t make me suffer through a drying or flaking stage like so many other products that claim to boost collagen.</li>
            <li> It was not expensive at all, and I figured that if it didn&#x27;t work, it was a cheap enough moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I would recommend for people with large pours.</li>
            <li> the pure Alpha-Hydrox pictured here.  </li>
            <li> I have hereditary large pores.</li>
            <li> just plain ol look better!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m super sensitive to smells).&lt;br /&gt;It stings quite a bit when you first start using it, and my skin looked pretty red too, but that doesn&#x27;t last more than 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I wear this nearly every night and in the morning my skin feel sooo soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t anything else to say about this.</li>
            <li> So needs some time to see if it really works.</li>
            <li> i didnt really see much of a difference with this product.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> This makes a real difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> but it is very bothersome.</li>
            <li> It really does help keep the wrinkles away.</li>
            <li> I really want to try their 12% AHA body lotion and their foot cream.</li>
            <li> Note: this product has really gone up in price,</li>
            <li> n fast too</li>
            <li> I never got a break, haha...</li>
            <li> B000052YM8 Alpha Hydrox Oil Free Treatment 10 Percent AHA 1.7 fl oz.]]), to this cream simply because Ulta was out of it when I went to pick some up about a year ago.  </li>
            <li> But I need to say it is really really irreated.</li>
            <li> I really won&amp;#34;t</li>
            <li> You need to approach this product with respect for the fact that it&#x27;s an acid or you&#x27;ll turn yourself into one very burned lizard. &#x27;</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re running out before then, you&#x27;re either a conehead (can I get your autograph?) or using too much on your face/neck.</li>
            <li> As described, fast shipping</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, not the best cutting edge moisturizer around.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> (I sound like a commercial).</li>
            <li> This creme does make skin much smoother, and much fresher.</li>
            <li> I had expected this product to be more moisturizing than the other Alpha Hydrox products I&#x27;ve tried and loved, especially the Alpha Hydrox Enhanced Lotion.</li>
            <li> I found their products, and ordered the foaming facial cleaner, toner/astringent, oil free moisturizer, and their heavier 2 oz jar of moisturizer for normal skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed a dramatic improvement in my skin, but it was in pretty good shape to begin with.</li>
            <li> I previously purchased the gel from acne skin and had not such good results.</li>
            <li> This is the best AHA for mature skin...not too harsh and I wear it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I does not smell good; however, I think it is real AHA, and I can feel it soften my skin, even few days after starting.</li>
            <li> I feel like this cream really helps my skin to not only appear healthy but also to actually be healthier.</li>
            <li> I actually have stuck with the cream ever since because I find I like the feel of it a little better, and it seems you have a little more wiggle room than with the oil free treatment...</li>
            <li> and of course I&#x27;m getting older.  </li>
            <li> so maybe I&#x27;d have to be a bit older to see a difference.  </li>
            <li> makes the face look &amp; feel vibrant.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine having better results with much more expensive products.</li>
            <li> Will continue using this and most likely will repurchase when it gets low.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use much of this stuff for it to work well,so one small supply will last a good while.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for men &amp; women.</li>
            <li> (that&#x27;s important b/c Alpha-Hydroxy alone will dry out your skin) and in a couple of month you will be amazed at the difference!  </li>
            <li> Thought the product will work a little better.</li>
            <li> I see fewer lines and my face is soft and much smoother.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and find it really keeps my skin young looking.</li>
            <li> Im am 33 years old, don&#x27;t drink much water...</li>
            <li> When I first started using  this years ago, I went through the rough part before the calm.</li>
            <li> From what I know, this product removes top layer &#x27;dead&#x27; cells.</li>
            <li> but it should subside shortly after it is absorbed.  </li>
            <li> The instructions say that is normal, though.</li>
            <li> After washing, I used my normal witch hazel toner, and</li>
            <li> While the cover says it is for normal skins.</li>
            <li> IF you have normal skin, you can get away with this for a day-time moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I usually put this on before my facial moisturizer (I actually use a different brand, Boots Botanics Organic day cream, but use whatever you find works best for you...) and tinted moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> This is important for those with thin easy to tear or stretchy skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and I even used to have dry patches on my cheeks, which didn&#x27;t look good at all, especially with makeup.</li>
            <li> I love this because it is not harsh, but I can&#x27;t use it after a scrub or it burns a little.</li>
            <li> Who can live without it?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other alpha hydroxy acids in the past with a higher concentration of AHA but the pH was too high to make it effective.</li>
            <li> I have been using for 20+ years and after shaving, it really helps my general complexion and has gotten rid of redness/irritation on my neck.</li>
            <li> I just left my first review ever for the foaming face wash in this product line, and I wanted to come here and leave a review for this cream too.  </li>
            <li> but the cream is cheaper and works exactly the same.</li>
            <li> Nothing else has worked for me thus far!</li>
            <li> I am always getting compliments on my skin and I am 64 years old!</li>
            <li> It has a very strong smell of sour milk for the first couple of minutes and since I need this especially for the dry skin around my nose, it was unavoidable.</li>
            <li> not sure if this does much for lines and wrinkles- first, I don&#x27;t have many, and I haven&#x27;t used this long enough, but this creme does a wonderful job for dry skin with patches, and for uneven skin, through faster renewal, and dead skin cell removal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The oil free moisturizer I use in the daytime, this one I typically use at night.</li>
            <li> Useful inexpensive addition to my drawer of creams to treat my dry skin both day and night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 59 year old male who has been using Alpha Hydroxy on my face since 1995.I first discovered it in a dollar store in a 12 ounce bottle for 1 buck plus tax.</li>
            <li> After a week of use, I had a noticeable reduction of fine lines, dull patches and large pores.</li>
            <li> A lot of small cream containers seem to empty so quickly, so it&#x27;s great that this product has a silky glide that seems to cover your entire face in no time.</li>
            <li> The redness on my forehead did get a little better the next day.</li>
            <li> This cream is so effective that I had to cut back on it a little and mix it in with some regular face cream.</li>
            <li> Now I am afraid to use mine lol</li>
            <li> (MINE WAS), IT TAKES ABOUT TWO OR THREE WEEKS BEFORE YOUR SKIN BEGINS TO REALLY CLEAR UP, AND</li>
            <li> It helped clear all my acne scars and is keeping wrinkles at bay.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use it to keep my face clear.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin prone to breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 51 years old.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s never too early to start</li>
            <li> The old skin sloughing off.</li>
            <li> I use it daily under my foundation and it keeps me skin moist without being greasy...and that is really saying something when you have combination skin.</li>
            <li> I have combo sensitive skin</li>
            <li> /I&#x27;ve even been &#x27;accused&#x27; of being somewhere between 39 and early 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> then I spot treated my problem areas with this and didn&#x27;t rub it in completely immediately.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this product for over a year and it has helped reduce the amount of adult cystic acne on my face.  </li>
            <li> If you get it anywhere near your eyes it burns.  </li>
            <li> So I have not comment  so far.</li>
            <li> She is 57 now, and does look young for her age, so if your looking for the fountain of youth, don&#x27;t know if this is it, but I know she swears by it.</li>
            <li> but after awhile, my skin feels soft.</li>
            <li> but when I do tell people I&#x27;m 55 years old, their jaws literally drop.</li>
            <li> so far I see no changes in my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 44 years old, I&#x27;ve never been a sun-worshiper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve retired my benzoyl peroxide gel completely since switching to this product.  </li>
            <li> Put to much on and my face went lobster red.</li>
            <li> Give it a month, not a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.waiting for the wrinkles to disappear.</li>
            <li> have young, sensitive, acne prone skin and would rather take mayo to my face than ever use this again.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This might work for more mature, drier, thick</li>
            <li> when I ran out of my last bottle( this is my second this time around), I noticed the difference right away.</li>
            <li> Oh, and I agree with other reviews, has definitely helped smooth out some scarring, too...</li>
            <li> But shortly after that I would occasionally use it and after just a single use the results were visible: clear, smooth, porcelain skin.  </li>
            <li> The higher the pH, the greater the buffer and that reduces the strength of the AHA and renders it useless.</li>
            <li> I believe this is my third time purchasing this cream since I first bought it to help some facial scars</li>
            <li> This very jar should last over a month and possibally two or more,depending on how often depending on how much yo use(full facial or wrinkles only)I use it on my face and neck once daily</li>
            <li> I used to use this product years ago, and came back to it when my skin needed TLC as I got older.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I checked the other products, which are much more expensive, but I wasn&#x27;t convinced they were better for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Value - I have found a very small amount of this cream goes  a LONG way, which is nice.</li>
            <li> I have not had massive breakouts like I normally would</li>
            <li> Product produces a little reddening of my skin and some mild peeling, no stinging.</li>
            <li> It diminishes large wrinkles and erases totally the smaller ones</li>
            <li> A thin layer of this and a little under eye concealer could be all you need and what a great feeling that is.    </li>
            <li> I have not been using it for very long though, so I can&#x27;t really say how it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use, because it&#x27;s certainly not doing any harm, but I probably won&#x27;t repurchase (unless my skin all of a sudden takes a sharp turn for the better).</li>
            <li> For daytime use, I apply just a thin layer of this creme, wait for about 5-10 minutes, and apply my spf moisturizer, and then makeup (sunblock is  a must after this product, cause AHA is an exfoliator, and makes your skin more sensitive to UVA/UVB).</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended AHA moisturizers, and this cream is so thick and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed a significant reduction in the number of breakouts I usually have.</li>
            <li> This is a better way to go than ProActive, which will usually tend to over dry the skin with salicylic acids and benzoyl peroxides.</li>
            <li> For the past two years, I&#x27;ve been dealing with mild adult acne.</li>
            <li> This company makes FABULOUS AHA products, but they are hard to find...</li>
            <li> I am 36 years old, so I thought if I caught the problems early, I would be saving my skin in the long run.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you have sensitive skin, this cream may sting when you initially apply it</li>
            <li> The next morning I noticed a marked difference in the size of the pores.  </li>
            <li> Often your skin will get worse before its gets better, when you are exfoliating like this.</li>
            <li> And if your skin gets a bit worse before it gets better, remember what I&#x27;ve said.</li>
            <li> I believe by using this first, it closes my pores letting less foundation clog.</li>
            <li> It does improve the \\&quot;look\\&quot; of my skin but can&#x27;t say much about the long term benefits as I haven&#x27;t used it that long.  </li>
            <li> AFTER BEGINNING TO USE IT, YOUR SKIN MAY HAVE A SHORT PERIOD OF GETTING WORSE BEFORE IT GETS BETTER.</li>
            <li> but this product is worth the few dollars extra.  </li>
            <li> As four weeks went by, I am down to the last of my first bottle of cleanser, and ran out of toner.</li>
            <li> but i might tingle a little bit when you first start using it</li>
            <li> , I picked up this little product for the first time when I was around 19.</li>
            <li> I am in my thirties and was starting to get fine lines and a dull complexion, even though I still had occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li> Also, the first week or two after I started using this moisturizer I started to break out a little-</li>
            <li> It takes awhile to work, but the results were long lasting - new location of spots now need attention.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately not for my few spots.</li>
            <li> Had success with it in the past at  diminishing age spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> It would tingle the first few times I put it on</li>
            <li> a few months ago I was getting pretty discouraged by my skins condition.</li>
            <li> It does burn/sting when you first put it on, I have sensitive skin and definitely felt the prickles the first time I have used this - nothing intense or painful, but you should be aware.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has really helped the appearance of the scars to where I hardly notice them anymore and also helps out with any new breakouts.</li>
            <li> Keep away from eyes, including the corners/your temples, as it can be very drying and make the muscles feel *too* tight at times.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, and while I&#x27;m not sure how many wrinkles it has taken care of, it does make my face feel smoother, and less dry.</li>
            <li> If you apply a layer which is too thick to be absorbed, your skin will temporarily (for about 30 minutes or so) turn tomato red!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not bad, just not good either.</li>
            <li> AHA creams are supposed to be applied it first and let set for at least 30 minutes before applying anything else.</li>
            <li> Ive had acne of varying degrees my whole life and as an adult, it&#x27;s the nasty cystic kind.</li>
            <li> I have not used this product long enough to determine if it does what it claims to do or not.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m not old, but years playing sports in the sun were starting to show...</li>
            <li> The cream has actually reduced the look of acne scars, discoloration and dry patches.</li>
            <li> The active ingredients are the same as in much more expensive creams.</li>
            <li> For those of you leary of a slight chemical peel, I do have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Again, I never had deep-set wrinkles, but even still... Been a loyal user now for the past few years.</li>
            <li> The price of the item is good, but I haven&#x27;t seen any results from it, very disappointing since I was hoping it would help with my skin,</li>
            <li> Break in&#x27; your skin, especially if it&#x27;s sensitive--use it every other night before bed, working your way up to daily use.</li>
            <li> Product left my skin very dry...</li>
            <li> I do use another dry skin cream on dry areas like around my nose and eyes as they seem to require extra moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I should note that it is a little harsh at first.  </li>
            <li> The redness doesn&#x27;t take terribly long to go away but just be forewarned.    </li>
            <li> The moisturizer is a moisturizer, so it does that, but as far as lifting or improving my trouble spots...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effects overtime will produce long term effects.</li>
            <li> but I will keep ordering from Amazon as long as they have it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for as long as I can remember</li>
            <li> and i see myself using this for as long as its made.</li>
            <li> long term use skin is lighter, clearer and smoother.</li>
            <li> The secret is the the right pH</li>
            <li> Do other skin care products do the same?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used more expensive anti aging products with little to no results .</li>
            <li> As other people (and the jar itself) have said, you&#x27;ll need an SPF15 sunblock for wearing it around the day: your skin is going to become extra photosensitive</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin softer without dry patches.  </li>
            <li> Skin feels dry after using this cream.</li>
            <li> For night use if my skin feels dry, I sometimes apply some Alpha Hydrox nourishing night creme</li>
            <li> The only thing that helps my cystic acne next to retin a which is harsh.</li>
            <li> A jar of this should last a regular user a month, give or take a few days.</li>
            <li> It was used and not new.  </li>
            <li> although $14.00 is still reasonable, it used to cost roughly $6.00 in the past, so watch for sales and deal breakers!...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Warning: this product breaks me out every single time I put it on.</li>
            <li> Keeps neck and face clear of heat rash and small bumps.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice :(</li>
            <li> My blemishes were calmed down and healing within 48 hours of use last month.</li>
            <li> They are just like any other plain old lotion.</li>
            <li> Its just the bad stuff coming closer to the surface and soon it will be gone leaving behind beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> A tingling sensation when you apply,  Am and PM, and after several weeks&lt;br /&gt;my skin looked slightly irritated and peeled in places.</li>
            <li> ; the product looks very different and smells very different from the product I have purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li> It was what I expected for use before bedtime.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it does nothing for laugh lines (the naso-labial folds beside your mouth.)</li>
            <li> After the 2nd day of using this product it dried the heck out of my husbands face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting harder to find.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy or too heavy, but seems to last on my skin throughout the night.  </li>
            <li> Shipment came on time as expected.  </li>
            <li> I bought several of the  Alpha Hydrox line  of products and there are a few</li>
            <li> This lotion has lightened the dark spots on my face and reduced the dry spots.  </li>
            <li> A serious plus when I consider that I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li> Before trying this I had tried about 25 other beauty products and never had results like this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few weeks, but I can already see the difference!</li>
            <li> It tingles at times, but not to any extreme.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;The small box that included the product was thrown into a larger Amazon box without any protection.</li>
            <li> I am done with all other skin care lines but</li>
            <li> little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> For the price, it is a bargain that lasts far longer than expensive products of a similar nature.  </li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like the smell - kind of gluey and unpleasant.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way and it makes my skin feel heavenly.  </li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin with scaring and dark spots, my skin is an olive complexion</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I have been using this for about six months and have used about half the tub.</li>
            <li> Within a couple of days of using this product there was a bit of stinging and redness and slight peeling but that soon stopped.  </li>
            <li> and I have had a lot less breakouts since beginning this regimen.</li>
            <li> Slight burning, but</li>
            <li> My eyes are not as puffy  and have less wrinkles.</li>
            <li> My complexion is even, scars are fading, and anytime I stop using it for longer than a week and a half, I regret it.</li>
            <li> I notice that I need less foundation and that it&#x27;s easier to apply.</li>
            <li> So the less exfoliation you need, the less it effects your skin.</li>
            <li> As a result, the box became dented and the product inside the jar was a mess once the jar was opened.</li>
            <li> I do still get a few pimples here and there and still have black heads some</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look and feel a little softer...  Moistureizes too.  </li>
            <li> I have used this a few times, but I am always on the prowl for the miracle fountain of youth.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> -Don&#x27;t let The few people that have rash&#x27;s from it&#x27;s usage discourage you.</li>
            <li> , my face is red and swallen and cappilaries are broken.</li>
            <li> Also, the faint crow feet near my eyes are fading.  </li>
            <li> Sloughs off dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also a fan of Freeman&#x27;s Dead Sea mineral mask.</li>
            <li> You might sweat for a few minutes after you apply it, but it should go away rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find that my acne errupts as the skin slouches away( not as harsh as it sounds, it&#x27;s just the exfoliation)</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work for you, your problem isn&#x27;t a buildup of dead skin needing exfoliation.</li>
            <li> Yet another epic fail.  </li>
            <li> I wake up in the morning with no fine line on my brow</li>
            <li> Waited a few days used small amount, no problem at all.</li>
            <li> I received this product just a little over a week ago and have used it at least once a day since.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of other products and this works!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 5 years.  </li>
            <li> and I hate me smile wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I usually use this product for about a month at a time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was supposed to smell that way</li>
            <li> This creme induce allergy, it is not safe to use it.</li>
            <li> stars because I&#x27;m just not sure what product is in the container, and \\&quot;real\\</li>
            <li> Alpha Hydrox has done what it has done for my complection in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it does</li>
            <li> From now on, Ill stick with this stuff because its the only thing that can make my skin look great!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> No top plastic over was over the cream.  </li>
            <li> Since then,it&#x27;s been hard to find in the marketplace,but i don&#x27;t know why.</li>
            <li> I was having a bad case of acne and this product did start to clear it up within two days.</li>
            <li> Do not use it if you have fairly delicate skin...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m mistaken for someone in their late 40s all the time.  </li>
            <li> Anti-Wrinkle Firming Complex - 1.05 oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When it tingles it mean its working.</li>
            <li> Even now (like this cold, cold winter), I sometimes have to step back and adjust my usage for a little while...</li>
            <li> Aha cream faded my acne scars within one weak and started changing my comedones to pimples.</li>
            <li> It is smoothed my skin and decreased my hyperpigmentation</li>
            <li> and then the foundation makes it worse.</li>
            <li> was not happy w/</li>
            <li> I see a noticeable difference in the appearance of my skin, and it isn&#x27;t irritating at all.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have bad acne, just a few blackheads on my forehead.</li>
            <li> it has a little bit of unpleasant chemical smell, but it&#x27;s very faint, and you can&#x27;t smell it on the skin (</li>
            <li> Also the smell is funky and weird, which is why I probably haven&#x27;t used it as often as I should.</li>
            <li> 4 stars because the smell is unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I am almost 60 and the sun spots are very faint</li>
            <li> My eye and forehead wrinkles are not there anymore, and my mouth lines (my \\&quot;parentheses\\&quot; as I call them) are very faint now.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product for my mother and it made her breakout really mad :(</li>
            <li> smoke, all of that stuff that&#x27;s bad for your skin.</li>
            <li> I use foundation to cover my bad skin</li>
            <li> This time around, the bad cycle wasn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> I broke out in painful pimples all over my face and neck where I applied this.  </li>
            <li> After five weeks of faithful use, I must say I am disappointed that this product doesn&#x27;t work like</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> There really isn&#x27;t anything else to say about this. I didn&#x27;t have bad acne, just a few blackheads on my forehead. But I used this every night and eventually my skin was just super smooth and really soft. I used this at night along with some Olay lotion and Clinique pore corrector after Oil cleansing with Olive Oil. In the morning, I washed my face with water and used some Olay and sunscreen and now my skin is fantastic. Thank you, AHA.</li>
            <li> I like this cream. My skins soaks it up very quickly, and it appears to soften lines. However, when I apply my liquid foundation over the top it doesn&#x27;t blend easily, and results in little flakes I have to wipe off. A good cream to wear at night, or if you do not wear foundation.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, and while I&#x27;m not sure how many wrinkles it has taken care of, it does make my face feel smoother, and less dry. I&#x27;m glad to see it on Amazon as I have had to order it directly from the company before, since it&#x27;s not carried in stores around where I live.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected for use before bedtime. I like this product. I would recommend for people with large pours.</li>
            <li> Works wondrerfully and at a great price. I have tried a lot of other products and this works!!! Try it!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 15 years but stopped when Walgreens discontinued it.  So grateful that Amazon carries it.  This is an awesome Fruit Acid Cream. I have extremely sensitive skin prone to breakouts.  This product is amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 5 years.  I&#x27;m 51 years old.  My face was always prone to breakouts and of course I&#x27;m getting older.  Since using this product my face has never, ever been clearer. The cream has actually reduced the look of acne scars, discoloration and dry patches. It&#x27;s a freakin miracle in a bottle. Before trying this I had tried about 25 other beauty products and never had results like this.  TRY IT.</li>
            <li> Useful inexpensive addition to my drawer of creams to treat my dry skin both day and night. This alpha hydroxy anti wrinkle cream gets used day and night while the others sit around waiting forever.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my mother and it made her breakout really mad :( she didn&#x27;t like it . Now I am afraid to use mine lol</li>
            <li> I&#x27;D BATH IN IT IF I COULD. SINCE I STARTED USING IT ALMOST 15 YEARS AGO, I HAVE RECEIVED NUMEROUS COMPLIMENTS FROM PEOPLE ABOUT MY SKIN. IF YOUR SKIN HAS BLACKHEADS AND IS PRONE TO BREAKOUTS (MINE WAS), IT TAKES ABOUT TWO OR THREE WEEKS BEFORE YOUR SKIN BEGINS TO REALLY CLEAR UP, AND AFTER BEGINNING TO USE IT, YOUR SKIN MAY HAVE A SHORT PERIOD OF GETTING WORSE BEFORE IT GETS BETTER. BUT IT WILL, AND I THINK YOU WILL NEVER USE ANYTHING ELSE ON YOUR SKIN AGAIN... I WON&#x27;T.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product. I see an improvement in my smile wrinkles. I&#x27;m only 22 but it&#x27;s never too early to start and I hate me smile wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This is important for those with thin easy to tear or stretchy skin. If you had cystic acne or a collagen/connective tissue disorder, your skin actually needs this to turn over faster.</li>
            <li> I have used this a few times, but I am always on the prowl for the miracle fountain of youth.  so in my pursuit I have stopped using this cream and then realize that my skin just does not look as nice as it used to..  I am done experimenting this it the one I need to stay with as it is the best thing out there.</li>
            <li> Have used this cream for over 10 years. Inexpensive, and seems to work well. I use it at night only. Can&#x27;t purchase in drugs Stores or target any longer. Amazon price is fair.</li>
            <li> THIS IS ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY THE BEST I HAVE FOUND FOR WRINKLES!   FINALLY A PRODUCT THAT ACTUALLY MEET MY EXPECTATIONS!  ANY BY THE WAY IT HAS TO BE THIS BRAND .......FOR SOME REASON THE GENERIC ONES DONT WORK. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;FIND A WRINKE ON YOUR FACE AND CONSISTENTLY USE THIS PRODUCT.....AFTER 3 OR 4 WEEKS YOU WILL SEE THE RESULTS.....UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!        DONT WASTE MONEY ON THE PRICEY ONES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look and feel a little softer...  Moistureizes too.  I have used it for 8 years.</li>
            <li> Have blemishes? This is a wonder cream, no doubt about it. I have been using for 20+ years and after shaving, it really helps my general complexion and has gotten rid of redness/irritation on my neck. Highly recommended for men &amp; women.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a month - almost every day - but I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s doing anything (it&#x27;s ok purely as a moisturizer). I also don&#x27;t like the smell - kind of gluey and unpleasant. I&#x27;ll continue to use, because it&#x27;s certainly not doing any harm, but I probably won&#x27;t repurchase (unless my skin all of a sudden takes a sharp turn for the better).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few weeks, but I can already see the difference! My laugh lines are completely erased and my skin feels super smooth when I wake up in the morning. 4 stars because the smell is unpleasant. But it goes away after about a minute as the product absorbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: this product breaks me out every single time I put it on. My skin may need more adjusting, so I will update this review later. But for now, I can only apply this at night because my face is way too red and splotchy from all the blood rushing to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have been using this for about six months and have used about half the tub. I apply it generously about 2-4 times a week. Only at night, before sleeping. And, of course, I used a sunscreen the next day. I still love the way it makes me feel on the next morning and I&#x27;ve noticed a significant reduction in the number of breakouts I usually have. My wrinkles are also gone. I will keep re-purchasing this until I die.</li>
            <li> I am not an expert on skin care products but I simply believe that after its use that my skin appears refreshed. From what I know, this product removes top layer &#x27;dead&#x27; cells. Do other skin care products do the same? sure but this is my choice!</li>
            <li> It certainly does what its supposed to do...renews your skin!  A tingling sensation when you apply,  Am and PM, and after several weeks&lt;br /&gt;my skin looked slightly irritated and peeled in places. This is good! The old skin sloughing off. Be sure to use moisturizer  ten minutes after applying  the AHA.  Its stong!  Also excellent for your hands, in time will get rid of brown spots.  Unfortunately, it does nothing for laugh lines (the naso-labial folds beside your mouth.)</li>
            <li> i have oily and acne prone skin.  this stuff is great.  it&#x27;s the only glycolic acid cream i can use...i hope alpha hydrox never stops making this!</li>
            <li> I have used Alpha Hydrox AHA Cream for many years and I&#x27;m really not even that old.  I first got my hands on my mom&#x27;s when I was about 10 and managed to burn the h*** out of my eyes.  :)  But shortly after that I would occasionally use it and after just a single use the results were visible: clear, smooth, porcelain skin.  It helped clear all my acne scars and is keeping wrinkles at bay.  I usually use this product for about a month at a time and then I begin to use it again when my skin appears to need it.  If you are someone who will not go out without makeup, this can really help you feel more comfortable in your own skin.  A thin layer of this and a little under eye concealer could be all you need and what a great feeling that is.    I used to use a store brand AHA cream but this product is worth the few dollars extra.  The store brand I tried just didn&#x27;t absorb as well as this product which is very important so that it does not get into your eyes while you sleep.    Please be advised to apply this lightly, especially if you are going to be leaving the house!  If you apply a layer which is too thick to be absorbed, your skin will temporarily (for about 30 minutes or so) turn tomato red!  The redness doesn&#x27;t take terribly long to go away but just be forewarned.    Also, if you have sensitive skin, this cream may sting when you initially apply it but it should subside shortly after it is absorbed.  Just remember, no pain, no gain.  ;)</li>
            <li> I previously purchased the gel from acne skin and had not such good results. This consistency is much better and absorbs quickly into the skin. I feel the potency is stronger with this than the AHA gel. I could feel my skin tingle after application. Will keep posted about my experience with this product.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product for a reasonable price.  I have ordered this product several times and I will buy it again. This is a good seller, the product comes on time, wrapped well.  Do as instructed, its a good product used with Enhanced Lotion.</li>
            <li> This is the only cream that works for me to treat my rosacea.  It&#x27;s light, not oily, and I use it day and night.  Best of all, this seller always makes sure I receive the product in just a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 32 years now. I am 76 yrs old and everybody always remarks how beautiful my skin looks and I know I&lt;br /&gt;owe it to this cream and it is so reasonably priced and of course it is available on Amazon, bless them â™¥</li>
            <li> best kept secret. I am allergic to almost everything- and this works for me&lt;br /&gt;I am even allergic to Clinique!</li>
            <li> After five weeks of faithful use, I must say I am disappointed that this product doesn&#x27;t work like the reviewers say it does.  I use it in conjunction with the AH 14% Serum.  The moisturizer is a moisturizer, so it does that, but as far as lifting or improving my trouble spots...nothing.  I am 36 years old, so I thought if I caught the problems early, I would be saving my skin in the long run.  I don&#x27;t see myself purchasing this product again; it may be time to move on to something that will perform as I need.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  A small amount goes a long way and it makes my skin feel heavenly.  I use it daily under my foundation and it keeps me skin moist without being greasy...and that is really saying something when you have combination skin. It does improve the \\&quot;look\\&quot; of my skin but can&#x27;t say much about the long term benefits as I haven&#x27;t used it that long.  I am in my early 50&#x27;s and haven&#x27;t always taken good care of my skin, especially protecting it from the sun.  I also use their skin lightener and the two products working together are making a positive difference.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> This lotion has lightened the dark spots on my face and reduced the dry spots.  I look a lot clearer overall.  I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s a great moisturizer so I use a separate moisturizer after the the AHA soaks in.  It&#x27;s reduced lines around my eyes too.  I am a big fan.</li>
            <li> Terrible smell and have not seen any results.</li>
            <li> I am. On my first jar and I definitely feel my skin has improved and is softer. I use this at night along with some Clinique washing and toning products. I do use another dry skin cream on dry areas like around my nose and eyes as they seem to require extra moisturizing. I think this product is a winner and priced right.</li>
            <li> Good for acne prone skin. It has Glycols acid- Exfoliating properties-i used it 2x a week, and  a moisturizer after. Used the cerave pm (oil free- has hyaluronic acid) and it helps with milia.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Works great and makes your skin feel so smooth..I&#x27;ll definitely keep buying this product! two thumbs up :)</li>
            <li> I have been looking for Alpha Hydroxy cream for sometime and was delighted to find it on Amazon. It&#x27;s my favorite sight to shop, so I really wasn&#x27;t too surprised to find it there. They have everything, and if they don&#x27;t, they can hook me up to where I might find it. I&#x27;m enjoying the cream. It&#x27;s no miracle cream, but it makes my face and neck feel softer and look softer. At 68 that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> This cream is so effective that I had to cut back on it a little and mix it in with some regular face cream. That means not only does it work, but it will last longer.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a lot of results but to be honest, I use the product sporadically. The jar still looks full which means I probably haven&#x27;t used it a lot either. Also the smell is funky and weird, which is why I probably haven&#x27;t used it as often as I should.</li>
            <li> giving this a one star because of no expiration date..it helps somewhat, but I quit using, I find Eo&#x27;s of more benefit</li>
            <li> This is the first time I use this kind of product. So needs some time to see if it really works.</li>
            <li> This cream is great for oily skin an skin with break outs. I even notice that my skin is brighter.</li>
            <li> I read glycolic acid may help prevent and reduce acne spots. Unfortunately not for my few spots. Prescription cream helped cure me instead thank goodness. This didn&#x27;t lighten my freckles either and I didn&#x27;t notice any improvements with fine skin texture changes. I have combo sensitive skin and this tingles like how an acid should I guess. After a month I have stopped using this. Laser helped my sun spots perfectly at at dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Glad to have found it on Amazon - been looking locally for years.  Had success with it in the past at  diminishing age spots on my face.  It takes awhile to work, but the results were long lasting - new location of spots now need attention.</li>
            <li> This product does come with warnings and you should heed them.  I used it and noticed immediately that my skin did not like it.  It probably is a great product but not on my skin.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell if it is effective.  Have used it only a couple of weeks.  Only thing I don&#x27;t like is the stinging feeling I get after applying.  The instructions say that is normal, though.</li>
            <li> I have tried every cream out there and this one is like most of them. Feels good on the face but doesn&#x27;t do any miracles</li>
            <li> Could not tell any inprovement in my skin at all,I wish for once a product would do what it says it will do. I don&#x27;t expect a mimerical but some improvement would be nice.....don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and love how it keeps the wrinkles at bay.  I would recommend it and have to whom ever asked me about what I use on my face.</li>
            <li> i didnt really see much of a difference with this product. i was disappointed in it and wont purchase again.</li>
            <li> Alpha Hydroxy is amazing.It diminishes large wrinkles and erases totally the smaller ones-Don&#x27;t let The few people that have rash&#x27;s from it&#x27;s usage discourage you.I&#x27;m a 59 year old male who has been using Alpha Hydroxy on my face since 1995.I first discovered it in a dollar store in a 12 ounce bottle for 1 buck plus tax.Since then,it&#x27;s been hard to find in the marketplace,but i don&#x27;t know why.People that meet me ALWAYS believe me to be 10 to 15 years younger than i am/I&#x27;ve even been &#x27;accused&#x27; of being somewhere between 39 and early 40&#x27;s.I&#x27;m one of those people that you look at and you don&#x27;t know just what age to pin on them.This has everything to do with the Alpha Hydroxy cream.It&#x27;s effects overtime will produce long term effects.Unlike anti-wrinkle creams you see advertised on tv and in magazines,Alpha Hydroxy has been proven to work.You don&#x27;t have to use much of this stuff for it to work well,so one small supply will last a good while.This is not a bad price for this stuff..trust me.This very jar should last over a month and possibally two or more,depending on how often depending on how much yo use(full facial or wrinkles only)I use it on my face and neck once daily and it lasts for over a month.</li>
            <li> really like how this makes my skin feel!</li>
            <li> I just received this cream... tested on my hand and it seemed OK, started putting it on my face and it burned my skin, my face is red and swallen and cappilaries are broken. Do not use it if you have fairly delicate skin... there is no warning on the package about it, just to use sunscrean before going out. Right now I just want to cry, can&#x27;;t go out like I planned... my face is burning on one side where i put it like it&#x27;s on fire.</li>
            <li> I have not used this product long enough to determine if it does what it claims to do or not.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the reviews were good.  all it&#x27;s done for my skin is make it dryer plus  my makeup doesn&#x27;t look good since using this! Highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like this product and use it every day and find it keeps my face from having wrinkles</li>
            <li> I have been using for some time. I really like it. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product that fulfills its advertised goal.  This is my second order and I am very satisfied with the results of using it.</li>
            <li> I just left my first review ever for the foaming face wash in this product line, and I wanted to come here and leave a review for this cream too.  I purchased both together because I had some large pores that I wanted to get rid of and had read that glycolic acid was the safe thing to use.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased!  The wash worked very very well and the cream has done just as well.  After washing, I used my normal witch hazel toner, and then I spot treated my problem areas with this and didn&#x27;t rub it in completely immediately.  The next morning I noticed a marked difference in the size of the pores.  Two more nights of this and the pores were significantly smaller.  I&#x27;ve since started applying it to my entire face and rubbing in because I read further that glycolic acid is great for acne scarring as well.  Haven&#x27;t seen many changes on that front yet, but I didn&#x27;t purchase it for that anyway.  I purchased it for the pores and I continue to see improvement in their size every day.  I&#x27;m very happy!  This is an excellent high quality product that has prompted this regular amazon customer but never before reviewer to come back and actually leave a review!</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for over a year and it has helped reduce the amount of adult cystic acne on my face.  Leaves my skin softer without dry patches.  Would advise anyone who uses this to also use a moisturizer that contains sunscreen because this isn&#x27;t a moisturizing cream and it will make your skin more sensitive to sunlight.  With that being said, the cream is advertised to reduce wrinkles but I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in wrinkle reduction. I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s so maybe I&#x27;d have to be a bit older to see a difference.  Overall, a good product for what I use it for and I hope they keep making it because I haven&#x27;t found anything in the stores that is comparable.</li>
            <li> Do not believe all the hype.  It is a nice cream that feels good on your face, but it&#x27;s not any magic cream or highly effective, life changing product.</li>
            <li> This product was a  good deal for the actual price. I really liked it.  The formula was gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li> Within a couple of days of using this product there was a bit of stinging and redness and slight peeling but that soon stopped.  I had parenthesis around my mouth that is now starting to soften.  Also, the faint crow feet near my eyes are fading.  I also have creasing on my forehead that too are softening.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and it has kept brown spots off my face.  I was a sun worshiper in my younger years and this product kept the brown spots at bay  I am almost 60 and the sun spots are very faint no.  Of course, stay out of the sun for long periods of time &amp; use lotion that has good protection.</li>
            <li> Product produces a little reddening of my skin and some mild peeling, no stinging. I haven&#x27;t really noticed a dramatic improvement in my skin, but it was in pretty good shape to begin with.</li>
            <li> After the 2nd day of using this product it dried the heck out of my husbands face.  If you get it anywhere near your eyes it burns.  Would NOT recommend at all!</li>
            <li> Great product for the price and high in AHA that is good for your aging skin.</li>
            <li> Love it. The only thing that helps my cystic acne next to retin a which is harsh.</li>
            <li> This is the best Anti-Wrinkle crÃ¨me you could ever use in your whole life - especially if you are over 40!  I have been using Alpha Hydroxy  products since I was in my 30s.  I used Avon product with Alpha Hydroxy in them until they stopped selling them and then switched to the pure Alpha-Hydrox pictured here.  I am now 68 and I&#x27;m mistaken for someone in their late 40s all the time.  When I&#x27;m out with my grandchildren everyone thinks I&#x27;m their mother.  Use this crÃ¨me at night with any face crÃ¨me over it (that&#x27;s important b/c Alpha-Hydroxy alone will dry out your skin) and in a couple of month you will be amazed at the difference!  Don&#x27;t forget your neck!</li>
            <li> I have used t his product for many years and my complexion has stayed unwrinkled.  Sometimes people even remark that my skin looks good . It&#x27;s getting harder to find., but I will keep ordering from Amazon as long as they have it.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin softer and smoother.  It probably won&#x27;t take care of all wrinkles but I am pleased with it thus far.</li>
            <li> It took a good 5 to 6 weeks to see results, but my skin definitely is smoother and the wrinkles are not as &amp;#34; deep&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This makes a real difference in the texture of my skin. Have been using it for years and can&#x27;t go without it.</li>
            <li> I use this two times per day. It keeps blemishes (monthly hormone kind) under control and smooths out my skin. I think this is one of the best values in skin care. No need to spend hundreds of dollars. This product is a winner and a staple for me.</li>
            <li> I have used this product along with the night replenishing cream and foaming face wash for 6 wks now- I can definately see the difference in my skin. My skin appears firmer, pores smaller and I have had a lot less breakouts since beginning this regimen. I would definately recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love the tingling sensation your get upon application. Great product, excellent value!</li>
            <li> Thank you!! A+A+A+A+A+</li>
            <li> I really love this product i notice when i have a pimple and i put this on the next morning my pimple is gone. it goes on like silk your skin feels so soft &amp; smooth. I just love it</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with my purchase of Alpha Hydrox AHA Enhanced Creme, Anti-Wrinkle Exfoliant.  I use it along with a moisturizer each night.  It tingles at times, but not to any extreme.  It is not greasy or too heavy, but seems to last on my skin throughout the night.  Happily, there is a notable difference in my skin!  I see fewer lines and my face is soft and much smoother.  For the price, it is a bargain that lasts far longer than expensive products of a similar nature.  I have found a product in Alpha Hydrox AHA Enhanced Creme, Anti-Wrinkle Exfoliant that I will purchase again and again.</li>
            <li> Shipment came on time as expected.  Good product.</li>
            <li> I recently had a facial and the esthetician recommended  using glycolic cream.  I used to work in retail and  remembered that drug stores used to carry this.  I was disappointed that they don&#x27;t anymore.  Luckily,  I found it at Amazon at reasonable prize.  I have been using it under my moisturizer at nightime.  My skin feels refreshed in the morning and it feels smoother and tighter.  I only have been using it for about a month.  I am in my mid-40&#x27;s and still breakout so I am trying to get back to daily routine and it seems to be helping.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and find it really keeps my skin young looking. It&#x27;s easy to apply. I&#x27;m used to it so it doesn&#x27;t sting but i might tingle a little bit when you first start using it but that means its working. The active ingredients are the same as in much more expensive creams. Great product.</li>
            <li> Aha cream faded my acne scars within one weak and started changing my comedones to pimples. I read some comments complaining about breaking out. I think they should be more patient. There are some points i would like to add. I received it in a very bad condition. Besides, the information says it is good on all kind of skins but sensitive. While the cover says it is for normal skins. I was about to return it ( as i have an oily skin) but i changed my mind because of my laziness. Now i am glad that i gave it a try.</li>
            <li> I actually notice my skin getting firmer with this product and it is a great price.  I&#x27;ve used more expensive anti aging products with little to no results . This one shows real improvement  quickly and doesn&#x27;t make me suffer through a drying or flaking stage like so many other products that claim to boost collagen. I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li> The best for your skin ! When it tingles it mean its working. Make my face soft, smooth &amp; helps with wrinkles. Sloughs off dead skin cells. makes the face look &amp; feel vibrant. I love it !</li>
            <li> Very good exfoliating product at an excellent price. My wife has been using the product successfully for over 10 years</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for more than a year, and I love it! It makes my skin feel so soft (but not greasy), and it diminishes the appearance of my fine lines.  It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, though.  I wake up in the morning with no fine line on my brow but, since I furrow my brow throughout the day, they always return later on.  I would (and have) recommended this product to others.</li>
            <li> I thought by law if not by a company&#x27;s own prudence that a safety seal and expiration date should be placed on all cosmetic product.  Well this product arrived with no safety seal and no expiration date.  The packaging was all beat up.  I don&#x27;t know about you, but I don&#x27;t trust any cosmetic coming from the internet with no safety seal.  When&#x27;s the last time you bought something from a drug store with no safety seal and risked using it</li>
            <li> Keeps neck and face clear of heat rash and small bumps.  Not to mention helps to renew skin daily.  So glad to find it here.</li>
            <li> My wife ordered it, she has not used it yet. So I have not comment  so far. I hope it as good as other products I purchased from you.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;The small box that included the product was thrown into a larger Amazon box without any protection. As a result, the box became dented and the product inside the jar was a mess once the jar was opened. The product looked as if it was returned. Very disappointed.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended AHA moisturizers, and this cream is so thick and easy to apply.  It stays on all day or night.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for close to 20 years. I believe it works and I do have nice skin. Is it because of this or ???? I don&#x27;t know but I&#x27;m not going to stop to find out.</li>
            <li> My Wife says this product is the reason she looks 40. She is 57 now, and does look young for her age, so if your looking for the fountain of youth, don&#x27;t know if this is it, but I know she swears by it.</li>
            <li> I have not used this religiously but I like that it hydrates once I figured out how to use it correctly. AHA creams are supposed to be applied it first and let set for at least 30 minutes before applying anything else. The only thing that bothers me about this is the smell. It has a very strong smell of sour milk for the first couple of minutes and since I need this especially for the dry skin around my nose, it was unavoidable. I&#x27;m not sure if it was supposed to smell that way but it is very bothersome. This (and the set for 30 minutes) is why I do not use it every day.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple weeks at night and like the way my skin feels in the morning. It seems like it might be drying after you put it on but after awhile, my skin feels soft. I would recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time and in good condition. I was having a bad case of acne and this product did start to clear it up within two days. It has not made a difference in fine lines or wrinkles. I will continue to use it to keep my face clear.</li>
            <li> This creme induce allergy, it is not safe to use it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!  But I get it from Neoteric Cosmetics.  They give you a free Alpha Hydrox face wash free with every purchase</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. They used to sell the 12% Alpha Hydrox cream at Walgreen&#x27;s but they don&#x27;t carry it anymore. I learned years ago when I first started using it that the best concentration for an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) is between 8% to 12% and the ideal pH is 3 to 4. You can use a pH test strip to check the pH. The Alpha Hydrox cream has a concentration of 10 and a pH of 4. The souffle works well too but the cream is cheaper and works exactly the same. I&#x27;ve tried other alpha hydroxy acids in the past with a higher concentration of AHA but the pH was too high to make it effective. The higher the pH, the greater the buffer and that reduces the strength of the AHA and renders it useless. I&#x27;ve been using this brand for years although I&#x27;ve occasionally tried others. I haven&#x27;t found anything yet that does a better job for the price. It really does help keep the wrinkles away. I don&#x27;t often reveal my age but when I do tell people I&#x27;m 55 years old, their jaws literally drop. Makes me feel great!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of all the other good reviews, however, I have been using it for about 3 weeks and I have not noticed anything different.  Not even sure it moisterizes well.  The price of the item is good, but I haven&#x27;t seen any results from it, very disappointing since I was hoping it would help with my skin, even just evening it out some.  It didn&#x27;t help with any fine lines at all.  It would tingle the first few times I put it on but now it just feels like I am putting on a cream.</li>
            <li> Product left my skin very dry... Waist of money as I could not return items.</li>
            <li> Thought the product will work a little better. Slight burning, but so far I see no changes in my face.</li>
            <li> nice and creamy plus exfoliating is agreat bonus. I love this because it is not harsh, but I can&#x27;t use it after a scrub or it burns a little.</li>
            <li> I called the Alpha Hydrox company out of curiosity before ordering! I ordered their entire line. I&#x27;m 44 years old, I&#x27;ve never been a sun-worshiper. Three years ago someone asked me if I was 29. I was so flattered. As a teenager, i never had blemishes. For the past two years, I&#x27;ve been dealing with mild adult acne. My Mom is a licensed hairdresser &amp; cosmetologist. A dear friend of mine is a licensed esthetician. I called my friend, she suggested I try the Alpha Hydrox line. I found their products, and ordered the foaming facial cleaner, toner/astringent, oil free moisturizer, and their heavier 2 oz jar of moisturizer for normal skin. As four weeks went by, I am down to the last of my first bottle of cleanser, and ran out of toner. I just ordered two more bottles of cleanser, and two additional bottles of toner. The oil free moisturizer I use in the daytime, this one I typically use at night. My blemishes were calmed down and healing within 48 hours of use last month. My skin GLOWED after a week of use. All of their products I purchased are 10% glycolic acid. I really want to try their 12% AHA body lotion and their foot cream. Alpha Hyrox is PHENOMENAL, amazing stuff!!! I would not trade these products for anything in the universe. For being 44, my skin has that healthy glow I had at 19 and through my 20&#x27;s!!! I used Mary Kay from 1991 to 2003, I&#x27;ve sold Mary Kay 3 different times. I&#x27;ve tried Cetaphil and nothing BUT this product line has cleared up my skin. Eight years ago when my child was born, I became allergic to MK Timewise.  I am done with all other skin care lines but Alpha Hydrox! :) The Alpha Hydrox Toner is something I purchase TWO of at a time. It has no fragrance. A serious plus when I consider that I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances. For those of you leary of a slight chemical peel, I do have sensitive skin. This has not bothered me. Everything is pH balanced, my skin has never felt so incredibly clean, and I always use the Alpha Hydrox Foaming Cleanser with a washcloth. 10% glycolic acid in the toner, cleansers, this moisturizer and the oil-free. My complexion DRINKS this moisturizer in, and it&#x27;s NON-greasy. If you have any doubts, go to the Neoteric website, and read the actual blog for why Alpha Hydrox products are so amazing. Ulta has sales from time to time for about $5.99 a bottle for the cleanser and their toner. IF you have normal skin, you can get away with this for a day-time moisturizer. Neoteric&#x27;s website I&#x27;ve signed up for monthly special alerts. I&#x27;m happy to purchase this wherever I can find the best price. This is a better way to go than ProActive, which will usually tend to over dry the skin with salicylic acids and benzoyl peroxides. I&#x27;ve retired my benzoyl peroxide gel completely since switching to this product.  I&#x27;ve not had any breakouts.  My pores are GONE. I&#x27;m also a fan of Freeman&#x27;s Dead Sea mineral mask.</li>
            <li> I used this product about 12 years back and I remember having a tinkling feeling for the first 3-4 days. At it was only a 5 %, this is 10% and I felt nothing so I&#x27;m wondering if it is what it claims to be.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, however, I stepped out from \\&quot;fulfilled by Amazon\\&quot; or Derm Store and purchased from Beauty 4 you; the product looks very different and smells very different from the product I have purchased in the past.  So after I cautiously use It, I will come back with a review...I just hope it does not mess with my very clear and flawless complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 stars because I&#x27;m just not sure what product is in the container, and \\&quot;real\\&quot; Alpha Hydrox is great and I don&#x27;t want to smear the Brand Name of this Product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;APRIL 10, 2013: Update; I have used the product purchased from&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Beauty 4 you\\&quot; and I have not had any problems with the product. Alpha Hydrox has done what it has done for my complection in the past. However, I still suggest that one choose a reputable seller to purchase this product. Although, there are some very great stores on Amazon, one is always taking a chance purchasiang any product when stepping away from the Amazon Halo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Post Note: this product has really gone up in price, although $14.00 is still reasonable, it used to cost roughly $6.00 in the past, so watch for sales and deal breakers!...changed my stars to 5....Good Luck</li>
            <li> I Love this stuff.I continue to reorder as I run out I hope they never stop making this product ever.</li>
            <li> Works miracles , you can use another night cream within 10 mins of applying this one for smoother feeling .</li>
            <li> I saw results the first day!!!</li>
            <li> This is making my skin smoother and just plain ol look better! Only four stars because I don&#x27;t like the smell....it&#x27;s not bad, just not good either. But it soaks in and then I can&#x27;t smell it at all in just a couple or so minits. It really works! Does just what it sais it does for real, and good price.</li>
            <li> Love it, Been using for 10 years and it lightly sloughs dead skin, Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this cream!</li>
            <li> This is a great product it really work n fast too u c results really quick n it is cheap</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough great things about the entire line of AH!  Love love love it!</li>
            <li> The jury is still out on this one. I have read many good things about this product, that it is a great wrinkle reducer, and a great exfoliate. I have not been using it for very long though, so I can&#x27;t really say how it works. It does give my skin a glow! I use this at bedtime, after cleansing my face. Wait 10 min. before putting it on or else it might sting! Also, don&#x27;t forget sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Put to much on and my face went lobster red. Waited a few days used small amount, no problem at all. My complexion is more even.Like the product, I wear a spf 30 with it as well.</li>
            <li> Love this cream, I actually think is works!!!!! lol</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years.  it&#x27;s an excellent product.  It works and it&#x27;s cheap.  what more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> When I was in high school, I used the Alpha Hydrox Oil Free Treatment to help stave off some acne, but like most things around that time, I was flighty and quickly forgot about it.... Until I hit my 30s that is and was not only *still* working to stave off acne, but also began find wrinkles forming... What the heck?  Oily skin AND wrinkles?  I never got a break, haha... At any rate, I remembered this product my mother bought for me 15 years prior and figured I&#x27;d give it a try... What a change!  Quickly balanced my skin, and hands down, it has been the best for reducing (and dare I say, eliminating???) my wrinkles... Now, I&#x27;m not old, but years playing sports in the sun were starting to show... My eye and forehead wrinkles are not there anymore, and my mouth lines (my \\&quot;parentheses\\&quot; as I call them) are very faint now.  Again, I never had deep-set wrinkles, but even still... Been a loyal user now for the past few years. Oh, and I agree with other reviews, has definitely helped smooth out some scarring, too...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched from the Oil Free Treatment (which is great, soaks in fast and easy to wear under makeup... [[ASIN:B000052YM8 Alpha Hydrox Oil Free Treatment 10 Percent AHA 1.7 fl oz.]]), to this cream simply because Ulta was out of it when I went to pick some up about a year ago.  I actually have stuck with the cream ever since because I find I like the feel of it a little better, and it seems you have a little more wiggle room than with the oil free treatment... perhaps the cream makes it milder, especially if you accidentally get it close to your eyes and lips??? I don&#x27;t know... I usually put this on before my facial moisturizer (I actually use a different brand, Boots Botanics Organic day cream, but use whatever you find works best for you...) and tinted moisturizer.  Lays nicely, and oddly enough, because it helps my skin stay balanced, my makeup (which is only the tinted moisturizer, eye shadow/powder liner/mascara and light blush) stays put all day.If you find that you wear heavier stuff (like foundations and powders), I&#x27;d say try the Oil Free Treatment, as it&#x27;s more of a gel than a cream, so it soaks in even more...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the AH Retinol Night ResQ at bedtime and just put some Vitamin E oil on top of that after about 15 or 20 min.  The oil soaks in fast, isn&#x27;t too heavy and, let&#x27;s face it (pun???), there&#x27;s enough going on in the ResQ cream so something simple like the Vitamin E complements it instead of fighting against it... Trader Joe&#x27;s sells it cheap, but I bet you can find it here on Amazon, too... [[ASIN:B0000535VH Alpha Hydrox Optimum Series, Retinol Night ResQ, Anti-Wrinkle Firming Complex - 1.05 oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are considering buying this product-- which I hope you do-- I should note that it is a little harsh at first.  When I started, I only used it in the mornings until my face adjusted to that, and then I added in the night regime with the Retinol ResQ... Even now (like this cold, cold winter), I sometimes have to step back and adjust my usage for a little while... But you will find that balance.  I just suggest easing into it and having patience with it.  Give it a month, not a few weeks.  It will work!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review is helpful, if not wordy.  I just love the stuff... and it&#x27;s not too pricey to boot!~</li>
            <li> I bought it after recommeded by my friends. I had use it for one week and this is really working now! The ance spot decrease a lot. But I need to say it is really really irreated. And it is better to use it in the night i believe</li>
            <li> I bought several of the  Alpha Hydrox line  of products and there are a few I really won&amp;#34;t buy again.  This is one of them I do not like the consistency of this product. The night replenishing cream is much better.</li>
            <li> I was pretty sure that this cream would not work, but it had some great reviews so I thought that I would give it a try. It was not expensive at all, and I figured that if it didn&#x27;t work, it was a cheap enough moisturizer. I was very surprized after a few days when I realized that the creases around my eyes were not as noticable. I realy notice the difference when I wake up in the morning. My eyes are not as puffy  and have less wrinkles. I will definitely keep using this product. I only wish that I had taken a picture of my eyes before I started so that I could compare the difference.</li>
            <li> This is the best AHA for mature skin...not too harsh and I wear it everyday.  It keeps my face smooth and soft and helps with the blackheads.  Love it and love the price.</li>
            <li> Once upon a time, I went in search of my Skin Charming. Like Prince Charming, it had to be perfect: effective, affordable, and easily accessible. Unlike Prince Charming, however, my Skin Charming needed to be proven scientifically before I&#x27;d accept a dinner invitation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I met AHA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a preface, I don&#x27;t use this for wrinkles and I never have--I&#x27;m 23, I picked up this little product for the first time when I was around 19. I tried out many different brands, looked into retinol, and did my research in hopes of finding my one acne-cure all. Fortunately, I&#x27;m a premed student so most of my research was covered in my chem classes already, but I still made some mistakes when using it out of impatience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get to the point: this product works. My complexion is even, scars are fading, and anytime I stop using it for longer than a week and a half, I regret it. HOWEVER. You need to approach this product with respect for the fact that it&#x27;s an acid or you&#x27;ll turn yourself into one very burned lizard. &#x27;Break in&#x27; your skin, especially if it&#x27;s sensitive--use it every other night before bed, working your way up to daily use. For me, my acne has all but cleared entirely, showing up almost exclusively when I&#x27;ve slacked off on my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s effective for more than just skin tone, though that&#x27;s the most immediate effect. It&#x27;s also a great treatment for stretchmarks, old and new, if continued for a *long* period of time, promoting collagen production in the skin. I can&#x27;t speak for its abilities on wrinkles, but based on what I know about how wrinkles work/how stretchmarks work, I&#x27;d wager it&#x27;s also excellent for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way! A jar of this should last a regular user a month, give or take a few days. If you&#x27;re running out before then, you&#x27;re either a conehead (can I get your autograph?) or using too much on your face/neck. Keep away from eyes, including the corners/your temples, as it can be very drying and make the muscles feel *too* tight at times. As other people (and the jar itself) have said, you&#x27;ll need an SPF15 sunblock for wearing it around the day: your skin is going to become extra photosensitive and since you&#x27;re probably using this to improve the overall quality, it would be in your best interest to avoid an actual sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t advise using an astringent to clean your skin beforehand, but I do recommend using it after an hour or so. You might sweat for a few minutes after you apply it, but it should go away rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my Skin Charming. I buy several jars at a time for fear of running out, but different products will work differently for--you guessed it--different people. Low price point, effective, and accessible: I cannot recommend more.</li>
            <li> These products are the best I&#x27;ve found.  You do not need to spend hundreds of dollars to get the same results.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to be 69 this year and people are always noticing my skin.  So I put them on to the GREAT product line.</li>
            <li> I wear this nearly every night and in the morning my skin feel sooo soft and smooth. The best exfliator I&#x27;ve ever tried. It is smoothed my skin and decreased my hyperpigmentation</li>
            <li> I think this was just too strong for my skin. I did as the directions told you and did a test patch and it caused a rash.</li>
            <li> As described, fast shipping</li>
            <li> So far so good.waiting for the wrinkles to disappear. Will update when I look 40 again.I am sure I will reorder.</li>
            <li> Great and effective product. The secret is the the right pH in the packaging--most others don&#x27;t balance the pH to suit the AHA&#x27;s, and it destroys their effectiveness. This company makes FABULOUS AHA products, but they are hard to find...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, not the best cutting edge moisturizer around. The AHA&#x27;s are great, the moisturizer is only so-so. I used a better moisturizer over this when I used this (now I use Paulas Choice).</li>
            <li> I use this product for some scars that I have received. I put it on the area once in the morning and once at night. Since using this product I have noticed the scars flattening out and becoming softer. Nothing else has worked for me thus far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for as long as I can remember and I really like it. I use it every morning only wish it had sunscreen in it.</li>
            <li> Did apply the product as instruction. The redness on my forehead did get a little better the next day. But I don&#x27;t apply it during daytime</li>
            <li> Great product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 years.  I&#x27;m 55, and people tell me I have a youthful complexion.  I know it&#x27;s because of this product, though I mostly use this on my hands, and the lighter cream on my face.</li>
            <li> I believe this is my third time purchasing this cream since I first bought it to help some facial scars and i see myself using this for as long as its made. It has really helped the appearance of the scars to where I hardly notice them anymore and also helps out with any new breakouts. It makes my skin so smooth and it works wonderfully with my vitamin c serum.</li>
            <li> I had expected this product to be more moisturizing than the other Alpha Hydrox products I&#x27;ve tried and loved, especially the Alpha Hydrox Enhanced Lotion. But it isn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m not sure what it does that the Enhanced Lotion doesn&#x27;t and it is pricier. I wouldn&#x27;t bother with it again. It is fine, but I&#x27;d stick to the Lotion, which is fantastic for clearing skin, making it brighter, helping even skin tones, and diminishing the look of wrinkles (I sound like a commercial).</li>
            <li> Love this product, use it for sun spots and sun damage after being in the sun all summer. Works great</li>
            <li> I used to use this product years ago, and came back to it when my skin needed TLC as I got older.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I checked the other products, which are much more expensive, but I wasn&#x27;t convinced they were better for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product spreads nicely on your skin without any greasy residue or the strong scent I can&#x27;t handle. I use it on my neck, too, and my neck looks better. This time, I will stay with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon offers the best deal I can find.</li>
            <li> This product works and you can&#x27;t beat the price! I will purchase again. I can tell a difference in the texture and smoothness of my face. Smoothed my deep wrinkles. Have some redness in my cheeks but that means its working.....increasing the blood flow to my face. Be sure and use a good moisturizer with any retinol product</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t many things that work for everyone, so don&#x27;t be discouraged by any contrary reviews. This stuff is amazing.Im am 33 years old, don&#x27;t drink much water...smoke, all of that stuff that&#x27;s bad for your skin.Ive had acne of varying degrees my whole life and as an adult, it&#x27;s the nasty cystic kind. I&#x27;m a light skinned multi racial woman and the pigment in my skin marks every scar and bump.I have hereditary large pores.Just lots of fun stuff going on!&lt;br /&gt;I discovered Alpha hydrox about 6 years ago and it&#x27;s always worked.Im lazy, so once my skin is flawless I just don&#x27;t worry as much. From now on, Ill stick with this stuff because its the only thing that can make my skin look great!&lt;br /&gt;I like this formula the best. The concentration is just right.When I first started using  this years ago, I went through the rough part before the calm.Often your skin will get worse before its gets better, when you are exfoliating like this.I find that my acne errupts as the skin slouches away( not as harsh as it sounds, it&#x27;s just the exfoliation) and then once it&#x27;s gone, I&#x27;m left with beautiful clear skin.&lt;br /&gt;Well a few months ago I was getting pretty discouraged by my skins condition.I use foundation to cover my bad skin and then the foundation makes it worse.Its a cycle.But I&#x27;ve found the perfect balance.I wash my skin well at night and then apply thisin the morning, wait about 10 minutes and THEN apply my foundation. It&#x27;s amazing what it does.Within minutes your pores are smaller and skin smoother.I notice that I need less foundation and that it&#x27;s easier to apply.I believe by using this first, it closes my pores letting less foundation clog.It&#x27;s just overall an 1000% improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Well when I ran out of my last bottle( this is my second this time around), I noticed the difference right away.And in the three days I was out, a break out occurred.Only because cystic acne is my underlying issue.&lt;br /&gt;With long term use skin is lighter, clearer and smoother.Trust me, this is an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;If it doesn&#x27;t work for you, your problem isn&#x27;t a buildup of dead skin needing exfoliation. And if your skin gets a bit worse before it gets better, remember what I&#x27;ve said.Its just the bad stuff coming closer to the surface and soon it will be gone leaving behind beautiful skin.It takes about 1-4 weeks to go through a cycle.This time around, the bad cycle wasn&#x27;t bad at all.So the less exfoliation you need, the less it effects your skin.</li>
            <li> We have been using Alpha Hydrox for years. Very effective.</li>
            <li> It caused my skin to break out. I gave it to my mom. It broke her skin out. It is really good as a foot cream.</li>
            <li> This product enraged my skin.  I broke out in painful pimples all over my face and neck where I applied this.  I gave it some time for my skin to &amp;#34;purge&amp;#34; but realized this was the cause of my acne, and was not purging anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This might work for more mature, drier, thick skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have young, sensitive, acne prone skin and would rather take mayo to my face than ever use this again.  It&#x27;s in the garbage.</li>
            <li> You cannot use this under make up you can not use this at all. Now I sound like Dr. Suess lol. It peels off as you rub it in I was not happy w/ this at all</li>
            <li> Great product, really works to exfoliate dead skin cells. My skin was softer after the first use. After a week of use, I had a noticeable reduction of fine lines, dull patches and large pores. This product tingles a bit after applying and dries to a film, so I use it after washing my face before bed.  In the morning I rinse it off and it leaves my skin looking great, neither dry nor greasy. I definitely recommend this product if you are like me. I am in my thirties and was starting to get fine lines and a dull complexion, even though I still had occasional breakouts. This produt did a great job of smoothing and brightening my skin, evening my tone, unclogged pores, and even fading acne scars.  The price is great too, I&#x27;m so happy I found such an effective product at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a difference after using this product - especially right out of show or after exfoliating. I have been using this product for about 2 months now, and have noticed more of a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to my skin, and a reduction of fine lines. It does burn/sting when you first put it on, I have sensitive skin and definitely felt the prickles the first time I have used this - nothing intense or painful, but you should be aware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Value - I have found a very small amount of this cream goes  a LONG way, which is nice. A lot of small cream containers seem to empty so quickly, so it&#x27;s great that this product has a silky glide that seems to cover your entire face in no time. One caution is to make sure to use sun screen with this product as it can make your skin more susceptible to the sun.</li>
            <li> Love it, easy to take away dead skin, bit tickle at first, but get it over very soon, nice stuff!</li>
            <li> Skin feels dry after using this cream. No benefits at all. Smells nice :(</li>
            <li> This is a product I have used for twenty plus years.  Results?  I&#x27;m 67 and do not have crows feet.  I can&#x27;t imagine having better results with much more expensive products.</li>
            <li> I does not smell good; however, I think it is real AHA, and I can feel it soften my skin, even few days after starting.</li>
            <li> I received this product just a little over a week ago and have used it at least once a day since. I have acne prone skin with scaring and dark spots, my skin is an olive complexion so I tend to scar easily and get spots. Since using this cream I have been able to wake and feel pretty good about walking around without using something to cover my blemishes. I have not had massive breakouts like I normally would and I feel like my skin has a touch of a glow to it now. I do not constantly run to a mirror to make sure my cover up is staying put. Will continue using this and most likely will repurchase when it gets low. Would order more now but it seems to be lasting well and I want to be sure it keeps doing good for my skin and isn&#x27;t just a fluke! Will update if it stops working for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Still works great! I do still get a few pimples here and there and still have black heads some but nothing like before. I feel like this cream really helps my skin to not only appear healthy but also to actually be healthier.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product for years.....I question if it was the product...No top plastic over was over the cream.  It was used and not new.  It wasn&#x27;t creamy  or smooth.  maybe it was left out open</li>
            <li> Nice products, lightens spots, improves texture, helps with wrinkles. I follow up with a good moisturizing product to avoid dryness.</li>
            <li> Alpha Hydrox might as well close it&#x27;s doors.  I don&#x27;t know what happened because twenty years ago they had amazing products for a cheap price.  Now they cost twice what they did then, understandable with inflation, but don&#x27;t work worth a darn.  Yet another epic fail.  I am so disappointed in this product line.  I purchased several different products a few months ago and after finishing the bottles am still convinced they are absolute garbage.  They do not do what they claim but if you just want a lotion...here you go.  They are just like any other plain old lotion.</li>
            <li> This is a very cool product. I have dry skin, and I even used to have dry patches on my cheeks, which didn&#x27;t look good at all, especially with makeup. This creme does make skin much smoother, and much fresher. It is not scented- it has a little bit of unpleasant chemical smell, but it&#x27;s very faint, and you can&#x27;t smell it on the skin (and I&#x27;m super sensitive to smells).&lt;br /&gt;It stings quite a bit when you first start using it, and my skin looked pretty red too, but that doesn&#x27;t last more than 15 minutes. Also, the first week or two after I started using this moisturizer I started to break out a little- that is a temporary effect too. I guess, this is how this stuff works- that must be some sort of cleansing process for the skin. Now that I&#x27;ve used this for about a month my skin is MUCH smoother and is much more clear, I can even skip the foundation, but if I do use foundation it goes on nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Alph Hydrox nourishing cleanser with this. For daytime use, I apply just a thin layer of this creme, wait for about 5-10 minutes, and apply my spf moisturizer, and then makeup (sunblock is  a must after this product, cause AHA is an exfoliator, and makes your skin more sensitive to UVA/UVB). For night use if my skin feels dry, I sometimes apply some Alpha Hydrox nourishing night creme (it doesn&#x27;t contain AHAs).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if this does much for lines and wrinkles- first, I don&#x27;t have many, and I haven&#x27;t used this long enough, but this creme does a wonderful job for dry skin with patches, and for uneven skin, through faster renewal, and dead skin cell removal.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product, it&#x27;s a great, truly effective creme, and you can&#x27;t really beat the price!</li>
            <li> I have reordered this product more than once. Non-greasy cream.</li>
            <li> I am 45 and this stuff works.  I have used a lot of different products since my teens.  I have NEVER been disappointed with Alpha products.  Simply they work.  Alpha product lines tend to fly low in an already over stimulated market of commercials and new product wonders that appear in constantly in an ever changing money making industry devoted to our own vanity (present company included).  But these products work!  I can testify to that.  The best thing is they are high in concentrate and low in price that is an A+++ in my book.</li>
            <li> I love Alpha Hydrox. I haven&#x27;t used it in awhile, but everytime I do, it diminishes fine lines on my face quickly. and gives my entire face a younger glow and appearance! A smoother complexion too.</li>
            <li> Who can live without it? I am always getting compliments on my skin and I am 64 years old! I&#x27;ve used it for almost 20 years and I love it. I have no wrinkles on my face</li>
            <li> does as described. I see a noticeable difference in the appearance of my skin, and it isn&#x27;t irritating at all.</li>
