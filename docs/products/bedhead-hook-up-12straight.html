            <li>I didn&#x27;t use the dual voltage setting on it since I had a pretty nice power adapter/converter that it worked great with.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine textured, mixed-ethnic hair.</li>
            <li>Unlike most straighteners.</li>
            <li>Never was able to make it work.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the perfect size for short hair/bangs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just making sure that no one purchases this item without understanding that is is a MINI straightener.</li>

            <li>I have short hair, so this curling iron is the perfect size.</li>
            <li>this is perfect for short hair - I got my hair wacked off</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS....</li>
            <li>However, I takes me more time to use this straightener than it would to just use a blow-dryer.</li>
            <li>This straightener is perfect for styling short hair.</li>
            <li>overall a great product!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>When I read all the reviews on this straightener, I was so excited to try it out!</li>
            <li>It gave me great soft curls.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it to spend more and get something better quality that heats up more.</li>
            <li>I am a guy and as far as I know this product works great.</li>
            <li>i guess i neglected to read the details i didn&#x27;t know it was a mini straight iron but its good for portable purposes</li>
            <li>but it certainly is perfect as a back up or quick use.</li>
            <li>It heats quickly and works perfect for my short hair.</li>
            <li>What a great little travel iron and good for at home to.</li>
            <li>Heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact size allows for easy travel and storage.</li>
            <li>it gets nice &amp; hot</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t grasp the hair if its fine like mine.  </li>
            <li>and I love it very much!</li>
            <li>This little iron does the trick flawlessly.</li>
            <li>so I only use it for fly aways</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-feels like cheap plastic</li>
            <li>great to curl short hair</li>
            <li>It works great for my very short hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always getting knocked off the vanity because of how light it is.  </li>
            <li>Works great especially for bangs!</li>
            <li>This is a perfect size for short hair and it heats up incredibly fast.</li>
            <li>It cute, its practical, and it is the right price.  </li>
            <li>This is straight is very very useful, and it is very easy to carry it with me.</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I do love the fact that it will heat up really fast!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair look nicer its the right size for me!</li>
            <li>But if you have a short bob or a pixie cut, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li>I might eventually buy a full size one to keep in my gym bag instead.</li>
            <li>It serves its purpose, but I don&#x27;t recommend attempting to straighten a full head of hair with this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so tiny and perfect for straightening my short hair.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Quick</li>
            <li>again just like the bigger flat iron it is a wonderful product and get very hot.</li>
            <li>Good product, but it gets extremely hot on the entire unit (not just the plates).  </li>
            <li>Gets really hot!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay for its size, but I feel that this is a product more suited to doing fine details (e.g. Doing little turn-ups at the ends of your hair, or root straightening touch ups)</li>
            <li>I like to flip the ends to make my hair messy looking and this straightener is great for that too.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price</li>
            <li>I like that this straightener is tiny because if it were any bigger I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to use it effectively for the length of the hair</li>
            <li>I have very straight hair</li>
            <li>It does get hot, just doesn&#x27;t meet my needs.</li>
            <li>Like it gets hot but doesnt straighten any of my hair</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I&#x27;d like</li>
            <li>My bangs sometimes lay wrong and this is the perfect size!</li>
            <li>It heats up fast, but it doesn&#x27;t have an auto turn off!</li>
            <li>I tried bigger irons to get more straightening done per sweep-through-my-hair, but they&#x27;re too in-the-way.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I want it to do.</li>
            <li>I got this straightener when I got bangs for the first time.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for and exactly what the description said it was.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But since this was my first straightener purchase, I&#x27;ve learned some of the drawbacks with using a mini straightener.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast!</li>
            <li>First of all, it is adorbs being so small, but second of all, it works great!</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly, and doesn&#x27;t take too long to cool off.</li>
            <li>Awesome for small jobs, but definitely not the whole head.</li>
            <li>Ok sure, my hair is really thick, I guess, but this didn&#x27;t work on my hair at all.</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty long and somewhere between wavy and curly, and this gets it straight pretty easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tiny - fits easily into luggage</li>
            <li>This does the job and heats up hot enough, but just disapointed with how cheap it seems.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this product if you&#x27;re just going to use it on bangs or short hair, or even fine hair.</li>
            <li>The plastic does get a little warm but that doesnt bother me.</li>
            <li>Since I have very straight hair, my bangs dry totally straight, which is gross, so I use this to give them a little curve, and the size helps me get the perfect curve every time.</li>
            <li>up fast</li>
            <li>Heats up a bit too much and burns my fingers.</li>
            <li>But it works really well</li>
            <li>Like a toy,but heat up up fast.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect too much out of it</li>
            <li>This does make my hair straight and it fast to heat up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- heats up fast</li>
            <li>It heats up really fast.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s very lightweight.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for thin silky short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This little flat iron was great.</li>
            <li>And, it gets hot enough, quickly, to do the job.</li>
            <li>It gets hot quickly and is surprisingly easy to hold, despite its small size.</li>
            <li>Great product I went natural,but still wanted to flat iron my hair a few times.</li>
            <li>Apparently this thing works pretty well because my wife brings it along with her everywhere!  </li>
            <li>It actually gets pretty hot.  </li>
            <li>This 1/2&amp;#34; allows me more flexibility than my larger 1&amp;#34; flat iron.</li>
            <li>WAS I SURPRISED!!  </li>
            <li>This is a great little iron for travel, or just if you want an inexpensive way to get tight curls or quick touch ups with a flat iron.</li>
            <li>Much easier to go slow with a smaller iron, and get every hair just right. :)</li>
            <li>I ordered this one expecting it to be a bit bigger, more like the traditional mini style, but this thing is tiny.  </li>
            <li>It gets hot and works like its suppose to, which is why I&#x27;m overall</li>
            <li>(It gets just as hot, but you only have 1/2 inch to work with.)</li>
            <li>It is also pretty short lengthwise.</li>
            <li>My first flat iron and</li>
            <li>i have pin straight hair dont even need to blow dry it straight.</li>
            <li>My seven year old</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m mainly giving it  only three stars for not putting MINI in the description and wasting my time.</li>
            <li>This has an on off switch and is small and can fit in your purse.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t send it back because of the trouble and cheap price</li>
            <li>I purchased this flat iron before a trip to Israel in early March mainly because I wanted one I wasn&#x27;t emotionally attached to ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Great for bangs; but a little small to do any of your other hair.  </li>
            <li>She has short hair &amp; natural curls.</li>
            <li>I usually plug it in when getting ready after a shower and it seems like it takes about 20 seconds to be hot enough to use.</li>
            <li>Guess I shouldn&#x27;t have expected too much for the price.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it on my bangs, I don&#x27;t really have the patience to do all of my hair because it&#x27;s so small, but I could if I took the time.</li>
            <li>It is tiny, so flat ironing long curly hair is a beast (but I stand as witness that it can be done and it definitely gets hot enough).  </li>
            <li>B0050Q58XI Rusk RSK807 Heat Freak Professional STR8 Ceramic Tourmaline Flat Iron, 1 1/2 Inches]])in case it got left overseas.  </li>
            <li>I really only needed a small straightener to tame one section of wayward hair (I have pretty short hair except for on the right side in front of my ear</li>
            <li>Only hold it at the part where there&#x27;s no flat iron surface.</li>

            <li> Since I have very straight hair, my bangs dry totally straight, which is gross, so I use this to give them a little curve, and the size helps me get the perfect curve every time.</li>

            <li> Heats up a bit too much and burns my fingers.</li>

            <li> It heats up really fast.</li>

            <li> This little flat iron was great.</li>

            <li> It gets hot quickly and is surprisingly easy to hold, despite its small size.</li>
            <li> Great product I went natural,but still wanted to flat iron my hair a few times.</li>

            <li> It actually gets pretty hot.  </li>

            <li> WAS I SURPRISED!!  </li>
            <li> This is a great little iron for travel, or just if you want an inexpensive way to get tight curls or quick touch ups with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> Much easier to go slow with a smaller iron, and get every hair just right. :)</li>
            <li> I ordered this one expecting it to be a bit bigger, more like the traditional mini style, but this thing is tiny.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It makes my hair look nicer its the right size for me! It makes my thin hair look thicker and softer</li>
            <li> This is a perfect size for short hair and it heats up incredibly fast.</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron before a trip to Israel in early March mainly because I wanted one I wasn&#x27;t emotionally attached to ([[ASIN:B0050Q58XI Rusk RSK807 Heat Freak Professional STR8 Ceramic Tourmaline Flat Iron, 1 1/2 Inches]])in case it got left overseas.  WAS I SURPRISED!!  This little flat iron, while not heavy on the settings, packs a punch for its size and cost.  It is tiny, so flat ironing long curly hair is a beast (but I stand as witness that it can be done and it definitely gets hot enough).  Its great for curling too.  It gave me great soft curls.  I never had an issue as some of the other reviewers did of burning myself, but I&#x27;m a little ocd about that sort of thing anyways and am pretty careful with it (so maybe they just weren&#x27;t being careful?).  I didn&#x27;t use the dual voltage setting on it since I had a pretty nice power adapter/converter that it worked great with.  This is a great little iron for travel, or just if you want an inexpensive way to get tight curls or quick touch ups with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> My seven year old and I use this on her bangs.  Awesome for small jobs, but definitely not the whole head.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter. She has short hair &amp; natural curls. She likes that its small enuff to straighten her hair. Unlike most straighteners.</li>
            <li> i guess i neglected to read the details i didn&#x27;t know it was a mini straight iron but its good for portable purposes</li>
            <li> Mine took forever to heat up and it didn&#x27;t do a very good job at straightening my hair, or any of my friends hair.</li>
            <li> Never was able to make it work. However, the fault may be my own.</li>
            <li> Ok sure, my hair is really thick, I guess, but this didn&#x27;t work on my hair at all. I had to return it.</li>
            <li> Good for travel. Its perfect size and does the work. I have very straight hair so I only use it for fly aways</li>
            <li> Great for bangs; but a little small to do any of your other hair.  I would like it to be a little hotter.</li>
            <li> I really only needed a small straightener to tame one section of wayward hair (I have pretty short hair except for on the right side in front of my ear it&#x27;s down past my chin, and it tends to curl outward when dry...) and the whirl in my bangs. I like that this straightener is tiny because if it were any bigger I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to use it effectively for the length of the hair I&#x27;m using it on. It&#x27;s also really handy when traveling. I usually plug it in when getting ready after a shower and it seems like it takes about 20 seconds to be hot enough to use. I use it every day and can&#x27;t believe I let my hair look the way it did before spending the measly $11 to buy this thing. Well worth the price and it&#x27;s the perfect size for short hair/bangs.</li>
            <li> This straightener is VERY small. I&#x27;m just making sure that no one purchases this item without understanding that is is a MINI straightener. I have long hair, and this product is not very convenient for me - unless I want to spend 4 hours separating my hair. It does get hot, just doesn&#x27;t meet my needs. I&#x27;m mainly giving it  only three stars for not putting MINI in the description and wasting my time.</li>
            <li> I recently got a pixie cut and struggled to straighten my hair with my usual straightener.  I ordered this one expecting it to be a bit bigger, more like the traditional mini style, but this thing is tiny.  I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with this thing!  It&#x27;s so tiny and perfect for straightening my short hair.  I like to flip the ends to make my hair messy looking and this straightener is great for that too.  I would not suggest for longer hair at all!  But if you have a short bob or a pixie cut, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> It does not work nor straighten my hair. Like it gets hot but doesnt straighten any of my hair fail</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to people with short hair, or guys who like to straighten their hair. This straightener is tiny! I didn&#x27;t know it was going to be this small. I have long, thick hair. This isn&#x27;t going to do anything for my hair. Anyway, I don&#x27;t like it but maybe you will.</li>
            <li> again just like the bigger flat iron it is a wonderful product and get very hot. know this flat iron is smaller and easier to handle so I let my 11 yo granddaughter use it she loves it.</li>
            <li> great size for shorter hair with frizzy ends.  Arrived quickly.  Plastic packaging difficult to open. on off button on the inside</li>
            <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;-Heats up fast, 30-60 seconds&lt;br /&gt;-Cools Quick&lt;br /&gt;-Cord length, not to short but, not too long&lt;br /&gt;-Vibrant red color&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-Small surface area&lt;br /&gt;-feels like cheap plastic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy. I love using this straightener. Gets really hot! Perfect for trying different styles. Like the color. However, it can be a little hard to handle. Try not to burn yourself.</li>
            <li> This little flat iron was great. Heats up a bit too much and burns my fingers. Didn&#x27;t really last too long maybe about 6 months but then again, I did use it daily. I don&#x27;t think this product is meant for daily use but it certainly is perfect as a back up or quick use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tiny - fits easily into luggage that&#x27;s already stuffed. But it works really well, I didn&#x27;t need to take a larger one with me. It gets hot quickly and is surprisingly easy to hold, despite its small size.</li>
            <li> too small! Like a toy,but heat up up fast. The price is a little high for this item. I feel disappointed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to freshen up my hair at the gym.  It doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I&#x27;d like but it works.  I do have thick, long hair.  This would probably work great if your hair is fine.  I might eventually buy a full size one to keep in my gym bag instead.</li>
            <li> Great product I went natural,but still wanted to flat iron my hair a few times. This little iron does the trick flawlessly.</li>
            <li> Alls i need a straightener for is my bangs.. i have pin straight hair dont even need to blow dry it straight. My bangs sometimes lay wrong and this is the perfect size!</li>
            <li> it is grt cos i cut my hair &amp; it gets all my short parts Thanx it is nice it gets nice &amp; hot</li>
            <li> When I ordered this, I didn&#x27;t realize it was TINY! Like it&#x27;s roughly the size of a cigar. I have very long straight hair, so I have no use for an expensive straightener. I just needed something to style my bangs, and this is unexpectedly perfect! Since I have very straight hair, my bangs dry totally straight, which is gross, so I use this to give them a little curve, and the size helps me get the perfect curve every time. It heats up fast, but it doesn&#x27;t have an auto turn off! Once I left it on while I was at work.  Thankfully, it didn&#x27;t burn the house down.  I definitely recommend this for anyone with short hair or bangs.</li>
            <li> This iron is so tiny.  It is perfect for my short hair.  It heats up fast &amp; does a great job straightening my bangs.</li>
            <li> What a great little travel iron and good for at home to. the only draw back is there is still a slight odor when in use. Its the perfect tool for short hair</li>
            <li> Had I known how small it was, I never would have purchased this item. I will think twice before I order another straightener online.</li>
            <li> I bought this portable straightener to replace one I lost that I got from Sally&#x27;s.  I thought this looked similar but I was wrong.  This does not close all the way so it doesn&#x27;t grasp the hair if its fine like mine.  Can&#x27;t say for sure it would work better on thicker hair, but it might.  I didn&#x27;t send it back because of the trouble and cheap price but Im definitely putting it into my next garage sale.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect too much out of it but it did even less than I expected. I have a lot of hair but it&#x27;s pretty thin so I figured if I took my time it would work. No such luck. It&#x27;s worth it to spend more and get something better quality that heats up more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as small as I had hoped. Works perfect for bangs and side burn hair.  Heats up very quickly. Word.</li>
            <li> This is a very small straightener. This has an on off switch and is small and can fit in your purse. I liked that I can travel with this and it is not bulky at all. This does make my hair straight and it fast to heat up. I would not use as everyday but travel and touch up oh yeah. This is a great product. I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have short hair, so this curling iron is the perfect size. It&#x27;s also good for both getting at my roots for straightening as well as bumping the ends of my hair in a hurry. I tried bigger irons to get more straightening done per sweep-through-my-hair, but they&#x27;re too in-the-way. Much easier to go slow with a smaller iron, and get every hair just right. :)</li>
            <li> Apparently this thing works pretty well because my wife brings it along with her everywhere!  Obviously, it must serve the purpose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a girl with a pixie hair cut and I use this to curl my hair.  It is perfect for thin silky short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pluses:&lt;br /&gt;-great price&lt;br /&gt;- portable&lt;br /&gt;- heats up fast&lt;br /&gt;- great to curl short hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;-only one setting&lt;br /&gt;- might be tedious for thick long hair people</li>
            <li> I am a guy and as far as I know this product works great. It heats up really fast. The plastic does get a little warm but that doesnt bother me. I would recommend this product. And guys if you are looking for one, the 1/2&amp;#34; works well.</li>
            <li> When I had recieved this straightener today, I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be so small. Which doesn&#x27;t bother me at all! I do love the fact that it will heat up really fast! It does exactly what I want it to do. For less than $12, it works like a $50 straightener. It works great for my very short hair. Just recently cut it &amp; needed something to help maintain the style. When I read all the reviews on this straightener, I was so excited to try it out! I will never regret buying this. I think I may just start buying more from this Bedhead brand! &#x3D;-)</li>
            <li> I got this straightener when I got bangs for the first time. My hair is pretty long and somewhere between wavy and curly, and this gets it straight pretty easily. I mainly use it on my bangs, I don&#x27;t really have the patience to do all of my hair because it&#x27;s so small, but I could if I took the time. It heats up very quickly, and doesn&#x27;t take too long to cool off. I&#x27;d recommend this product if you&#x27;re just going to use it on bangs or short hair, or even fine hair.</li>
            <li> this is perfect for short hair - I got my hair wacked off and it is very short.  This flat iron gives it the body I so desperately needed.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS....I use it daily!!! Exactly what I was looking for and exactly what the description said it was.</li>
            <li> This is a good straightener. It gets hot and works like its suppose to, which is why I&#x27;m overall satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But since this was my first straightener purchase, I&#x27;ve learned some of the drawbacks with using a mini straightener. It&#x27;s just a half inch, which means less heating space thus less heat. (It gets just as hot, but you only have 1/2 inch to work with.) It is also pretty short lengthwise. It&#x27;s a compact device, so I can&#x27;t blame it for that. Just understand that it is indeed very small. If your hair is even 2&amp;#34;, you should probably look into a 1&amp;#34; straightener instead.</li>
            <li> This is straight is very very useful, and it is very easy to carry it with me. Good product, and I love it very much!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is much smaller and lighter in weight than I expected.  I recently got bangs and needed something small to straighten my bangs with (my bigger flat iron left a dent).  This does the job and heats up hot enough, but just disapointed with how cheap it seems.  It&#x27;s always getting knocked off the vanity because of how light it is.  Guess I shouldn&#x27;t have expected too much for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking that it would be the solution for my very short hair. However, I takes me more time to use this straightener than it would to just use a blow-dryer. It&#x27;s okay for its size, but I feel that this is a product more suited to doing fine details (e.g. Doing little turn-ups at the ends of your hair, or root straightening touch ups)</li>
            <li> This straightener is perfect for styling short hair. It&#x27;s compact size allows for easy travel and storage. I would definitely recommend this product for anyone with unruly short hair.</li>
            <li> Good product, but it gets extremely hot on the entire unit (not just the plates).  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend leaving it on for long.  It heats quickly and works perfect for my short hair.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast! Works great especially for bangs! Just a note it does not have adjustable heat settings...overall a great product!</li>
            <li> The Bedhead Hook Up 1/2&amp;#34; Straightner is AWESOME!  First of all, it is adorbs being so small, but second of all, it works great! I like to throw it in my bag when I know its going to be a long day and it takes up less room than my cell phone!  It cute, its practical, and it is the right price.  I love it.</li>
            <li> This hair straightener is so tiny!  It actually gets pretty hot.  I only use it to touch up my bangs in the morning.  It serves its purpose, but I don&#x27;t recommend attempting to straighten a full head of hair with this.</li>
            <li> I have very fine textured, mixed-ethnic hair. This 1/2&amp;#34; allows me more flexibility than my larger 1&amp;#34; flat iron. And it&#x27;s very lightweight. I can get close to my scalp and edges, without the appliance being too big. And, it gets hot enough, quickly, to do the job. It&#x27;s very small. So to reduce the chance of being burned while holding it, don&#x27;t be sloppy. Only hold it at the part where there&#x27;s no flat iron surface.</li>
            <li> My first flat iron and it is just what I wanted.  I only need to straighten the front sides of my hair and it does the trick.</li>
