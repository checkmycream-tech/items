            <li>So it works and now my hair days are great!</li>
            <li>This is the best conditioner for detangling and for use as a leave-in for curly hair!  </li>
            <li>We have used all of Giovanni&#x27;s shampoos and conditioners over the years and this is one of the best in our opinion.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is amazing!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many brands and this conditioner combined with 50:50 shampoo is god send!!!</li>
            <li>It has great slip.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s AMAZING) and it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>But this is great.</li>
            <li>Product provides good slip and feels great with i put it on my hair.</li>
            <li>All-in-all they did a good job</li>
            <li>and she loved it.  </li>
            <li>It has no silicone to build up on my hair and the matching SLS-free shampoo is a good complement to it.</li>
            <li>The bottle looks good sitting in the shower.  </li>
            <li>A good product for the price.</li>
            <li>Good slip.</li>
            <li>I was able to detangle my hair with my hands, which is highly uncommon on my African-American tresses.</li>
            <li>It leaves hair beautifully conditioned and easy to style.  </li>
            <li>They smell wonderful, are all natural and they fly off the shelves.</li>
            <li>This stuff was awesome at first.  </li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best conditioner I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Absolute must buy :-D</li>
            <li>The first time I used the conditioner, my hair loved it!</li>
            <li>Giovanni is the best hair care line for natural hair of any texture.</li>
            <li>If it(price) sounds too good to be true</li>
            <li>The light fragrance is pleasant without being overpowering, and it is paraben and phalate free.  </li>
            <li>I buy this at Marshall&#x27;s in the large pump size for $12.99, so it&#x27;s a GREAT value.</li>
            <li>it is superb as a leave-in and a daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>This could be a byproduct of its more natural/gentle ingredient list, I&#x27;m just not fond of it.</li>
            <li>now my hair is healthy again.</li>
            <li>Whereas the Wen product made my hair softer and more manageable, after using Giovanni 50:50 my hair felt like it had been stripped of all its moisture.</li>
            <li>Furthermore I felt a lot of what seemed like static on my hair.</li>
            <li>Much better than the Giovanni Tea Tree Conditioner if you ask me.</li>
            <li>I like It, and it is my wife&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the Giovanni line.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a lovely product.  </li>
            <li>The smell is nice and this works just as well on my hair as the TTTT and Smooth-</li>
            <li>maybe it will work better in her hair.</li>
            <li>and I love the amount of moisture it gives to my hair.  </li>
            <li>VERY awesome conditioner for my 4c low porosity hair.</li>
            <li>My TWA love this this product.</li>
            <li>I love Giovanni shampoos but mostly the conditioners.</li>
            <li>Love this product for my curly hair.</li>
            <li>Love it, Love it and my hair loves it.</li>
            <li>Leaves my girls&#x27; hair clean without a filmy buildup and has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is wonderful for hair like mine that is dry on the ends and oily at the roots.</li>
            <li>Great for my natural hair!</li>
            <li>Giovanni hair products has many cone/silicone free as well.</li>
            <li>The packaging is sleek, stylish and clean looking.  </li>
            <li>I have lots of somewhat fine strands packed densely together &amp; they are prone to dryness.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and a bit damaged from sun and color-treatment.</li>
            <li>My cousin&#x27;s girlfriend introduced me to this product and it is by far the most amazing conditioner I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>All in all, I would buy it again but would not make it my primary conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love it, this conditioner is worth every penny</li>
            <li>This conditioner (and the accompanying shampoo) are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Giovanni 50:50 conditioning is fantastic and leaves it shiny, silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li>so I figured they should be pretty good, but the conditioner didn&#x27;t hydrate my hair enough and my hair had a lot of static.  </li>
            <li>If you have ever had the real Giovanni 50:50 conditioner, then you will be able to tell the difference when you use this product.  </li>
            <li>I used the Wen (sweet almond mint conditioner) and then used the Giovanni conditioner.</li>
            <li>All I really have to say is that I love this product.</li>
            <li>detangling with it on my loose natural hair is great!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for over two years, and it works great to hydrate my curly hair without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>Really makes my 4a-4b hair easy to finger comb</li>
            <li>(My hair is straight and fine but not \\&quot;flat\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair that tends to run oily.</li>
            <li>The products are very quality and work fantastic on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I used to be able to purchase this brand from natural food stores</li>
            <li>Not as good as their other products.</li>
            <li>I have tried other products, but I keep coming back to this one because I love that it is all natural and does a great job of allowing my sometimes dry hair to always have a great balance of moisture.</li>
            <li>A really nice product that makes my thirsty hair soft and shiny, but not heavy and lanky.</li>
            <li>I am having much better luck with the suave naturals line, which obviously is not 100% natural , but detangles and moisturizes far better and is easier on the wallet while still being silicone free.</li>
            <li>This is the only line that fixed the problem and 50:50 leaves my dry hair perfectly balanced.  </li>
            <li>One positive thing about this product, though, is the smell.</li>
            <li>The reviews were so positive that I bought the pack of three instead of just one.</li>
            <li>Even when I used more conditioner the next time and left it on during the rest of my shower, it seemed to completely rinse away and still had the static.</li>
            <li>Others may have better luck with this, but as for me it made my hair frizzy,tangled, and dry as straw.</li>
            <li>Their conditioners have always left my hair super soft and silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I find that using this conditioner makes a huge different.</li>
            <li>This product has been gentle and calming on my scalp and also helped repair the damage and dryness resulting from lots of swimming.</li>
            <li>My hair was falling out so much</li>
            <li>Btw... my friend has Very oily hair</li>
            <li>#34;hot comb ready hair&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light enough to just leave it in and keep going.  </li>
            <li>Recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>my hair responds very well to these products.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>Other products I&#x27;ve used do noticeably better.    </li>
            <li>this particular 50/50 balance conditioner was always out of stock.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just going to buy it from the store where it costs more but at least I will get the right product.</li>
            <li>It makes detangling so much more easier with little product.</li>
            <li>If I feel I need more moisture, I mix some in a deep moisture recipe I got from the long hair community (snowymoon&#x27;s moisture treatment, google this</li>
            <li>It is making my transition back to my natural black hair easy and it is priced right!</li>
            <li>For many years I assumed that all shampoos and conditioners were pretty much created equal, with some being more expensive simply because of name and packaging.  </li>
            <li>I tried this particular brand because it was suppose to be natural and ph balanced.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair very soft, but with the protection of protein.</li>
            <li>It is more expensive, true, than a regular drug store conditioner, but it is soooo worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>My hair is still natural and I now use henna for coloring and find that the 50/50 conditioner breathes new life into my hair.</li>
            <li>It is very thick (which frightened me at first) but it washes out clean and gives your hair weightless moisture!  </li>
            <li>Secondly, it does not score very high marks for me in the \\&quot;shine\\&quot; department</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>Does the job of keeping my hair soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m old school</li>
            <li>During my transition from relaxed to natural hair</li>
            <li>Unlike that product, this conditioner did the absolute opposite of what I wanted it to.   </li>
            <li>Who knows how much inventory they have that has this same labelling error?</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly type 3c and 4a.</li>
            <li>Works well, gets the tangles out and leaves my hair feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>This prodouct has been a staple product forme since I decided to go natural in August 2010.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>This product felt and smelled old.</li>
            <li>For some reason I thought it would give a bit more slip in my thick naturally curly/ afro type hair.</li>
            <li>so it usually has a light bounce after a shower).</li>
            <li>Even though this conditioner is for normal to dry hair, my hair tends to be oily and I still like it.  </li>
            <li>This is a great deal and product if you are using the no poo method which is washing your hair and scalp with conditioner you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li>I found it first in a health food store, but it&#x27;s less expensive (and more convenient) to have it delivered to my door.</li>
            <li>The consistency of this Giovanni displayed here compared to my previous &#x27;real&#x27; Giovanni product was obviously different.  </li>

            <li> The consistency of this Giovanni displayed here compared to my previous &#x27;real&#x27; Giovanni product was obviously different.  The product was so thick that I had to remove the lid to get it out of the bottle, which is not the way the &#x27;real&#x27; product should be.  The smell should have a slight citrus scent to it, but this product did not smell anything like that at all.  If you have ever had the real Giovanni 50:50 conditioner, then you will be able to tell the difference when you use this product.  Don&#x27;t be fooled(like me)! If it(price) sounds too good to be true then it probably is.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best conditioner I have ever used. I have dry, frizzy, curly hair.  If I wash it with an oilfree conditioner (don&#x27;t ever use shampoo on this type of hair it is too harsh) then follow with Giovanni 50:50 conditioner my frizz problem is gone. For those of you out there battling the same problem I recommend you read CURLY GIRL by Lorraine Massey.</li>
            <li> I have kinky curly hair, tight curls, and this works wonders for it. It has great slip. It&#x27;s creamy and smoothes and soothes my hair and scalp. It makes detangling so much more easier with little product. A small amount can be used as a leave in. It leaves your hair very soft, but with the protection of protein. It provides shine that&#x27;s really hard to get with kinky curly hair, and makes your curls really pop. It is definitely a product for all hair types, especially dry. Giovanni is the best hair care line for natural hair of any texture. Plus it&#x27;s paraben and sulfate. Giovanni hair products has many cone/silicone free as well.</li>
            <li> hey, there!  i have been using this product for about a year.  it is superb as a leave-in and a daily moisturizer.  detangling with it on my loose natural hair is great!!  i don&#x27;t like how the product doesn&#x27;t have a smell, though.</li>
            <li> While I did originally recieve the wrong product (shampoo instead of conditioner). When I called the company they immediately sent me out a the correct product and even allowed me to keep the shampoo, which I recieved the next day. All-in-all they did a good job and I would have no problem purchasing from them again.</li>
            <li> This product has been gentle and calming on my scalp and also helped repair the damage and dryness resulting from lots of swimming. In addition, it does not irritate my back the way other hair products do.    I give it only 4 stars for 2 reasons. Firstly, I&#x27;m not fond of the consistency. It is very thick and I find it is rather difficult to squeeze out from the bottle. This could be a byproduct of its more natural/gentle ingredient list, I&#x27;m just not fond of it. Secondly, it does not score very high marks for me in the \\&quot;shine\\&quot; department now my hair is healthy again. Other products I&#x27;ve used do noticeably better.    I should note that my hair falls flatter after using this (My hair is straight and fine but not \\&quot;flat\\&quot; so it usually has a light bounce after a shower). But the product never makes any claims of such so I cannot fault it.    All in all, I would buy it again but would not make it my primary conditioner.</li>
            <li> My cousin&#x27;s girlfriend introduced me to this product and it is by far the most amazing conditioner I&#x27;ve tried. It doesn&#x27;t leave any build up and gives your hair a lot of shine. You must try it out for yourself to believe it.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair. The first time I used the conditioner, my hair loved it! I was able to detangle my hair with my hands, which is highly uncommon on my African-American tresses. I also used it on my daughter&#x27;s hair. I think I will try the shampoo as well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many brands and this conditioner combined with 50:50 shampoo is god send!!! My hair was falling out so much and I couldn&#x27;t figure out what it was.  This is the only line that fixed the problem and 50:50 leaves my dry hair perfectly balanced.  I love it, this conditioner is worth every penny and so is the shampoo.  I call this my \\&quot;hidden gem\\&quot; because not a whole lot of people know but this is the best line of hair care for any hair needs.  Btw... my friend has Very oily hair and I gave her the Tea Tree Shampoo/Conditoner and she loved it.  So it works and now my hair days are great!</li>
            <li> Very moisturising without heavy build up. Does not have a heavy smell. Does the job of keeping my hair soft. I don&#x27;t know about these texture ratings people use to categorize their hair. I&#x27;m old school so my rating is &amp;#34;hot comb ready hair&amp;#34;. This product works well with it. There you go.</li>
            <li> During my transition from relaxed to natural hair I bought this based on numerous reviews from other transitioners. My hair could be described as 4C. Prior to trying this I&#x27;d been using Wen conditioner. Unlike that product, this conditioner did the absolute opposite of what I wanted it to.   I used the Wen (sweet almond mint conditioner) and then used the Giovanni conditioner. Whereas the Wen product made my hair softer and more manageable, after using Giovanni 50:50 my hair felt like it had been stripped of all its moisture. Furthermore I felt a lot of what seemed like static on my hair. I used it once and afterwards my hairdresser also used it once with me, however I don&#x27;t ever intend to use this conditioner again.   It was very disappointing and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone else. One positive thing about this product, though, is the smell. Apart from that, if I could give this product no stars I would. The reviews were so positive that I bought the pack of three instead of just one. That&#x27;s a mistake I&#x27;ll never make again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for over two years, and it works great to hydrate my curly hair without weighing it down.  The light fragrance is pleasant without being overpowering, and it is paraben and phalate free.  My only complaint is that the design of the bottle sometimes makes it tough to squeeze.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner for detangling and for use as a leave-in for curly hair!  But I will not buy this product from this seller again.  They sent me shampoo instead of conditioner because they have stuck a label on the pack of 3 that says it is shampoo when it is not.  It&#x27;s an internal labelling problem and apparently it has not been fixed (I now see that this happened to a previous reviewer).  Who knows how much inventory they have that has this same labelling error? They are going to make this right, but getting the wrong item is a hassle.  I&#x27;m just going to buy it from the store where it costs more but at least I will get the right product.</li>
            <li> All I really have to say is that I love this product. I have tried other Giovanni conditioners- not to mention the countless other brands- but this is one of my favorites. My hair is naturally curly type 3c and 4a. I have lots of somewhat fine strands packed densely together &amp; they are prone to dryness. I find that using this conditioner makes a huge different. On some days, I don&#x27;t wash all of the conditioner out of my hair. It&#x27;s light enough to just leave it in and keep going.  Much better than the Giovanni Tea Tree Conditioner if you ask me.</li>
            <li> The 50:50 is my go to shampoo and conditioner. I like It, and it is my wife&#x27;s favorite. We have used all of Giovanni&#x27;s shampoos and conditioners over the years and this is one of the best in our opinion. I always buy these two or three at a time if I&#x27;m not around a store that has refillable bulk stations.</li>
            <li> Helps keeps my hair from  drying out daily without the buildup....love it</li>
            <li> I buy this at Marshall&#x27;s in the large pump size for $12.99, so it&#x27;s a GREAT value. This conditioner is wonderful for hair like mine that is dry on the ends and oily at the roots. It has no silicone to build up on my hair and the matching SLS-free shampoo is a good complement to it. If I feel I need more moisture, I mix some in a deep moisture recipe I got from the long hair community (snowymoon&#x27;s moisture treatment, google this, it&#x27;s AMAZING) and it works wonderfully. A really nice product that makes my thirsty hair soft and shiny, but not heavy and lanky.</li>
            <li> For many years I assumed that all shampoos and conditioners were pretty much created equal, with some being more expensive simply because of name and packaging.  I was very wrong.  This conditioner (and the accompanying shampoo) are fantastic.  It leaves hair beautifully conditioned and easy to style.  It is more expensive, true, than a regular drug store conditioner, but it is soooo worth every penny.  And it is FAR less expensive than most other organic conditioners.  Recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Giovanni line.  The products are very quality and work fantastic on my hair.  The packaging is sleek, stylish and clean looking.  The bottle looks good sitting in the shower.  My only gripe is that due to the thin design of the bottle it&#x27;s hard to get all of the product out.  I find myself banging the bottle upside down in the shower to get to the last bits of conditioner.  Other than that it&#x27;s a lovely product.  The smell is nice and this works just as well on my hair as the TTTT and Smooth-As-Silk Giovanni Conditioners which is why I&#x27;ve rated it 5.</li>
            <li> Leaves my girls&#x27; hair clean without a filmy buildup and has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> Even though this conditioner is for normal to dry hair, my hair tends to be oily and I still like it.  Works well, gets the tangles out and leaves my hair feeling soft.  A good product for the price.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair that tends to run oily. Giovanni 50:50 conditioning is fantastic and leaves it shiny, silky and smooth.  Recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Product provides good slip and feels great with i put it on my hair. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling as moisturized as I would like after it is washed out.</li>
            <li> This stuff was awesome at first.  It is organic none of those yucky chemicals.  It is very thick (which frightened me at first) but it washes out clean and gives your hair weightless moisture!  It didn&#x27;t leave me with greasy roots (which I typically have a problem with when using other conditioners).  You don&#x27;t have to use a lot so it lasts forever.  However after 4 weeks of use my hair became very coarse and unmanageable.  I had to discontinue use immediately.  I have already given it way to one of my friends maybe it will work better in her hair.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser uses these products so I figured they should be pretty good, but the conditioner didn&#x27;t hydrate my hair enough and my hair had a lot of static.  Even when I used more conditioner the next time and left it on during the rest of my shower, it seemed to completely rinse away and still had the static.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and a bit damaged from sun and color-treatment. I use the matching shampoo product followed by this conditioner, and I feel that it restores moisture to my hair and avoids frizzing. I found it first in a health food store, but it&#x27;s less expensive (and more convenient) to have it delivered to my door.</li>
            <li> I use this conditioner for my every other day or daily cowashing and I love the amount of moisture it gives to my hair.  This prodouct has been a staple product forme since I decided to go natural in August 2010.  I have tried other products, but I keep coming back to this one because I love that it is all natural and does a great job of allowing my sometimes dry hair to always have a great balance of moisture.</li>
            <li> VERY awesome conditioner for my 4c low porosity hair. Good slip.</li>
            <li> Great for my natural hair! My TWA love this this product. A very small amount goes a long way and leaves my hair soft and brings out my natural curls when I use it for co-washing or use along Giovanni 50:50 shampoo. It is making my transition back to my natural black hair easy and it is priced right!</li>
            <li> Not as good as their other products. Not the same smell, texture, feeling. Shame. Used one bottle, using the other 2 for gifts.</li>
            <li> My all time favourite conditioner. I&#x27;ve never had a &amp;#34;staple product&amp;#34; before. But this is great. Detangle, moisturises n has my curls popping; even in london where the water usually kicks the life out of them. Absolute must buy :-D</li>
            <li> I love Giovanni shampoos but mostly the conditioners. Their conditioners have always left my hair super soft and silky smooth. I discovered the 50/50 conditioner and shampoo when I had locs and my hair and scalp were extremely dry from coloring. My hair is still natural and I now use henna for coloring and find that the 50/50 conditioner breathes new life into my hair. No matter the water hard, soft, cold, or hot my hair responds very well to these products. They smell wonderful, are all natural and they fly off the shelves. I used to be able to purchase this brand from natural food stores but then they were always out of stock. I then found them at Ricky&#x27;s but this particular 50/50 balance conditioner was always out of stock. I gave up looking into local stores to purchase and just ordered them in a three pack. This is a great deal and product if you are using the no poo method which is washing your hair and scalp with conditioner you will not be disappointed. I may even consider subscribing to have this item delivered to me on a consistently so as not to worry about it going out of stock.</li>
            <li> Love this product for my curly hair. It&#x27;s moisturizing without weighing my hair down, and leaves no residue, eliminating the need for a harsh shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love it, Love it and my hair loves it.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I tried this particular brand because it was suppose to be natural and ph balanced. Not sure how a conditioner can dry your hair out, but this one managed to do just that. Others may have better luck with this, but as for me it made my hair frizzy,tangled, and dry as straw. I am having much better luck with the suave naturals line, which obviously is not 100% natural , but detangles and moisturizes far better and is easier on the wallet while still being silicone free.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is amazing!!!  Really makes my 4a-4b hair easy to finger comb then wide tooth comb through!!!  I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> This product felt and smelled old. For some reason I thought it would give a bit more slip in my thick naturally curly/ afro type hair. I have 3 bottles, I&#x27;ll use the rest in my 4 daughters hair but I will not reorder this product. I &amp;#34;may&amp;#34; give it another chance in my hair but at the moment I don&#x27;t like it, I&#x27;ll update if my opinion changes.</li>
