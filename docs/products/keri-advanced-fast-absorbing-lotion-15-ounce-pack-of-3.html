            <li>How nice to be able to order it online.  </li>
            <li>In addition the price is reasonable, actually a great buy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many lotions and NONE have worked as well as this one.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this as a body and face lotion for many years.</li>

            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>This lotion is smooth, it isn&#x27;t oily, it isn&#x27;t greasy, it has just a very light scent (I can&#x27;t stand products that smell), I don&#x27;t wear perfume, etc.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is not greasy and blends into the skin easily, as well as thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>Now I buy them in three-packs, the price is a bit more, but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>Since I use a keyboard and mouse at my work it is important to me not to have the lotion come off on everything.</li>

            <li>smells good, absorbs completely and does not leave your hads greasy.  </li>
            <li>Original review:  </li>
            <li>This lotion is great for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It feels light on my skin and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>I like that it is light and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I was happy to find the fast absorbing, it really is.  </li>
            <li>This is true from smart phone and tablet as well.</li>
            <li>Keri lotion is light and fast absorbing.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it very much.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion and this seems to be the only place that I can get it.  </li>
            <li>I have used only Keri Advanced as a general moisturizer for many years.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>When I stopped finding it at my normal stores, I came to Amazon.  </li>
            <li>And I have had allergies for many years to anything heavily perfumed.  </li>
            <li>It dries fast and does not leave skin feeling sticky like so many other big name brands I tried.  </li>
            <li>I can live without it..</li>
            <li>Keri Advanced is the only choice for me because I like the &amp;#34;ungreasiness&amp;#34; factor, and when applied while my body is still damp after towel-drying from my daily shower, it leaves my skin feeling moisturized and supple.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, not greasy, fast absorption, no strong scent and it works for me.</li>
            <li>My skin is 81 years young, and feels smoooooth!</li>
            <li>Keeping skin less dry at 78 with mild diabetes is a challenge.  </li>

            <li> No other lotion compares for combating my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I wish they had a body scrub for the shower to remove dry skin in the winter, and sluffing off dry skin in the summer before a tan.  </li>
            <li> The Advanced formula is very difficult to find in retail stores, and it is the only Keri lotion that is oil-free.  </li>
            <li> Little bit is enough.  </li>
            <li> It does not feel oily and once it is rubbed in there is no trace of it other than my skin feels softer.</li>
            <li> My only problem is its hard to find it in store.</li>
            <li> no one carries it any more and if they do it is very expensive!</li>
            <li> It does not feel heavy like all the other lotions I have tried.</li>
            <li> Sad this is no where to be found in the stores where I live.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday after I shower.  </li>
            <li> You can use this all year round.</li>
            <li> As usual, the order arrived on time.  </li>
            <li> A doctor reccomended Keri Advance to me years ago because in the cold season my skin dries up and blothches and it itch its a major problem.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find keri in the stores</li>
            <li> I have been unable to find it in the drugstore or grocery store.  </li>

            <li> Love this brand!  I was happy to find the fast absorbing, it really is.  Sad this is no where to be found in the stores where I live.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, not greasy, fast absorption, no strong scent and it works for me. Will order again.  Thank you. - maria</li>
            <li> As Advertised, Prompt delivery</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and this seems to be the only place that I can get it.  Please continue keeping it in stock.</li>
            <li> I wish they had a body scrub for the shower to remove dry skin in the winter, and sluffing off dry skin in the summer before a tan.  What a seller that product would be!!!</li>
            <li> smells good, absorbs completely and does not leave your hads greasy.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> As usual, the order arrived on time.  This lotion is not greasy and blends into the skin easily, as well as thoroughly.  In addition the price is reasonable, actually a great buy.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many lotions and NONE have worked as well as this one.  It dries fast and does not leave skin feeling sticky like so many other big name brands I tried.  I have been using this as a body and face lotion for many years. Once you use it, you will never use another lotion!</li>
            <li> Great product,  I will continue to purchase, fast shipping and a great price! It is very hard to find keri in the stores no one carries it any more and if they do it is very expensive!</li>
            <li> Update, January 26, 2016:  What the f? $80 for a three-pack? Do they include solid gold bars in every pack?   Original review:  I have used only Keri Advanced as a general moisturizer for many years.  When I stopped finding it at my normal stores, I came to Amazon.  Now I buy them in three-packs, the price is a bit more, but it is worth it.  This lotion is smooth, it isn&#x27;t oily, it isn&#x27;t greasy, it has just a very light scent (I can&#x27;t stand products that smell), I don&#x27;t wear perfume, etc.  Anyway, there must be a reason my dermatologist tells me my skin is decades younger than I am.  I think this lotion has a lot to do with it.</li>
            <li> Husband&#x27;s favorite; not oily, pleasant scent</li>
            <li> the only lotion I can find that actually absorbs into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.  I order it online&lt;br /&gt;because I can&#x27;t find it in any box stores.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for years now and it is my favorite. It does not feel oily and once it is rubbed in there is no trace of it other than my skin feels softer. Since I use a keyboard and mouse at my work it is important to me not to have the lotion come off on everything. This is true from smart phone and tablet as well.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great for dry skin.  It isn&#x27;t oily or sticky.</li>
            <li> Out of all the keri products the Advanced is the best.A doctor reccomended Keri Advance to me years ago because in the cold season my skin dries up and blothches and it itch its a major problem.So after I shower I apply it everywhere I have dryness and it goes away within days.I can live without it..</li>
            <li> I have used this hand lotion for a number of years.  I have been unable to find it in the drugstore or grocery store.  I am happy that I can order it online.</li>
            <li> This is the only body lotion recommended by my dermatologist for over 20 years, and I use it exclusively.  It is oil-free, non-greasy, absorbent with no gooey feeling, and leaves my skin nice and smooth.  The Advanced formula is very difficult to find in retail stores, and it is the only Keri lotion that is oil-free.  How nice to be able to order it online.  Keri lotion is the best.</li>
            <li> This product has fulfilled my need.  Keeping skin less dry at 78 with mild diabetes is a challenge.  And I have had allergies for many years to anything heavily perfumed.  It does the job, arrived on time and was just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Keri Advanced is the only choice for me because I like the &amp;#34;ungreasiness&amp;#34; factor, and when applied while my body is still damp after towel-drying from my daily shower, it leaves my skin feeling moisturized and supple. My skin is 81 years young, and feels smoooooth!</li>
            <li> Keri lotion is light and fast absorbing.  No other lotion compares for combating my dry skin.  I use it everyday after I shower.  It feels light on my skin and absorbs quickly.  It does not feel heavy like all the other lotions I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years. Its light. You can use this all year round. My only problem is its hard to find it in store. Good thing I was able to find it here at Amazon!</li>
            <li> excellent lotion; I use it all the time even on my hair.  the best lotion I ever had.  I recommend it very much.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. I like that it is light and absorbs quickly. The smell is nice, as well. I will continue to purchase the three pack.</li>
            <li> great fast absorbing light lotion</li>
