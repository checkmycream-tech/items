            <li>Amazing?</li>
            <li>While using this product the seche vite restore is a must own.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>I bought this to start doing my own manicures.  </li>
            <li>Honestly.</li>
            <li>I was happy that my package arrived on time and even more excited to try out the product!</li>
            <li>HAS SUPER SHINE AND GLOSS WITH GREAT QUALITY.</li>
            <li>BEST clear coat.</li>
            <li>I always do my own nails and have tried lots of different brands and this one is the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>so I had to get more.  </li>
            <li>Have been using this product for MANY years and will continue to.</li>
            <li>Seche vite is my favorite top coat</li>
            <li>It ruined many polish jobs before I realized what was happening.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a MUCH better product.</li>
            <li>I also purchased the top coat.</li>
            <li>The top coat&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>this brand is also my favorite.</li>
            <li>I wanted to protect my nails from damage and I&#x27;m sure it would have.</li>
            <li>The more layer the ticker it gets.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>The top coat firms up almost immediately</li>
            <li>Love this brand.</li>
            <li>I give this brand as a top coat 10 stars if I had the option  : )</li>
            <li>Try is you will love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fabulous!  </li>
            <li>Ive tried many variations on application with no difference.</li>
            <li>glaze flip flop fantasy too!:)</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Added bonus is that it&#x27;s formaldehyde and toluene free!</li>
            <li>I also bought the top coat.  </li>
            <li>If you put on a top coat every 3 days, your nail color lasts about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I top with Seche Vite and my nails</li>
            <li>worked way better for me.  </li>
            <li>i love their top coat.  </li>
            <li>I used it as soon as I received it and paint my nails with an opi nail color with a sache v top coat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;when combined with the Seche Vite Top Coat</li>
            <li>but im glad it came.</li>
            <li>it helped keep my polish on for days and it still hasnt came off ! :)</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m able to save a lot of money.</li>
            <li>I Love this top coat.  </li>
            <li>I also use the Seche Top Coat.</li>
            <li>I love the topcoat</li>
            <li>(If you have a UV light, the Seche UV top coat is also very good and can be removed normally without damage to your nails.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this wouldn&#x27;t be an issue with light colors or skin-toned shades, but I like to wear bold, bright polishes, and I don&#x27;t want to risk this happening again...</li>
            <li>It sells for a very reasonable price and is just as good as brands like Butter of London or Julep.</li>
            <li>look beautiful and professionally done every time.  </li>
            <li>With all basecoats, I&#x27;ve had the best results when doing this, instead of allowing the basecoat to fully dry on my nails before applying polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>Both are great products that Amazon offers at an affordable price!</li>
            <li>BUT, after painting over it and then using the top coat (Which is actually fabulous)</li>
            <li>I got great results even using it by itself, it gives a natural shine to my nails.</li>
            <li>but this one is by far the absolute best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>it goes over very quickly and stays shiny for days after.</li>
            <li>It does not bubble and applies easily.  </li>
            <li>It drys very quickly, lasts and lasts...</li>
            <li>: Strong smell and you have to purchase the restore.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent  top coat and really does help your manicure last longer, maintaining freshly applied look for longer than most top coats.  </li>
            <li>So if you like cheapo nail products, Seche Vite is fine.</li>
            <li>but for now, it&#x27;s going just fine.</li>
            <li>I get tons of people who ask me if I use gel when I use this also super shiny!</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s super shiny, dries whatever nail polish</li>
            <li>Dries to a semi-matte and so quickly!</li>
            <li>you haven&#x27;t tried the fast drying top coat, GET IT!</li>
            <li>Makes giving yourself your own mani and pedi so easy and so much quicker</li>
            <li>and I get a huge chip, or two, or three.</li>
            <li>It caused my manicure to come off in either huge chunks or all the polish would just pop off of my nails.</li>
            <li>It covers so smooth and no bubbles.</li>
            <li>Great product and price from Cosmetics Central!</li>
            <li>A fantastic product that I&#x27;ll be using forever.</li>
            <li>This product shrinks away from the free edge upon drying.  </li>
            <li>the bright side it did protect my natural nail</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t bubble like my Dior did, and dries almost instantaneously.</li>
            <li>If you paint your own nails getting a polish thinner will really make a difference with the longevity and wear of your nail polish.</li>
            <li>It dries clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily, dries quickly, and can even be worn by itself.</li>
            <li>I clean houses now and my polish stays on my nails and toes for over a week.</li>
            <li>My nail polish comes off clean and doesn&#x27;t stain.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s anything special though.</li>
            <li>Comes right off!</li>
            <li>It only lasts for about 2 days but that&#x27;s good for me.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and last pretty good.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly</li>
            <li>It applies well and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>also have a bottle of restore which is a polish thinner to keep your nail polish in the best shape because thick nail polish will peel right off.</li>
            <li>like to put on every other day on my clean nails, feel my nails so clean and even look good.</li>
            <li>This is a little pricey compared to most top coats, but I think very worth it, as it extends the life of any nail polish that you choose!</li>
            <li>Hands down the very best in professional and DYI nail care.  </li>
            <li>to test the reliability of this basecoat, I&#x27;m going to attempt this again with a different polish brand, but for the time being, Seche loves Essie, and I love this basecoat!</li>
            <li>Better off going to the dollar store and getting clear coat!</li>
            <li>I didnot see the content of alcohol in the ingredients of this nail polish in the internet descriptions but it is the first ingredient on the polish bottle!</li>
            <li>Two coats works best if you&#x27;re using a thin nail color over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended,</li>
            <li>so I figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>Better than the OPI top coat I used previously.</li>
            <li>so I don’t have to worry about messing it up with light activity, and after 20-30 minutes, I continue with my normal activities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It dries super fast to keep from getting wrinkle marks and nicks in your polish.</li>
            <li>But...in the long run...it&#x27;s worth putting up in order to get such great result</li>
            <li>It really causes the nail polish to adhere to the nails!  </li>
            <li>It works pretty well too.</li>
            <li>You might have a better experience of you have different nails than me.</li>
            <li>(The only thing better is maybe a gel manicure.)  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t paint my nails without applying it first now.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many different brands</li>
            <li>I first got this out of curiosity</li>
            <li>I also love the top coat and have recommended Seche to others in the past as well.</li>
            <li>Before my nail polish looked lifeless but with this top coat it&#x27;s shiny and looks fresh for a long time.</li>
            <li>and it comes fast!</li>
            <li>Love it, especially at this price.</li>
            <li>AND I MADE SEVERAL MORE PURCHASES FOR MYSELF</li>
            <li>fast drying base coat prepares your nails for that perfect coat of color and adheres nicely to keep the chipping to a minimum</li>
            <li>It really helps to extend the life of your manicure, and the top coat helps the polish to dry quickly and to be very shiny!</li>
            <li>If you knoe any secrets to keep it from peeling snd want amazing shine and fast dry time, this is for you!</li>
            <li>Quick to dry, but strong smelling.</li>
            <li>Seche is THE best base and top coat brand</li>
            <li>After the color has set, but not dried completely, I apply the Seche Vite top coat.</li>
            <li>The Seche Vite top coat is awesome, so I tried this base coat, and no...</li>
            <li>Seche Vite has the best base and top coats out there.</li>
            <li>I had great hopes from this base coat as their top coat is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I use it every time (even for a quick clear coat when I don&#x27;t have time to paint my nails).</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it has a strong scent.</li>
            <li>My only problem is how strong the smell is, but the smell doesn&#x27;t change how the quality or texture of it.</li>
            <li>My experience has been this:  even if you prime your nail with pure acetone, and cap the free edge during the application, it shrinks slightly and pulls away from the free edge as it dries.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely a MUST have for every nail polish</li>
            <li>I used this basecoat along with Essie polish, and the Seche Topcoat, and my nails have been chip free for an entire week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just make sure you use it while your nail polish is still wet so that you don&#x27;t get any shrinkage.</li>
            <li>It dries so fast together.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and turns all white and crusty around the edges of my polish.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to use the bottom coat you have to be really patient.</li>
            <li>Nails were ready for polish by the time I finished with my 10th nail  </li>
            <li>It lasts for a whole 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>It is so shiny and dries SOOOOO FAST.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It is fast drying and&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it dries fast.</li>
            <li>, the whole polish had come off of 2 of my nails &amp; by the end of the day it was as if I had never painted my nails at all.</li>
            <li>I really wish I had read reviews on it before I purchased it.</li>
            <li>and I like it just as much.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I was so excited to show everyone the next day, but about 3 hours into my day</li>
            <li>As with the top coat, the brush is too short and it is easy to waste much of the product because it cannot be reached.</li>
            <li>It had more good reviews than bad</li>
            <li>While this top coat does what it days, every time I wear it date only a day or two my entire polish coat peels off like a shell</li>
            <li>I used it several times and not once could I get my manicure to last more than two days.</li>
            <li>This clear coat does the job, but just seems to be average like most other top coats.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t screw the top on too tightly, or this will probably happen to your bottle.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>My nails are SUPER SHINY, dry quickly and last about two weeks.  </li>
            <li>Normally my nails chip in 2-3 days, but this extended their life to 5-6 days without chipping.</li>
            <li>I use it with the Seche Vite top coat, and I&#x27;ve never had nail polish last this long ever.  </li>
            <li>However, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, the best part about this base coat is that it keeps my nails from yellowing when I consistently keep my nails painted.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and definitely makes your polish last longer.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t super impressed, but wasn&#x27;t disappointed either!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I’ve tried the top coat without the base coat and though it still looks great, I’m convinced the base+top coat combo is the key.</li>
            <li>even though the polish was completely dry, you could push the nail polish right off because of how the bottom coat is.</li>
            <li>And, if the color starts to look dull, I apply another top coat to shine it</li>
            <li>also swipe my nails with rubbing alcohol after filing then washing them but before painting to get rid of any oil, then I finish with the Seche Vite top coat and my polish stays on for a week or two depending on how hard I am on my nails that week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It actually stays on my fingers where other clears come off easily and chip.</li>
            <li>Clear away.  </li>
            <li>I liked Seche Vite, the top coat, but the polishjust chips or peels immediately when you apply this base coat.</li>
            <li>Works fine and there is not a strong odor, would recommend</li>
            <li>Seche Clear is the best base coat I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Best professional base coat I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>So I thought this base coat would be as amazing as the seche vite top coat</li>
            <li>But the finish seems to remain a bit soft.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best base coat I&#x27;ve every used on my natural nails.  </li>
            <li>Have no complaints so far.</li>
            <li>The Base coat is perfect for my nails.</li>
            <li>It really does protect my nails underneath the base coat, and when you pair it with the Seche Vite top coat, you&#x27;ve got BETTER than a salon manicure.  </li>
            <li>Best base coat to use.</li>
            <li>Excellent base coat.</li>
            <li>This has to be the best base coat ever.  </li>
            <li>This is honestly one of my favourite brands for base coat and top coat.</li>
            <li>I have been using both the seche vite top coat and base coat with nice nailpolishes like OPI and Butter London.</li>
            <li>This is the best base coat.  </li>
            <li>this base coat is so great!</li>
            <li>I love Seche Vite as a top coat, so I figured that the base coat would be a high quality product as well.  </li>
            <li>You can see a little flaking on the side of my middle and index fingers, and the color (Essie Mojito Madness) is a little dull, but it still looks pretty good!</li>
            <li>Normally, my nail polish on my hands last for about 5 days..</li>
            <li>It was exactly the way I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>Seche Vite is an amazing product, but unfortunately, Seche Clear is not.</li>
            <li>I have used this brand of base coat (also the top coat) for many years.</li>
            <li>It helps hold your color to your nail and creates a nice smooth base for polishing.</li>
            <li>I will use no other.</li>
            <li>I will use no other now.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really compare base coats so it is hard for me to know if there are actually better ones out there, but this is a good brand name.</li>
            <li>I agree 100% with all the other positive user reviews.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the product was expired, but I had a bad experienced.</li>
            <li>is very shiny and long lasting.</li>
            <li>it really does make my manicure last long</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised at the reviews for this product, because I&#x27;ve had the opposite experience.</li>
            <li>no yellow nails so far.</li>
            <li>I manicure my nails at home and use the Seche Clear base coat and Seche Vite top coat with a variety of nail polish brands like Essie, OPI, Orly and even Sally Hansen - all with fabulous, long-lasting results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have never had a base or top coat that chips/flakes away more easily or in bigger chunks.</li>
            <li>After a few uses, the black top became glued to the glass.</li>
            <li>I use the rebuild because it keeps my peeling nails strong plus their base coat and top coat.</li>
            <li>Tjis top coat is both amazing and terrible.</li>
            <li>The downside is that even with glitter you&#x27;ll get chipping really fast, so use it only if you can change your polish every other day.</li>
            <li>and im left with bare nail.</li>
            <li>used to dedicate about 3 hours every 3 days to maintain my OPI Nail Envy base and top coat manicure, and more time with other brands.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best base coat I have ever used.</li>

            <li> but I am hoping that it will be of good quality</li>
            <li> In looking for a good nail polish, I don&#x27;t want alcohol in it.</li>

            <li> Better than the one my solon lady uses!</li>
            <li> Absolute the best top coat for nails, EVER,!  </li>
            <li> Amazing?</li>
            <li> While using this product the seche vite restore is a must own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> I bought this to start doing my own manicures.  </li>
            <li> Honestly.</li>
            <li> I was happy that my package arrived on time and even more excited to try out the product!</li>
            <li> HAS SUPER SHINE AND GLOSS WITH GREAT QUALITY.</li>
            <li> BEST clear coat.</li>
            <li> I always do my own nails and have tried lots of different brands and this one is the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> so I had to get more.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this product for MANY years and will continue to.</li>
            <li> Seche vite is my favorite top coat</li>
            <li> It ruined many polish jobs before I realized what was happening.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a MUCH better product.</li>
            <li> I also purchased the top coat.</li>
            <li> The top coat&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> this brand is also my favorite.</li>
            <li> I wanted to protect my nails from damage and I&#x27;m sure it would have.</li>
            <li> The more layer the ticker it gets.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> The top coat firms up almost immediately</li>
            <li> Love this brand.</li>
            <li> I give this brand as a top coat 10 stars if I had the option  : )</li>
            <li> Try is you will love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fabulous!  </li>
            <li> Ive tried many variations on application with no difference.</li>
            <li> glaze flip flop fantasy too!:)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Added bonus is that it&#x27;s formaldehyde and toluene free!</li>
            <li> I also bought the top coat.  </li>
            <li> If you put on a top coat every 3 days, your nail color lasts about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I top with Seche Vite and my nails</li>
            <li> worked way better for me.  </li>
            <li> i love their top coat.  </li>
            <li> I used it as soon as I received it and paint my nails with an opi nail color with a sache v top coat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;when combined with the Seche Vite Top Coat</li>
            <li> but im glad it came.</li>
            <li> it helped keep my polish on for days and it still hasnt came off ! :)</li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m able to save a lot of money.</li>
            <li> I Love this top coat.  </li>
            <li> I also use the Seche Top Coat.</li>
            <li> I love the topcoat</li>
            <li> (If you have a UV light, the Seche UV top coat is also very good and can be removed normally without damage to your nails.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this wouldn&#x27;t be an issue with light colors or skin-toned shades, but I like to wear bold, bright polishes, and I don&#x27;t want to risk this happening again...</li>
            <li> It sells for a very reasonable price and is just as good as brands like Butter of London or Julep.</li>
            <li> look beautiful and professionally done every time.  </li>
            <li> With all basecoats, I&#x27;ve had the best results when doing this, instead of allowing the basecoat to fully dry on my nails before applying polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Both are great products that Amazon offers at an affordable price!</li>
            <li> BUT, after painting over it and then using the top coat (Which is actually fabulous)</li>
            <li> I got great results even using it by itself, it gives a natural shine to my nails.</li>
            <li> but this one is by far the absolute best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> it goes over very quickly and stays shiny for days after.</li>
            <li> It does not bubble and applies easily.  </li>
            <li> It drys very quickly, lasts and lasts...</li>
            <li> : Strong smell and you have to purchase the restore.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent  top coat and really does help your manicure last longer, maintaining freshly applied look for longer than most top coats.  </li>
            <li> So if you like cheapo nail products, Seche Vite is fine.</li>
            <li> but for now, it&#x27;s going just fine.</li>
            <li> I get tons of people who ask me if I use gel when I use this also super shiny!</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s super shiny, dries whatever nail polish</li>
            <li> Dries to a semi-matte and so quickly!</li>
            <li> you haven&#x27;t tried the fast drying top coat, GET IT!</li>
            <li> Makes giving yourself your own mani and pedi so easy and so much quicker</li>
            <li> and I get a huge chip, or two, or three.</li>
            <li> It caused my manicure to come off in either huge chunks or all the polish would just pop off of my nails.</li>
            <li> It covers so smooth and no bubbles.</li>
            <li> Great product and price from Cosmetics Central!</li>
            <li> A fantastic product that I&#x27;ll be using forever.</li>
            <li> This product shrinks away from the free edge upon drying.  </li>
            <li> the bright side it did protect my natural nail</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t bubble like my Dior did, and dries almost instantaneously.</li>
            <li> If you paint your own nails getting a polish thinner will really make a difference with the longevity and wear of your nail polish.</li>
            <li> It dries clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily, dries quickly, and can even be worn by itself.</li>
            <li> I clean houses now and my polish stays on my nails and toes for over a week.</li>
            <li> My nail polish comes off clean and doesn&#x27;t stain.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s anything special though.</li>
            <li> Comes right off!</li>
            <li> It only lasts for about 2 days but that&#x27;s good for me.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and last pretty good.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly</li>
            <li> It applies well and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> also have a bottle of restore which is a polish thinner to keep your nail polish in the best shape because thick nail polish will peel right off.</li>
            <li> like to put on every other day on my clean nails, feel my nails so clean and even look good.</li>
            <li> This is a little pricey compared to most top coats, but I think very worth it, as it extends the life of any nail polish that you choose!</li>
            <li> Hands down the very best in professional and DYI nail care.  </li>
            <li> to test the reliability of this basecoat, I&#x27;m going to attempt this again with a different polish brand, but for the time being, Seche loves Essie, and I love this basecoat!</li>
            <li> Better off going to the dollar store and getting clear coat!</li>
            <li> I didnot see the content of alcohol in the ingredients of this nail polish in the internet descriptions but it is the first ingredient on the polish bottle!</li>
            <li> Two coats works best if you&#x27;re using a thin nail color over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended,</li>
            <li> so I figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> Better than the OPI top coat I used previously.</li>
            <li> so I don’t have to worry about messing it up with light activity, and after 20-30 minutes, I continue with my normal activities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It dries super fast to keep from getting wrinkle marks and nicks in your polish.</li>
            <li> But...in the long run...it&#x27;s worth putting up in order to get such great result</li>
            <li> It really causes the nail polish to adhere to the nails!  </li>
            <li> It works pretty well too.</li>
            <li> You might have a better experience of you have different nails than me.</li>
            <li> (The only thing better is maybe a gel manicure.)  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t paint my nails without applying it first now.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried many different brands</li>
            <li> I first got this out of curiosity</li>
            <li> I also love the top coat and have recommended Seche to others in the past as well.</li>
            <li> Before my nail polish looked lifeless but with this top coat it&#x27;s shiny and looks fresh for a long time.</li>
            <li> and it comes fast!</li>
            <li> Love it, especially at this price.</li>
            <li> AND I MADE SEVERAL MORE PURCHASES FOR MYSELF</li>
            <li> fast drying base coat prepares your nails for that perfect coat of color and adheres nicely to keep the chipping to a minimum</li>
            <li> It really helps to extend the life of your manicure, and the top coat helps the polish to dry quickly and to be very shiny!</li>
            <li> If you knoe any secrets to keep it from peeling snd want amazing shine and fast dry time, this is for you!</li>
            <li> Quick to dry, but strong smelling.</li>
            <li> Seche is THE best base and top coat brand</li>
            <li> After the color has set, but not dried completely, I apply the Seche Vite top coat.</li>
            <li> The Seche Vite top coat is awesome, so I tried this base coat, and no...</li>
            <li> Seche Vite has the best base and top coats out there.</li>
            <li> I had great hopes from this base coat as their top coat is fabulous.</li>
            <li> I use it every time (even for a quick clear coat when I don&#x27;t have time to paint my nails).</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it has a strong scent.</li>
            <li> My only problem is how strong the smell is, but the smell doesn&#x27;t change how the quality or texture of it.</li>
            <li> My experience has been this:  even if you prime your nail with pure acetone, and cap the free edge during the application, it shrinks slightly and pulls away from the free edge as it dries.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely a MUST have for every nail polish</li>
            <li> I used this basecoat along with Essie polish, and the Seche Topcoat, and my nails have been chip free for an entire week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just make sure you use it while your nail polish is still wet so that you don&#x27;t get any shrinkage.</li>
            <li> It dries so fast together.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and turns all white and crusty around the edges of my polish.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to use the bottom coat you have to be really patient.</li>
            <li> Nails were ready for polish by the time I finished with my 10th nail  </li>
            <li> It lasts for a whole 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> It is so shiny and dries SOOOOO FAST.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It is fast drying and&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it dries fast.</li>
            <li> , the whole polish had come off of 2 of my nails &amp; by the end of the day it was as if I had never painted my nails at all.</li>
            <li> I really wish I had read reviews on it before I purchased it.</li>
            <li> and I like it just as much.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I was so excited to show everyone the next day, but about 3 hours into my day</li>
            <li> As with the top coat, the brush is too short and it is easy to waste much of the product because it cannot be reached.</li>
            <li> It had more good reviews than bad</li>
            <li> While this top coat does what it days, every time I wear it date only a day or two my entire polish coat peels off like a shell</li>
            <li> I used it several times and not once could I get my manicure to last more than two days.</li>
            <li> This clear coat does the job, but just seems to be average like most other top coats.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t screw the top on too tightly, or this will probably happen to your bottle.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My nails are SUPER SHINY, dry quickly and last about two weeks.  </li>
            <li> Normally my nails chip in 2-3 days, but this extended their life to 5-6 days without chipping.</li>
            <li> I use it with the Seche Vite top coat, and I&#x27;ve never had nail polish last this long ever.  </li>
            <li> However, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, the best part about this base coat is that it keeps my nails from yellowing when I consistently keep my nails painted.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and definitely makes your polish last longer.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t super impressed, but wasn&#x27;t disappointed either!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I’ve tried the top coat without the base coat and though it still looks great, I’m convinced the base+top coat combo is the key.</li>
            <li> even though the polish was completely dry, you could push the nail polish right off because of how the bottom coat is.</li>
            <li> And, if the color starts to look dull, I apply another top coat to shine it</li>
            <li> also swipe my nails with rubbing alcohol after filing then washing them but before painting to get rid of any oil, then I finish with the Seche Vite top coat and my polish stays on for a week or two depending on how hard I am on my nails that week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It actually stays on my fingers where other clears come off easily and chip.</li>
            <li> Clear away.  </li>
            <li> I liked Seche Vite, the top coat, but the polishjust chips or peels immediately when you apply this base coat.</li>
            <li> Works fine and there is not a strong odor, would recommend</li>
            <li> Seche Clear is the best base coat I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Best professional base coat I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> So I thought this base coat would be as amazing as the seche vite top coat</li>
            <li> But the finish seems to remain a bit soft.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best base coat I&#x27;ve every used on my natural nails.  </li>
            <li> Have no complaints so far.</li>
            <li> The Base coat is perfect for my nails.</li>
            <li> It really does protect my nails underneath the base coat, and when you pair it with the Seche Vite top coat, you&#x27;ve got BETTER than a salon manicure.  </li>
            <li> Best base coat to use.</li>
            <li> Excellent base coat.</li>
            <li> This has to be the best base coat ever.  </li>
            <li> This is honestly one of my favourite brands for base coat and top coat.</li>
            <li> I have been using both the seche vite top coat and base coat with nice nailpolishes like OPI and Butter London.</li>
            <li> This is the best base coat.  </li>
            <li> this base coat is so great!</li>
            <li> I love Seche Vite as a top coat, so I figured that the base coat would be a high quality product as well.  </li>
            <li> You can see a little flaking on the side of my middle and index fingers, and the color (Essie Mojito Madness) is a little dull, but it still looks pretty good!</li>
            <li> Normally, my nail polish on my hands last for about 5 days..</li>
            <li> It was exactly the way I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is an amazing product, but unfortunately, Seche Clear is not.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand of base coat (also the top coat) for many years.</li>
            <li> It helps hold your color to your nail and creates a nice smooth base for polishing.</li>
            <li> I will use no other.</li>
            <li> I will use no other now.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really compare base coats so it is hard for me to know if there are actually better ones out there, but this is a good brand name.</li>
            <li> I agree 100% with all the other positive user reviews.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the product was expired, but I had a bad experienced.</li>
            <li> is very shiny and long lasting.</li>
            <li> it really does make my manicure last long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at the reviews for this product, because I&#x27;ve had the opposite experience.</li>
            <li> no yellow nails so far.</li>
            <li> I manicure my nails at home and use the Seche Clear base coat and Seche Vite top coat with a variety of nail polish brands like Essie, OPI, Orly and even Sally Hansen - all with fabulous, long-lasting results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have never had a base or top coat that chips/flakes away more easily or in bigger chunks.</li>
            <li> After a few uses, the black top became glued to the glass.</li>
            <li> I use the rebuild because it keeps my peeling nails strong plus their base coat and top coat.</li>
            <li> Tjis top coat is both amazing and terrible.</li>
            <li> The downside is that even with glitter you&#x27;ll get chipping really fast, so use it only if you can change your polish every other day.</li>
            <li> and im left with bare nail.</li>
            <li> used to dedicate about 3 hours every 3 days to maintain my OPI Nail Envy base and top coat manicure, and more time with other brands.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best base coat I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I need a new base and top coat!</li>
            <li> This base coat is amazing, but it does smell to high heaven.  </li>
            <li> Best base coat I&#x27;ve ever purchased, bar none...don&#x27;t waste your money on others!</li>
            <li> My last bottle got stuck closed and the glass actually BROKE when I tried to open it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found better results using Gelous Advanced Nail Gel Coat, with the green cap, as my base coat.</li>
            <li> Am very pleased, especially after using more expensive &amp;#34;top of the line&amp;#34; base coats.  </li>
            <li> , my nails dry up faster and it also last longer.  </li>
            <li> Really seems to help my polish stick longer, at least compared to the Beauty Secrets I was using before.</li>
            <li> It holds my nail polish quite well, no chipping or flaking off for a long time</li>
            <li> LASTS LONG</li>
            <li> but if using this color or any other highly color saturated nail polish color I would say make sure you double up on the base coat.</li>
            <li> My top got stuck so it&#x27;s impossible to open now.</li>
            <li> them be dry to the touch in under a minute, about 5 for completely dry.</li>
            <li> Overall, great base coat!</li>
            <li> Seche Clear base coat is made to work with the Seche Vite top coat, creating a bond with color between - and together, they work wonders.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really nice base coat, definitely cheaper than OPI.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite base coat.</li>
            <li> and I still have about half left</li>
            <li> and of course, apply your Seche topcoat while the color is still wet.</li>
            <li> Now, I only spend about an hour once a week (give or take a few days) and they always look great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can have wet nails one minute and paint over them with this and havw</li>
            <li> Base coat with Top Nail make my manicure last longer.</li>
            <li> I have used many different base coats in my life</li>
            <li> Then I tried those same colors with my Revlon base coat which works like magic.</li>
            <li> When I put it on and then my nail color, 2-3 thin coats, and then Seche Vite, my nails are very very tough and that&#x27;s a nice added benefit as my nails tend to be a bit brittle.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend both the Seche Vite top and base coats!</li>
            <li> like it was supposed to &amp; the shipping is super quick &amp; I had no problems with it but other than that its horrible.</li>
            <li> This base coat does not adhere to the nail so nail polish starts peeling pretty fast.</li>
            <li> The process destroyed my nails after a few weeks and it was super expensive.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to purchase this at first</li>
            <li> After only one use, I realize how wrong that assumption was, and I am throwing away my bottle of Seche Clear.  </li>
            <li> I always wondered why my nails would be stained after wearing a dark color nail polish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok base coat.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite makes a three-star top coat and a one-star base coat.</li>
            <li> I was a slave to the OPI base and top coats for years.</li>
            <li> I love this base coat.</li>
            <li> Ever since I switched over to Seche base and top coat, I noticed my polish lasts longer.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite base coat.</li>
            <li> I love this base coat.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite has always been my choice as a top coat and will now be my choice for base coat also.</li>
            <li> when i put on polish over the base coat, it goes on so smoothly with no clumps!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M DELIGHTED TO HAVE THIS BRAND OF BASE COAT!</li>
            <li> i really like using seche clear base coat.</li>
            <li> Buy this base coat if you&#x27;re only interested in a one night stand after you paint your nails.</li>
            <li> Threw it out and got China Glaze Strong Adhesion base coat instead.</li>
            <li> It gets two stars because the base coat is three free (less chemicals)</li>
            <li> &amp; this was LESS THAN 24 HOURS of painting my nails !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had the pleasure of having any nail base or polish dry as fast .  </li>
            <li> What a waste!</li>
            <li> I love this base coat!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usually chipping off on day 2.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use base coats, so I don&#x27;t know what a great base coast should feel like, but this one gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Have used different base coats over the past 2 years and this is the only one that keeps my nails from chipping.  </li>
            <li> This base coat is great--the few home manis I&#x27;ve done with it lasted absolutely forever.  </li>
            <li> First time using this base coat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a common occurrence for me</li>
            <li> This came on time it was almost one day late</li>
            <li> However, it does become stringy and thick after being opened and exposed to air.</li>
            <li> This base coat really strengthens my nails.</li>
            <li> I like a lot, I always apply base coat and this works very well.</li>
            <li> Nail polish should slowly drip off the brush, if it doesn&#x27;t it&#x27;s too thick and needs to be thinned out.</li>
            <li> All the other base coats I used previously always caused a few chips within 2-3 days max.  </li>
            <li> No good.</li>
            <li> Enter Seche Clear Base Coat.</li>
            <li> I use the clear base because the other base is a little milky.</li>
            <li> It made my nail polish chip within 24 hours of putting it on and would sometimes make the entire nail&#x27;s polish come off. :(</li>
            <li> Goes on thin and smoothes out nails</li>
            <li> This base coat does not stick to my nails and my nail polish chipped off in big chunks.  </li>
            <li> Then I came across this base coat and my nails are lasting with color for almost a week now, and that&#x27;s without capping my tips.</li>
            <li> This base makes my mani last up to two weeks!</li>
            <li> I apply a thin coat of the base, wait a few minutes</li>
            <li> Worst polish ever, it always peels off entire nail and all polish at once within like 2 days max.</li>
            <li> but I was WRONG.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what constitutes a \\&quot;good\\&quot; base coat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was the formula or the base coat</li>
            <li> I am never sure what a base coat does.</li>
            <li> My polish lasts 2-3 times longer when I use this base coat than with any other base coat I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> I used this base coat with a green nail polish that I have used before with my regular base coat, but this time, when I took it off, my nail beds were stained a horrible sickly greenish-yellow color.  </li>
            <li> This is possibly the worst base coat I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> i used revlon color stay, but it is way to thick and smells awful.</li>
            <li> I ended up using it for glitter polish because the adhesion is so bad that you can literally peel off your manicure.</li>
            <li> I was so frustrated that I bought a UV lamp and started doing gel color to get a longer-lasting manicure.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed to see my nail color was pealing off.</li>
            <li> I was so angry &amp; now I&#x27;ve waisted $5.50 on a base I will never use again !</li>
            <li> disappointed in the quality of the base coat.</li>
            <li> This is an affordable base coat.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and cannot do nails without this base coat.</li>
            <li> I like this product as a base coat.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any issues with this base coat.</li>
            <li> I hate bubbles.</li>
            <li> even base coats don&#x27;t prevent the yellowing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not found any base coat that protects against that problem.  </li>
            <li> Today is day 5 with this base coat and not one nail has chipped.  </li>
            <li> I would skip this base coat and just buy Sally Hansen.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve noticed the nail polish tends to rub off on the tip of my nails even when I run the base coat on the edge of my nail.</li>
            <li> Revlon color stay base coat</li>
            <li> Then I got to know the culprit which is the sache v base coat.</li>
            <li> but I do recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a cheaper alternative to OPI&#x27;s base coat.</li>
            <li> I will never buy another brand of base coat/top coat again.  </li>
            <li> I paint my nails a couple times a week and always use this base coat.</li>
            <li> They say you can use the rebuild as your base coat</li>
            <li> so I figured I&#x27;d try the base coat</li>
            <li> but this base coat was awful on me.</li>
            <li> While I didn&#x27;t have an issue with bonding as others have mentioned, this base coat DOES NOT PROTECT YOUR NAILS AGAINST COLOR STAINING!!  </li>
            <li> Pathetic product sold by pathetic seller.</li>

            <li> Buy this base coat if you&#x27;re only interested in a one night stand after you paint your nails. It chips within a day and peels off my nails like a sticker! Just stick to the top coat!</li>
            <li> Base coat with Top Nail make my manicure last longer. The Base coat is perfect for my nails. Thank you.</li>
            <li> My last bottle got stuck closed and the glass actually BROKE when I tried to open it (CUZ I&#x27;M SHE-RA) so I had to get more.  Hope that was a fluke!</li>
            <li> Perhaps it is the price you have to pay for non-yellowing? But the finish seems to remain a bit soft.</li>
            <li> Great!  The price was good too!</li>
            <li> Quick to dry, but strong smelling. Goes on thin and smoothes out nails well. Two coats works best if you&#x27;re using a thin nail color over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended,</li>
            <li> Absolute the best top coat for nails, EVER,!  It protects My manicure from chips, nips, scratches and peeling.  You can use 2 coats of it over 2coats of nail color.  Manicure will last 7-10 days!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  This base coat is amazing, but it does smell to high heaven.  But...in the long run...it&#x27;s worth putting up in order to get such great result</li>
            <li> Keeps my nails White!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent  top coat and really does help your manicure last longer, maintaining freshly applied look for longer than most top coats.  It sells for a very reasonable price and is just as good as brands like Butter of London or Julep.</li>
            <li> This is a great top coat  same one they use at the nail salon I go to). It really causes the nail polish to adhere to the nails!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely a MUST have for every nail polish addict:)100% love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok base coat. It chips of so for me it&#x27;s not that great. Maybe someone else would like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at the reviews for this product, because I&#x27;ve had the opposite experience. I used this basecoat along with Essie polish, and the Seche Topcoat, and my nails have been chip free for an entire week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit I did apply an additional topcoat midweek, but I am ecstatic about the results and the fact that I haven&#x27;t had to touch up my nails for an entire 7 days. I also try to keep my nails shorter to minimize the abrasion on the tips of my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect that the key is to apply your polish soon after you apply the basecoat, and of course, apply your Seche topcoat while the color is still wet. I didn&#x27;t have great results with the basecoat or topcoat until I did these things (and read the directions!), so if you haven&#x27;t had luck, try again. With all basecoats, I&#x27;ve had the best results when doing this, instead of allowing the basecoat to fully dry on my nails before applying polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to test the reliability of this basecoat, I&#x27;m going to attempt this again with a different polish brand, but for the time being, Seche loves Essie, and I love this basecoat!</li>
            <li> Best top coat! Just make sure you use it while your nail polish is still wet so that you don&#x27;t get any shrinkage.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use base coats, so I don&#x27;t know what a great base coast should feel like, but this one gets the job done. It&#x27;s been protecting my nails from yellowing, and I think it&#x27;s prolonging the freshness of my nails by 1 day. I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> Hands down the very best in professional and DYI nail care.  Does not yellow nails, nor does it cause nails to become brittle.  Have been using this product for MANY years and will continue to.</li>
            <li> this is the best when used with the to coat.  It dries so fast together.  I will use no other.</li>
            <li> Comes right off! What a waste!</li>
            <li> Seche vite is my favorite top coat but this base coat was awful on me. It made my nail polish chip within 24 hours of putting it on and would sometimes make the entire nail&#x27;s polish come off. :(</li>
            <li> Great service and happy with product.</li>
            <li> BEST TOPCOAT. HAS SUPER SHINE AND GLOSS WITH GREAT QUALITY. I ALWAYS GET ASKED IF I AM WEARING GEL NAILS WITH THIS TOPCOAT. However, it does become stringy and thick after being opened and exposed to air. While using this product the seche vite restore is a must own.</li>
            <li> Great Svc. Great everything!  Perfect</li>
            <li> Does not adhere to nail. Manicure almost immediately peeled off.</li>
            <li> This base coat does not stick to my nails and my nail polish chipped off in big chunks.  Will not use again.</li>
            <li> This is an affordable base coat. It works pretty well too. I have issues with my nails peeling and this helps. It only lasts for about 2 days but that&#x27;s good for me. You might have a better experience of you have different nails than me.</li>
            <li> I agree 100% with all the other positive user reviews.  However, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, the best part about this base coat is that it keeps my nails from yellowing when I consistently keep my nails painted.  It really does protect my nails underneath the base coat, and when you pair it with the Seche Vite top coat, you&#x27;ve got BETTER than a salon manicure.  (The only thing better is maybe a gel manicure.)  Highly recommend both the Seche Vite top and base coats!</li>
            <li> I have used this brand of base coat (also the top coat) for many years. It really helps to extend the life of your manicure, and the top coat helps the polish to dry quickly and to be very shiny!</li>
            <li> Seche Vite makes a three-star top coat and a one-star base coat. It&#x27;s cheap and turns all white and crusty around the edges of my polish. It ruined many polish jobs before I realized what was happening. Threw it out and got China Glaze Strong Adhesion base coat instead. It&#x27;s a MUCH better product. So if you like cheapo nail products, Seche Vite is fine. But you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what constitutes a \\&quot;good\\&quot; base coat. It does the job I guess. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s anything special though. I order with the topcoat...which is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I love Seche Vite as a top coat, so I figured that the base coat would be a high quality product as well.  After only one use, I realize how wrong that assumption was, and I am throwing away my bottle of Seche Clear.  While I didn&#x27;t have an issue with bonding as others have mentioned, this base coat DOES NOT PROTECT YOUR NAILS AGAINST COLOR STAINING!!  I used this base coat with a green nail polish that I have used before with my regular base coat, but this time, when I took it off, my nail beds were stained a horrible sickly greenish-yellow color.  That was weeks ago and they are still stained!  I&#x27;m sure this wouldn&#x27;t be an issue with light colors or skin-toned shades, but I like to wear bold, bright polishes, and I don&#x27;t want to risk this happening again...So like I said, I&#x27;m throwing my bottle of Seche Clear away.  Seche Vite is an amazing product, but unfortunately, Seche Clear is not.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to purchase this at first but I was sold on the reviews. Do it! I was a slave to the OPI base and top coats for years. I love this base coat. It dries quickly so I can start painting my nails faster. I also purchased the top coat. Ever since I switched over to Seche base and top coat, I noticed my polish lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I have used many different base coats in my life and I have never had longevity in my manicures. 2 days and I get a huge chip, or two, or three. Then I came across this base coat and my nails are lasting with color for almost a week now, and that&#x27;s without capping my tips. I have also noticed something else. This base coat really strengthens my nails. When I put it on and then my nail color, 2-3 thin coats, and then Seche Vite, my nails are very very tough and that&#x27;s a nice added benefit as my nails tend to be a bit brittle. I highly recommend this top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: I used a nail color, Julep \\&quot;Karmen\\&quot;, and when I removed the nail polish my nails were a bit red stained. I&#x27;m not sure if it was the formula or the base coat but if using this color or any other highly color saturated nail polish color I would say make sure you double up on the base coat.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite base coat. My nails have no become stained from using it and it just works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Issue(s): Strong smell and you have to purchase the restore.</li>
            <li> Normally, my nail polish on my hands last for about 5 days.. with this, I&#x27;ve achieved 10 days with no chipping and 14 days with just one chipped nail. Amazing? YESS!</li>
            <li> Dries as soon as I put it on! Made my nail polish last! Bought for gift too. Will buy again</li>
            <li> Best base coat to use. I have used this for years and cannot do nails without this base coat. The top coat&lt;br /&gt;In this brand is also my favorite.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product. I wanted to protect my nails from damage and I&#x27;m sure it would have. BUT, after painting over it and then using the top coat (Which is actually fabulous) even though the polish was completely dry, you could push the nail polish right off because of how the bottom coat is. If you&#x27;re going to use the bottom coat you have to be really patient. Paint the bottom coat on the day before. Because even waiting one hour has not been sufficient for me. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a good product. BUT again, I&#x27;m not a patient person.</li>
            <li> I like this product as a base coat.  I got great results even using it by itself, it gives a natural shine to my nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had the pleasure of having any nail base or polish dry as fast .  Best I&#x27;ve ever used. .  Nails were ready for polish by the time I finished with my 10th nail  Came well packaged and shipped promptly</li>
            <li> I layer my nails with this 5-6 times when I want the &amp;#34;solon&amp;#34; finish. The more layer the ticker it gets. It dries clean and smooth. Can&#x27;t do my nails without these now. BEST clear coat. Better than the one my solon lady uses!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any issues with this base coat. I don&#x27;t really compare base coats so it is hard for me to know if there are actually better ones out there, but this is a good brand name. Plus, I believe it says it resists yellowing the nails, which is why I purchased it. I think it helped out with the lack of yellowing.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It is the best top coat. Have been using it for years and this was a great price.  Very happy!</li>
            <li> Seche is THE best base and top coat brand I’ve ever used. Ever. I manicure my nails at home and use the Seche Clear base coat and Seche Vite top coat with a variety of nail polish brands like Essie, OPI, Orly and even Sally Hansen - all with fabulous, long-lasting results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to dedicate about 3 hours every 3 days to maintain my OPI Nail Envy base and top coat manicure, and more time with other brands. I was so frustrated that I bought a UV lamp and started doing gel color to get a longer-lasting manicure. The process destroyed my nails after a few weeks and it was super expensive. Now, I only spend about an hour once a week (give or take a few days) and they always look great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Seche Clear base coat is made to work with the Seche Vite top coat, creating a bond with color between - and together, they work wonders. I apply a thin coat of the base, wait a few minutes so it is still a bit tacky, then put on 1-2 coats of color. After the color has set, but not dried completely, I apply the Seche Vite top coat. (If you have a UV light, the Seche UV top coat is also very good and can be removed normally without damage to your nails.) The top coat firms up almost immediately so I don’t have to worry about messing it up with light activity, and after 20-30 minutes, I continue with my normal activities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve tried the top coat without the base coat and though it still looks great, I’m convinced the base+top coat combo is the key. My manicures last around 7-10 days, and even come out unscathed after scrubbing a bathroom or digging in the dirt. I’ve never had a problem with the product peeling off of my nail like others have mentioned. And, if the color starts to look dull, I apply another top coat to shine it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve also included a photo of my nails after day 8. You can see a little flaking on the side of my middle and index fingers, and the color (Essie Mojito Madness) is a little dull, but it still looks pretty good!</li>
            <li> this is the best one for my nails, make my nails much more strong and good for my nails too.&lt;br /&gt;I like to put on every other day on my clean nails, feel my nails so clean and even look good.</li>
            <li> Love this brand. I used to be a nail tech and was introduced to the brand about 5 years ago and never went back to anything else. I clean houses now and my polish stays on my nails and toes for over a week. As for my pedicures they can last up to a month in the winter. I give this brand as a top coat 10 stars if I had the option  : )</li>
            <li> The best top coat ever! I get tons of people who ask me if I use gel when I use this also super shiny!</li>
            <li> I love this base coat. It lasts for a whole 2 weeks. It covers so smooth and no bubbles. I hate bubbles. Try is you will love it. Louise</li>
            <li> Just sayin this s*** holds my nail designs like nobody&#x27;s business and that is basically all that I&#x27;m about to say :P</li>
            <li> Every polish I&#x27;ve used turns my nails yellow...  even base coats don&#x27;t prevent the yellowing.  I&#x27;ve not found any base coat that protects against that problem.  I searched on line for this product because I&#x27;d read about it but I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores.  It&#x27;s fabulous!  No yellow nails.  I won&#x27;t paint my nails without applying it first now.</li>
            <li> Tjis top coat is both amazing and terrible. It is so shiny and dries SOOOOO FAST. I can have wet nails one minute and paint over them with this and havw them be dry to the touch in under a minute, about 5 for completely dry. While this top coat does what it days, every time I wear it date only a day or two my entire polish coat peels off like a shell and im left with bare nail. Ive tried many variations on application with no difference. It binds all of your layers together and I huess that&#x27;s why it peels off. Ive read if you apply it to everywhere but rhe edges it will stay so I will try tjat. If you knoe any secrets to keep it from peeling snd want amazing shine and fast dry time, this is for you! It looks great over china glaze flip flop fantasy too!:)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It actually stays on my fingers where other clears come off easily and chip. It has a good shine if you just want to wear this coat.</li>
            <li> This is a great base coat. It goes on smooth and definitely makes your polish last longer. Also it&#x27;s great at preventing your nails from getting stained from the nail polish.</li>
            <li> I change my polish once per week and I&#x27;ve tried many different brands but this one is by far the absolute best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used. Better than the OPI top coat I used previously. I love that it&#x27;s super shiny, dries whatever nail polish it goes over very quickly and stays shiny for days after.</li>
            <li> Great product and price from Cosmetics Central! I would definitely repurchase from them!  Seche Vite has always been my choice as a top coat and will now be my choice for base coat also.</li>
            <li> Have used different base coats over the past 2 years and this is the only one that keeps my nails from chipping.  All the other base coats I used previously always caused a few chips within 2-3 days max.  Today is day 5 with this base coat and not one nail has chipped.  Am very pleased, especially after using more expensive &amp;#34;top of the line&amp;#34; base coats.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I would skip this base coat and just buy Sally Hansen. I liked Seche Vite, the top coat, but the polishjust chips or peels immediately when you apply this base coat.</li>
            <li> Works fine and there is not a strong odor, would recommend</li>
            <li> This is by far the best base coat I&#x27;ve every used on my natural nails.  Added bonus is that it&#x27;s formaldehyde and toluene free!</li>
            <li> My top got stuck so it&#x27;s impossible to open now. Only used 2 or 3 times.</li>
            <li> A fantastic product that I&#x27;ll be using forever.</li>
            <li> I bought this to start doing my own manicures.  My nails look great.  I also bought the top coat.  My nails are SUPER SHINY, dry quickly and last about two weeks.  If you put on a top coat every 3 days, your nail color lasts about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> works well enough. no yellow nails so far.</li>
            <li> It holds my nail polish quite well, no chipping or flaking off for a long time but I&#x27;ve noticed the nail polish tends to rub off on the tip of my nails even when I run the base coat on the edge of my nail. It&#x27;s a common occurrence for me so I&#x27;ll keep searching but for now, it&#x27;s going just fine.</li>
            <li> My polish lasts 2-3 times longer when I use this base coat than with any other base coat I&#x27;ve ever used.  It dries quickly and is easy to apply. I top with Seche Vite and my nails look beautiful and professionally done every time.  The only downside is that it has a strong scent.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily, dries quickly, and can even be worn by itself. It also has a great shine to it.</li>
            <li> This is a great base coat. It applies well and dries quickly. My only problem is how strong the smell is, but the smell doesn&#x27;t change how the quality or texture of it. Overall, great base coat!</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff. Makes giving yourself your own mani and pedi so easy and so much quicker</li>
            <li> Works, i suppose. I am never sure what a base coat does.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT. LASTS LONG</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nail technician its all I use</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t buy this or probably even use it again.  Revlon color stay base coat worked way better for me.  i love their top coat.  disappointed in the quality of the base coat.</li>
            <li> I had great hopes from this base coat as their top coat is fabulous. I bought it from herbal beauty supply from amazon. I used it as soon as I received it and paint my nails with an opi nail color with a sache v top coat. I was so disappointed to see my nail color was pealing off. I thought that there is a problem with the nail color so I tried a different one and same thing happened. Then I tried those same colors with my Revlon base coat which works like magic. Then I got to know the culprit which is the sache v base coat. I requested the refund and got an answer from the seller that they accept returns only if the product is still in packed condition with no return shipping cost. I don&#x27;t know if the product was expired, but I had a bad experienced. Pathetic product sold by pathetic seller.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best base coat I have ever used. As with the top coat, the brush is too short and it is easy to waste much of the product because it cannot be reached.</li>
            <li> First time using this base coat. Have no complaints so far. Love the top coat the best.</li>
            <li> This is a great base coat nail polish. It prevents the regular color from damaging your nails or the color leaching through and staining your nails. It also prevents a lot of the dryness that you would otherwise have.</li>
            <li> Seche Clear is the best base coat I have ever used.  It is fast drying and&lt;br /&gt;when combined with the Seche Vite Top Coat is very shiny and long lasting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really nice base coat, definitely cheaper than OPI. For me, it worked to keep my nails from yellowing (I wear nailpolish on my nails all the time, the longest I&#x27;ve ever gone without wearing nail polish on my nails is 1 day). Everyone&#x27;s nails are different but I do recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a cheaper alternative to OPI&#x27;s base coat.</li>
            <li> Best base coat I&#x27;ve ever purchased, bar none...don&#x27;t waste your money on others!</li>
            <li> Best professional base coat I have ever used.  It does not bubble and applies easily.  I use it every time (even for a quick clear coat when I don&#x27;t have time to paint my nails).</li>
            <li> I like a lot, I always apply base coat and this works very well.</li>
            <li> This base makes my mani last up to two weeks!</li>
            <li> After a few uses, the black top became glued to the glass. As I was trying to unscrew it, the entire glass neck broke off. Don&#x27;t screw the top on too tightly, or this will probably happen to your bottle.</li>
            <li> The product is really good quality. It was exactly the way I expected it to be. I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This came on time it was almost one day late but im glad it came. it helped keep my polish on for days and it still hasnt came off ! :)</li>
            <li> This formula is great, and extends the life of any nail polish. Normally my nails chip in 2-3 days, but this extended their life to 5-6 days without chipping. This is a little pricey compared to most top coats, but I think very worth it, as it extends the life of any nail polish that you choose!</li>
            <li> I love this base coat! Goes on smoothly and last pretty good. I will be using this from now.</li>
            <li> I first got this out of curiosity but I have to say it lives up to it&#x27;s products, my nails dry up faster and it also last longer.  Totally recommending this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Excellent base coat. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It does what i set out for it to do, a good dependable product. I would order it again, cheaper then at the store</li>
            <li> I will never buy another brand of base coat/top coat again.  It leaves my nails so shiny!  I can paint my nails before bed and wake up with no sheet marks!  Love.</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing! it really does make my manicure last long and it looks so shiny! I no longer go to a nail salon on a regular basis so I&#x27;m able to save a lot of money.</li>
            <li> It made my nails yellow. Throw it away.</li>
            <li> This has to be the best base coat ever.  I also love the top coat and have recommended Seche to others in the past as well.</li>
            <li> This is honestly one of my favourite brands for base coat and top coat. It works well and it dries fast. This is my to go to brand everytime I need a new base and top coat!</li>
            <li> This product shrinks away from the free edge upon drying.  The Seche Vite top coat is awesome, so I tried this base coat, and no...I don&#x27;t recommend this.  My experience has been this:  even if you prime your nail with pure acetone, and cap the free edge during the application, it shrinks slightly and pulls away from the free edge as it dries.  I&#x27;ve found better results using Gelous Advanced Nail Gel Coat, with the green cap, as my base coat.</li>
            <li> Worst polish ever, it always peels off entire nail and all polish at once within like 2 days max. Would not recommend to anyone. Better off going to the dollar store and getting clear coat!</li>
            <li> I Love this top coat.  It drys very quickly, lasts and lasts...</li>
            <li> So I thought this base coat would be as amazing as the seche vite top coat but I was WRONG. This product is terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I did a beautiful floral design on my nails &amp; I was so excited to show everyone the next day, but about 3 hours into my day, the whole polish had come off of 2 of my nails &amp; by the end of the day it was as if I had never painted my nails at all. &amp; this was LESS THAN 24 HOURS of painting my nails ! It caused my manicure to come off in either huge chunks or all the polish would just pop off of my nails. I was so angry &amp; now I&#x27;ve waisted $5.50 on a base I will never use again !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the bright side it did protect my natural nail like it was supposed to &amp; the shipping is super quick &amp; I had no problems with it but other than that its horrible. I would not recommend this to anyone. I really wish I had read reviews on it before I purchased it. DO NOT BUY !</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite base coat. It goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t bubble like my Dior did, and dries almost instantaneously. It keeps my nails from turning yellow and helps the polish stay on longer.</li>
            <li> This clear coat does the job, but just seems to be average like most other top coats. I wasn&#x27;t super impressed, but wasn&#x27;t disappointed either!</li>
            <li> I have been using both the seche vite top coat and base coat with nice nailpolishes like OPI and Butter London. I have never had a base or top coat that chips/flakes away more easily or in bigger chunks. It&#x27;s like you could just scrape your nail polish off with your nails! I&#x27;ve even tried using PH balance dehydrator on my nails to help it stick. No good. It gets two stars because the base coat is three free (less chemicals)</li>
            <li> Great Service and product.</li>
            <li> I was happy that my package arrived on time and even more excited to try out the product! I have not used it yet but I am hoping that it will be of good quality</li>
            <li> A friend introduced me to this wonderful product and now I will continue to use it. Before my nail polish looked lifeless but with this top coat it&#x27;s shiny and looks fresh for a long time. Not to mention it dries before I Ness it up!</li>
            <li> This is possibly the worst base coat I have ever tried. It had more good reviews than bad so I figured it was worth a try. It wasn&#x27;t. This base coat does not adhere to the nail so nail polish starts peeling pretty fast. I used it several times and not once could I get my manicure to last more than two days. I always got chips on day one. I ended up using it for glitter polish because the adhesion is so bad that you can literally peel off your manicure. The downside is that even with glitter you&#x27;ll get chipping really fast, so use it only if you can change your polish every other day. I would simply say don&#x27;t buy this one. Honestly.</li>
            <li> i really like using seche clear base coat. it works well with adhering my nail polish to my nail so that my nail polish lasts longer.</li>
            <li> This is the best base coat.  I swear by it.  It helps hold your color to your nail and creates a nice smooth base for polishing.</li>
            <li> this base coat is so great! it is the BEST base coat i ever used! it literaly dries in 30 seconds! the BEST! when i put on polish over the base coat, it goes on so smoothly with no clumps! for this price, it is the best. i used revlon color stay, but it is way to thick and smells awful. i wear a mask to put on revlon. this doesn&#x27;t smell at all! so great! and it comes fast! so happy!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This base coat is great--the few home manis I&#x27;ve done with it lasted absolutely forever.  I use it with the Seche Vite top coat, and I&#x27;ve never had nail polish last this long ever.  It&#x27;s usually chipping off on day 2. I will definitely buy again once the bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> fast drying base coat prepares your nails for that perfect coat of color and adheres nicely to keep the chipping to a minimum</li>
            <li> I always wondered why my nails would be stained after wearing a dark color nail polish. Enter Seche Clear Base Coat. I decided to try this on a whim and now I won&#x27;t be without it again! I paint my nails a couple times a week and always use this base coat. My nail polish comes off clean and doesn&#x27;t stain. I also use the Seche Top Coat. Both are great products that Amazon offers at an affordable price!</li>
            <li> Great base. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love it, especially at this price. Dries to a semi-matte and so quickly! Really seems to help my polish stick longer, at least compared to the Beauty Secrets I was using before.</li>
            <li> In looking for a good nail polish, I don&#x27;t want alcohol in it. I didnot see the content of alcohol in the ingredients of this nail polish in the internet descriptions but it is the first ingredient on the polish bottle! It brittles and breaks my nails.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite has the best base and top coats out there. I always do my own nails and have tried lots of different brands and this one is the best. I use the rebuild because it keeps my peeling nails strong plus their base coat and top coat. If I&#x27;m doing a french tip I use the clear base because the other base is a little milky. They say you can use the rebuild as your base coat but I like to use both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also swipe my nails with rubbing alcohol after filing then washing them but before painting to get rid of any oil, then I finish with the Seche Vite top coat and my polish stays on for a week or two depending on how hard I am on my nails that week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t tried the fast drying top coat, GET IT! You will not regret it! It dries super fast to keep from getting wrinkle marks and nicks in your polish. It&#x27;s the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have a bottle of restore which is a polish thinner to keep your nail polish in the best shape because thick nail polish will peel right off. Nail polish should slowly drip off the brush, if it doesn&#x27;t it&#x27;s too thick and needs to be thinned out. I got the bigger bottle over a year ago and I still have about half left and I use it a lot. If you paint your own nails getting a polish thinner will really make a difference with the longevity and wear of your nail polish.</li>
            <li> I love the topcoat so I figured I&#x27;d try the base coat and I like it just as much.  I will use no other now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M DELIGHTED TO HAVE THIS BRAND OF BASE COAT! POLISH GOES ON SO SMOOTHL AND I MADE SEVERAL MORE PURCHASES FOR MYSELF AND ALSO SENT TO A FRIEND!  HAPPY TO HAVE FOUND SECHE!</li>
