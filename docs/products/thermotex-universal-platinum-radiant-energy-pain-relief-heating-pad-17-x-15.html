            <li>there is nothing good to say about this product..</li>
            <li>This is an amazing heat pad.  </li>
            <li>It may be more valuable to be in the winter, to be fair</li>
            <li>No, you can&#x27;t borrow mine; please get your own.</li>
            <li>This is a great heating pad, but I can&#x27;t say that the \\&quot;infra-red\\&quot; has does anything great in terms of relieving my back pain.  </li>
            <li>Found out about this product many years ago.</li>
            <li>After using this product twice my pains are getting better.  </li>
            <li>There is no way to be sure your order has gone through.</li>
            <li>This will be the 3rd one I have ordered from you, they make excellent gifts.</li>
            <li>(The shoulder heating pad might have been better for me).  </li>
            <li>I guess they figured they got better</li>
            <li>Anyway, you&#x27;ll probably get sticker shock like everyone else who values a couple hundred bucks more than their health and well being.</li>
            <li>, I thought it would work much better for the price</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this product, I have recommended it to most of my friends.</li>
            <li>This product will give you the best possible relief from your pain</li>
            <li>even more upest because of that. .</li>
            <li>This is the most important technology in my life.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and sturdy and I like it, but it&#x27;s more like a very well made heating pad.  </li>
            <li>The old one has seen many years of good service.</li>
            <li>This pad heats up just fine</li>
            <li>Helped my husband&#x27;s swollen knee feel better quickly.</li>
            <li>The heating pad fits comfortable when I straps it to each knees (</li>
            <li>I love it worth ever penny</li>
            <li>I enjoy the warmth and relief from using this product.</li>
            <li>Others need to know that this product - based on my experience - is one of the most powerful healing tools that has ever been invented.</li>
            <li>feels great on my back</li>
            <li>If you have insurance and can get a physician to write you a prescription for an Infrared Heating Pad for treatment of whatever ails you, then you can submit it for reimbursement as a Durable Medical Good under many policies.</li>
            <li>I find this item very useful for pain relief for my arthritis.  </li>
            <li>but  for me was worth it!</li>
            <li>It is remarkable for my back and neck.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t just warm the outer layers of tissue, like most heating pads, but gets to the deeper layers, where the pain actually originates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gives good heat when needed or a low heat for deeper penetration over a longer period of time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve suffered severe joint pain for many years - thanks to Ehlers Danlos Syndrome - and</li>
            <li>In 1994, I purchased one of these Thermotex Pads, and it saved me much pain and many dollars of treatment.  </li>
            <li>Good deep heat level.  </li>
            <li>These people were also completely amazed that they healed so quickly; however, once they healed up, they decided not to fork out the $200+ to get their own.</li>
            <li>This pad does heat up quickly.  </li>
            <li>Although this finally quit on me, I probably have used it 3 - 5 times more often and for longer periods of time than most folks, and don&#x27;t consider this a defect.</li>
            <li>I feel it was marketed for us that have tryed everything, and we get nothing more than a high priced heating pad.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product, it has relieved my lower back pain.</li>
            <li>this is a nice deep heat pad.  </li>
            <li>The heat helps her back feel more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I get the same relief with my inexpensive heating pad which is much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Though this item costs a lot, it is well worth the price...</li>
            <li>this isn&#x27;t cheap, but it is actually an FDA approved device which means that it is safe and has some therapeutic value.</li>
            <li>Certainly worth it to check with your physician and insurance company, but the relief that this gives is worth it even if they won&#x27;t pay.  </li>
            <li>And while this pad covers a large surface area, you may have to look into their specific area heating pads to better fit the part of the body wanting to heat.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give five stars only because the expense is considerable, but the results are much more satisfying than drug therapy.</li>
            <li>, didn&#x27;t want to pay that much, realized I would lend it again in the future, and decided not to make their own investment to get one.</li>
            <li>This product WORKS!!!The platinum edition is best, but it still does not fit into \\&quot;grooves\\&quot;, like groin area, unless you are lying flat...</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s is a huge difference between this and the old fashioned heating pad.</li>
            <li>I am glad I decided to purchase the universal one instead of one for just the knee.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t know if this pad does more to help it than a regular heating pad.  </li>
            <li>My gauss meter shows there is no harmful EMF (electromagnetic field) generated as with regular heating pads, plus the heat goes deeper for better pain relief without over-stimulation of the skin surface.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, and I had plantar fasciitis for many years prior to getting this heating pad.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a cure all but definitely better than regular heating pads.</li>
            <li>Works so much better than a regular heating pad.  </li>
            <li>This pad has done nothing for any of those conditions, even though I have followed the directions exactly and used it every day since receiving it.</li>
            <li>and I am more active outside and in a warm pool</li>
            <li>The cover is a cheap, velveteen material that I&#x27;m certain is synthetic and, as such, full of chemicals.  </li>
            <li>this is a very good product compared to other normal commercial am options</li>
            <li>It is amazing how much quicker my \\&quot;old age\\&quot; injuries heal with the increased circulation that deep heat provides.      </li>
            <li>But, the body&#x27;s natural healing agents are in the blood, and getting those healing agents to the injured areas quickly ACCELERATES the process - dramatically, in my experience.</li>
            <li>The Velcro cover is extremely heavy duty and still looks almost as good as when it was new.</li>
            <li>High gets too hot, I think.</li>
            <li>Hard to put around a shoulder but feels good.</li>
            <li>No way I&#x27;d spend this much money on this flimsy thing.</li>
            <li>My Husband really likes this Pad.</li>
            <li>but nothing ready resolved the problem.  </li>
            <li>This is a product with which I have had much experience.  </li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>It takes some time, about an hour a day for me, but it really seems to help the achey breakies.  </li>
            <li>and this gives me almost as much relief as prescription pain killers without any of the side effects.</li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>Very helpful in alleviating my arthritic pain.</li>
            <li>really does seem to penetrate deeper into the muscles and joints, and give more relief, than a conventional heating pad.</li>
            <li>This is our second Thermotex, we used the other one for several years and were very pleased with the results:  this isn&#x27;t your mother&#x27;s heating pad; this one emits light rays.  </li>
            <li>I bought this pad just recently, after an old one of the same kind wore out.</li>
            <li>I tried many different pain remedies, pain pills, standard heating pad, stretching exercises</li>
            <li>For the high price I would think twice about the purchase.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>While the price is high you must keep</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this pad.</li>
            <li>The connection on the new pad has better reinforcing, so perhaps will last longer than my former one.  </li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s right for you, then make one purchase that will work for years, instead of buying cheap junk that, yes, may actually work, but not for long.</li>
            <li>It actually paid for itself the first week!  </li>
            <li>The unit quit in normal use after a couple months.</li>
            <li>It better last a very long time.</li>
            <li>but I highly doubt it&#x27;s far infrared.  </li>
            <li>This is my second pad after wearing out the first one.  </li>
            <li>I am 65 and an avid golfer that from time to time suffered with a sore lower back.</li>
            <li>I have used the product before and was just as satisfied this time as in the past.</li>
            <li>I paid over 220 bucks for this heating pad and I camt believe that it works the  same as a 10 dollar heating pad...doesn&#x27;t even get that hot..</li>
            <li>but clearly it does not work for my neck.</li>
            <li>The soft side is to prevent the leaking of the infrared.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for several months now and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>The far infrared technology and the price though Amazon helped in my purchase.  </li>
            <li>I do have the old type and it seems to work just as well.</li>
            <li>The heat goes so much deeper than any regular heating pad.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference between this and a regular heating pad.  </li>
            <li>It gets deep into what hurts and really makes a difference.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the thermotex infrared heating pad because my wife was  having an autogolous adult stem cell injection (ASCI) treatment on her arthritic knees.</li>
            <li>I use it as much as possible, and it is very durable.  </li>
            <li>well worth every penny spent.</li>
            <li>Ordered the smaller Thermotex pad first and found out it was one solid pad that you couldn&#x27;t bend.  </li>
            <li>one knee for 1/2 intervals on high then low).  </li>
            <li>After probably 30 hours of research, I coughed up the price for this unit because it is versatile and seems to be a high quality item, based on reviews and my personal experience to date.</li>
            <li>The thermal heat really gets in deep into the muscles and provides relief a lot faster than a regular heating pad.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a firm feel so laying in it is ok but not soft like regular heating pad</li>
            <li>I firmly believe in the Far Red Infrared penetration technology being more beneficial than an ordinary heating pad, and that it is not just some gimmick to sell a high priced heating pad.  </li>
            <li>There is synthetic foam on one side of the heat panels, which I assumed was the soft side that goes next to your body, but you can&#x27;t feel any heat that way.  </li>
            <li>I went to an orthopedic surgeon to see if I had an underlying spine problem or perhaps a pinched nerve that might be the root of my pain, no physical problems uncovered, just old age creeping in.</li>
            <li>it penetrates far deeper then the standard heating pad.</li>
            <li>Because of the design, it is not soft and flexible like your normal Drug Store heating pad.  </li>
            <li>Less useful for the back as the instructions say do not lie on it.</li>
            <li>I do like it so far though and am hoping it will ultimately help with lower back issues.</li>
            <li>This heating pad is very pricey &amp; clearly not worth it.</li>
            <li>I have purchased the Platinum model and on the chilly days or when I feel tightness in my bac, I first warm up the back before playing a round of golf.</li>

            <li> I bought this pad just recently, after an old one of the same kind wore out.</li>
            <li> I tried many different pain remedies, pain pills, standard heating pad, stretching exercises</li>
            <li> For the high price I would think twice about the purchase.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> While the price is high you must keep</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this pad.</li>
            <li> The connection on the new pad has better reinforcing, so perhaps will last longer than my former one.  </li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s right for you, then make one purchase that will work for years, instead of buying cheap junk that, yes, may actually work, but not for long.</li>
            <li> It actually paid for itself the first week!  </li>
            <li> The unit quit in normal use after a couple months.</li>
            <li> It better last a very long time.</li>
            <li> but I highly doubt it&#x27;s far infrared.  </li>
            <li> This is my second pad after wearing out the first one.  </li>
            <li> I am 65 and an avid golfer that from time to time suffered with a sore lower back.</li>
            <li> I have used the product before and was just as satisfied this time as in the past.</li>
            <li> I paid over 220 bucks for this heating pad and I camt believe that it works the  same as a 10 dollar heating pad...doesn&#x27;t even get that hot..</li>
            <li> but clearly it does not work for my neck.</li>
            <li> The soft side is to prevent the leaking of the infrared.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for several months now and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> The far infrared technology and the price though Amazon helped in my purchase.  </li>
            <li> I do have the old type and it seems to work just as well.</li>
            <li> The heat goes so much deeper than any regular heating pad.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference between this and a regular heating pad.  </li>
            <li> It gets deep into what hurts and really makes a difference.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the thermotex infrared heating pad because my wife was  having an autogolous adult stem cell injection (ASCI) treatment on her arthritic knees.</li>
            <li> I use it as much as possible, and it is very durable.  </li>
            <li> well worth every penny spent.</li>
            <li> Ordered the smaller Thermotex pad first and found out it was one solid pad that you couldn&#x27;t bend.  </li>
            <li> one knee for 1/2 intervals on high then low).  </li>
            <li> After probably 30 hours of research, I coughed up the price for this unit because it is versatile and seems to be a high quality item, based on reviews and my personal experience to date.</li>
            <li> The thermal heat really gets in deep into the muscles and provides relief a lot faster than a regular heating pad.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a firm feel so laying in it is ok but not soft like regular heating pad</li>
            <li> I firmly believe in the Far Red Infrared penetration technology being more beneficial than an ordinary heating pad, and that it is not just some gimmick to sell a high priced heating pad.  </li>
            <li> There is synthetic foam on one side of the heat panels, which I assumed was the soft side that goes next to your body, but you can&#x27;t feel any heat that way.  </li>
            <li> I went to an orthopedic surgeon to see if I had an underlying spine problem or perhaps a pinched nerve that might be the root of my pain, no physical problems uncovered, just old age creeping in.</li>
            <li> it penetrates far deeper then the standard heating pad.</li>
            <li> Because of the design, it is not soft and flexible like your normal Drug Store heating pad.  </li>
            <li> Less useful for the back as the instructions say do not lie on it.</li>
            <li> I do like it so far though and am hoping it will ultimately help with lower back issues.</li>
            <li> This heating pad is very pricey &amp; clearly not worth it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased the Platinum model and on the chilly days or when I feel tightness in my bac, I first warm up the back before playing a round of golf.</li>
            <li> Similar, cheaper imitations are exactly that; cheaper with poor quality, which reviews generally show have an extremely short lifespan.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these 4 years ago after the first of 4 operations and have used it every day for an average of an hour to an hour and a half</li>
            <li> Tendons and ligaments get relatively little blood flow, otherwise, which is why those injuries take so long to heal under normal conditions.</li>
            <li> I have constant pain in multiple areas and like the relief that this unit provides and because it has three separate compartments it can be folded into a triangle to use on a foot, wrapped around a thigh, knee, or calf using the shorter Velcro strap or using the longer strap as a belt you can hold it tight against your back.</li>
            <li> Very flexible in use, and the heavy duty velour cover makes it comfortable though not enough to lay down flat on it as the LED panels are hard, somewhat thick, and might even break, but almost any other position is possible.  </li>
            <li> This technology does not directly heal your body, of course.</li>
            <li> Has a long cord.</li>
            <li> I spent the extra money for the Platinum edition as I read in the reviews that it would bend.</li>
            <li> Getting the heat deep into my joints and the surrounding tissues helps me heal and restore extremely quickly (a few days) from the minor joint injuries I experience on a daily basis (due to subluxations and dislocations), whereas I used to have to care for injuries and joint pain for weeks (prior to Thermotex).</li>
            <li> im on a limited income and</li>
            <li> I turn the pad on low, lay down on it and just let the heat work through my muscles.</li>
            <li> I feel I could have bought another brand for 1/3 or less of the price, and it work the same.</li>
            <li> I used the infrared heating pad for a half hour one night and the next morning the spasm was gone and has not returned.  </li>
            <li> and it fits flat in my average sized suitcase.  </li>
            <li> I would have to back off golfing for a few weeks at a time to let my pain subside.</li>
            <li> This heating pad is expensive, but well worth the money because the heat does penetrate the muscles.  </li>
            <li> I did not read the description carefully.  </li>
            <li> It has stiff panels inside, about the size of a brick, and you can only bend this pad between those panels.  </li>
            <li> After daily use over a few years, the wiring eventually broke in half where it connects to the pad.  </li>
            <li> The other FIR pads I have have gemstones in them ...</li>
            <li> The other is a Therassage and has jade.  </li>
            <li> What the heck IS this besides an extremely overpriced, electric heating pad?  </li>
            <li> Not true.</li>
            <li> It relaxes my tight muscles and prevents migraines.</li>
            <li> My only comment is it is difficult to put on your knees as it is firm and not soft and pliable.  </li>
            <li> I can use it on my knees, but its a little challenging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thermotex</li>
            <li> If after my round I feel a little soreness, I relax in front of the TV with the Thermotex pad.</li>
            <li> She puts it behind her back while watching TV.  </li>
            <li> that he would let me try it out for a few days to see if would help relieving my pain</li>
            <li> By now it was nicely broken in, what with rotator cuff, impingement, frozen shoulders and back pain.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> And it is not comfortable being comprised of 3 stiff blocks.</li>
            <li> The stiff panels feel like heavy-duty cardboard when you tap them with your knuckles.  </li>
            <li> It has stiff boards in it which don&#x27;t bend.</li>
            <li> Very, very difficult to pay this much for a heating pad.</li>
            <li> After a few months, no more foot pain!  </li>
            <li> The Thermotex sales person told me to put the hard plate side close to my body.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only sorry I didn&#x27;t do the two-day shipping to get it here faster!  </li>
            <li> Therefore, it becomes a little expensive since there are no additional anti-inflammatory properties to it.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s impossible to use it for a neck or any other bendable part.  </li>
            <li> I ended up with a duplicate order and to make matters worse</li>
            <li> However, heating is expensive but made well.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately in my case, it appears I have a shoulder joint problem</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> So it seems like a very expensive heating pad.</li>
            <li> wife has a bad hip, and she says this pad has been a life-saver--</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Found out about this product many years ago. It has been such a blessing and answer to prayer for soothing relief. It relaxes my tight muscles and prevents migraines.</li>
            <li> The ability  to penetrate over 2 inches is best on market providing deeper relief&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a firm feel so laying in it is ok but not soft like regular heating pad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If u have muscle issues this is a very good product compared to other normal commercial am options&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expensive  but  for me was worth it!</li>
            <li> I have back pain and should pain.  After using this product twice my pains are getting better.  I called the company after I asked a question on Amazon regarding which side I should put close to my body.  The Thermotex sales person told me to put the hard plate side close to my body.  The soft side is to prevent the leaking of the infrared.</li>
            <li> Great product. Relieves pain caused by over working the muscles. Brings blood to the area to help the pain. I have been using these for 7 years. I had to buy a second one for my wife.</li>
            <li> Following directions has given me daily relief.</li>
            <li> I had a stem cell procedure on both my knees and my doctor recommended buying this heating pad to relief some of the pain. The heating pad fits comfortable when I straps it to each knees (one knee for 1/2 intervals on high then low).  However, heating is expensive but made well. It better last a very long time.</li>
            <li> This pad heats up just fine but I highly doubt it&#x27;s far infrared.  The cover is a cheap, velveteen material that I&#x27;m certain is synthetic and, as such, full of chemicals.  It is velcroed across one end so it can be opened and there are wires all over the place.  It has stiff panels inside, about the size of a brick, and you can only bend this pad between those panels.  So it&#x27;s impossible to use it for a neck or any other bendable part.  There is synthetic foam on one side of the heat panels, which I assumed was the soft side that goes next to your body, but you can&#x27;t feel any heat that way.  The stiff panels feel like heavy-duty cardboard when you tap them with your knuckles.  The other FIR pads I have have gemstones in them ... one is a biomat and has amethyst and tourmaline.  The other is a Therassage and has jade.  What the heck IS this besides an extremely overpriced, electric heating pad?  No way I&#x27;d spend this much money on this flimsy thing.</li>
            <li> This is a great heating pad, but I can&#x27;t say that the \\&quot;infra-red\\&quot; has does anything great in terms of relieving my back pain.  It&#x27;s nice and sturdy and I like it, but it&#x27;s more like a very well made heating pad.  Therefore, it becomes a little expensive since there are no additional anti-inflammatory properties to it.</li>
            <li> This product WORKS!!!The platinum edition is best, but it still does not fit into \\&quot;grooves\\&quot;, like groin area, unless you are lying flat...but for your back or legs, or neck...you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Thermotex Heating Pad for about 1 month now, I have degenerative disc disease in my lower back and when I have flare ups with pain and muscle tightness I turn the pad on low, lay down on it and just let the heat work through my muscles. I have this by my bed I use it every evening for daily heat therpy. I love it worth ever penny would not be with out it.    N.Smoot</li>
            <li> Every time I use the one click process to order I screw it up!! There is no way to be sure your order has gone through. I ended up with a duplicate order and to make matters worse I had ordered the Thermotex Radiant Energy unit instead of the Thermotex Infrared Therapy unit. An hour or two later when I received confirmation of 2 orders I asked that both orders be canceled. LGMedSupply only canceled 1 order.  Now I have 1 Thermotex Radiant Energy unit to return and have to order the the Infrared unit.  The Thermotex Infrared works great.  This will be the 3rd one I have ordered from you, they make excellent gifts. I am reviewing the Infrared unit, I know nothin of the Radiant unit.</li>
            <li> The Thermo texted not meet my needs</li>
            <li> I have been using it for several months now and it works very well.  I needed on for my knee since I had stem cell injections.  I am glad I decided to purchase the universal one instead of one for just the knee.</li>
            <li> this is a nice deep heat pad.  I have arthritis in my lower back but I don&#x27;t know if this pad does more to help it than a regular heating pad.  For the high price I would think twice about the purchase.  It may be more valuable to be in the winter, to be fair this is summer time and I am more active outside and in a warm pool</li>
            <li> I have been using this heating pad and can tell a difference from others. This does help for me. I enjoy the warmth and relief from using this product.</li>
            <li> My Husband really likes this Pad. He has a lot of Back problem, however the Thermotex Universal Platinum  Heating Pad Is helping his pain.</li>
            <li> I bought this pad to treat a suspected muscle strain in my arm.  It only has two settings, but that is all I needed.  Gives good heat when needed or a low heat for deeper penetration over a longer period of time.  Because of the design, it is not soft and flexible like your normal Drug Store heating pad.  And while this pad covers a large surface area, you may have to look into their specific area heating pads to better fit the part of the body wanting to heat.  (The shoulder heating pad might have been better for me).  Unfortunately in my case, it appears I have a shoulder joint problem and I am currently looking into an ultrasound device to use in conjunction with with the heating pad.  The far infrared technology and the price though Amazon helped in my purchase.  Great follow-up from the MendMeShop.</li>
            <li> This is the most important technology in my life. I&#x27;ve suffered severe joint pain for many years - thanks to Ehlers Danlos Syndrome - and the infrared heating pads are the ONLY things that have ever helped. Getting the heat deep into my joints and the surrounding tissues helps me heal and restore extremely quickly (a few days) from the minor joint injuries I experience on a daily basis (due to subluxations and dislocations), whereas I used to have to care for injuries and joint pain for weeks (prior to Thermotex). This technology does not directly heal your body, of course. But, the body&#x27;s natural healing agents are in the blood, and getting those healing agents to the injured areas quickly ACCELERATES the process - dramatically, in my experience. Tendons and ligaments get relatively little blood flow, otherwise, which is why those injuries take so long to heal under normal conditions. These infrared heating pads have helped me stop back spasms as well. Again, getting the heat DEEPER into the tissue (muscle, in this case) is what makes all the difference. Note I&#x27;m not saying anyone will be &amp;#34;Rise up and walk&amp;#34; healed overnight; but I am saying my healing processes have been MUCH faster when I&#x27;ve been diligent to use this to nurse injuries over the course of a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my one frustration with this product: I have let several people borrow mine to nurse their injuries. These people were also completely amazed that they healed so quickly; however, once they healed up, they decided not to fork out the $200+ to get their own. I guess they figured they got better, didn&#x27;t want to pay that much, realized I would lend it again in the future, and decided not to make their own investment to get one. This frustration is the reason I&#x27;m writing this review. Others need to know that this product - based on my experience - is one of the most powerful healing tools that has ever been invented. Try it! You will not be sorry. Anyway, you&#x27;ll probably get sticker shock like everyone else who values a couple hundred bucks more than their health and well being. So I&#x27;ll say it now: No, you can&#x27;t borrow mine; please get your own.</li>
            <li> great buy! Travels well. Has a long cord. Can wrap limbs and torso with included detatchable Velcro straps.</li>
            <li> This brand, in the platinum version, does provide clinically proven help with healing, and the heat actually penetrates deep into the tissue. After probably 30 hours of research, I coughed up the price for this unit because it is versatile and seems to be a high quality item, based on reviews and my personal experience to date. Similar, cheaper imitations are exactly that; cheaper with poor quality, which reviews generally show have an extremely short lifespan. Very, very difficult to pay this much for a heating pad. But in this instance, you actually get what you pay for. In my case, I am  currently recovering from a T7 spinal compression fracture. (Initial treatment; ice, heat, pain meds, rest, leaving lots of time for research.) If you&#x27;re still stuck in a research mode, then use your time to learn how deep-penetrating heat can help. If it&#x27;s right for you, then make one purchase that will work for years, instead of buying cheap junk that, yes, may actually work, but not for long. Consider this an investment. There&#x27;s is a huge difference between this and the old fashioned heating pad. Hope this helps in making a pricey decision.</li>
            <li> This is my second pad after wearing out the first one.  After daily use over a few years, the wiring eventually broke in half where it connects to the pad.  The connection on the new pad has better reinforcing, so perhaps will last longer than my former one.  My gauss meter shows there is no harmful EMF (electromagnetic field) generated as with regular heating pads, plus the heat goes deeper for better pain relief without over-stimulation of the skin surface.  It does not aggravate inflammation.  I use it all the time for arthritis in my spine, hips, and knees.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mother who is 78.  She has had lower back pain for years.  She puts it behind her back while watching TV.  The heat helps her back feel more comfortable.  Keep it on low.  High gets too hot, I think.</li>
            <li> I do like the way the heating heats, but it&#x27;s not what I thought it would be, I thought it would work much better for the price I paid.&lt;br /&gt; I feel I could have bought another brand for 1/3 or less of the price, and it work the same. I do have the old type and it seems to work just as well. I will not advise anyone that I know to buy one, and if I were asked I would tell them to save thier money.&lt;br /&gt;  I feel it was marketed for us that have tryed everything, and we get nothing more than a high priced heating pad.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t  work for me.  Sent it back.</li>
            <li> I am 65 and an avid golfer that from time to time suffered with a sore lower back. I would have to back off golfing for a few weeks at a time to let my pain subside. I tried many different pain remedies, pain pills, standard heating pad, stretching exercises but nothing ready resolved the problem.  I went to an orthopedic surgeon to see if I had an underlying spine problem or perhaps a pinched nerve that might be the root of my pain, no physical problems uncovered, just old age creeping in. Another golf buddy told me he was using the Thermotex pad and it was a big help and that he would let me try it out for a few days to see if would help relieving my pain and it did. I have purchased the Platinum model and on the chilly days or when I feel tightness in my bac, I first warm up the back before playing a round of golf. If after my round I feel a little soreness, I relax in front of the TV with the Thermotex pad. I am so pleased with this product, I have recommended it to most of my friends. It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is a product with which I have had much experience.  In 1994, I purchased one of these Thermotex Pads, and it saved me much pain and many dollars of treatment.  It actually paid for itself the first week!  By now it was nicely broken in, what with rotator cuff, impingement, frozen shoulders and back pain.  One of our sons had some shoulder problems recently, and when I needed it, I ordered another one.  I&#x27;m only sorry I didn&#x27;t do the two-day shipping to get it here faster!  The heat goes so much deeper than any regular heating pad.  Can&#x27;t say enough about it.</li>
            <li> The unit quit in normal use after a couple months. Also, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything in this thing that justifies the price.  Slap the name \\&quot;infrared\\&quot; on a heating pad and there you go!</li>
            <li> As a tennis player and runner, I get a lot of sprains and strains.  I start with ice when I get off the court, and then use this heating pad for an hour or two at night when I read.  It is amazing how much quicker my \\&quot;old age\\&quot; injuries heal with the increased circulation that deep heat provides.      Additionally, and I had plantar fasciitis for many years prior to getting this heating pad.  Now I put it under my feet when I eat breakfast, and viola&#x27;!  After a few months, no more foot pain!  (I also massage and stretch my feet at night, but that never healed them until I added the infrared heat. I do NOT ice my feet!)</li>
            <li> This heating pad is very pricey &amp; clearly not worth it. I spent the extra money for the Platinum edition as I read in the reviews that it would bend. Not true. It has stiff boards in it which don&#x27;t bend. I can lie on it but clearly it does not work for my neck. I get the same relief with my inexpensive heating pad which is much more comfortable. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this pad just recently, after an old one of the same kind wore out. The old one has seen many years of good service. Though this item costs a lot, it is well worth the price...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has a bad hip, and she says this pad has been a life-saver--well worth every penny spent. It doesn&#x27;t just warm the outer layers of tissue, like most heating pads, but gets to the deeper layers, where the pain actually originates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can put this pad anywhere on your body--even sitting or lying on it--many cheaper heating pads aren&#x27;t designed for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need heat for sore muscles or joints, give this pad a try. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> So let&#x27;s be fair. The pad works well from a technical perspective but i have not gotten results to date. So it seems like a very expensive heating pad. We will stick with ti and hope for results</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband who has chronic back pain and found that he can use it for hours without burning the skin.  The thermal heat really gets in deep into the muscles and provides relief a lot faster than a regular heating pad.  It isn&#x27;t a cure all but definitely better than regular heating pads.</li>
            <li> This pad does heat up quickly.  Verdict still out on whether or not it is working with infrared heat.  I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference between this and a regular heating pad.  I have only used a couple of times though so can&#x27;t comment yet on that.  I do like it so far though and am hoping it will ultimately help with lower back issues.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a physical therapist.  Works so much better than a regular heating pad.  It gets deep into what hurts and really makes a difference.  I fully recommend this heating pad!</li>
            <li> Works well.  Good deep heat level.  I would highly recommend this product.  I purchased two; one for home and one for my office.</li>
            <li> feels great on my back</li>
            <li> I purchased the thermotex infrared heating pad because my wife was  having an autogolous adult stem cell injection (ASCI) treatment on her arthritic knees. Brian Shiple, D.O., the physician who administered this treatment is the co-author, with her, of the soon-to-be-released book REGENERATIVE HEALING FOR LIFE. He suggested the infrared heating pad to encourage stem cell growth.  Her knees are healing well and the heating pad provides good pain relief.  During this time I had a muscle spasm in my back.  Despite a chiropractic treatment, it had not let go.  I used the infrared heating pad for a half hour one night and the next morning the spasm was gone and has not returned.  It really works.</li>
            <li> This is our second Thermotex, we used the other one for several years and were very pleased with the results:  this isn&#x27;t your mother&#x27;s heating pad; this one emits light rays.  It takes some time, about an hour a day for me, but it really seems to help the achey breakies.  I didn&#x27;t give five stars only because the expense is considerable, but the results are much more satisfying than drug therapy.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these 4 years ago after the first of 4 operations and have used it every day for an average of an hour to an hour and a half and it finally died on me. I have constant pain in multiple areas and like the relief that this unit provides and because it has three separate compartments it can be folded into a triangle to use on a foot, wrapped around a thigh, knee, or calf using the shorter Velcro strap or using the longer strap as a belt you can hold it tight against your back. Very flexible in use, and the heavy duty velour cover makes it comfortable though not enough to lay down flat on it as the LED panels are hard, somewhat thick, and might even break, but almost any other position is possible.  Although this finally quit on me, I probably have used it 3 - 5 times more often and for longer periods of time than most folks, and don&#x27;t consider this a defect. The Velcro cover is extremely heavy duty and still looks almost as good as when it was new. I firmly believe in the Far Red Infrared penetration technology being more beneficial than an ordinary heating pad, and that it is not just some gimmick to sell a high priced heating pad.  Granted this isn&#x27;t cheap, but it is actually an FDA approved device which means that it is safe and has some therapeutic value. If you have insurance and can get a physician to write you a prescription for an Infrared Heating Pad for treatment of whatever ails you, then you can submit it for reimbursement as a Durable Medical Good under many policies. Certainly worth it to check with your physician and insurance company, but the relief that this gives is worth it even if they won&#x27;t pay.  I just ordered another one and can&#x27;t wait for it to be delivered as I have Sciatic pain and this gives me almost as much relief as prescription pain killers without any of the side effects.</li>
            <li> This IS NOT the standard heating pad. While the price is high you must keep i mind it penetrates far deeper then the standard heating pad. Any person with chronic problems such as neuropathy or joint problems. This product will give you the best possible relief from your pain</li>
            <li> Ordered the smaller Thermotex pad first and found out it was one solid pad that you couldn&#x27;t bend.  Sent it back, and ordered this one.  It has 3 separate pads that allow the pad to bend around your body.  Really like it.</li>
            <li> I have fibromyalgia and also have a back injury that has gotten a lot of arthritis in the area.  This heating pad is expensive, but well worth the money because the heat does penetrate the muscles.  I use it as much as possible, and it is very durable.  I take it with me traveling and it fits flat in my average sized suitcase.  I would buy another one if for some reason this one quit or got lost.  I highly recommend this pad.</li>
            <li> I find this item very useful for pain relief for my arthritis.  My only comment is it is difficult to put on your knees as it is firm and not soft and pliable.  I did not read the description carefully.  I recommend purchasing this item if you suffer with constant pain.  It is remarkable for my back and neck.  I can use it on my knees, but its a little challenging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thermotex Universal Platinum Radiant Energy Paint Relief Heating Pad.</li>
            <li> really does seem to penetrate deeper into the muscles and joints, and give more relief, than a conventional heating pad.</li>
            <li> I have recently boken my wrist, I have arthritis in my hands, and I have nerve damage in my back from having had shingles. This pad has done nothing for any of those conditions, even though I have followed the directions exactly and used it every day since receiving it. And it is not comfortable being comprised of 3 stiff blocks.Less useful for the back as the instructions say do not lie on it. I would give it zero stars if that were possible.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Helped my husband&#x27;s swollen knee feel better quickly.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing heat pad.  Use it all day at work.  Can&#x27;t wait to get another so I don&#x27;t have to transfer it from work and home.</li>
            <li> I have used the product before and was just as satisfied this time as in the past. Very helpful in alleviating my arthritic pain.</li>
            <li> Hard to put around a shoulder but feels good. Wish it had a automatic shut off. Pricey</li>
            <li> I paid over 220 bucks for this heating pad and I camt believe that it works the  same as a 10 dollar heating pad...doesn&#x27;t even get that hot..I have a chronic pain condition and im just so upset with this product I wouldnot rrecommend wasting your money in al seriousness there is nothing good to say about this product..i just got totally ripped off and im on a limited income and even more upest because of that. .</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product, it has relieved my lower back pain. I have chronic spondylisthesis, which comes and goes.</li>
