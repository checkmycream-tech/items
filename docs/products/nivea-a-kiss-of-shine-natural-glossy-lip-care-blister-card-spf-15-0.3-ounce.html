            <li>Nice smell, tint and shine.</li>
            <li>nice lip gloss, moisturizing wish it lasted longer</li>
            <li>It glides on so nice and is not sticky.  </li>
            <li>This is the best lip gloss I have ever used at a decent price for the quality.</li>
            <li>It is the best product on the market for keeping lips moist and soft.  </li>
            <li>Its pretty good, I didn&#x27;t love the color on me but its a nice color.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this gloss.  </li>
            <li>I really love this Nivea Glossy Lip Care.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>In terms of lip balm quality per dollar, I have not found a product that does better.</li>
            <li>What can I say, I am in love with Nivea</li>
            <li>BUT DOES A OK JOB</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to learn to love balms/glosses...</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite lip glosses.  </li>
            <li>Love it, keeps my lips moist in winter and summer.</li>
            <li>So glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I make sure i always sure I have this tube in my purse where ever I go.</li>
            <li>But, for the purposes of being a gloss that can be worn alone or on top of lip color</li>
            <li>Not too sticky, it is a nice light lip gloss.</li>
            <li>Just ok.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes and has spf 15 on top of it.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I use it as a top coat for my lipstick to give it a glossy feel.</li>
            <li>The taste is ok.</li>
            <li>I have tried another type of Nivea lip gloss that I love, I don&#x27;t care for the taste of this one, I like the way it looks on my lips, just a hint of color</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>When I wear it, even people who have known me for a long time say things like &amp;#34;wow, you look especially nice today.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It lasts a pretty good amount of time.</li>
            <li>I used Nivea a kiss of shine lip gloss for the first time and I love it , I have always used lip glosses and this ne is the best so far :))</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that the funny smell is because of the SPF, but I think I&#x27;m not going to purchase this kind again.  </li>
            <li>It is the perfect subtle color that adds the perfect finish for a natural polished look!</li>
            <li>Great for daytime wear, easy to apply and not heavy.</li>
            <li>Natural looking and just real lovely.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>and I believe it was very much liked and appreciated.</li>
            <li>The shimmer that it has I enjoy.</li>
            <li>Loved it, but when I went back for more</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until I discovered these that I&#x27;m now clean....</li>
            <li>Nice product but the color is just too &#x27;natural&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Smell is different but good to my lips.</li>
            <li>It looks gorgeous on, just wish it was bigger.</li>
            <li>a little bit too sticky for me but looks good!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a very nice, small size, easy to keep in a pocket.  </li>
            <li>Great for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell either.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite lip product of all time.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for nearly 3 years and haven&#x27;t been able to find anything else that compares to it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just the right amount of shine and moisture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overly shiny, but just the right touch.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for years, haven&#x27;t been able to find it locally recently</li>
            <li>It does have an odd smell, but no real taste, and it feels wonderful through the day!</li>
            <li>certainly nothing scented.</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to purchase at local stores, however, this product is no longer available.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It holds in moisture really well and isn&#x27;t overly shiny or lipstick looking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather buy a lip gloss and lip balm separately rather than tying to combine them in one as it serves neither purpose very well.</li>
            <li>but this lip care is really moisturizing and has an SPF.  </li>
            <li>That being said it does give off a really pretty natural looking shine.</li>
            <li>Nice product, lasts longer than most lip glosses, which usually evaporate within an hour or less.</li>
            <li>This particular product does bring on the shine.</li>
            <li>&amp; I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Wish the color had just a little more opacity but for the price, it&#x27;s not a problem</li>
            <li>top of a little lip color.</li>
            <li>Started using it earlier this year &amp; was very pleased at how long it last on my lips!!!  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t as thick as others, which is nice.</li>
            <li>Especially through a dry winter, this saved my lips many times.  </li>
            <li>some are fantastic and some are super thick and like peanut butter on my lips.</li>
            <li>My lips are really soft since I started using this!</li>
            <li>I have tried hundreds of lip balms over the past 40 years and this one is my lifetime favorite.</li>
            <li>so if your significant other (or you) like a flavored gloss this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok, I ordered it as it sounded like a good idea but is too sticky, goes bad pretty fast and is not as usable on top of my non-transfer lipstick as I imagined as it&#x27;s a little too thick.</li>
            <li>Not too greasy like a lot of clear shine gloss is.</li>
            <li>Overall it is really well.</li>
            <li>The tint in the natural bowed no hint of color at all</li>
            <li>This one surprised me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, I like it a lot.  </li>
            <li>near expiration date...</li>
            <li>It just looks so natural.</li>
            <li>Nice hint of pearly pink shine that does not look childish.  </li>
            <li>the shimmer is overwhelming and it&#x27;ll look too thick.</li>
            <li>Also the picture shows the original package as one would buy at the store but the gloss came in a small ziplock like plastic bag.</li>
            <li>A red or a pink would probably work a little better.  </li>
            <li>I like the shine that the lipgloss gives, and it can be done on bare lips or over a lip pencil.</li>
            <li>Not much else to say really</li>
            <li>Super slick and feels slimy.</li>
            <li>A little really goes a long way, because it you apply smidgen too much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I can get past the smell, but it does glide on nicely.</li>
            <li>Fun little lip gloss - very subtle color - goes on easily.</li>
            <li>I had to continuously applied several times a day (5-8) when my old one that I had a little bit left, was used about 3x a day and it kept my lips soft and hydrated throughout the day.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I can get past the smell, but it does glide on nicely.</li>
            <li> Fun little lip gloss - very subtle color - goes on easily.</li>
            <li> I had to continuously applied several times a day (5-8) when my old one that I had a little bit left, was used about 3x a day and it kept my lips soft and hydrated throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I still had a little bit left in my old Nivea gloss that I had purchase at the pharmacy and comparing to this one</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth as butter and the shine is subtle, with a little bit of shimmer.</li>
            <li> Long shipping time.</li>
            <li> I expected this lipgloss to be much bigger.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very sticky and thick.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time too!</li>
            <li> I work a retail job, so my lips get really dry...</li>
            <li> Lip glosses tend to dry out summer lips</li>
            <li> The tube is fairly small, but even with my extremely frequent use it lasts for well over a month.</li>
            <li> A sickenly artifical sweet smell, gummy consistency, and weird frosted effect.</li>
            <li> First the scent was extremely mild, and worst it barely lasted at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really glossy to the point its sticky.</li>
            <li> NOT WHAT I EXPECTED</li>
            <li> I like it, but it dries up quiker than I expected</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t purchase any other lip gloss.</li>
            <li> I wear it alone but also over lip liner or any other lip color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always prefered the shine of lip glosses over lip stick, but lip gloss doesn&#x27;t last, and it&#x27;s usually made for teenagers or little girls.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the size of a little travel size lipgloss.</li>
            <li> It gives you a little bit of shine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky or heavy.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of gloss from clinique to Victoria&#x27;s Secret and this is what I always come back to!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to find multi-purpose SFP lip products that wear well</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed about this..smaller than depicted for sure.</li>
            <li> Its expensive and hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> Seriously!</li>
            <li> Use it as a base before using lipsticks and lip liners because the color is a neutral pink.</li>
            <li> I have even given up on expensive lipsticks and lipgloss and just wear this instead.  </li>
            <li> Not to sticky and not sure what people are talking about it tasting bad its really tasteless nothing like lipstick</li>
            <li> It has been keeping my lips moist, while giving them some very faint color and shine, not to mention an SPF of 15!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had a really bad taste that made me nauseous.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so bad</li>
            <li> Very disappointed...  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather apply bug repellent to my lips than this!</li>

            <li> I still had a little bit left in my old Nivea gloss that I had purchase at the pharmacy and comparing to this one felt like the formula was changed. First the scent was extremely mild, and worst it barely lasted at all.  I had to continuously applied several times a day (5-8) when my old one that I had a little bit left, was used about 3x a day and it kept my lips soft and hydrated throughout the day.  Also the picture shows the original package as one would buy at the store but the gloss came in a small ziplock like plastic bag. Very disappointed...  Since what I ordered felt like it wasn&#x27;t doing anything, I went and bought something else.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip care product I have ever used in my life! It does have an odd smell, but no real taste, and it feels wonderful through the day! Perfect! (And, now, I can&#x27;t find it anywhere!)</li>
            <li> I finally found a lip gloss that stays where I put it. My lips are really soft since I started using this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that the funny smell is because of the SPF, but I think I&#x27;m not going to purchase this kind again.  I&#x27;m not sure I can get past the smell, but it does glide on nicely.</li>
            <li> The best lipgloss of all!! Shiny but not sticky. I love it!</li>
            <li> This lip gloss works wonderfully over lipstick.  Especially through a dry winter, this saved my lips many times.  This one&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this gloss.  It is the perfect subtle color that adds the perfect finish for a natural polished look!</li>
            <li> I really love this Nivea Glossy Lip Care. I&#x27;ve always prefered the shine of lip glosses over lip stick, but lip gloss doesn&#x27;t last, and it&#x27;s usually made for teenagers or little girls. This is thicker than lip gloss but isn&#x27;t sticky. I&#x27;ll call it lip gloss for women! I love it and it&#x27;s just the right amount of shine and moisture.</li>
            <li> I have tried hundreds of lip balms over the past 40 years and this one is my lifetime favorite. It&#x27;s shiny without being obtrusive, it smells great, it is a perfectly neutral-yet-flattering color (I&#x27;m very fair-skinned). It doesn&#x27;t leak. It goes on smoothly. I have one in every coat pocket and one in every purse and backpack. In terms of lip balm quality per dollar, I have not found a product that does better. When I wear it, even people who have known me for a long time say things like &amp;#34;wow, you look especially nice today.&amp;#34; Seriously!</li>
            <li> I am a lip care junkie.  It wasn&#x27;t until I discovered these that I&#x27;m now clean....I will only use this product!  It is the best product on the market for keeping lips moist and soft.  I have even given up on expensive lipsticks and lipgloss and just wear this instead.  It&#x27;s not sticky or heavy.  My husband even likes it and will kiss me wearing it!</li>
            <li> I really like this. It&#x27;s not really glossy to the point its sticky. It lasts a pretty good amount of time. I like to wear it with a butter lipstick I use and it looks great. My only problem with this is you have to apply just enough. A little really goes a long way, because it you apply smidgen too much the shimmer is overwhelming and it&#x27;ll look too thick. I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell either. Overall it is really well.</li>
            <li> What can I say, I am in love with Nivea so if its something I use &amp; Nivea makes it I am purchasing it &amp; I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Natural looking and just real lovely. By far my favorite lip product of all time. Not to sticky and not sure what people are talking about it tasting bad its really tasteless nothing like lipstick thank god.</li>
            <li> Nice product but the color is just too &#x27;natural&#x27;.  A red or a pink would probably work a little better.  The tint in the natural bowed no hint of color at all</li>
            <li> I have been trying to purchase at local stores, however, this product is no longer available. THANK YOU AMAZON! I love to mix the Nivea Glossy Lip care with my lip gloss, the shine is out of this world and it does not flake!</li>
            <li> Way, way smaller than it appears online - it&#x27;s like a mini. And I didn&#x27;t realize it was a tube, I thought it was a stick. Long shipping time.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for a friend and I believe it was very much liked and appreciated. Great idea!</li>
            <li> NOT WHAT I EXPECTED BUT DOES A OK JOB</li>
            <li> a little bit too sticky for me but looks good!</li>
            <li> Its pretty good, I didn&#x27;t love the color on me but its a nice color. Great for daytime wear, easy to apply and not heavy. Its expensive and hard to find in stores so if you like it beware.</li>
            <li> This one surprised me.  Very hydrating.  Not sticky.  Nice hint of pearly pink shine that does not look childish.  :)</li>
            <li> I love this gloss! it gives you the perfect glossy lip without that sticky ,drying residue.Great for everyday wear. The only problem with this product is the size of the actual item...VERY disappointed about this..smaller than depicted for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to learn to love balms/glosses... some are fantastic and some are super thick and like peanut butter on my lips. This isn&#x27;t as thick as others, which is nice. The shimmer that it has I enjoy. All and all I like this product for it&#x27;s color...</li>
            <li> Great product.  Its the best lip care product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I love this lip gloss!  Started using it earlier this year &amp; was very pleased at how long it last on my lips!!!  Great!!</li>
            <li> I ordered three of these because I like to have a lip gloss with an SPF. They arrived two days after I ordered them and expire within one month of receiving them. SPF&#x27;s do expire. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite lip glosses.  Hydrates and leaves a nice gloss.  just makes me happy to use it!</li>
            <li> nice color but it&#x27;s very sticky and thick. my hair gets stuck on my lips when i&#x27;m wearing it. yuck</li>
            <li> I like the shine that the lipgloss gives, and it can be done on bare lips or over a lip pencil. It&#x27;s not overly shiny, but just the right touch.</li>
            <li> Wife loved the product. Will buy again...</li>
            <li> Love it, keeps my lips moist in winter and summer. Use it as a base before using lipsticks and lip liners because the color is a neutral pink.</li>
            <li> I bought this as it was an add on item and I never seem to have enough chap stick or lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;So far, I like it a lot.  It has been keeping my lips moist, while giving them some very faint color and shine, not to mention an SPF of 15!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a very nice, small size, easy to keep in a pocket.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Smell is different but good to my lips.Thanks</li>
            <li> this stuff is great I love it!</li>
            <li> Nice product, lasts longer than most lip glosses, which usually evaporate within an hour or less. Wish the color had just a little more opacity but for the price, it&#x27;s not a problem and I can always add it over a lipstick.</li>
            <li> I bought a tube of this at a local store with a coupon. Loved it, but when I went back for more they had stopped selling it. So glad to find it on Amazon. It holds in moisture really well and isn&#x27;t overly shiny or lipstick looking. Lasts a long time too! This has replaced my chapstick.</li>
            <li> I used Nivea a kiss of shine lip gloss for the first time and I love it , I have always used lip glosses and this ne is the best so far :))</li>
            <li> near expiration date...</li>
            <li> I like it, but it dries up quiker than I expected</li>
            <li> Great product! It&#x27;s the only lip gloss that I wear. I have been using it for nearly 3 years and haven&#x27;t been able to find anything else that compares to it.</li>
            <li> I am a self proclaimed lip gloss addict. I make sure i always sure I have this tube in my purse where ever I go. It goes on smooth as butter and the shine is subtle, with a little bit of shimmer. The tube is fairly small, but even with my extremely frequent use it lasts for well over a month. My lips feel moisturized, never sticky or tacky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint, and it&#x27;s minor, is that I wish it had a sweet flavor like strawberry or peach. It doesn&#x27;t taste like anything so if your significant other (or you) like a flavored gloss this isn&#x27;t it. But, for the purposes of being a gloss that can be worn alone or on top of lip color this stuff is great!</li>
            <li> warning! this is the nastiest tasting lip product I have ever used, would never buy again! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Not too sticky, it is a nice light lip gloss. Not much else to say really, it&#x27;s just lip gloss Amazon!</li>
            <li> Excellent Lip Product. I buy this brand all of the time. My entire family has a Nivea lip&lt;br /&gt;product in their pocket! This particular product does bring on the shine. I wear it&lt;br /&gt;on top of a little lip color.</li>
            <li> Had a really bad taste that made me nauseous. I wasn&#x27;t trying to eat it, but if it transferred to a cup or food from my lips, it was just unbearable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok, I ordered it as it sounded like a good idea but is too sticky, goes bad pretty fast and is not as usable on top of my non-transfer lipstick as I imagined as it&#x27;s a little too thick. Just ok. I&#x27;d rather buy a lip gloss and lip balm separately rather than tying to combine them in one as it serves neither purpose very well.</li>
            <li> Super slick and feels slimy.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip gloss ever!  It moisturizes and has spf 15 on top of it.  It is wonderful ontop of colored lipstick.  I can&#x27;t say enough about it.I don&#x27;t purchase any other lip gloss.</li>
            <li> Love it. Not too greasy like a lot of clear shine gloss is. I use it as a top coat for my lipstick to give it a glossy feel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite sticky though. The shine is nice. The taste is ok. But it&#x27;s way too sticky for my liking.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years, haven&#x27;t been able to find it locally recently so I&#x27;ve been ordering on amazon. This moisturizers while also sealing the moisturizer in. I wear it alone but also over lip liner or any other lip color. I&#x27;ve tried lots of gloss from clinique to Victoria&#x27;s Secret and this is what I always come back to! I wear department store everything else on my face but this $3 lip gloss is the best!</li>
            <li> A sickenly artifical sweet smell, gummy consistency, and weird frosted effect. It&#x27;s not easy to find multi-purpose SFP lip products that wear well but the smell and taste made me dread wearing this, until I finally liberated myself and just threw it away. It&#x27;s so bad, it makes me question whether I&#x27;d buy any Nivea products again -- certainly nothing scented. I&#x27;d rather apply bug repellent to my lips than this!</li>
            <li> I have tried another type of Nivea lip gloss that I love, I don&#x27;t care for the taste of this one, I like the way it looks on my lips, just a hint of color but  not the taste</li>
            <li> This is the best lip gloss I have ever used at a decent price for the quality. Nice smell, tint and shine.</li>
            <li> nice lip gloss, moisturizing wish it lasted longer</li>
            <li> I expected this lipgloss to be much bigger. It&#x27;s the size of a little travel size lipgloss. That being said it does give off a really pretty natural looking shine. It looks gorgeous on, just wish it was bigger.</li>
            <li> Fun little lip gloss - very subtle color - goes on easily.</li>
            <li> I love this for my lips! It glides on so nice and is not sticky.  It gives you a little bit of shine.  It just looks so natural. I work a retail job, so my lips get really dry... I keep it in my pocket so it&#x27;s handy! I plan on buying more!</li>
            <li> This is the best of both worlds, moisturizing and a nice glossy summer shine.  Lip glosses tend to dry out summer lips but this lip care is really moisturizing and has an SPF.  I&#x27;m on my second tube.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, unfortunately you can&#x27;t always find it at the drug store. So  when they have it I always buy them out or I order from Amazon. This really is a great neutral nude gloss. Keeps lips moist and just a bit shiny. Love it.</li>
            <li> Not sticky at all.  Love this.</li>
