            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I just love it!</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It works just fine!</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and medium/short and I love the waver!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off placing your hair in a waffle iron.</li>
            <li>This is more of a crimper than a waver.</li>
            <li>Does what it is ment to, but it looks more like a crimp than a wave to me.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>and I decided I&#x27;m more the curls type.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I get many compliments on my hair when I use this tool.  </li>
            <li>the wave holds shape for more than a day.</li>
            <li>I can adjust for a more pronounced look or make it look like my natural waves - just better!</li>
            <li>Works beautifully, easy to adjust the size of the waves, fast delivery!!</li>
            <li>Makes very nice waves in shorter hair as well as long hair.</li>
            <li>I love the adjustable centre and that was the main reason I ordered it.</li>
            <li>Many people ask, &amp;#34;is that a perm?&amp;#34;, or &amp;#34;is that your natural hair&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li>Highly suggest this to anyone who wants a pretty beach wave hairstyle! :)</li>
            <li>and I just used it for the first time and it is wonderful on my really thick hair!</li>
            <li>Other than that it is a good product.</li>
            <li>It gives body to the top portions that are usually more weighed down.  </li>
            <li>This works very, very well.</li>
            <li>Heats up quick, different temp settings, easy to use.</li>
            <li>great waves and they last a long time</li>
            <li>My hair looked exactly like the picture, I didn&#x27;t like the finished look.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it does, just follow the instructions.</li>
            <li>This was my first time buying a waver</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>so if you live outside the USA, be prepared :)</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>and I really like that I can adjust the size of the waves.</li>
            <li>Very versatile.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I had to buy an adapter because of the US plug (I live in Hungary)</li>
            <li>Extremely disappointing, especially after reading so many amazing reviews.</li>
            <li>It heats up super fast and not only can you make different size curls and get the messy look, it leaves your curls smooth.</li>
            <li>- I can get a deep, loser wave or one that is a little more kinky.  </li>
            <li>Its kind of hard to use on very short hair above your shoulders because it is so big.</li>
            <li>I usually adjust this to my natural wave length and get the less wavy part more wavy.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It also smooths down my natural waves and makes it less frizzy and really shiny.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long, some curly, some really wavy and some just a little wavy.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair thats to my lower back, and I can do my whole head grabbing big sections in about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> After curling the first strand of hair, the waver left the same terrible burning smell in the air and in my hair.</li>
            <li> Does wonders to my thin short hair, a must have for short-lenght haired girls because of the size of the device and the volume it creates.</li>
            <li> Upon first heating, the product had a terrible burning smell, and the heat was only halfway from the highest setting.</li>
            <li> And there was a weird skunky smell coming off of it when I used it.</li>
            <li> The waver left a horrible wave and an even worse smell!</li>

            <li> great waves and they last a long time</li>
            <li> Love it! Heats up quick, different temp settings, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Works great! Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Made my hair frizzy. You&#x27;re better off placing your hair in a waffle iron.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Great item. Makes very nice waves in shorter hair as well as long hair.</li>
            <li> Great product! Highly suggest this to anyone who wants a pretty beach wave hairstyle! :)</li>
            <li> Amazing! This product is incredible. My daughter just loves it!</li>
            <li> Works beautifully, easy to adjust the size of the waves, fast delivery!!</li>
            <li> My hair is long, some curly, some really wavy and some just a little wavy.  I usually adjust this to my natural wave length and get the less wavy part more wavy.  It also smooths down my natural waves and makes it less frizzy and really shiny.  It gives body to the top portions that are usually more weighed down.  I can adjust for a more pronounced look or make it look like my natural waves - just better!</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s suppose to.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast. Iron works well and I really like that I can adjust the size of the waves.</li>
            <li> This is more of a crimper than a waver. I know it&#x27;s adjustable but even on the biggest setting the waves aren&#x27;t very big. And there was a weird skunky smell coming off of it when I used it.</li>
            <li> Does what it is ment to, but it looks more like a crimp than a wave to me. I have thick hair thats to my lower back, and I can do my whole head grabbing big sections in about 30 minutes. I like it for the &amp;#34;natural curly hair&amp;#34; look or the &amp;#34;beach bum&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> My hair looked exactly like the picture, I didn&#x27;t like the finished look. Only used it once, but since it&#x27;s not for me I will not be using it again.</li>
            <li> Delivery time was on point! I&#x27;ve been wanting one forever and I just used it for the first time and it is wonderful on my really thick hair! Love it</li>
            <li> Upon first heating, the product had a terrible burning smell, and the heat was only halfway from the highest setting. After curling the first strand of hair, the waver left the same terrible burning smell in the air and in my hair. I let the waver heat up longer, thinking the smell would burn off of the metal. After waiting an additional 15 minutes, I continued waving my hair at a medium heat setting. After finishing my hair, it looked like I was electrocuted. The waver left a horrible wave and an even worse smell! I shampooed and conditioned my hair, and could not get the burning smell out of my air. Three hair washes later and the burn smell still remains. Would never recommend this product. Extremely disappointing, especially after reading so many amazing reviews.</li>
            <li> This works very, very well. It heats up super fast and not only can you make different size curls and get the messy look, it leaves your curls smooth. Its kind of hard to use on very short hair above your shoulders because it is so big. But if you have shoulder length hair or longer it will work beautifully!</li>
            <li> It works just fine! I love it!</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully for beautiful hair!</li>

            <li> Exactly as described. Very easy to use. I love the adjustable centre and that was the main reason I ordered it.</li>
            <li> This device is amazing! I just love it!</li>
            <li> Love it. Works as expected.</li>
            <li> Gift for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;According to her, an spectacular product!</li>
            <li> Like that it is adjustable.  Wish it had a stand.</li>
            <li> The adjustable plates are wonderful - I can get a deep, loser wave or one that is a little more kinky.  Very versatile.  I get many compliments on my hair when I use this tool.  Many people ask, &amp;#34;is that a perm?&amp;#34;, or &amp;#34;is that your natural hair&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li> Drys out my hair no matter what product I use with this product.</li>
            <li> Does wonders to my thin short hair, a must have for short-lenght haired girls because of the size of the device and the volume it creates. I used it only one time since the arrival but it did meet my expectations. I used heat protector on my hair before using it, and it didn&#x27;t damage my hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;Although I had to buy an adapter because of the US plug (I live in Hungary) so if you live outside the USA, be prepared :)</li>
            <li> I just only wish it made bigger waves</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Makes hair shiney and the wave holds shape for more than a day.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and medium/short and I love the waver! The Waves last and last!</li>
