            <li>8/29/12:&lt;br /&gt;It still makes my skin happy, it is also good for oily/acne prone skin, it will help reduce/shrink your pimples, etc.</li>
            <li>It claims to be unscented but does have a scent that&#x27;s quite pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I wish one of those professionals would have told me to use good ole over the counter Vaseline.</li>
            <li>I panicked so you can imagine how delighted I was to find it online.</li>
            <li>This stuff is that good.</li>
            <li>Good Good</li>
            <li>i pick this up because i was looking for a good lotion for face.</li>
            <li>I saw this product, which I had not seen at home, and thought, if the Alaskans use this its probably good.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is good.</li>
            <li>Good quality, good buy.</li>
            <li>It  good Vaaeline Petroleum  </li>
            <li>&quot; believe me, its better to risk to have a beautiful skin than be scared and</li>
            <li>It works best for me if put on at night right before bed.</li>
            <li>I love it and will continue to purchase from Amazon and not even trek around town trying to find it!</li>
            <li>I use it on my face at night (the creamier and thicker the better!)</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this creamy vaseline!</li>
            <li>This cream is amazing for those winter months when your hands are all cracked.</li>
            <li>Noncomedogenic fragrance free which is great.</li>
            <li>I would recommend using this after drying off after taking a warm shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent that does not smell girly, my son likes it.  </li>
            <li>It goes on wonderfully and really does the job.  </li>
            <li>Always handy &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>nice to the  touch on  your  </li>
            <li>I was able ti find it online.</li>
            <li>I love this vaseline product and use it sparingly all the time.  </li>
            <li>In the morning my feet look much better.</li>
            <li>This Vaseline Deep Moisture Creamy Formula is excellent!!!!!!!!  </li>
            <li>Better than any fancy-schmancy body butter (trust me I have tried them all).</li>
            <li>Best DEEP Moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used for my hands and body.  </li>
            <li>I suffer from psoriasis and have been searching for a reliable moisturizer for many years.</li>
            <li>When my dermatologist asked me to find a better moisturizer for my skin</li>
            <li>I love this Vaseline product and have used it for years on feet and legs.  </li>
            <li>I hope it&#x27;s OK to say that, lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have tried many otc creams/lotions and this one  </li>
            <li>and I love this lotion for him.  </li>
            <li>I am glad it worked out, because this is quite a deal compared to the price of one in store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years I love</li>
            <li>Simply the best lotion you can use.</li>
            <li>What could be better?</li>
            <li>I love this jelly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than lotion, I vouch for it.</li>
            <li>Try it yourself! :)</li>
            <li>so I tried using petroleum jelly on my face, which was okay for providing moisture on my face without any issues.</li>
            <li>I do love the product and the price was even better than WalMart!!!&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t beat that combination</li>
            <li>I love to use it on my hands and feet.  </li>
            <li>If your skin doesn&#x27;t feel better after use, you need to see a doctor.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I really love this product because It seems to help with my psoriasis.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to get such a great deal too!(They are already a great bargain though)</li>
            <li>I love this product; the consistency is perfect for dry skin BUT doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling slippery or</li>
            <li>Years ago I heard that one of the best products for dry heels and elbows was petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li>I have really dry skin ever since and this has been a great help!</li>
            <li>I think this cream is awesome for dry hands -</li>
            <li>much more easy to go on line rather than visiting 20 stores and not find what I want.</li>
            <li>This is the best moisturizer I have found for my chronic dry hands.</li>
            <li>Best i have found for winter dry skin.</li>
            <li>I bought a package of 3 of these and then ended up giving one to my best friend and one to my sister - who both knew what a problem I had with the dry skin on my elbows.  </li>
            <li>This is the best lotion therapy for cracked, dry heels.  </li>
            <li>best for dry winter alligator skin.</li>
            <li>Excellent for very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>and most of all leaves your skin smooth for hours.</li>
            <li>The good news is that it really does work well.</li>
            <li>My skin gets scaly and cracks easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, not goopy, and</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that it is unscented and the price is reasonable; however, after learning what petroleum does to skin, I am no longer touching it.</li>
            <li>It has a very mild, clean-smelling aroma that seems to disappear minutes after applying.</li>
            <li>importantly, this product absorbs very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling waxy or tacky</li>
            <li>I was worried about the product surviving shipping (temperature and pressure changes, etc.), but my 3-pack arrived just fine.  </li>
            <li>The lotion came quickly too!</li>
            <li>but it soon soaks in and feels smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>but i wanted something a lot light and creamier.</li>
            <li>my heels are as smooth as my palm.</li>
            <li>It has been a few months now and I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>It keeps both my hands and feet smooth and moist.</li>
            <li>so  smooth  </li>
            <li>The moisturing effect of this product is far superior to any of Vaseline&#x27;s lighter-weight lotions and creams, and even lasts through a couple of hand washings.  </li>
            <li>Eighty year old friend with gorgeous skin has used this for years.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
            <li>Success!</li>
            <li>Started using it about 3 days ago, and my eczema has improved significantly.</li>
            <li>A bit sticky at first, but not the waxy forever feel of many lotions.  </li>
            <li>have seen significant improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li>great for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>I spritz my clean face at night and rub this in for all night protection from the drying winter air.  </li>
            <li>It works great on my feet &amp; hands which are very dry.</li>
            <li>but if I use just the right amount I think it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>my hands look great with minimal flaking.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, this is my absolute favorite handcream.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer so much, I&#x27;ve even given tubes of this as gifts to friends.</li>
            <li>and this works better than straight Vaseline</li>
            <li>I really was in love with this item.  </li>
            <li>I once loved this cream, it was thick and rich and perfect for dry hands in the winter time.</li>
            <li>I have tried dozens of different deep moisturizers over the years, and this is the one that works the best for me.</li>
            <li>It is super moisturizing and absorbs quickly so it isn&#x27;t greasy on my skin.</li>
            <li>A smaller tube that would be in-flight carry-on friendly or purse-sized would be amazing.</li>
            <li>my mind Vaseline Deep Moisture is as good as a heavy duty body butter, although it doesn&#x27;t have a nice fragrance like so many of them do.</li>
            <li>No store in my town carries it, but the product is so good, that I&#x27;m willing to go to such lengths to have this on hand at all times.  </li>
            <li>I also use this on my belly since I&#x27;m pregnant right now.  </li>
            <li>GREAT lotion for over dried skin</li>
            <li>Skin will be soft and wrinkles will be minimized, making skin appear more youthful.  </li>
            <li>Too much won&#x27;t be absorbed in the skin.  </li>
            <li>The lotion itself is creamy to the touch and is easily absorbed, about a minute or so, after application.</li>
            <li>from time to time, but that product takes more effort to work in completely</li>
            <li>Maybe just worth keeping an eye on.  </li>
            <li>it has to be fully absorbed when using makeup otherwise your face will feel cakey.</li>
            <li>By far, my favorite moisturizing cream.  </li>
            <li>It might not work for all skins but it is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>This was an old time favorite winter cream.  </li>
            <li>That isn&#x27;t to say there aren&#x27;t other good lotions out there, but in my experience this one is the thickest and deepest penetrating lotion I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>and I could never seem to find the right product.  </li>
            <li>Just put it on right out the shower or bath.</li>
            <li>right now I squeeze all my tubes into a pump bottle I got from Sally&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much, which is fortunate because yes, this cream feels greasy, and that keeps me from using more of it than is really necessary.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am extremely happy with this product and I feel it is a good compromise between the long lasting properties of regular vaseline and the fast absorbing properties of a lotion.</li>
            <li>No scents, no colors -- very gentle</li>
            <li>we also use this on our older daughter&#x27;s face - she gets chapping around her mouth in the windy, cool weather.</li>
            <li>Nothing ever really worked ... until now!</li>
            <li>I have eczema as well as a pretty severe case of keratosis pilaris.</li>
            <li>so much that I have it automatically delivered through Subscribe and Save!</li>
            <li>Be sure to open any doors you need to go through BEFORE putting this on your hands!</li>
            <li>I do not like most regular lotion.</li>
            <li>Hot tub really dries out skin, but I don&#x27;t plan on giving it up!  </li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more when I finish my package of 3.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different lotions and none of them have worked... until now.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff mid</li>
            <li>I decided to try it and have stopped looking for a better product for moisturizing and reducing tiny wrinkles.</li>
            <li>The product is fragrance-free (though there is a very faint, mild scent to the product - not at all offensive), creamy without being greasy or sticky, and, best of all, moisturizing!</li>
            <li>have to understand that I&#x27;m still lamenting the demise of Vaseline&#x27;s Intensive Care for which I&#x27;ll never understand why such a useful product was ever dropped from production, so I have been very observant about just what becomes available since then.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used pretty much anything you can think of to help my psoriasis.</li>
            <li>I have used this lotion for a long time and I love it.</li>
            <li>Nothing soothes my dry skin better than this product.</li>
            <li>This is only one of the few products out there that does a great job moisturizing without giving me a rash.  </li>
            <li>If it feels greasy, then you&#x27;ve applied too much.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li>They had it and it was shipped fast.  </li>
            <li>It really does help heal those cracks and paper cuts.  </li>
            <li>After I take a shower, I apply this cream all over my feet (and you really don&#x27;t need a ton of it) and man does it ever make a difference.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It really helps during the colder season.</li>
            <li>and do no put too much</li>
            <li>Using this with Lubriderm Intensive Repair Lotion has really changed my skin.</li>
            <li>This is very helpful to keep skin from overdrying.</li>
            <li>this is a very moisturizing lotion(?).  </li>
            <li>It really moisturizes well without leaving my skin greasy.</li>
            <li>This has really helped.</li>
            <li>AND is reasonably priced with no yuck aroma.  </li>
            <li>I have spent hundreds of dollars on beauty products that claim to promise to give a better healthier skin.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>This is our favorite cream for use on rough patches of our skin.  </li>
            <li>Use for the whole body</li>
            <li>It works very well and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve compared it to several other products, including other Vaseline creams, and it has worked best for me.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many other products, but none have the staying power of this.  </li>
            <li>My hands easily become dry and cracked.</li>
            <li>My hands are soft and smooth and not a dry flake in sight!</li>
            <li>Once the initial stickiness has subsided it leaves my skin soft and smooth and really well moisturized.</li>
            <li>So far I love this stuff, I have very dry skin</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s pretty much fragrance free, although I do detect a slight odor.)</li>
            <li>Sometimes the mundane things in life get in the way of enjoying your life.</li>
            <li>We have finally found a lotion that works for my loving husband&#x27;s rough skin.</li>
            <li>It disappears quickly without leaving any film, but it definitely seals in moisture.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for years but none of my local pharmacies seem to carry it anymore (or it sells out quickly).</li>
            <li>As an older American, I love the extra protection this product gives.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only docked a star because I would love the option to buy this product in the form of a bottle with a pump and in a larger quantity ...</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it to everyone.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of high end products; including Erno Laszlo.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light enough to use on your face, yet moisturizing enough for your whole body.  </li>
            <li>Normal moisturizing lotions don&#x27;t have the ability to lock in the moisture like this does.  </li>
            <li>Once I apply it in the afternoon my hands feel normal for the rest of the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is not sticky and keeps my husband&#x27;s heels free from dry flaky skin!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very thick and creamy and exactly like so many of the other creams I&#x27;ve found in those specialty mall stores, except way better priced.</li>
            <li>I don;t think I can ever live without this product.</li>
            <li>I live on this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Life becomes about moisturizers when living in New Mexico.</li>
            <li>I started using this product about a week ago and within one day, my hands were like new.</li>
            <li>My son has super dry skin</li>
            <li>I started using this product in the morning and after work, after about a week my hands are pretty much back to normal.  </li>
            <li>I tend to get dry patches on my face (or did), but this has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>Just as President Truman stopped the buck, my dry skin and splitting bleeding hands were quickly stopped upon the first application of this product last year, and it has since never returned with just a sparing application once or twice a week.</li>
            <li>Perfect for the cold weather, and for the rest of the year, too!</li>
            <li>bought my first bottle at the local drugstore and since it worked wonders I came looking for a deal on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>much better than the more expensive creams in my personal experience.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I don&#x27;t break out all that much, so I&#x27;m not sure how this would work for someone with acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>So easy to get products that are not available in my area.  </li>
            <li>My skin would get very dry again very quickly when I only used Cetaphil.</li>
            <li>fine lotion, just an overall odd smell that lingers much longer than anything with a fragrance and doesnt wash off</li>
            <li>Great moisturizing cream for my extremely dry, thin skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different facial moisturizers, but it seemed like they weren&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
            <li>It contains pure Vaseline Petroleum Jelly (30%), but unlike regular petroleum jelly, it comes in a creamy formula and is enriched with Vitamin E.</li>
            <li>I am constantly washing my hands, putting on vinyl gloves, taking them off, and then just doing one more little thing on the easel with my fingers just before I walk out the door</li>
            <li>It absorbs pretty quickly; has a slight fragrance to it even though it says \\&quot;fragrance-free.\\&quot; Actually bought mine at Target for a comparable price.</li>
            <li>And yet this simple and really affordable one is the clear winner.</li>
            <li>but it is much closer to actual lotion in look, feel, texture for the purposes I was hoping to employ it for.</li>
            <li>I am a nurse and frequent use  </li>
            <li>I make sure I put it on at least 20 minutes before I go to bed and wear socks or slippers if I walk around, otherwise it will leave some greasy footprints.</li>
            <li>The first day I tried this I was amazed at how long it lasted.</li>
            <li>seems to work(in addition to changing liquid soft soap to dr. bronners).  </li>
            <li>then in the morning I have a soft dewy look.  </li>
            <li>A real surprise to me upon discovering the skin healing quality of White Petroleum USP.</li>
            <li>It completely went away in 2-3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>The product is - as far as I can tell without a lab - identical to the one I bought in the store.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my old face at night.</li>
            <li>and I am 67 years old and my grandmother my mother</li>
            <li>I would suggest everyone to do a bit of research and consider natural options.</li>
            <li>So far, no itchiness from stretching.  </li>
            <li>My hands are awesomely soft.  </li>
            <li>Petroleum  Jelly  made  sensitive  </li>
            <li>I would love if it went back to what it was, just a few months ago.</li>
            <li>I thought that i have nothing to lose but to try this cream and add a thick layer of vaseline or aquaphor on top of it at night.</li>
            <li>Cures the ills of dry skin from this cold winter weather on my pasty white, fair, easily sunburned, old lady skin, and my avocation as a pastelist.  </li>
            <li>since it works so well for the kids i used some for my dry hands, and it really works!</li>
            <li>and this stuff is rich and heavy duty.</li>
            <li>Hope it&#x27;s the same quality of previous usage.&lt;br /&gt;Worked fine before.</li>
            <li>A tiny pea-sized amount is generally all I need to last me the whole day... through hand washings and everything!</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive nose generally, but this doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li>From time to time, I put it on lightly instead or avoid some spots on my face because I get a small pimple now and then.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and when it became difficult or impossible to buy locally - I got on Amazon and was able to find it at a great price!    </li>
            <li>I longer suffer discomfort and pain from dry and cracking hands thanks to this product.  </li>
            <li>By having things like this available you give us that few extra moments to relax.</li>
            <li>product has a slight but distinct \\&quot;smell\\&quot; but not, as the description attests, a fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Presently it doesn&#x27;t look like it would offer much savings over getting 3 individual bottles in the store.  </li>
            <li>Really - after years of trying all kinds of more expensive products...who could have guessed that this would be the answer??!![[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Super moisturizing but not as greasy as plain vaseline.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t crack down the middle to the quick.</li>
            <li>I live in Alaska and have dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Goes on a little greasy but in moments it&#x27;s absorbed.  </li>
            <li>With this fantastic product, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>and it makes my hands so soft, and does last thru about 3 washings of your hands.  </li>
            <li>I peeled them and apparently peeled off a layer of nail --</li>
            <li>Washing hands frequently exacerbates the problems ten folds.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product that really works for my dry chapped hands.</li>
            <li>Immediately after application, there will be an oily sheen on the skin which can at first seem excessively greasy; but after about 5-10 minutes, that sheen and any sense of greasiness will completely disappear.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I have dry, dehydrated skin that is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s psychological, but no other cream works for me.</li>
            <li>So I use Cetaphil as a base first, then apply the Vaseline Deep Moisture on top of that, and the combination works really well.</li>
            <li>It might feel a bit &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; at first, but in a few minutes that goes away.  </li>
            <li>I also shellacked my fingernails and no one seriously explained ( they might have said something, but I didn&#x27;t really listen) that you have to return to the nail salon and use straight acetone to remove the shellac.  </li>
            <li>Immediately after I shower, I apply this  lotion and it keeps my skin moisturized and soft all day long!  </li>
            <li>However, you&#x27;ll spend a whole lot less money on this.</li>
            <li>This product first showed up in the local Walmart a few months ago, never seeing it before that, but others claim to be using it for years.</li>
            <li>It seems to last through the first few hours of my shifts, but washing my hands every 5 minutes erases almost everything I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>It is thick and it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>Until then, though, I don&#x27;t mind making a little room in my bag for the large tubes.</li>
            <li>, with sensitive skin, in a dry climate, have purchased this product multiple times.</li>
            <li>I have eczema and very dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making it just a little bit easier.</li>
            <li>I seriously doubt this cream version was available, but the petroleum jelly product has been around so long</li>
            <li>My hands get very dry and uncomfortable in cold weather, but this cream makes them feel good again better than anything I&#x27;ve used.  </li>

            <li> 8/29/12:&lt;br /&gt;It still makes my skin happy, it is also good for oily/acne prone skin, it will help reduce/shrink your pimples, etc.</li>
            <li> It claims to be unscented but does have a scent that&#x27;s quite pleasant.  </li>
            <li> I wish one of those professionals would have told me to use good ole over the counter Vaseline.</li>
            <li> I panicked so you can imagine how delighted I was to find it online.</li>
            <li> This stuff is that good.</li>
            <li> Good Good</li>
            <li> i pick this up because i was looking for a good lotion for face.</li>
            <li> I saw this product, which I had not seen at home, and thought, if the Alaskans use this its probably good.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is good.</li>
            <li> Good quality, good buy.</li>
            <li> It  good Vaaeline Petroleum  </li>
            <li> &quot; believe me, its better to risk to have a beautiful skin than be scared and</li>
            <li> It works best for me if put on at night right before bed.</li>
            <li> I love it and will continue to purchase from Amazon and not even trek around town trying to find it!</li>
            <li> I use it on my face at night (the creamier and thicker the better!)</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this creamy vaseline!</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing for those winter months when your hands are all cracked.</li>
            <li> Noncomedogenic fragrance free which is great.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using this after drying off after taking a warm shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent that does not smell girly, my son likes it.  </li>
            <li> It goes on wonderfully and really does the job.  </li>

            <li> nice to the  touch on  your  </li>
            <li> I was able ti find it online.</li>
            <li> I love this vaseline product and use it sparingly all the time.  </li>
            <li> In the morning my feet look much better.</li>
            <li> This Vaseline Deep Moisture Creamy Formula is excellent!!!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> Better than any fancy-schmancy body butter (trust me I have tried them all).</li>
            <li> Best DEEP Moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used for my hands and body.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from psoriasis and have been searching for a reliable moisturizer for many years.</li>
            <li> When my dermatologist asked me to find a better moisturizer for my skin</li>
            <li> I love this Vaseline product and have used it for years on feet and legs.  </li>
            <li> I hope it&#x27;s OK to say that, lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have tried many otc creams/lotions and this one  </li>
            <li> and I love this lotion for him.  </li>
            <li> I am glad it worked out, because this is quite a deal compared to the price of one in store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years I love</li>
            <li> Simply the best lotion you can use.</li>
            <li> What could be better?</li>
            <li> I love this jelly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than lotion, I vouch for it.</li>
            <li> Try it yourself! :)</li>
            <li> so I tried using petroleum jelly on my face, which was okay for providing moisture on my face without any issues.</li>
            <li> I do love the product and the price was even better than WalMart!!!&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t beat that combination</li>
            <li> I love to use it on my hands and feet.  </li>
            <li> If your skin doesn&#x27;t feel better after use, you need to see a doctor.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I really love this product because It seems to help with my psoriasis.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to get such a great deal too!(They are already a great bargain though)</li>
            <li> I love this product; the consistency is perfect for dry skin BUT doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling slippery or</li>
            <li> Years ago I heard that one of the best products for dry heels and elbows was petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin ever since and this has been a great help!</li>
            <li> I think this cream is awesome for dry hands -</li>
            <li> much more easy to go on line rather than visiting 20 stores and not find what I want.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I have found for my chronic dry hands.</li>
            <li> Best i have found for winter dry skin.</li>
            <li> I bought a package of 3 of these and then ended up giving one to my best friend and one to my sister - who both knew what a problem I had with the dry skin on my elbows.  </li>
            <li> This is the best lotion therapy for cracked, dry heels.  </li>
            <li> best for dry winter alligator skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent for very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> and most of all leaves your skin smooth for hours.</li>
            <li> The good news is that it really does work well.</li>
            <li> My skin gets scaly and cracks easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, not goopy, and</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that it is unscented and the price is reasonable; however, after learning what petroleum does to skin, I am no longer touching it.</li>
            <li> It has a very mild, clean-smelling aroma that seems to disappear minutes after applying.</li>
            <li> importantly, this product absorbs very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling waxy or tacky</li>
            <li> I was worried about the product surviving shipping (temperature and pressure changes, etc.), but my 3-pack arrived just fine.  </li>
            <li> The lotion came quickly too!</li>
            <li> but it soon soaks in and feels smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> but i wanted something a lot light and creamier.</li>
            <li> my heels are as smooth as my palm.</li>
            <li> It has been a few months now and I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> It keeps both my hands and feet smooth and moist.</li>
            <li> so  smooth  </li>
            <li> The moisturing effect of this product is far superior to any of Vaseline&#x27;s lighter-weight lotions and creams, and even lasts through a couple of hand washings.  </li>
            <li> Eighty year old friend with gorgeous skin has used this for years.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> Success!</li>
            <li> Started using it about 3 days ago, and my eczema has improved significantly.</li>
            <li> A bit sticky at first, but not the waxy forever feel of many lotions.  </li>
            <li> have seen significant improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li> great for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I spritz my clean face at night and rub this in for all night protection from the drying winter air.  </li>
            <li> It works great on my feet &amp; hands which are very dry.</li>
            <li> but if I use just the right amount I think it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> my hands look great with minimal flaking.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, this is my absolute favorite handcream.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer so much, I&#x27;ve even given tubes of this as gifts to friends.</li>
            <li> and this works better than straight Vaseline</li>
            <li> I really was in love with this item.  </li>
            <li> I once loved this cream, it was thick and rich and perfect for dry hands in the winter time.</li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of different deep moisturizers over the years, and this is the one that works the best for me.</li>
            <li> It is super moisturizing and absorbs quickly so it isn&#x27;t greasy on my skin.</li>
            <li> A smaller tube that would be in-flight carry-on friendly or purse-sized would be amazing.</li>
            <li> my mind Vaseline Deep Moisture is as good as a heavy duty body butter, although it doesn&#x27;t have a nice fragrance like so many of them do.</li>
            <li> No store in my town carries it, but the product is so good, that I&#x27;m willing to go to such lengths to have this on hand at all times.  </li>
            <li> I also use this on my belly since I&#x27;m pregnant right now.  </li>
            <li> GREAT lotion for over dried skin</li>
            <li> Skin will be soft and wrinkles will be minimized, making skin appear more youthful.  </li>
            <li> Too much won&#x27;t be absorbed in the skin.  </li>
            <li> The lotion itself is creamy to the touch and is easily absorbed, about a minute or so, after application.</li>
            <li> from time to time, but that product takes more effort to work in completely</li>
            <li> Maybe just worth keeping an eye on.  </li>
            <li> it has to be fully absorbed when using makeup otherwise your face will feel cakey.</li>
            <li> By far, my favorite moisturizing cream.  </li>
            <li> It might not work for all skins but it is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> This was an old time favorite winter cream.  </li>
            <li> That isn&#x27;t to say there aren&#x27;t other good lotions out there, but in my experience this one is the thickest and deepest penetrating lotion I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> and I could never seem to find the right product.  </li>
            <li> Just put it on right out the shower or bath.</li>
            <li> right now I squeeze all my tubes into a pump bottle I got from Sally&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much, which is fortunate because yes, this cream feels greasy, and that keeps me from using more of it than is really necessary.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am extremely happy with this product and I feel it is a good compromise between the long lasting properties of regular vaseline and the fast absorbing properties of a lotion.</li>
            <li> No scents, no colors -- very gentle</li>
            <li> we also use this on our older daughter&#x27;s face - she gets chapping around her mouth in the windy, cool weather.</li>
            <li> Nothing ever really worked ... until now!</li>
            <li> I have eczema as well as a pretty severe case of keratosis pilaris.</li>
            <li> so much that I have it automatically delivered through Subscribe and Save!</li>
            <li> Be sure to open any doors you need to go through BEFORE putting this on your hands!</li>
            <li> I do not like most regular lotion.</li>
            <li> Hot tub really dries out skin, but I don&#x27;t plan on giving it up!  </li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more when I finish my package of 3.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different lotions and none of them have worked... until now.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff mid</li>
            <li> I decided to try it and have stopped looking for a better product for moisturizing and reducing tiny wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The product is fragrance-free (though there is a very faint, mild scent to the product - not at all offensive), creamy without being greasy or sticky, and, best of all, moisturizing!</li>
            <li> have to understand that I&#x27;m still lamenting the demise of Vaseline&#x27;s Intensive Care for which I&#x27;ll never understand why such a useful product was ever dropped from production, so I have been very observant about just what becomes available since then.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used pretty much anything you can think of to help my psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for a long time and I love it.</li>
            <li> Nothing soothes my dry skin better than this product.</li>
            <li> This is only one of the few products out there that does a great job moisturizing without giving me a rash.  </li>
            <li> If it feels greasy, then you&#x27;ve applied too much.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li> They had it and it was shipped fast.  </li>
            <li> It really does help heal those cracks and paper cuts.  </li>
            <li> After I take a shower, I apply this cream all over my feet (and you really don&#x27;t need a ton of it) and man does it ever make a difference.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It really helps during the colder season.</li>
            <li> and do no put too much</li>
            <li> Using this with Lubriderm Intensive Repair Lotion has really changed my skin.</li>
            <li> This is very helpful to keep skin from overdrying.</li>
            <li> this is a very moisturizing lotion(?).  </li>
            <li> It really moisturizes well without leaving my skin greasy.</li>
            <li> This has really helped.</li>
            <li> AND is reasonably priced with no yuck aroma.  </li>
            <li> I have spent hundreds of dollars on beauty products that claim to promise to give a better healthier skin.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> This is our favorite cream for use on rough patches of our skin.  </li>
            <li> Use for the whole body</li>
            <li> It works very well and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve compared it to several other products, including other Vaseline creams, and it has worked best for me.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many other products, but none have the staying power of this.  </li>
            <li> My hands easily become dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> My hands are soft and smooth and not a dry flake in sight!</li>
            <li> Once the initial stickiness has subsided it leaves my skin soft and smooth and really well moisturized.</li>
            <li> So far I love this stuff, I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s pretty much fragrance free, although I do detect a slight odor.)</li>
            <li> Sometimes the mundane things in life get in the way of enjoying your life.</li>
            <li> We have finally found a lotion that works for my loving husband&#x27;s rough skin.</li>
            <li> It disappears quickly without leaving any film, but it definitely seals in moisture.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for years but none of my local pharmacies seem to carry it anymore (or it sells out quickly).</li>
            <li> As an older American, I love the extra protection this product gives.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only docked a star because I would love the option to buy this product in the form of a bottle with a pump and in a larger quantity ...</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it to everyone.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of high end products; including Erno Laszlo.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light enough to use on your face, yet moisturizing enough for your whole body.  </li>
            <li> Normal moisturizing lotions don&#x27;t have the ability to lock in the moisture like this does.  </li>
            <li> Once I apply it in the afternoon my hands feel normal for the rest of the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not sticky and keeps my husband&#x27;s heels free from dry flaky skin!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and creamy and exactly like so many of the other creams I&#x27;ve found in those specialty mall stores, except way better priced.</li>
            <li> I don;t think I can ever live without this product.</li>
            <li> I live on this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Life becomes about moisturizers when living in New Mexico.</li>
            <li> I started using this product about a week ago and within one day, my hands were like new.</li>
            <li> My son has super dry skin</li>
            <li> I started using this product in the morning and after work, after about a week my hands are pretty much back to normal.  </li>
            <li> I tend to get dry patches on my face (or did), but this has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> Just as President Truman stopped the buck, my dry skin and splitting bleeding hands were quickly stopped upon the first application of this product last year, and it has since never returned with just a sparing application once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the cold weather, and for the rest of the year, too!</li>
            <li> bought my first bottle at the local drugstore and since it worked wonders I came looking for a deal on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> much better than the more expensive creams in my personal experience.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I don&#x27;t break out all that much, so I&#x27;m not sure how this would work for someone with acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> So easy to get products that are not available in my area.  </li>
            <li> My skin would get very dry again very quickly when I only used Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> fine lotion, just an overall odd smell that lingers much longer than anything with a fragrance and doesnt wash off</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing cream for my extremely dry, thin skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different facial moisturizers, but it seemed like they weren&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
            <li> It contains pure Vaseline Petroleum Jelly (30%), but unlike regular petroleum jelly, it comes in a creamy formula and is enriched with Vitamin E.</li>
            <li> I am constantly washing my hands, putting on vinyl gloves, taking them off, and then just doing one more little thing on the easel with my fingers just before I walk out the door</li>
            <li> It absorbs pretty quickly; has a slight fragrance to it even though it says \\&quot;fragrance-free.\\&quot; Actually bought mine at Target for a comparable price.</li>
            <li> And yet this simple and really affordable one is the clear winner.</li>
            <li> but it is much closer to actual lotion in look, feel, texture for the purposes I was hoping to employ it for.</li>
            <li> I am a nurse and frequent use  </li>
            <li> I make sure I put it on at least 20 minutes before I go to bed and wear socks or slippers if I walk around, otherwise it will leave some greasy footprints.</li>
            <li> The first day I tried this I was amazed at how long it lasted.</li>
            <li> seems to work(in addition to changing liquid soft soap to dr. bronners).  </li>
            <li> then in the morning I have a soft dewy look.  </li>
            <li> A real surprise to me upon discovering the skin healing quality of White Petroleum USP.</li>
            <li> It completely went away in 2-3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> The product is - as far as I can tell without a lab - identical to the one I bought in the store.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my old face at night.</li>
            <li> and I am 67 years old and my grandmother my mother</li>
            <li> I would suggest everyone to do a bit of research and consider natural options.</li>
            <li> So far, no itchiness from stretching.  </li>
            <li> My hands are awesomely soft.  </li>
            <li> Petroleum  Jelly  made  sensitive  </li>
            <li> I would love if it went back to what it was, just a few months ago.</li>
            <li> I thought that i have nothing to lose but to try this cream and add a thick layer of vaseline or aquaphor on top of it at night.</li>
            <li> Cures the ills of dry skin from this cold winter weather on my pasty white, fair, easily sunburned, old lady skin, and my avocation as a pastelist.  </li>
            <li> since it works so well for the kids i used some for my dry hands, and it really works!</li>
            <li> and this stuff is rich and heavy duty.</li>
            <li> Hope it&#x27;s the same quality of previous usage.&lt;br /&gt;Worked fine before.</li>
            <li> A tiny pea-sized amount is generally all I need to last me the whole day... through hand washings and everything!</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive nose generally, but this doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li> From time to time, I put it on lightly instead or avoid some spots on my face because I get a small pimple now and then.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and when it became difficult or impossible to buy locally - I got on Amazon and was able to find it at a great price!    </li>
            <li> I longer suffer discomfort and pain from dry and cracking hands thanks to this product.  </li>
            <li> By having things like this available you give us that few extra moments to relax.</li>
            <li> product has a slight but distinct \\&quot;smell\\&quot; but not, as the description attests, a fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Presently it doesn&#x27;t look like it would offer much savings over getting 3 individual bottles in the store.  </li>
            <li> Really - after years of trying all kinds of more expensive products...who could have guessed that this would be the answer??!![[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing but not as greasy as plain vaseline.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t crack down the middle to the quick.</li>
            <li> I live in Alaska and have dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Goes on a little greasy but in moments it&#x27;s absorbed.  </li>
            <li> With this fantastic product, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> and it makes my hands so soft, and does last thru about 3 washings of your hands.  </li>
            <li> I peeled them and apparently peeled off a layer of nail --</li>
            <li> Washing hands frequently exacerbates the problems ten folds.  </li>
            <li> This is the only product that really works for my dry chapped hands.</li>
            <li> Immediately after application, there will be an oily sheen on the skin which can at first seem excessively greasy; but after about 5-10 minutes, that sheen and any sense of greasiness will completely disappear.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I have dry, dehydrated skin that is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s psychological, but no other cream works for me.</li>
            <li> So I use Cetaphil as a base first, then apply the Vaseline Deep Moisture on top of that, and the combination works really well.</li>
            <li> It might feel a bit &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; at first, but in a few minutes that goes away.  </li>
            <li> I also shellacked my fingernails and no one seriously explained ( they might have said something, but I didn&#x27;t really listen) that you have to return to the nail salon and use straight acetone to remove the shellac.  </li>
            <li> Immediately after I shower, I apply this  lotion and it keeps my skin moisturized and soft all day long!  </li>
            <li> However, you&#x27;ll spend a whole lot less money on this.</li>
            <li> This product first showed up in the local Walmart a few months ago, never seeing it before that, but others claim to be using it for years.</li>
            <li> It seems to last through the first few hours of my shifts, but washing my hands every 5 minutes erases almost everything I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li> It is thick and it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> Until then, though, I don&#x27;t mind making a little room in my bag for the large tubes.</li>
            <li> , with sensitive skin, in a dry climate, have purchased this product multiple times.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and very dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making it just a little bit easier.</li>
            <li> I seriously doubt this cream version was available, but the petroleum jelly product has been around so long</li>
            <li> My hands get very dry and uncomfortable in cold weather, but this cream makes them feel good again better than anything I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Tried this in hopes that I could get the rough spots off my heal, it works well thick and rich, but greasy.  </li>
            <li> I usually apply it at night and am amazed at how much softer my hands are the next morning.  </li>
            <li> With this product I only have to apply it once in the morning after my shower and it usually lasts me the whole day until I get home.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this product would be really thick and greasy feeling, but that is not the case.  </li>
            <li> Several years ago it was carried in my grocery store, and I was looking for an intensive healing cream for severely dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I had cracks on the back of my knuckles and my hands were dry up to my wrists.  </li>
            <li> I recently visited Alaska and had very dry skin on my hands.  </li>
            <li> It rubs in completely with a little effort, but if you&#x27;re in a hurry it wipes off on a hand towel.  </li>
            <li> I use it regularly and find it to be soothing and helpful, when other lotions and creams don&#x27;t help much or last as long.</li>
            <li> I have always had dry skin and scaling on my elbows and they are now as smooth and soft as a baby&#x27;s behind!!  </li>
            <li> have done a lot of researchs, desperately looking for relief, for a healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li> I have never liked a product that much as I do now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even tested it directly against other products, using this on one arm and another product on the other.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time, too.  </li>
            <li> As in, the moisture is sealed in and lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I hope it will keep working in the long</li>
            <li> Not to thick and not thin.</li>
            <li> This makes the product last longer, unlike those other almost watery products.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, if I use Vaseline Deep Moisture by itself on my face, it will sometimes clog up the skin pores.</li>
            <li> Mercifully, unlike some of the other chemical treatments that I have been prescribed, I can use Vaseline deep moisture creamy formula for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> the alcohol foam hand sanitizers causes dry crackerd areas on my hands.  </li>
            <li> It is designed to provide 18 hours of moisturization by increasing skin&#x27;s moisture by 250%, as well as heal severely dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems with extremely dry hands.</li>
            <li> : For people like me, if you get diagnosed with folliculitis and keratosis pilaris you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> However, this product works on dry skin as well.</li>
            <li> My skin is always dry.  </li>
            <li> I received this lotion from a friend once and then had to find it for myself because it is so soothing for my battered, dry hands.</li>
            <li> I still have to use it every day, but my hands don&#x27;t hurt and they don&#x27;t get quite as dry during a shift at work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband does mechanic work and has issues with dry hands as well.  </li>
            <li> This is my go-to moisturizer in the winter when the air is dry.  </li>
            <li> If you have problem with dry skin and or dry feet</li>
            <li> Every time summer goes and winter comes, my hands get extremely dry to the point that they crack and bleed.</li>
            <li> My hands get painfully dry to the point of cracking and bleeding.  </li>
            <li> It works so well on dry hands and feet, and can heal up just about any water damage to hands in two days.  </li>
            <li> you have dry skin - try it.</li>
            <li> Stops painfully dry skin.</li>
            <li> and it relieves the dry, itchy skin on my arms.</li>
            <li> I have painfully dry hands that crack</li>
            <li> So I rub this in every morning and night to keep my fingernails supple enough so the few layers left</li>
            <li> Overall, I am quite satisfied, a 4.5 oz lasts me a little over a month and even when my skin starts drying out and peeling when I have to blow my nose a lot when my allergies bothers me or when I have a cold, it does not take long before all of the dryness goes away again.</li>
            <li> A little seems to go a long way - I put a pea sized drop on the back of each hand and then rub it in, then a pea sized drop for my forearms.  </li>
            <li> I also have very dry hands</li>
            <li> My daughter has very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I use this, let it soak in (seems a little greasy, but only for a moment), apply BB cream or foundation...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t look for this product in one of those wasteful pump bottles because this is a very thick cream, but much easier to apply than the jelly.</li>
            <li> We use it for our baby&#x27;s diapers, but instead of having something that&#x27;s only made for that (typical diaper cream) now we can use it for other purposes too.</li>
            <li> only complaint about this product (and it doesn&#x27;t change my rating) is that this tube is the only size offered.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few moisturizers that does what it promises in a very short period of time.  </li>
            <li> and it was getting harder to find, so</li>
            <li> It is rather thick and takes some time to integrate completely with the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick enough to protect, but not too thick to feel like straight vaseline.</li>
            <li> No cracked peeling dry skin for me!!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I apply a small amount (think pea size for forehead, right/left cheek, front of the neck and then back of the neck--</li>
            <li> again, no irritation, unlike all other moisturizers we have tried.</li>
            <li> have psoriasis of hands &amp; feet and embarrassing when my hands are extremely flaky.  </li>
            <li> It solve my  skin problem them any other vaselin</li>
            <li> I have dry feet and dry; cracked heels (I know it sounds terrible), and this stuff is an amazing solution to the problem.  </li>
            <li> When a couple of these tubes showed up on the shelf I dropped one of them into my cart regardless that Dimethicone was not listed as an active ingredient.</li>
            <li> However, the last two winters I have been faithful to Vaseline Deep Moisture and for two winters I have not experienced cracking around my fingertips.</li>
            <li> I have since re ordered this product several times and at least 9 or 10 at a time.</li>
            <li> my skin has improved dramatically in less than one week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even if you don&#x27;t think so because you tend to be slightly oily.</li>
            <li> I wish there was a way to buy them by the case so my expense would be less.  </li>
            <li> exactly what I needed for this cold weather.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, because it is so thick and creamy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and only a small dab is needed.</li>
            <li> This cream is a little greasy but it does withstand a handwashing or two.  </li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s prices are actually a little bit cheaper, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i put it on at nighttime and a little when i wake up.</li>
            <li> We apply a little bit of this product on our 2 month-old after each diaper change and he never has diaper rash.</li>
            <li> There is a slight smell of something, but it&#x27;s very slight.  </li>
            <li> Usually moisturizer dry up halfway through my work day, leaving me dry, itchy and uncomfortable for the other half of the day.</li>
            <li> and I seriously haven&#x27;t seen much of a dry patch since.</li>
            <li> I will be on the lookout for that since there are a few reviews here suggesting that not every batch is consistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is heavy without being too greasy.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to it by a friend after washing my hands with harsh soap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a fairly heavy lotion</li>
            <li> I work in a shop and my hands and body are subject to everything!  </li>
            <li> I go through at least 3 a week due to the severity of my psoriasis.  </li>
            <li> Although the cream is satisfactory for my needs, it has an unpleasant odor that the last tubes of the same brand of moisture didn&#x27;t have.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s, but hated the tacky feeling it left on my skin after application (thanks to the allantoin).</li>
            <li> I like to dilute it just a very little bit, as it spreads easier then.  </li>
            <li> I notice that any minor cracks that had been beginning to form have started to heal and don&#x27;t turn deep painful</li>
            <li> I went to a bunch of dermatologists over the past decade</li>
            <li> Moisturize everyday!</li>
            <li> I usually apply it to my hands just after washing, while my hands are still a bit damp.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any of this on the shelf in the past couple of months so either</li>
            <li> Have used this product in the past.  </li>
            <li> I usually just find myself applying this one - the Vaseline product - on the way out</li>
            <li> I even use this on my face when it gets really dried out!  </li>
            <li> but I not sure I will get them again.  </li>
            <li> I wish I were smart enough to realize that when people suffer terrible burns-</li>
            <li> However when recieving this large package of them I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t be without it, but its getting hard to find in stores around here, so I order it online to keep in stock.</li>
            <li> That would be hard enough on my hands, but the last step involves quick-drying sanitizer and that stuff is brutal on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> For some reason, it&#x27;s hard to find this in stores.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for years, but it is hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> Now they have at least 3 of them because they all started using it too.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if the formulation changed, or if this is a falsely labeled product, but the lotion seems thin and watered down.</li>
            <li> Even though I have naturally oily skin during the winter time I tend to dry up horribly</li>
            <li> it was less than 4 bucks!!!  </li>
            <li> Much less expensive than the leading brands.</li>
            <li> no good.  </li>
            <li> It is very hard to find these days and thought I would search at Amazon.com.   </li>
            <li> It is too thin and weak.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all being purchased or worse, Vaseline has dropped this product from production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> it was just elbow creases and behind her knees.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
            <li> We brought up a tube to the golf course restaurant where we hang out ALOT and asked the staff to keep it behind the bar for us.  </li>
            <li> (it doesn&#x27;t stick to vinyl gloves or make them difficult to put on).</li>
            <li> Unable to find this product at any stores.</li>
            <li> I tried expensive brands of face lotions and had allergic reactions to it</li>
            <li> unfortunately, it didnt work for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> by the way, i know people are afraid to apply it on the face, \\&quot;its unhealthy, it will clog your pores\\</li>
            <li> Well, I did try this a few times, but I hated the greasiness of the petroleum jelly</li>
            <li> Although this product is listed as fragrance-free, it does have a very faint fragrance, however I don&#x27;t find it bothersome.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will keep buying this product until the formula changes or I get a couple of bad batches in a row.  </li>
            <li> (Horrifying, but</li>
            <li> I was however very disappointed in the amount of product in the container.  </li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t horrible</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> With this fantastic product, a little goes a long way! A tiny pea-sized amount is generally all I need to last me the whole day... through hand washings and everything! If it feels greasy, then you&#x27;ve applied too much. Just spread it around and let it soak in. They stopped carrying it at our local store (horrors!) and nothing else even compares. Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my baby&#x27;s skin hoping it would be a softer version of the traditional petroleum jelly but it is much closer to actual lotion in look, feel, texture for the purposes I was hoping to employ it for.</li>
            <li> Best moisture cream. Excellent for your face as well. Why can&#x27;t you get it in the drugstore anymore?? Thanks to Amazon I was able ti find it online.</li>
            <li> Success! We have finally found a lotion that works for my loving husband&#x27;s rough skin. And guess what?  I don&#x27;t even have to leave the house to get it.  The only improvement I can see now is to put it on Subscribe and Save. [Hint, hint!]  Sometimes the mundane things in life get in the way of enjoying your life. By having things like this available you give us that few extra moments to relax. Thanks for making it just a little bit easier.</li>
            <li> I love this vaseline product and use it sparingly all the time.  It is very hard to find these days and thought I would search at Amazon.com.   Bingo!  They had it and it was shipped fast.  Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> I happened upon this product while looking for a moisturizing cream for my hands.  I am a nurse and frequent use  the alcohol foam hand sanitizers causes dry crackerd areas on my hands.  This cream is a little greasy but it does withstand a handwashing or two.  I usually apply it at night and am amazed at how much softer my hands are the next morning.  It really does help heal those cracks and paper cuts.  I bought the 3 pack so I could keep one in the kitchen, one in the bedroom and one in my purse.  Much less expensive than the leading brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  Area stores no longer stock it, so I ordered it from Amazon and even saved money by doing so.  I&#x27;m grateful to have found it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great hand/body cream.  It&#x27;s unscented, so can be used by people with sensitivities or those working in food prep or health care.  Immediately after application, there will be an oily sheen on the skin which can at first seem excessively greasy; but after about 5-10 minutes, that sheen and any sense of greasiness will completely disappear.  Skin will be soft and wrinkles will be minimized, making skin appear more youthful.  The moisturing effect of this product is far superior to any of Vaseline&#x27;s lighter-weight lotions and creams, and even lasts through a couple of hand washings.  It&#x27;s really good stuff!</li>
            <li> Why do I order this product on Amazon and buy the 3-pack to boot?  No store in my town carries it, but the product is so good, that I&#x27;m willing to go to such lengths to have this on hand at all times.  Several years ago it was carried in my grocery store, and I was looking for an intensive healing cream for severely dry skin.  I gave this product a try, and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.  Sandpaper heels?  They&#x27;re gone.  Snowflake legs.  Gone!  A little bit goes a long way, because it is so thick and creamy.  This makes the product last longer, unlike those other almost watery products.  Just give it a try.</li>
            <li> Years ago I heard that one of the best products for dry heels and elbows was petroleum jelly. A doc recommended slathering it on before bed (wearing socks, of course.) Well, I did try this a few times, but I hated the greasiness of the petroleum jelly and I also don&#x27;t like sleeping with socks on.  But then I ran across Vaseline Deep Moisture. It contains pure Vaseline Petroleum Jelly (30%), but unlike regular petroleum jelly, it comes in a creamy formula and is enriched with Vitamin E. It is designed to provide 18 hours of moisturization by increasing skin&#x27;s moisture by 250%, as well as heal severely dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this at bedtime only. That&#x27;s because it is a bit sticky, not unlike a body butter. It is rather thick and takes some time to integrate completely with the skin. I make sure I put it on at least 20 minutes before I go to bed and wear socks or slippers if I walk around, otherwise it will leave some greasy footprints. The good news is that it really does work well. Once the initial stickiness has subsided it leaves my skin soft and smooth and really well moisturized. It doesn&#x27;t have that greasy feeling like Petroleum Jelly. In the morning my feet look much better. I notice that any minor cracks that had been beginning to form have started to heal and don&#x27;t turn deep painful ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my mind Vaseline Deep Moisture is as good as a heavy duty body butter, although it doesn&#x27;t have a nice fragrance like so many of them do. (it&#x27;s pretty much fragrance free, although I do detect a slight odor.) However, you&#x27;ll spend a whole lot less money on this.</li>
            <li> I use this every night for my eczema and it is as soothing and supple as everyone claims it to be. I have a bottle sitting at home, in my purse, and on my desk at work. Perfect for the cold weather, and for the rest of the year, too!</li>
            <li> fine lotion, just an overall odd smell that lingers much longer than anything with a fragrance and doesnt wash off</li>
            <li> This Vaseline Deep Moisture Creamy Formula is excellent!!!!!!!!  I have dry feet and dry; cracked heels (I know it sounds terrible), and this stuff is an amazing solution to the problem.  After I take a shower, I apply this cream all over my feet (and you really don&#x27;t need a ton of it) and man does it ever make a difference.  Normal moisturizing lotions don&#x27;t have the ability to lock in the moisture like this does.  It lasts a long time, too.  I also have very dry hands and it makes my hands so soft, and does last thru about 3 washings of your hands.  Especially thrilled that it is unscented.  Very, very happy with my purchase and I highly recommend it to everyone.  FIVE STARS!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems with extremely dry hands. Nothing ever really worked ... until now! This is really awesome. Give it a try. You will see results.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and very dry sensitive skin. This product does a great job of moisturizing without causing irritation.  My skin would get very dry again very quickly when I only used Cetaphil. On the other hand, if I use Vaseline Deep Moisture by itself on my face, it will sometimes clog up the skin pores. So I use Cetaphil as a base first, then apply the Vaseline Deep Moisture on top of that, and the combination works really well.</li>
            <li> GREAT lotion for over dried skin</li>
            <li> I have eczema as well as a pretty severe case of keratosis pilaris. This cream is the only thing that moisturizes well enough to drastically improve both skin conditions. Better than any fancy-schmancy body butter (trust me I have tried them all). Super moisturizing but not as greasy as plain vaseline. Although this product is listed as fragrance-free, it does have a very faint fragrance, however I don&#x27;t find it bothersome. Great product for a great price! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I use this product on my face and neck. I have folliculitis and keratosis pilaris and this product actually works. It moisturizes to point where I am finally turning the corner on both issues. I went to a bunch of dermatologists over the past decade and I have been prescribed a slew of chemical treatments. I wish one of those professionals would have told me to use good ole over the counter Vaseline. I wish I were smart enough to realize that when people suffer terrible burns- doctors use Vaseline. Mercifully, unlike some of the other chemical treatments that I have been prescribed, I can use Vaseline deep moisture creamy formula for the rest of my life. I apply a small amount (think pea size for forehead, right/left cheek, front of the neck and then back of the neck-- the first time a small amount actually works) to my face and neck at night and my skin has improved dramatically in less than one week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: For people like me, if you get diagnosed with folliculitis and keratosis pilaris you have dry skin. Even if you don&#x27;t think so because you tend to be slightly oily. Moisturize everyday!</li>
            <li> This was discontinued by Vaseline and I dread the day I cannot go on Amazon and find anymore. I used to find it for years in the baby aisle then it disappeared!!! I panicked so you can imagine how delighted I was to find it online. I defy all facial rules and use regular soap on my face; and immediately slather this creamy (non greasy)formula all over it and my neck. My skin stays very happy!!!</li>
            <li> I apply this on my feet every night and day and my feet is now smoother and softer. I don;t think I can ever live without this product. I have really dry skin ever since and this has been a great help!</li>
            <li> My daughter has very dry skin.  This is one of the few moisturizers that does what it promises in a very short period of time.  No scents, no colors -- very gentle</li>
            <li> Best DEEP Moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used for my hands and body.  I say that because the softening effect lasts for hours on my hands.  My hands get very dry and uncomfortable in cold weather, but this cream makes them feel good again better than anything I&#x27;ve used.  A little goes a long way.  Too much won&#x27;t be absorbed in the skin.  It might feel a bit &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; at first, but in a few minutes that goes away.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> This is one of, if not THE best product I&#x27;ve ever used for my hands. I can only find this product locally at Wal-Mart stores, so I tend to stock-up. Amazon&#x27;s prices are actually a little bit cheaper, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry, dehydrated skin that is very sensitive. My skin gets scaly and cracks easily. I&#x27;ve tried O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s, but hated the tacky feeling it left on my skin after application (thanks to the allantoin). I tried Vaseline Deep Moisture Creamy Formula on a recommendation from a coworker and was instantly hooked. The product is fragrance-free (though there is a very faint, mild scent to the product - not at all offensive), creamy without being greasy or sticky, and, best of all, moisturizing! Not only is this product moisturizing, but it&#x27;s occlusive as well. As in, the moisture is sealed in and lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, this product absorbs very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling waxy or tacky (it doesn&#x27;t stick to vinyl gloves or make them difficult to put on). It&#x27;s thick and only a small dab is needed. I usually apply it to my hands just after washing, while my hands are still a bit damp. However, this product works on dry skin as well. I&#x27;ve turned several people on to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about this product (and it doesn&#x27;t change my rating) is that this tube is the only size offered. A smaller tube that would be in-flight carry-on friendly or purse-sized would be amazing. Until then, though, I don&#x27;t mind making a little room in my bag for the large tubes. This stuff is that good.</li>
            <li> Tried this in hopes that I could get the rough spots off my heal, it works well thick and rich, but greasy.  I even tried wearing socks after applying but still not the results I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I think this cream is awesome for dry hands - so much that I have it automatically delivered through Subscribe and Save! It&#x27;s very thick and creamy and exactly like so many of the other creams I&#x27;ve found in those specialty mall stores, except way better priced. It has no smell that I can detect. Some people may find it a bit greasy but if I use just the right amount I think it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that really works for my dry chapped hands. Wouldn&#x27;t be without it, but its getting hard to find in stores around here, so I order it online to keep in stock.</li>
            <li> I suffer from psoriasis and have been searching for a reliable moisturizer for many years. When my dermatologist asked me to find a better moisturizer for my skin I stumbled upon this while web surfing. The first day I tried this I was amazed at how long it lasted. Usually moisturizer dry up halfway through my work day, leaving me dry, itchy and uncomfortable for the other half of the day. With this product I only have to apply it once in the morning after my shower and it usually lasts me the whole day until I get home. The lotion itself is creamy to the touch and is easily absorbed, about a minute or so, after application. I put one of these each in my backpack, car, bathroom, and gym locker. I would recommend using this after drying off after taking a warm shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am extremely happy with this product and I feel it is a good compromise between the long lasting properties of regular vaseline and the fast absorbing properties of a lotion.</li>
            <li> The best hand cream ever!  My hands and arms stay hydrated with one daily use.</li>
            <li> So easy to get products that are not available in my area.  much more easy to go on line rather than visiting 20 stores and not find what I want. I love this Vaseline product and have used it for years on feet and legs.  No cracked peeling dry skin for me!!</li>
            <li> this is great lotion, and so cheap!&lt;br /&gt;i bought some for use on my baby&#x27;s skin folds, to avoid any redness etc. it works wonderfully and does not irritate his skin at all. we also use this on our older daughter&#x27;s face - she gets chapping around her mouth in the windy, cool weather. again, no irritation, unlike all other moisturizers we have tried. since it works so well for the kids i used some for my dry hands, and it really works! as someone else commented, initially it feels a bit greasy but it soon soaks in and feels smooth and silky. now i use this stuff all over my body after showering. my skin is supple and moisturized. couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.</li>
            <li> I adore this lotion. Put it on your feet at night under some socks and wake up with baby-soft tootsies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that because it&#x27;s petroleum-based, it makes you a bit greasy. Be sure to open any doors you need to go through BEFORE putting this on your hands!</li>
            <li> I hope it&#x27;s OK to say that, lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is my absolute favorite handcream. Nothing else compares for me. I don&#x27;t get super-dry hands, but I do need moisture. I know it&#x27;s psychological, but no other cream works for me. It&#x27;s as if my hands can tell the difference. When I&#x27;ve run out of deep moisture, I&#x27;ve used Aveeno, Nivea, CVS brand, and none of them compare. I was very happy to see that I could buy it in a pack of 3.</li>
            <li> I work in a shop and my hands and body are subject to everything!  My skin is always dry.  I especially love this stuff in the winter.  And you can use it on your face.  Goodbye Olay.</li>
            <li> have psoriasis of hands &amp; feet and embarrassing when my hands are extremely flaky.  have prescription med and prescription creams but still periodic exacerbation on hands.  have tried many otc creams/lotions and this one  seems to work(in addition to changing liquid soft soap to dr. bronners).  my hands look great with minimal flaking.</li>
            <li> I do not like most regular lotion. It is too thin and weak. I put this on my feet, knees, elbows and hands every night before bed. It really helps during the colder season.</li>
            <li> I received this lotion from a friend once and then had to find it for myself because it is so soothing for my battered, dry hands.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and when it became difficult or impossible to buy locally - I got on Amazon and was able to find it at a great price!    Immediately after I shower, I apply this  lotion and it keeps my skin moisturized and soft all day long!  I love it and will continue to purchase from Amazon and not even trek around town trying to find it!</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion ever. I use it on my face at night (the creamier and thicker the better!) then in the morning I have a soft dewy look.  I was so excited to get such a great deal too!(They are already a great bargain though)</li>
            <li> My son has super dry skin and I love this lotion for him.  It has a nice scent that does not smell girly, my son likes it.  It is thick and it absorbs quickly.  I have used it on myself as well.  I don&#x27;t like it for my hands because it leaves a residue, but every where else it is perfect!  The lotion came quickly too!</li>
            <li> Although the cream is satisfactory for my needs, it has an unpleasant odor that the last tubes of the same brand of moisture didn&#x27;t have.  I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product first showed up in the local Walmart a few months ago, never seeing it before that, but others claim to be using it for years. I seriously doubt this cream version was available, but the petroleum jelly product has been around so long it is an American icon. Haven&#x27;t seen any of this on the shelf in the past couple of months so either it&#x27;s all being purchased or worse, Vaseline has dropped this product from production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to understand that I&#x27;m still lamenting the demise of Vaseline&#x27;s Intensive Care for which I&#x27;ll never understand why such a useful product was ever dropped from production, so I have been very observant about just what becomes available since then. When a couple of these tubes showed up on the shelf I dropped one of them into my cart regardless that Dimethicone was not listed as an active ingredient. A real surprise to me upon discovering the skin healing quality of White Petroleum USP. Just as President Truman stopped the buck, my dry skin and splitting bleeding hands were quickly stopped upon the first application of this product last year, and it has since never returned with just a sparing application once or twice a week. It doesn&#x27;t take much, which is fortunate because yes, this cream feels greasy, and that keeps me from using more of it than is really necessary. Don&#x27;t look for this product in one of those wasteful pump bottles because this is a very thick cream, but much easier to apply than the jelly.</li>
            <li> Have used this product in the past.  Hope it&#x27;s the same quality of previous usage.&lt;br /&gt;Worked fine before. Good Good</li>
            <li> My baby (8mos) and child (4yo) had eczema.  The baby had it on her legs, arm, face and back. We used eucerin cream in the jar, hydrocortisone cream and ointment and the eczema persisted. The dermatologist suggested cerave but I thought of using this instead and it worked great.  It completely went away in 2-3 weeks.  I used it twice a day for the baby and once a day for the 4yo.  For the 4yo it was just elbow creases and behind her knees.  When I see her starting to itch, I begin to use it again and the eczema never appears.  Target and Walmart sell it for $3.</li>
            <li> One of the tubes had gone rancid and smelled ghastly.  I had to throw away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be safer to buy elsewhere.</li>
            <li> My job involves washing dishes periodically through the day.  That would be hard enough on my hands, but the last step involves quick-drying sanitizer and that stuff is brutal on my skin.  I had cracks on the back of my knuckles and my hands were dry up to my wrists.  I started using this product in the morning and after work, after about a week my hands are pretty much back to normal.  I still have to use it every day, but my hands don&#x27;t hurt and they don&#x27;t get quite as dry during a shift at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my first bottle at the local drugstore and since it worked wonders I came looking for a deal on Amazon.  I was worried about the product surviving shipping (temperature and pressure changes, etc.), but my 3-pack arrived just fine.  The product is - as far as I can tell without a lab - identical to the one I bought in the store.  I am glad it worked out, because this is quite a deal compared to the price of one in store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has a slight but distinct \\&quot;smell\\&quot; but not, as the description attests, a fragrance.  I have a sensitive nose generally, but this doesn&#x27;t bother me.  A little seems to go a long way - I put a pea sized drop on the back of each hand and then rub it in, then a pea sized drop for my forearms.  It rubs in completely with a little effort, but if you&#x27;re in a hurry it wipes off on a hand towel.  It seems to last through the first few hours of my shifts, but washing my hands every 5 minutes erases almost everything I&#x27;ve found.  Once I apply it in the afternoon my hands feel normal for the rest of the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep buying this product until the formula changes or I get a couple of bad batches in a row.  I will be on the lookout for that since there are a few reviews here suggesting that not every batch is consistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use [[ASIN:B00121UVU0 O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Working Hands Cream, 3.4 oz.]] from time to time, but that product takes more effort to work in completely and I don&#x27;t usually give myself that much time before work!  I usually just find myself applying this one - the Vaseline product - on the way out the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Take my comments about the 3-pack being a deal with a grain of salt.  The 3-pack is offered by different vendors at different times.  Presently it doesn&#x27;t look like it would offer much savings over getting 3 individual bottles in the store.  Maybe just worth keeping an eye on.  All that being said, I still think it&#x27;s a 5-star product.</li>
            <li> great lotion for the face. i pick this up because i was looking for a good lotion for face. i have been using regular petroleum jelly but i wanted something a lot light and creamier. i heard reviews about this and tried it and i love it. it contains vitamin c and absorbs so well into the skin. and most of all leaves your skin smooth for hours. i put it on at nighttime and a little when i wake up. it has to be fully absorbed when using makeup otherwise your face will feel cakey. and do no put too much i use a pea size and it goes a long way. 2 thumbs up totally recommend</li>
            <li> I work in a clinical setting, therefore I wash my hands several times every hour. My hands easily become dry and cracked. This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve found to keep my hands from drying out and cracking. It&#x27;s thick enough to protect, but not too thick to feel like straight vaseline. I highly recommend this product to anyone. I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
            <li> Even though I have naturally oily skin during the winter time I tend to dry up horribly and I could never seem to find the right product.  Until now.  At first I thought this product would be really thick and greasy feeling, but that is not the case.  It goes on wonderfully and really does the job.  I even use this on my face when it gets really dried out!  Using this with Lubriderm Intensive Repair Lotion has really changed my skin.</li>
            <li> I use it on my old face at night.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent cream.  It&#x27;s light enough to use on your face, yet moisturizing enough for your whole body.  It disappears quickly without leaving any film, but it definitely seals in moisture.  I&#x27;ve compared it to several other products, including other Vaseline creams, and it has worked best for me.  I&#x27;ve even tested it directly against other products, using this on one arm and another product on the other.  Four hours later, the arm with this cream felt softer.</li>
            <li> Hot tub really dries out skin, but I don&#x27;t plan on giving it up!  This is very helpful to keep skin from overdrying.</li>
            <li> It solve my  skin problem them any other vaselin and I try a lot of vaselin proudcat . So thank you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great. I use it for my baby. Easy to apply, not goopy, and no perfumes. Perfect! I will definitely buy more when I finish my package of 3.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I have found for my chronic dry hands. I have tried dozens of different deep moisturizers over the years, and this is the one that works the best for me. I love this moisturizer so much, I&#x27;ve even given tubes of this as gifts to friends. Everyone who&#x27;s used it has raved about it. I&#x27;m finding it more difficult to get in stores, so the fact I can still get it from Amazon is wonderful. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years I love you bother from my grandmother and I am 67 years old and my grandmother my mother and I all have beautiful skin it works</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. It is not sticky and keeps my husband&#x27;s heels free from dry flaky skin!! We cannot locate it in stores any longer.</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that it is unscented and the price is reasonable; however, after learning what petroleum does to skin, I am no longer touching it. Petroleum is not environment-friendly either. I wished I researched enough about petroleum before purchasing this product. I would suggest everyone to do a bit of research and consider natural options.</li>
            <li> Simply the best lotion you can use. I&#x27;ve used pretty much anything you can think of to help my psoriasis. And yet this simple and really affordable one is the clear winner. That isn&#x27;t to say there aren&#x27;t other good lotions out there, but in my experience this one is the thickest and deepest penetrating lotion I&#x27;ve used. I will always being using this product and hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> My wife tried this years ago as an alternative to those $20-$30 jars of designer creams like Orlay or whatever. I have since re ordered this product several times and at least 9 or 10 at a time. It saves me money and makes my wife happy. What could be better?</li>
            <li> I always get a patch of eczema on my hands in the winter, so I keep a bottle of this in my desk at work and use it after I wash my hands. Started using it about 3 days ago, and my eczema has improved significantly. It absorbs pretty quickly; has a slight fragrance to it even though it says \\&quot;fragrance-free.\\&quot; Actually bought mine at Target for a comparable price.</li>
            <li> this really is great stuff. I like to dilute it just a very little bit, as it spreads easier then.  Excellent product. Best i have found for winter dry skin.</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed for this cold weather. used to find something similar in walgreens but they don&#x27;t sell that anymore. great for my dry skin. much better than the more expensive creams in my personal experience.</li>
            <li> I live on this stuff.  My husband does mechanic work and has issues with dry hands as well.  We brought up a tube to the golf course restaurant where we hang out ALOT and asked the staff to keep it behind the bar for us.  Now they have at least 3 of them because they all started using it too.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this jelly.  This is my go-to moisturizer in the winter when the air is dry.  There is a slight smell of something, but it&#x27;s very slight.  It doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  I also use this on my belly since I&#x27;m pregnant right now.  So far, no itchiness from stretching.  This also takes care of my heels too.  About a week of this, and my heels are as smooth as my palm.</li>
            <li> Always keep well stocked up on this the best ever</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for a long time and I love it. It is heavy without being too greasy.</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing for those winter months when your hands are all cracked. It works best for me if put on at night right before bed.</li>
            <li> So far I love this stuff, I have very dry skin and this works better than straight Vaseline and it is easier to apply.</li>
            <li> this is a very moisturizing lotion(?).  You can use it on your feet, your hands, your bum.  We use it for our baby&#x27;s diapers, but instead of having something that&#x27;s only made for that (typical diaper cream) now we can use it for other purposes too.</li>
            <li> We bought this product for our baby diaper rash and it works perfectly and it doesn&#x27;t have any chemical that would harm your baby.</li>
            <li> I have used the creamy Vaseline jelly several years now. It&#x27;s hard to find in stores. It works great on my feet &amp; hands which are very dry. I carry it along with me in my shoulder bag. Always handy &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy. I wish it came in a bigger tube or in a bottle. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer stands up to desert dryness. Life becomes about moisturizers when living in New Mexico. As reviewers say everywhere,  I have tried everything. However, the last two winters I have been faithful to Vaseline Deep Moisture and for two winters I have not experienced cracking around my fingertips. Added bonus that the product is a bargain.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with this product. Unable to find this product at any stores.</li>
            <li> It really moisturizes well without leaving my skin greasy. It&#x27;s better than lotion, I vouch for it. Try it yourself! :)</li>
            <li> I live in Alaska and have dry, sensitive skin. I tried expensive brands of face lotions and had allergic reactions to it so I tried using petroleum jelly on my face, which was okay for providing moisture on my face without any issues. However, petroleum jelly is quite greasy so when I saw this at our local Walmart, I bought it. It has been a few months now and I am very happy with the results. I use it on my neck, all over my face and massage it under my eye. From time to time, I put it on lightly instead or avoid some spots on my face because I get a small pimple now and then. Overall, I am quite satisfied, a 4.5 oz lasts me a little over a month and even when my skin starts drying out and peeling when I have to blow my nose a lot when my allergies bothers me or when I have a cold, it does not take long before all of the dryness goes away again.</li>
            <li> I do love the product and the price was even better than WalMart!!!&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t beat that combination any where today.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisture hand lotion.  I keep one on my desk at work and at home.  It works as advertised and is not greasy!</li>
            <li> If you have problem with dry skin and or dry feet this stuff is great. Just put it on right out the shower or bath. Not to thick and not thin.</li>
            <li> I recently visited Alaska and had very dry skin on my hands.  I saw this product, which I had not seen at home, and thought, if the Alaskans use this its probably good.  So I bought it - and found the most awesome moisturizer I have EVER used and it was less than 4 bucks!!!  I have always had dry skin and scaling on my elbows and they are now as smooth and soft as a baby&#x27;s behind!!  I bought a package of 3 of these and then ended up giving one to my best friend and one to my sister - who both knew what a problem I had with the dry skin on my elbows.  They were extremely impressed with my results.  My hands are awesomely soft.  Really - after years of trying all kinds of more expensive products...who could have guessed that this would be the answer??!![[ASIN:B0040PDKPI Vaseline Petroleum Jelly Deep Moisture, 4.5Ounce (Pack of 3)]]</li>
            <li> Product is great.  Couldn&#x27;t find it at the Cvs or Rite Aid.  Cures the ills of dry skin from this cold winter weather on my pasty white, fair, easily sunburned, old lady skin, and my avocation as a pastelist.  I am constantly washing my hands, putting on vinyl gloves, taking them off, and then just doing one more little thing on the easel with my fingers just before I walk out the door and then my hands are pigmented in a variety of colors...so I wash them again.  This goes on all day. I also shellacked my fingernails and no one seriously explained ( they might have said something, but I didn&#x27;t really listen) that you have to return to the nail salon and use straight acetone to remove the shellac.  I peeled them and apparently peeled off a layer of nail -- no good.  So I rub this in every morning and night to keep my fingernails supple enough so the few layers left don&#x27;t crack down the middle to the quick. (Horrifying, but I think that&#x27;s what they want to do.)  It takes about a year to grow them back.  This has really helped. AND is reasonably priced with no yuck aroma.  A bit sticky at first, but not the waxy forever feel of many lotions.  A big gold star from me.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily.  I love to use it on my hands and feet.  It keeps both my hands and feet smooth and moist.</li>
            <li> I have always struggle with my skin for over 15 years. I was diagnosed with Seborrheic dermatitis, eczema and acne on my face. I have spent hundreds of dollars on beauty products that claim to promise to give a better healthier skin. I have tried a lot of high end products; including Erno Laszlo. Marilyn Monroe was a fan of Erno Laszlo, its the reason why I bought it. unfortunately, it didnt work for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;I have done a lot of researchs, desperately looking for relief, for a healthy looking skin. I have always thought \\&quot;why can&#x27;t i have the skin on the back of my hand?\\&quot; then one day i came across reading an article how marilyn monroe would smear vaseline on her face. I thought that i have nothing to lose but to try this cream and add a thick layer of vaseline or aquaphor on top of it at night. by the way, i know people are afraid to apply it on the face, \\&quot;its unhealthy, it will clog your pores\\&quot; believe me, its better to risk to have a beautiful skin than be scared and no try at all.&lt;br /&gt;well, it worked. i couldn&#x27;t believe it but it did. you will see a difference within one day. I have never liked a product that much as I do now. Im hooked. I hope it will keep working in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;I have no problem finding this product in my area. they have it at target. it only cost 3.39 per bottle. very good deal. Id recommend to anyone with any type of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 8/29/12:&lt;br /&gt;It still makes my skin happy, it is also good for oily/acne prone skin, it will help reduce/shrink your pimples, etc.</li>
            <li> Every time summer goes and winter comes, my hands get extremely dry to the point that they crack and bleed. I have tried so many different lotions and none of them have worked... until now. I started using this product about a week ago and within one day, my hands were like new. I&#x27;m not having to constantly reapply either. I just put some on in the morning and before I go to bed. My hands are soft and smooth and not a dry flake in sight! I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is only one of the few products out there that does a great job moisturizing without giving me a rash.  It also does not contain parabens.  My hands get painfully dry to the point of cracking and bleeding.  Washing hands frequently exacerbates the problems ten folds.  I use this after washing hands and at night before going to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen significant improvement in my skin.  I longer suffer discomfort and pain from dry and cracking hands thanks to this product.  For some reason, it&#x27;s hard to find this in stores.  So thank you Amazon for carrying it and please continue to do so!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years but none of my local pharmacies seem to carry it anymore (or it sells out quickly). Nothing soothes my dry skin better than this product. It is super moisturizing and absorbs quickly so it isn&#x27;t greasy on my skin. It has a very mild, clean-smelling aroma that seems to disappear minutes after applying.</li>
            <li> I once loved this cream, it was thick and rich and perfect for dry hands in the winter time. I am not sure if the formulation changed, or if this is a falsely labeled product, but the lotion seems thin and watered down. Not at all the moisturizing creme I was expecting.</li>
            <li> This stuff is good. If your skin doesn&#x27;t feel better after use, you need to see a doctor. I was introduced to it by a friend after washing my hands with harsh soap. It soothed my hands immediately. I have used it ever since, thank goodness for Amazon. I couldn&#x27;t find this in my neighborhood drug store. I recommend it, I know I will use it forever.</li>
            <li> Happy with my purchase.  Reasonably priced.  Thank You !</li>
            <li> As an older American, I love the extra protection this product gives.  I spritz my clean face at night and rub this in for all night protection from the drying winter air.  It works so well on dry hands and feet, and can heal up just about any water damage to hands in two days.  I order multiples to keep all around the house and in the cars.  I supply the kids with tubes as well.</li>
            <li> Best for keeping the wrinkles of age smoothed out.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion therapy for cracked, dry heels.  I lather up before bedtime and put on a pair of socks.  Works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a fairly heavy lotion and I don&#x27;t use it on anything but my feet.  But that is just personal preference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years and it was getting harder to find, so I turned to you for future purchases</li>
            <li> I really was in love with this item.  However when recieving this large package of them I was disappointed.  They were not like the individuals I&#x27;ve received.  They were thinner and didn&#x27;t smell the same.  I don&#x27;t have to squeeze the bottle for some to come out, just open it.  They weren&#x27;t horrible but I not sure I will get them again.  I would love if it went back to what it was, just a few months ago.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff mid you have dry skin - try it. After showering. Stops painfully dry skin. And is not overly greasy.</li>
            <li> We apply a little bit of this product on our 2 month-old after each diaper change and he never has diaper rash.</li>
            <li> Recommended by the doctor of my 89 year mother.  I started using it and it relieves the dry, itchy skin on my arms.</li>
            <li> This is our favorite cream for use on rough patches of our skin.  I use it regularly and find it to be soothing and helpful, when other lotions and creams don&#x27;t help much or last as long.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing cream for my extremely dry, thin skin.  SCURTISS1974@CENTURYLINK.NET</li>
            <li> I love this creamy vaseline! It is the best moisturizer I have ever found, and it has no scent and is not sticky. I have been using it for years, but it is hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> I love this product; the consistency is perfect for dry skin BUT doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling slippery or sticky!&lt;br /&gt;My Ma started using it on her face with no problem. I haven&#x27;t tried that but she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only docked a star because I would love the option to buy this product in the form of a bottle with a pump and in a larger quantity ... right now I squeeze all my tubes into a pump bottle I got from Sally&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa, with sensitive skin, in a dry climate, have purchased this product multiple times.</li>
            <li> By far, my favorite moisturizing cream.  I have tried many other products, but none have the staying power of this.  It truly does what it says it does.&lt;br /&gt;The best for dry winter alligator skin.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer ever.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. It moisturizers with just a dime size amount.  Good quality, good buy.</li>
            <li> Eighty year old friend with gorgeous skin has used this for years. I decided to try it and have stopped looking for a better product for moisturizing and reducing tiny wrinkles. It might not work for all skins but it is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> I tend to get dry patches on my face (or did), but this has helped tremendously. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different facial moisturizers, but it seemed like they weren&#x27;t strong enough. Fortunately, I don&#x27;t break out all that much, so I&#x27;m not sure how this would work for someone with acne prone skin. I use this, let it soak in (seems a little greasy, but only for a moment), apply BB cream or foundation...and I seriously haven&#x27;t seen much of a dry patch since. Hope this is helpful.</li>
            <li> IT  is  very  good  cream  for  sensitve  skin!  It  so  smooth  nice to the  touch on  your  make skin  moist!  It  good Vaaeline Petroleum  Jelly  Creamy formula  to use for /hard to find  so  buying  Vaseline  Petroleum  Jelly  made  sensitive  skin  to purchased to  line.  I recommmed to buy the  product  Vaseline  Petroleum  Jelly.  Very Good  purchased.</li>
            <li> I have painfully dry hands that crack and this stuff is rich and heavy duty. Noncomedogenic fragrance free which is great. I use it on my face and lips too. Use for the whole body</li>
            <li> Great price for a 3 pack. My Mom loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> This was an old time favorite winter cream.  Unavailable in stores.  Excellent for very dry skin.  Goes on a little greasy but in moments it&#x27;s absorbed.  It claims to be unscented but does have a scent that&#x27;s quite pleasant.  I highly recommend it.  It works very well and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I really love this product because It seems to help with my psoriasis.  I was however very disappointed in the amount of product in the container.  I go through at least 3 a week due to the severity of my psoriasis.  I wish there was a way to buy them by the case so my expense would be less.  If you can think of a way to help me with this please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Thank You,&lt;br /&gt;  Robin Eisner</li>
