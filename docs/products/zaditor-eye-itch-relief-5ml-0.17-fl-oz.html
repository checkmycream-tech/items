            <li>I get speedy relief from itching eyes (allergy, etc), and this is almost as good as a prescription eye drop.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just trusting my eye doctor&#x27;s advice, and what I literally experienced with my own 2 eyes.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s good to know that Amazon sells it.</li>
            <li>I have every kind of allergy there is</li>
            <li>Quick ship and great price.  </li>
            <li>These drops are, simply put, awesome.</li>
            <li>Im sure</li>
            <li>Besides, the medicine never seemed to help where I needed it most - my face.  </li>
            <li>It works within minutes and it takes care of my itching for most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product works well, better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, but I am glad I am not filling up my car with this.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>My eye doctor was also pleased.</li>
            <li>Zaditor is one of the best brand drops out there for relieving red eyes and itching eyes too.  </li>
            <li>I read most of the reviews, and no complaints on burning in the eye.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>My eyes feel so much better within five minutes.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t say my eye felt 100% better, but it feels so much better</li>
            <li>This product works exactly as advertised and at a good price point.  </li>
            <li>Truly, they help so very much!!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m free of symptoms for the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li>Also, did not receive detailed information and directions with my order.</li>
            <li>Once I started using it, however, I realized that it was worth the investment!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is like magic, one drop in each eye and you have immediate relief, it really works!</li>
            <li>Of course, it so good that I can barely find Zaditor at drugstores when I need it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite a effective but works reasonable well and is much much cheaper than Lastacaft.</li>
            <li>the first thing I&#x27;ve ever tried that worked!</li>
            <li>The box says Ketotifen is primarily for itchy eyes, but I really don&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
            <li>No matter what kind or how low the doses were, it makes me sleepy.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing!  </li>
            <li>It seemed pretty costly just for an itty-bitty bottle of eye drops.  </li>
            <li>Actually, I don&#x27;t find this to be any better than Alaway.  </li>
            <li>I use it first thing in the morning before putting in my contacts.</li>
            <li>This could purely my imagination, but</li>
            <li>fact, it turns out that the redness goes away on it&#x27;s own after a little while when I just treat the allergies with the Zaditor.</li>
            <li>They reduce mast cells in the eye so you don&#x27;t itch as much and are not a vessel constrictor.</li>
            <li>How Your One-of-a-Kind Family Can Make Homeschooling and Real Life Work]]</li>
            <li>You tend to take note how fast an eye-drop works when you are wanting to rip out your eyeballs out from allergies and you don&#x27;t have anything around.</li>
            <li>Really works for itchy eyes</li>
            <li>I actually think Visine allergy eye drops are more effective, especially considering they are half the cost.  </li>
            <li>The drops are long lasting too which is nice.  </li>
            <li>Since I have allergic conjunctivitis and am allergic to conventional meds for this, these drops were able to soothe and help the redness and itchiness.</li>
            <li>I put in a few drops and it feels as if it coats my eyes, instantly refreshing them, whereas Pat-A-Day felt like I was putting water in my eyes and didn&#x27;t help whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>My right eye (and only my right eye!) has always been so dry and itchy.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, sitting on the shelf right next to them, was Bausch &amp; Lomb Alaway.</li>
            <li>I immediately ordered them and as soon as I received the package in the mail I ripped it open and put a drop in my right eye.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>I bought these  particular eye drops because they only contain the anti-histamine and not the \\&quot;anti-redness\\&quot; chemical that can cause high blood pressure and that chemical seems to make my eyes feel \\&quot;tired\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mild dryness due to allergies.  </li>
            <li>If you have allergies with itchy eyes that sometimes or frequently annoy you with that feeling that they are sticky or there is something in them, try Zaditor.</li>
            <li>and my eyes are quite sensitive.  </li>
            <li>My eye was in so much pain that I can&#x27;t keep it open.</li>
            <li>I am rarely sensitive to anything, and I am really surprised I have the side effect.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised and did not think it would solve my problem.</li>
            <li>Have used several times with no problems and they seem to work really well with eye itchiness.</li>
            <li>Wow...</li>
            <li>(It does occasionally sting a bit on application).&lt;br /&gt;It is specifically designed for allergies, so unless you are sure your symptoms are allergic, read the manufactures recommendations, since the same symptoms can be caused by other conditions.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this due to the great reviews, but unfortunately this didnt do anything to relieve my eye allergies.  </li>
            <li>For the first time and ten years I could go outside during spring allergy season.  </li>
            <li>Overall product works; price is too high.</li>
            <li>Zaditor does provide some relief, but if your eyes get really itchy as mine do, I am not sure they&#x27;re strong enough, nor is it lasting.  </li>
            <li>My eye doctor recommended I try a new drop, but I ended up coming back to these.</li>
            <li>This stuff burns like hell, but only for a few seconds, and then you are free as a bird.</li>
            <li>I am not affiliated with this company in any way, but just have a bad hay fever hex which has been uncursed to a great extent by this product.</li>
            <li>Instant, and usually complete relief for hours.</li>
            <li>It costs about the same as the other 2, but you get twice as much, so you do the math!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried any other eye-drop that eliminates the itchiness this fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Patanol in the past and this only mildly controlled my symptoms.</li>
            <li>this eye drop works really well compared to other types of allergy eye drop, but it&#x27;s just more expensive than others.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I am a little disappointed in this product for the price, and given the fact it used to be available by prescription only.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried quite a few others from large manufactures &amp; retailers &amp; they don&#x27;t work as well.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few others from large manufactures &amp; retailers &amp; they don&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything I could think of to relieve the discomfort, and even went to an eye doctor who did some tests and told me nothing was wrong with it.</li>
            <li> give me relief from itching all day long.</li>
            <li> (I.e. feels like my eyes are dry</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have dry eyes)</li>
            <li> I have used similar products costing much less that worked just as well for my itchy yes.</li>
            <li> I have tried it a few times occasionally, and each time, the one drop I put in my eye burns my eye.</li>
            <li> Yeah, Ketotifen is expensive no matter what brand you get, but it does work, so it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I use Zaditor everyday and finally started wearing my contacts.</li>
            <li> The cloudiness slowly began to return, so I started back up on the Ketotifen eye drops and now use them regularly.</li>
            <li> it appears to alleviate other allergy symptoms as well.</li>
            <li> So you may not even need the other chemical anyways if the issue is allergies.  </li>
            <li> I checked it out, and Zaditor is quite expensive for only 0.17 fluid ounces per tiny bottle.</li>
            <li> After only a few days, the cloudiness in my eyes cleared up!</li>
            <li> I had blurred vision and itchy eyes due to my allergies.</li>
            <li> He was concerned when I mentioned the use of the other eye drops, and less so about these.</li>
            <li> only negative comment is that the drops is that when I first put them in, they actually burn like crazy!  </li>
            <li> And my eyes feel less \\&quot;tired.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> After about 10-15 seconds, seemed like forever, the burning went away, but my eye would continue to feel irritated and slightly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having increasing difficulty with itchy eyes and it affected my wearing of contact lenses, so my eye doctor suggested Zaditor over the expensive Pat-A-Day drops she normally prescribes.  </li>
            <li> I was introduced to this brand, Zaditor, by my vet - my dog&#x27;s doctor, because my little dog has allergy</li>
            <li> It only took a &amp;#34;couple&amp;#34; of applications to get rid of an itching eye allergy caused by grass cutting this time of year in southern california.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes, the burning goes away</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, I stopped using the Ketotifen eye drops because I figured the problem had cleared up. ....</li>
            <li> The watery eyes, and other problems went away within 2 days!!!  </li>
            <li> Wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive and come in such small bottles.</li>
            <li> I have terrible seasonal allergies that affect my eyes the most.  </li>
            <li> I usually take Claritan for seasonal allergies and find it helpful, but struggle, nevertheless, with burning, itching eyes during allergy season.</li>
            <li> I have pretty bad allergies that affect my eyes to the point where it is actually difficult to see due to goop in my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I was unable to wear my contact lenses due to allergic conjunctivitis.  </li>
            <li> Just very small bottle for price.</li>
            <li> But is too expensive.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to give it a 1 or 2 stars, because that would be unfair since I didn&#x27;t get to test this product.</li>
            <li> It is quite expensive for me in retirement.</li>
            <li> My doctor prescribed Pataday which grossly expensive and did nothing.</li>
            <li> Cutting the scientific stuff, Zaditor just works wonders.</li>
            <li> Itchy eyes are distracting and make it impossible to wear my contacts.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I think this is because my allergies are so bad.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from eye allergies and started out with a really bad year.</li>
            <li> My eye allergies were really bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had horrible allergies.  </li>
            <li> like I do, it is the WORST!  </li>
            <li> miserable itchy watery eyes.</li>

            <li> For years I used generic eye drops but these reduce the allergic problems I have with my eyes. They reduce mast cells in the eye so you don&#x27;t itch as much and are not a vessel constrictor. Wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive and come in such small bottles.</li>
            <li> The best allergy eye drops as recommended by my optometrist. Always have some on hand!</li>
            <li> These drops are, simply put, awesome. I suffer from allergies which manifest in itchy eyes. I have been put on prescription eye drops that do not work as well as Zaditor. I will have these on me at all times from now on. Truly, they help so very much!!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this due to the great reviews, but unfortunately this didnt do anything to relieve my eye allergies.  Im sure its a great product for some, just does not work for everyone.</li>
            <li> This product works exactly as advertised and at a good price point.  Very soothing!  Great product!  Would order it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had horrible allergies.  I can&#x27;t take oral allergy medication because it makes me incredibly sleepy.  No matter what kind or how low the doses were, it makes me sleepy.  Besides, the medicine never seemed to help where I needed it most - my face.  It itched constantly - the bridge of my nose, my cheeks, my forehead, my throat, inside my sinus passages, etc.  It was driving me CRAZY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I went to the pharmacy and they recommended Zaditor.  It was more expensive than the generic brands.  It seemed pretty costly just for an itty-bitty bottle of eye drops.  Once I started using it, however, I realized that it was worth the investment!  It works within minutes and it takes care of my itching for most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only negative comment is that the drops is that when I first put them in, they actually burn like crazy!  I think this is because my allergies are so bad.  After a few minutes, the burning goes away and I&#x27;m free of symptoms for the rest of the day.

            <li> It is listed at 2.62/oz, but the actual cost is over $41.00/oz. The product works well, better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, but I am glad I am not filling up my car with this.</li>
            <li> There is not a product on the market that compares to this!  I&#x27;ve tried quite a few others from large manufactures &amp; retailers &amp; they don&#x27;t work as well.  This is great for anyone who experiences allergies and/or discomfort associated with wearing contact lenses.</li>
            <li> Zaditor (ketotifen) is a 2nd generation antihistamine and mast cell stabilizer. Cutting the scientific stuff, Zaditor just works wonders. I&#x27;m not kidding. If you have allergies with itchy eyes that sometimes or frequently annoy you with that feeling that they are sticky or there is something in them, try Zaditor. Instant, and usually complete relief for hours. (It does occasionally sting a bit on application).&lt;br /&gt;It is specifically designed for allergies, so unless you are sure your symptoms are allergic, read the manufactures recommendations, since the same symptoms can be caused by other conditions. I am not affiliated with this company in any way, but just have a bad hay fever hex which has been uncursed to a great extent by this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  For the first time and ten years I could go outside during spring allergy season.  I will use this every spring from now on.  Its literally a life saver.</li>
            <li> Zaditor eye drops are helping my allergy eyes and saved money by ordering this product online.  Quick ship and great price.  I will order this product again online.</li>
            <li> This stuff burns like hell, but only for a few seconds, and then you are free as a bird. I&#x27;ve never tried any other eye-drop that eliminates the itchiness this fast. You tend to take note how fast an eye-drop works when you are wanting to rip out your eyeballs out from allergies and you don&#x27;t have anything around. This could purely my imagination, but it appears to alleviate other allergy symptoms as well.</li>
            <li> Very nice product for my pet&#x27;s eye allergy.</li>
            <li> Does what it says for relief of them eyes. Just very small bottle for price.</li>
            <li> IHave used Zaditor for 2 years as I habve had catarac surgery and my eyes are quite sensitive.  Works great.</li>
            <li> I have pretty bad allergies that affect my eyes to the point where it is actually difficult to see due to goop in my eyes.  I bought these  particular eye drops because they only contain the anti-histamine and not the \\&quot;anti-redness\\&quot; chemical that can cause high blood pressure and that chemical seems to make my eyes feel \\&quot;tired\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, it turns out that the redness goes away on it&#x27;s own after a little while when I just treat the allergies with the Zaditor. So you may not even need the other chemical anyways if the issue is allergies.  And my eyes feel less \\&quot;tired.\\&quot;  My eye doctor was also pleased. He was concerned when I mentioned the use of the other eye drops, and less so about these.</li>
            <li> work well. But is too expensive.  On the plus side I do not need to use this often. Overall product works; price is too high. Also, did not receive detailed information and directions with my order. I had to search online. Item as received was not in a cardboard box package.</li>
            <li> Actually, I don&#x27;t find this to be any better than Alaway.  Both sting when I put in the drops, but both give me relief from itching all day long.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from allergies and have itchy eyes like I do, it is the WORST!  This stuff is like magic, one drop in each eye and you have immediate relief, it really works!</li>
            <li> Zaditor is one of the best brand drops out there for relieving red eyes and itching eyes too.  Amazon&#x27;s price is cheaper than local drugstores.</li>
            <li> Really works for itchy eyes</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this brand, Zaditor, by my vet - my dog&#x27;s doctor, because my little dog has allergy and it makes her eyes run causing the fur below her eyes to stain. I got this bottle from the local drug store, and used it on my dog for a week or two. It didn&#x27;t work on her, and I stopped. She didn&#x27;t show any discomfort in the eyes when I used it on her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have been using the prescription eye drops for allergy (I.e. feels like my eyes are dry but I don&#x27;t have dry eyes) that costs me $50 out of pocket for a 1/4 of the size of this bottle of Zaditor, I decided to try it on myself. I have tried it a few times occasionally, and each time, the one drop I put in my eye burns my eye. My eye was in so much pain that I can&#x27;t keep it open. My eye would water. After about 10-15 seconds, seemed like forever, the burning went away, but my eye would continue to feel irritated and slightly achy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving it a 3 stars because I can&#x27;t truly test this product because of it burns my eyes. I don&#x27;t want to give it a 1 or 2 stars, because that would be unfair since I didn&#x27;t get to test this product. I read most of the reviews, and no complaints on burning in the eye. I am rarely sensitive to anything, and I am really surprised I have the side effect.</li>
            <li> I have terrible seasonal allergies that affect my eyes the most.  I also have allergies to pets that have the same reaction...miserable itchy watery eyes. It helps with the sneezing too. This works in minutes! I&#x27;ve tried Patanol in the past and this only mildly controlled my symptoms. I&#x27;ve been using Zaditor for years now when ever my itchy eyes return...I Zap them with a drop of Zaditor and they are gone! The drops are long lasting too which is nice.  One drop in each eye lasts me all day. All I have to say is AHHHH relief at last!</li>
            <li> It only took a &amp;#34;couple&amp;#34; of applications to get rid of an itching eye allergy caused by grass cutting this time of year in southern california. It also greatly reduced the sticky eye problem associated with it.</li>
            <li> I get speedy relief from itching eyes (allergy, etc), and this is almost as good as a prescription eye drop.</li>
            <li> My insurance stopped covering my prescription Lastacaft and this was recommended as an alternative.  It&#x27;s not quite a effective but works reasonable well and is much much cheaper than Lastacaft.</li>
            <li> My eye doctor recommended two kinds of eye drops.  Trying both.  These work great for my symptoms.  Mild dryness due to allergies.  Try them.  I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Jamie</li>
            <li> My dog has allergies and the vet recommended this product.  The vet suggested that I give her one drop in each one or two times a day as needed.  The dog tolerates the frogs and they help relieve some of her allergy symptoms.</li>
            <li> I usually take Claritan for seasonal allergies and find it helpful, but struggle, nevertheless, with burning, itching eyes during allergy season. This stuff provided immediate relief, and the relief was long-lasting. I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Zaditor Eye Relief 5ml (01.7 fl oz) is very good.  My eyes feel so much better within five minutes.  I use it in one eye if it itches.  Don&#x27;t have to use it in both.  Only the one eye that is itchy.  I keep buying when needed.</li>
            <li> I bought these drops after searching online for something that would help a tearing eye in the corner and a bit of itching. These did the trick with one drop. Very happy I tried them.</li>
            <li> I found it to be grossly overpriced..I have used similar products costing much less that worked just as well for my itchy yes.</li>
            <li> Works for me but marginally. I don&#x27;t think the expense justifies the product.  It is quite expensive for me in retirement.</li>
            <li> I have allergies that make my vision cloudy with mucus buildup. My eye doctor suggested I use Ketotifen, and suggested Zaditor by name, but said anything containing Ketotifen would work the same. I checked it out, and Zaditor is quite expensive for only 0.17 fluid ounces per tiny bottle. Even Target&#x27;s Up &amp; Up generic was only a couple bucks cheaper. Thankfully, sitting on the shelf right next to them, was Bausch &amp; Lomb Alaway. It also contains Ketotifen, but the bottle is exactly double the size, and contains 0.34 fluid ounces. It costs about the same as the other 2, but you get twice as much, so you do the math! I gave the stuff a whirl, and it works! After only a few days, the cloudiness in my eyes cleared up! After a few weeks, I stopped using the Ketotifen eye drops because I figured the problem had cleared up. ....Nope. The cloudiness slowly began to return, so I started back up on the Ketotifen eye drops and now use them regularly. Yeah, Ketotifen is expensive no matter what brand you get, but it does work, so it&#x27;s worth it. The box says Ketotifen is primarily for itchy eyes, but I really don&#x27;t have that problem. I&#x27;m just trusting my eye doctor&#x27;s advice, and what I literally experienced with my own 2 eyes. This stuff works!</li>
            <li> this eye drop works really well compared to other types of allergy eye drop, but it&#x27;s just more expensive than others.</li>
            <li> Itchy eyes are distracting and make it impossible to wear my contacts.&lt;br /&gt;This solves the problem. and prescription no longer needed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had very sensitive eyes and these are the only drops I have ever used that help! My eye doctor recommended I try a new drop, but I ended up coming back to these.</li>
            <li> Used it many times before, doctor recommended and am using it now again  wonderful day in the neighbor hood yeah</li>
            <li> Since I have allergic conjunctivitis and am allergic to conventional meds for this, these drops were able to soothe and help the redness and itchiness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having increasing difficulty with itchy eyes and it affected my wearing of contact lenses, so my eye doctor suggested Zaditor over the expensive Pat-A-Day drops she normally prescribes.  I&#x27;m never going back to Pat-A-Day!  I have every kind of allergy there is and my eyes are constantly itchy and red and irritated--Zaditor cures that problem.  I put in a few drops and it feels as if it coats my eyes, instantly refreshing them, whereas Pat-A-Day felt like I was putting water in my eyes and didn&#x27;t help whatsoever.  Of course, it so good that I can barely find Zaditor at drugstores when I need it so it&#x27;s good to know that Amazon sells it.</li>
            <li> I suffer from eye allergies and started out with a really bad year. I was unable to wear my contact lenses due to allergic conjunctivitis.  My doctor prescribed Pataday which grossly expensive and did nothing. I had blurred vision and itchy eyes due to my allergies. Finally after 4 months of suffering. He recommended Zaditor!!!  OMG instant relief. I was really surprised and did not think it would solve my problem. I use Zaditor everyday and finally started wearing my contacts. My eye allergies were really bad. The watery eyes, and other problems went away within 2 days!!!  I&#x27;m also allergic to pets.  It takes care of this problem. I&#x27;ve told everyone about Zaditor. It doesn&#x27;t burn when I use it. I&#x27;ve read some users had this issue. I use it first thing in the morning before putting in my contacts. Great product! . It&#x27;s actually cheaper at Target and they gave me a coupon for $3.50 next purchase. Compared to Pataday  &amp; Patanol , this product works better and works better!!!</li>
            <li> To be honest, I am a little disappointed in this product for the price, and given the fact it used to be available by prescription only.  I actually think Visine allergy eye drops are more effective, especially considering they are half the cost.  Zaditor does provide some relief, but if your eyes get really itchy as mine do, I am not sure they&#x27;re strong enough, nor is it lasting.  But everyone may be different!</li>
            <li> Some eye drops have a preservative that can cause some people&#x27;s eyes to dilate. These drops don&#x27;t have that preservative. Have used several times with no problems and they seem to work really well with eye itchiness.</li>
            <li> My right eye (and only my right eye!) has always been so dry and itchy. It feels like I&#x27;ve gotten shampoo in my eye all of the time and I&#x27;m constantly rubbing it. I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything I could think of to relieve the discomfort, and even went to an eye doctor who did some tests and told me nothing was wrong with it. I had given up, and then a friend suggested these eye drops. I immediately ordered them and as soon as I received the package in the mail I ripped it open and put a drop in my right eye. Wow... the first thing I&#x27;ve ever tried that worked! I won&#x27;t say my eye felt 100% better, but it feels so much better that I&#x27;m not rubbing it. I will definitely keep using this product!</li>
