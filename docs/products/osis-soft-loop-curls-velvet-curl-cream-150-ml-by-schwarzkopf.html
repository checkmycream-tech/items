            <li> a cream, but has a little bit more &amp;#34;stickyness&amp;#34; in your hands than your average cream.</li>
            <li> Then I pick around at my curls and blow it dry on low.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on your hair but works really well.  </li>
            <li> Initially the curls are too stiff and separate but by second day they are&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soft</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and this product helps to tame it slightly.</li>

            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the bottle is small</li>
            <li> I use this about every other day, and use a defrizzing product the day in between.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time even though it is a small container.</li>
            <li> Try mixing a little bit of this with a drop of Moroccan oil.</li>
            <li> people might think the price is a little steep</li>
            <li> I usually use a nickel sized amount in the palm of my hand, rub my hands together, and apply to my hair all over.</li>
            <li> It defines your curls without making them hard rock as some mouse or gel tends to do.</li>
            <li> Not good for my hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and it doesn&#x27;t smell awful.</li>

            <li> Initially the curls are too stiff and separate but by second day they are&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soft and well formed...so a 4 instead of a 5 rating</li>
            <li> I love this product! It smells amazing and it helps give my wavy/straight hair that extra curl boost. Great for thicker hair as well to help hold curl better.</li>
            <li> Great smelling product use very little!This really holds the hair in place. You will need a defrizzer to go with it for wavy frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. It is great for wet hair, damp hair, or dry hair. I love using it for &amp;#34;second day&amp;#34; styling. I am Caucasian and have 3a/3b curly hair with medium thickness and low porosity. My hair is very prone to dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a cream, but has a little bit more &amp;#34;stickyness&amp;#34; in your hands than your average cream. It feels soft in the hair (hence the name) but with awesome control. I am sure that seems contradictory, and I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it will give you control like a gel without the hardness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of those go to products that you can use on its own (I always use leave-in conditioner though) or in combination with other products. I use it as part of my regime (in this order: leave-in, anti-frizz serum, Schwarzkopf Upload volumizing serum, Soft Loop, and Schwarzkopf Twin Curl).</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and this product helps to tame it slightly. I love it. Rub it in your hands a but and then apply to freshly washed/conditioned/rinsed hair. Voila.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for people with curly hair in areas that have medium-high humidity.  Put it on after toweling hair dry and the frizz is gone, leaving just nice soft and shiny curls.</li>
            <li> I tried this because I couldn&#x27;t find &amp;#34;Pump My Curls&amp;#34; which I really LOVED.  This cream is a bit heavier, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Nice soft curls. Wish it was a bit more stiff though.</li>
            <li> This item was exactly as described and shipped quickly. I&#x27;m about to order from them again. The product is a fave if mine after my salon introduced it to me then stopped carrying it. It really keeps my hair in nice soft batches without any frizz. Love it.</li>
            <li> Too soft.  Not good for my hair.</li>
            <li> This hair cream is amazing. Absolutely amazing.  It leaves my hair soft and bouncy. And it holds all day! Love it.</li>
            <li> Love it!! I mix with Body me and my curls last for ever.</li>
            <li> Second time buying this for my Bf. Moulds the curl, he said it could be a little softer, but finds by the end of the day the curls soften and look much better.</li>
            <li> My wife likes this product. Kind of gives a wet look, my wife&#x27;s hair looks great. She loves Osis products.</li>
            <li> This product is one of my favorite products.  A little goes a long way and It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on your hair but works really well.  It smells terrific!!!  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the bottle is small and I have to buy it often.</li>
            <li> Helps hair curl just a bit</li>
            <li> Try mixing a little bit of this with a drop of Moroccan oil. Works nicely on it&#x27;s own, too.</li>
            <li> My wife loved the product. It enchances curls and it&#x27;s non sticky.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! It really makes my curls look healthy.</li>
            <li> The Schwarzkopf Osis Soft Loop Velvet Curl Cream was first used on me by my hairdresser.  I decided to buy it. I think it helps my hair curl, although, I have yet to find a product which really does a good job of that. It is not sticky or stiff on my hair but affords it some hold of the curls.&lt;br /&gt;The price was good, it arrived quickly from the vendor I purchased from.

The hair has to be damp or wet to use this best.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> If you have curly hair and love to wear it down and free this stuff is wonderful! :D It defines your curls without making them hard rock as some mouse or gel tends to do. :D&lt;br /&gt;My hair has a tendency to frizz, but this stuff seems to work well both in humid climate and dry.&lt;br /&gt;Some people might think the price is a little steep but it is quite worth it!</li>
            <li> Great hair product for curly and frizzy hair.  It takes away some of the frizz. Recommended by my hair stylist.</li>
            <li> The product added no body and did not enhance curls.  It actually caused my hair to become limp.  Just my experience.</li>
            <li> Love this curl cream, it takes away the frizziness, and doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff and sticky. A little goes a long way, and it doesn&#x27;t smell awful.</li>
            <li> love it...for the first time in a long time, my curls are back.  Wash, put the Osis Soft Loop cream on and go.</li>
            <li> soft loops - just like the name. It holds curls and manages to soften my hair with shine and body. The smell is &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; and improved with a drop or two of moroccan oil or schwartzkopf  oil although it is a salon trick to double up on products to increase sales/profit. OSIS - only sold in salons - products are expensive in salons and reasonable here.</li>
