            <li>Perfect for dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li>Perhaps one of the best conditioners I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended by my hair stylist after I changed my hair color from dark brown to brown-blonde ombre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>

            <li>I get highlights every 3-4 months and it keeps my hair smooth</li>
            <li>can smell it long after you get out of the shower and style your hair (its a pleasant smell &#x3D;))&lt;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey but very worth it.</li>
            <li>All of the products make my hair feel so nurished and clean.</li>
            <li>Guess it&#x27;s true what they say;</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li>So far so good, it has kept my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Will continue to buy more, and will probably try a few more of their products!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far better than I thought.</li>
            <li>The smell is quite nice and one of the only drawbacks is the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li>Not as good as other reviews.  </li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>The price is right too compared to retail.</li>
            <li>conditioner makes my hair extremely soft and noticeably reduces frizz but rinses easily without leaving hair greasy or waxy.  </li>
            <li>I use the shampoo and conditioner together, and I highly recommend that because these products are meant to be used together and need to be because  together they reach the the full effect of this set.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, but didn&#x27;t condition as well as expected.</li>
            <li>Like you just put a basket of hot doughnuts on your hair.</li>
            <li>I bought the oil as well and the combination makes my hair silky soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a mediocre conditioner with a great smell!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money to me to have decent looking hair.</li>
            <li>I would love to give this conditioner five stars; however, it did not provide as much hydration for my hair as I was ultimately looking for.</li>
            <li>It definitely does not seem to be moisturizing, and I have more tangles than normal.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair super soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair smooth but not flat.  </li>
            <li>I never write product reviews, but this stuff is the real deal for me.</li>
            <li>It has eased the straw-like texture and I am so much happier with my curls.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need much to do the job.  </li>
            <li>Really revitalizes hair without leaving it greasy.  </li>
            <li>This product was recommended by my stylist since I had a Brazilian blow out and was only allowed sulfate free hair products.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair and a lot of it.</li>
            <li>After shampooing, and putting all those chemicals in my hair, it feel super course, but after I put this stuff in and rinse it out, my hair feels soft as silk, completely changed.</li>
            <li>What I love most about that brand is the wonderful scent it has, and the conditioner I bought had a weird unpleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair real soft.</li>
            <li>Probably about 6 months, and it&#x27;s still got a good month left (keep in mind, I wash my hair every other day to every three days, since I have very dry, non-oily hair).</li>
            <li>I am enjoying using this conditioner on my very dry grey hair.</li>
            <li>It is not only good for dry hair, but it helps tame any frizz in humid weather while bringing up the curl.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if it was an old bottle that was out of date or what, but it is now sitting in my cabinet</li>
            <li>It make my colored hair feel soft and undamaged.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Yes, I obviously will be a repeat buyer and highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Made my coarse hair much softer.</li>
            <li>I recommend these products for anyone with dry hair that is naturally curly (but not thin; otherwise it mighty weigh hair down).</li>
            <li>Top of the bottle is different (orange) than previous (white), and outside of bottle has some type of film/dirt(?)</li>
            <li>I smell like cheap perfume for at least a day or two after using this.</li>
            <li>A young beautician with long flowing curls recommended it to me.</li>
            <li>this beats out other high end product lines like Bumble &amp; Bumble and Kerastase.</li>
            <li>Has made my hair so much healthier and less frizzy.</li>

            <li> Has made my hair so much healthier and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m blond but regularly have highlights and lowlights done along with regular blow drying and flat ironing.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels soft, looks less frizzy, and is overall lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Try Moroccanoil  hair oil before flat ironing to make your hair shine and protect from heat damage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I got to keep my long locks.</li>
            <li> Product is a different color than that of a previous purchase of same product.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the only conditioners that keeps my dry hair from feeling rough.</li>
            <li> have very long hair, almost at my belly button,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> I have course, curly hair and spend a lot of time in the ocean and my hair often felt like dry straw until I tried the Moroccan Oil product line.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t weight it down or make it seem flat or oily.</li>
            <li> It is quite pricey for such a small container, but I will continue to purchase this conditioner.</li>
            <li> so i am very careful on what type of shampoo and conditioner i use.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I used one of the other formulations before (there are at least three Moroccan conditioners), but in any event this is not nearly as good as my first bottle purchased a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> I have dry, thick, wavy, fizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Smell is a little too perfumey.</li>
            <li> There has been little to no change in shine or frizz</li>
            <li> It was well packaged, and there was a little piece of tape to keep the tab from opening.</li>
            <li> I have a few extensions in my hair</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t need to use a lot.&lt;br /&gt;A small amount</li>
            <li> The Morrocan Oil Conditioner I purchased was not at all like the ones I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recognize it&#x27;s fake until my hair become very dry and lost shine like before.</li>
            <li> I seriously get compliments on my hair now</li>
            <li> I have terrible dry hair and have had a hard time finding its line.  </li>
            <li> but a bit too expensive and overrated.</li>
            <li> (but it&#x27;s probably just my hair, because it&#x27;s seriously the worst hair).</li>
            <li> Maybe just a bad bottle...</li>
            <li> I am disappointed as I received the incorrect product.</li>

            <li> Best conditioner I have used ever! But based on this price, I probably won&#x27;t re-order.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is great !! Second bottle i use .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far better than I thought. Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Not as good as other reviews.  Was looking for mor of a cream conditioner.  Smell is a little too perfumey.</li>
            <li> Maybe I used one of the other formulations before (there are at least three Moroccan conditioners), but in any event this is not nearly as good as my first bottle purchased a few years ago.  It definitely does not seem to be moisturizing, and I have more tangles than normal.  Maybe just a bad bottle...</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, but didn&#x27;t condition as well as expected.</li>
            <li> I would love to give this conditioner five stars; however, it did not provide as much hydration for my hair as I was ultimately looking for. Now, that may be my hair&#x27;s fault because this conditioner has helped to strengthen and bring back health to my hair. The smell is quite nice and one of the only drawbacks is the size of the bottle. It is quite pricey for such a small container, but I will continue to purchase this conditioner. I do wish Moroccan Oil would come out with a leave-in conditioner!</li>
            <li> Perhaps one of the best conditioners I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended by my hair stylist after I changed my hair color from dark brown to brown-blonde ombre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need to use a lot.&lt;br /&gt;A small amount can go a lonnnnnnnnng way.&lt;br /&gt;I have very long hair, almost at my belly button,&lt;br /&gt;and I use about 2 quarter sized squirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t over moisture. My hair feels soft, looks less frizzy, and is overall lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;You can smell it long after you get out of the shower and style your hair (its a pleasant smell &#x3D;))&lt;br /&gt;A good conditioner for anyone with thirsty hair.</li>
            <li> I like how my hair feels but the scent is overpowering. I smell like cheap perfume for at least a day or two after using this.</li>
            <li> Product is a different color than that of a previous purchase of same product.  Top of the bottle is different (orange) than previous (white), and outside of bottle has some type of film/dirt(?) on it.  Am wondering why the difference, though product does feel the same on the hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Mostly use away from scalp.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing but I am used to using Deva Curl and that&#x27;s a much better product for detangling. This is more than 3 times the price of Deva Curl. I use Moroccan Oil hair oil &amp; like that much better.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it. It&#x27;s fake.&lt;br /&gt;The smell and the print on the bottle all different from what I used before. I don&#x27;t recognize it&#x27;s fake until my hair become very dry and lost shine like before.</li>
            <li> I never write product reviews, but this stuff is the real deal for me. I have course, curly hair and spend a lot of time in the ocean and my hair often felt like dry straw until I tried the Moroccan Oil product line. It&#x27;s a night and day difference and I have people telling me every day how great I smell!&lt;br /&gt;For me this beats out other high end product lines like Bumble &amp; Bumble and Kerastase.</li>
            <li> even if you are not using the moroccan oil shampoo, this is the best hydration conditioner i &#x27;ve had! my hair feels soft and looks beautiful!</li>
            <li> The Morrocan Oil Conditioner I purchased was not at all like the ones I have used in the past.  What I love most about that brand is the wonderful scent it has, and the conditioner I bought had a weird unpleasant scent. I tried shaking it to mix it better hoping that would help, but it didn&#x27;t. Don&#x27;t know if it was an old bottle that was out of date or what, but it is now sitting in my cabinet and I bought something else. I should have sent it back but I used it a couple of times to see if the scent would appear, so I just stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells so nice.  It makes my hair smooth but not flat.  I have a few extensions in my hair so i am very careful on what type of shampoo and conditioner i use.  This one is perfect.</li>
            <li> The formula has been changed.</li>
            <li> Nice gentle conditioner. Good for color treated hair. Does not disappoint as all their products are so very excellent. Leaves hair real soft.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner and I can&#x27;t find it anywhere else. It make my colored hair feel soft and undamaged. I&#x27;ve converted two friends over to this, everyone who uses it loves it!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  Takes out the tangles, leaves hair smooth and not &amp;#34;weighed down&amp;#34;.  I have received many comments on the wonderful scent it leaves in your hair as well.</li>
            <li> great product. leaved my hair smelling awesome and feeling silky soft</li>
            <li> Perfect for dry and damaged hair. Has made my hair so much healthier and less frizzy. Might also have to do with the products I use after the shower but I still see results with just this product. I use the shampoo and conditioner together, and I highly recommend that because these products are meant to be used together and need to be because  together they reach the the full effect of this set.</li>
            <li> This is some good stuff right hurr! I have only used it for a week but my hair felt softer after one use. It has eased the straw-like texture and I am so much happier with my curls. Will continue to buy more, and will probably try a few more of their products!</li>
            <li> Moroccanoil products are amazing- I&#x27;m blond but regularly have highlights and lowlights done along with regular blow drying and flat ironing.  My hair is fried...&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner makes my hair extremely soft and noticeably reduces frizz but rinses easily without leaving hair greasy or waxy.  Try Moroccanoil  hair oil before flat ironing to make your hair shine and protect from heat damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the smell, it&#x27;s olfactory (nose senses) heaven:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I obviously will be a repeat buyer and highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner. Was recommended by my stylist as the best detangler</li>
            <li> This conditioner is HEAVENLY!  I am a &amp;#34;live and die&amp;#34; Aveda fan, but I&#x27;ve started adding this hydrating conditioner and the oil and they are perfect.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever bought. I have dry, thick, wavy, fizzy hair. After shampooing, and putting all those chemicals in my hair, it feel super course, but after I put this stuff in and rinse it out, my hair feels soft as silk, completely changed. When my hair dries, it&#x27;s softer than it would be without it. There has been little to no change in shine or frizz (but it&#x27;s probably just my hair, because it&#x27;s seriously the worst hair). This conditioner literally smells like doughnuts. Like you just put a basket of hot doughnuts on your hair. It&#x27;s the best smelling conditioner ever. I smelled the scent before (not at a bakery shop), and I&#x27;ve always wanted to know where it came from, and now I found it!! I&#x27;ve had this conditioner forever, too. Probably about 6 months, and it&#x27;s still got a good month left (keep in mind, I wash my hair every other day to every three days, since I have very dry, non-oily hair). It was well packaged, and there was a little piece of tape to keep the tab from opening. I&#x27;ll mostly likely buy this again. I just don&#x27;t like the price, which was why I gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Great product for very curly corse hair.</li>
            <li> It works lovely...but a bit too expensive and overrated. Its equivalent to your lical beauty supply or drug store conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair and a lot of it. It is prone to tangles. I have tried so many options, but they have all failed. I thought I was going to have to cut my hair shorter. I bought this product based on reviews and I am very happy I did so. It has made all the difference for me. I bought the oil as well and the combination makes my hair silky soft and tangle free. I seriously get compliments on my hair now and I got to keep my long locks. I just wish it was cheaper. Guess it&#x27;s true what they say; don&#x27;t look a gift horse in the mouth...</li>
            <li> I am disappointed as I received the incorrect product. Ordered the hydrating conditioner and received volumizing conditioner. Not what I needed!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product. It smells good and I don&#x27;t have to use a lot, but I don&#x27;t feel that it gives enough moisture to my hair. It almost leaves it too oily. Thankfully I don&#x27;t need to condition my hair daily, and I usually only use it on the ends. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this if I had to use conditioner daily, but it works for my needs.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Don&#x27;t need much to do the job.  Really revitalizes hair without leaving it greasy.  The price is right too compared to retail.</li>
            <li> I love these products.  I have terrible dry hair and have had a hard time finding its line.  It works.</li>
            <li> This is one of the only conditioners that keeps my dry hair from feeling rough. I get highlights every 3-4 months and it keeps my hair smooth but it doesn&#x27;t weight it down or make it seem flat or oily. I&#x27;ve been buying this along with the shampoo for quite awhile and will continue to. It&#x27;s worth the money to me to have decent looking hair.</li>
            <li> This works so well with my coarse wavy hair. This product was recommended by my stylist since I had a Brazilian blow out and was only allowed sulfate free hair products. So far so good, it has kept my hair soft and smooth. It&#x27;s a bit pricey but very worth it.</li>
            <li> I love how this makes my hair feel and it makes my hair smell wonderful!  Many people notice and comment on it.</li>
            <li> Great hydrating shampoo.  Made my coarse hair much softer.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying using this conditioner on my very dry grey hair. A young beautician with long flowing curls recommended it to me. It is not only good for dry hair, but it helps tame any frizz in humid weather while bringing up the curl. It is also good as a styling agent coaxing curls and waves to stay where you want them. I will continue using this product and see what the long-term effects are. It has a pleasant fragrance too.</li>
            <li> Great for tangled hair. Love the smell.</li>
            <li> What a great conditioner (love the shampoo too). Leaves my hair super soft and hydrated. I recommend these products for anyone with dry hair that is naturally curly (but not thin; otherwise it mighty weigh hair down).</li>
            <li> It is good, smells good and very helpful for my hair dryness problem. it was recommended by my hair stylist</li>
            <li> it sure does smell great but I&#x27;m still looking for that one product that wows! I have wavy curly hair and lots of it and bought this based on the reviews but it&#x27;s a mediocre conditioner with a great smell!</li>
            <li> best shampoo and conditioner ever!</li>
            <li> I have switched to the Morrocan Oil line and I am very pleased with the change.  All of the products make my hair feel so nurished and clean. Love it</li>
