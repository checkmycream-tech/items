    <ol>
            <li>This is the BEST moisturizer on the market.  </li>
            <li>Excellent item, thank you......</li>
            <li>like I had a layer of plastic coating on my skin but Aveeno Creamy Moisturizing Oil seems to be perfect.  </li>
            <li>I received the product within the time promised and in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>Aveeno lotion is the best, it&#x27;s not greasy and not watery!  </li>
            <li>Very good, like this product</li>
            <li>Very good lotion.</li>
            <li>Softens, moisturizes, leaves no greasy or waxy feel - melts into the skin like buttah LOL.</li>
            <li>Aveeno products are great to use in the drying desert area I reside in.  </li>
            <li>One application after a morning shower and shave and i&#x27;m good to go all day.</li>
            <li>I too have LOVED this product and have been using it for almost 2 years.  </li>
            <li>This is the best of both worlds, and it has a delightful clean, light fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lotion!</li>
            <li>smooth and feels great on skin not greasy</li>
            <li>I also recommended it to my own mother, and she loves it as well.</li>
            <li>This body moisturizer smells nice and gives a nice glow to the skin without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>The liquid soap at the office is so drying, so I started bringing my own.  </li>
            <li>Totally satisfied with price as well because I have paid much more for a good cream.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Nice light scent!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best lotions I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>Love love love this!</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I also love the scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>:) I even get it for my mother for every Christmas or birthday or Mother&#x27;s Day. :)</li>
            <li>I just love this creamy lotion.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s an excellent product that I can&#x27;t get locally.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of the this lotion and the fact that it has moisturizing oils.  </li>
            <li>soo glad I bought this..</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, keeps your skin moist without being greasy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s still available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>although probably a little to greasy for most, i like the feel that my skins is being nourished to its best</li>
            <li>He says that the product keeps his hands from drying out and it doesn&#x27;t easily wash off.</li>
            <li>I love that it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my hands greasy</li>
            <li>Smells pretty pleasant and clean not so much of the scent but more of the smooth creamy feel.</li>
            <li>This is a really excellent product - a moisturizer that provides comforting softness to your skin without being greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li>Not greasy and dries smooth on your body.</li>
            <li>This product is like a miracle, goes on so easily and absorbs quickly ...</li>
            <li>It does, however, do a great job of relieving the dryness and accompanying itchiness that comes with frequent hand washing in hot water with institutional soap.</li>
            <li>Friendly to sensitve skin.</li>
            <li>, it works, it doesn&#x27;t feel like oil or plastic, it has that familiar oatmeal scent.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves your skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>So far, this has been my best and longest lasting solution.  </li>
            <li>As someone with strong allergies towards scents, I have to be careful with product choices, and this has pleasant neutral scent that doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies, and if my boyfriend finds himself in need of lotion this scent isn&#x27;t offputting or girly to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hard to find one that does all that, but this one is perfect!  </li>
            <li>Oil whipped up into a super lightweight and instantly absorbed souffle!</li>
            <li>but it soaks into the skin nicely while leaving a moist appearance to the skin which lasts pretty much all day.  </li>
            <li>My dry skin has improved remarkably.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bit over 7 months pregnant now</li>
            <li>Your skin is smooth and silky to touch after use of this, and the light almond scent is very pleasing.  </li>
            <li>It has an amazing scent as well that make it a total winner.  </li>
            <li>Love this Moisturiser and use it in conjunction with the &amp;#34;Aveeno Shower and Bath Oil with Natural Soothing Oatmeal&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It absorbs right in and feels so light, yet leaves my hands feeling so soft.  </li>
            <li>It was a really pleasant fragrance and it makes my dry scaly skin suuuper soft.  </li>
            <li>The scent is light and pleasant, similar to the scent of the other aveeno products.</li>
            <li>so I was looking for a good hand cream that didn&#x27;t feel heavy or leave a greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>It also has a pleasant smell that is not overwhelming or fruity.</li>
            <li>It does make my hands super soft though being 5.5 PH.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for a friend who has certain skin allergies.</li>
            <li>will be shopping for a new moisturizer TOMORROW!!</li>
            <li>This cream/oil is AMAZING and the ONLY one that does not dry skin out.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll experiment by adding quick absorbing, natural oil into it to see if that</li>
            <li>I tried this one and was amazed by how much softer my skin felt.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used products that are much more expensive yet never gotten such a great result.</li>
            <li>would cost me as much as the product itself.</li>
            <li>With -80 windchill and 175 mph winds, skin care is an absolute must here.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had very itchy skin.</li>
            <li>Application feels very luxurious and I wondered whether it would be too emollient</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin moisturized, silky and gives you a fresh, natural scent.</li>
            <li>Pleasant subtle fragrance.</li>
            <li>Good for someone allergic to strong artificial scent like me~</li>
            <li>Despite the product name, the reason I like this particular variety is that it doesn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling oily or goopy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Fabulous for dry skin!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll also use it on my legs after shaving and on any other dry/itchy patches I might have on my skin and the oatmeal in it really does seem to help calm the itching.</li>
            <li>When I first used it, my knuckles were actually so cracked they were bleeding and that cleared up in one day of use.  </li>
            <li>Aveeno is the only mfgr that I&#x27;m aware of that scents their lotion with almond.</li>
            <li>Exact to description definitely not sticky and leaves your skin soft and moisturized..</li>
            <li>far, I like this Aveeno creamy moisturizing oil a little better than the aforementioned product.  </li>
            <li>It feels like silk going on and keeps my soft all day.</li>
            <li>Also quite like the natural scent of the lotion.  </li>
            <li>It has a soft, neutral scent and moisturizes without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>bought my Aveeno Creamy Moisturizing Oil at the local drugstore for too much.  </li>
            <li>I hate that you can&#x27;t get this lotion in the stores anymore by far the best Aveeno lotion they have</li>
            <li>I do not get enough moisturizing from it as I do from the normal Aveeno lotion.</li>
            <li>Really works well for sensitive skin and dry skin!</li>
            <li>This prouduct is non geasy and really keeps dry skin smooth!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Super stuff - no huge fragrance for allergies</li>
            <li>Lately, even the SebaMed which for me moisturizes much better than everything I have tried prior, isn&#x27;t emoillent enough</li>
            <li>The scent is subtle and the texture is light so you don&#x27;t feel like you have greasy all over you.</li>
            <li>I only use it on my hands/arms, trunk, and feet/legs only because I&#x27;m one of those individuals with extremely sensitive skin and everything makes me breakout.  </li>
            <li>Most others have a strong scent that is very unpleasant (for my nose that is)...</li>
            <li>and it soothes my dry OLD skin without being &amp;#34;gunky&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I like something creamier than the usual body lotion, that will moisturize more like an oil, but not too heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>This product is hard to find on shelves in my area, on the rare occasion</li>
            <li>As long as I use it consistently, it gets rid of those little bumps on the back of my arms!</li>

            <li> As long as I use it consistently, it gets rid of those little bumps on the back of my arms!</li>
            <li> It dries quickly, no greasy residue, keeps me moisturized well, keeps the itchiness away and so far no stretch marks!</li>
            <li> While my moisturizing soap keeps my hands from being as dry, they are still in need of lasting moisture.  </li>
            <li> I continued to use it all year long, even in the summer.</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase this product as long as my spouse uses it.</li>
            <li> I have been spending tons of money for hand creams that are supposed to be lasting, thick and creamy but so far they have all fallen short.  </li>
            <li> the dry winter air won&#x27;t bother my skin this year as long as I keep using this lotion.</li>
            <li> They get so dry that they crack and hurt</li>
            <li> I like the shine that this gives, however, it tends to leave my skin dry after days of use.  </li>
            <li> whatever I thought I knew about dry skin, chapped lips, and winterburn, I&#x27;ve had to forget and learn from scratch.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to people with itchy dry skin.</li>
            <li> and I use it on my rough dry cracked feet.</li>
            <li> I am suffering with very dry skin as a result of cancer radiation etc .  </li>
            <li> I suffer from dry cracked hands and this product does not sting my hands as other brands do.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using this for the last few months on my belly to avoid stretch marks and itchiness.  </li>
            <li> Not as expected in oil form.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazon stopped offering this as a Subscribe and Save option a few months back, and now they don&#x27;t stock it themselves.</li>
            <li> I started using Aveeno Active Naturals Creamy Moisturizing Oil last winter after my skin dried out.</li>
            <li> Usually, I don&#x27;t get through one bottle of any product before I move on, however, I just purchased my third bottle of this.  </li>
            <li> contained in this product and their connection to cancers and other health issues.  </li>
            <li> I prefer to buy it online, as not many local stores stock it.</li>
            <li> This variety of Aveeno lotion has become hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> It is actually the least greasy lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Amazon lists it for about 40% less</li>
            <li> I still have to apply it between hand washings but a little less often.  </li>
            <li> I have 3 cats and one little shihtzu that is piddle pad trained</li>
            <li> I have tried everything having trouble for a few years and the Dermotologist introduced me to it.  </li>
            <li> you, it&#x27;s not heavy or greasy and it doesn&#x27;t make putting clothes on after application difficult.  </li>
            <li> Now, instead of being so dry they hurt, they&#x27;re just uncomfortable dry.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this without hesitation, especially if your skin is uncomfortable in the wintertime.</li>
            <li> I decided I was done with expensive, fragranced moisturizers I could only find at the department stores.  </li>
            <li> use Aveeno products but some items are hard to find.</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been using them together</li>
            <li> It is difficult to understand how Johnson &amp; Johnson can put these chemicals into the Aveeno \\&quot;Active</li>
            <li> (I HATE having greasy hands) but still leaves my hands feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Since then, the price has increasingly gone up and now is what I consider pretty outrageous.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate creams and lotions because of the sticky-ness hence the reason i decided trying this product...</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a bit over 7 months pregnant now and I&#x27;ve been using this for the last few months on my belly to avoid stretch marks and itchiness.  It dries quickly, no greasy residue, keeps me moisturized well, keeps the itchiness away and so far no stretch marks!</li>
            <li> Very good, like this product</li>
            <li> This is the BEST moisturizer on the market.  I had ezcema and since then use only Aveeno product.  This cream/oil is AMAZING and the ONLY one that does not dry skin out.  I have tried everything having trouble for a few years and the Dermotologist introduced me to it.  This saved my hands and leg and still is!  I never want to be without it!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have 3 cats and one little shihtzu that is piddle pad trained so I wash my hands dozens of times throughout the day.  They get so dry that they crack and hurt so I was looking for a good hand cream that didn&#x27;t feel heavy or leave a greasy feeling.  Hard to find one that does all that, but this one is perfect!  It absorbs right in and feels so light, yet leaves my hands feeling so soft.  When I first used it, my knuckles were actually so cracked they were bleeding and that cleared up in one day of use.  It has an amazing scent as well that make it a total winner.  I just ordered another bottle to have in my kitchen.  Love it.  Totally satisfied with price as well because I have paid much more for a good cream.</li>
            <li> I started using Aveeno Active Naturals Creamy Moisturizing Oil last winter after my skin dried out. I tried several lotions, but nothing seemed to help. I tried this one and was amazed by how much softer my skin felt. It kept it from drying out and took care of the peeling I was experiencing. I also love the scent. I continued to use it all year long, even in the summer. I have a feeling the dry winter air won&#x27;t bother my skin this year as long as I keep using this lotion. It&#x27;s definitely my favorite lotion. I also recommended it to my own mother, and she loves it as well.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. I should buy a case of it! :) I even get it for my mother for every Christmas or birthday or Mother&#x27;s Day. :)</li>
            <li> Excellent item, thank you......</li>
            <li> I ordered two and the pump does not work on either one.</li>
            <li> I am suffering with very dry skin as a result of cancer radiation etc .  This product is like a miracle, goes on so easily and absorbs quickly ... My dry skin has improved remarkably.</li>
            <li> although probably a little to greasy for most, i like the feel that my skins is being nourished to its best</li>
            <li> smooth and feels great on skin not greasy</li>
            <li> I just love this creamy lotion. Don&#x27;t let the words moisturizing oil fool you, it&#x27;s not heavy or greasy and it doesn&#x27;t make putting clothes on after application difficult.  It was a really pleasant fragrance and it makes my dry scaly skin suuuper soft.  I only use it on my hands/arms, trunk, and feet/legs only because I&#x27;m one of those individuals with extremely sensitive skin and everything makes me breakout.  So for you acne prone users, I&#x27;m just throwing out that out there.  I just wish I could find it in stores!  I&#x27;m always worried it&#x27;s going to be discontinued.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion! Even thought it says it is an oil it is not greasy AT ALL! It is actually the least greasy lotion I have ever used. I use it as my face lotion in the morning and I use it on my rough dry cracked feet. If you can&#x27;t stand the feel of greasy lotion this is the lotion for you. It absorbs quickly and leaves your skin feeling smooth. It also has a pleasant smell that is not overwhelming or fruity.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend who has certain skin allergies. It&#x27;s a bit pricey but it&#x27;s an excellent product that I can&#x27;t get locally.</li>
            <li> Love love love this! Oil whipped up into a super lightweight and instantly absorbed souffle! Softens, moisturizes, leaves no greasy or waxy feel - melts into the skin like buttah LOL. Pleasant subtle fragrance. Friendly to sensitve skin.</li>
            <li> Aveeno is the only mfgr that I&#x27;m aware of that scents their lotion with almond. Most others have a strong scent that is very unpleasant (for my nose that is)...</li>
            <li> Very good lotion. It does not leave the greasy feel that some do.</li>
            <li> I like something creamier than the usual body lotion, that will moisturize more like an oil, but not too heavy or greasy. This is the best of both worlds, and it has a delightful clean, light fragrance. It feels like silk going on and keeps my soft all day. Even after shaving my legs; even in the winter!</li>
            <li> Super stuff - no huge fragrance for allergies and it soothes my dry OLD skin without being &amp;#34;gunky&amp;#34;. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I like the shine that this gives, however, it tends to leave my skin dry after days of use.  I do not get enough moisturizing from it as I do from the normal Aveeno lotion.</li>
            <li> This is a really excellent product - a moisturizer that provides comforting softness to your skin without being greasy or heavy. Your skin is smooth and silky to touch after use of this, and the light almond scent is very pleasing.  I&#x27;ve used products that are much more expensive yet never gotten such a great result. I recommend this without hesitation, especially if your skin is uncomfortable in the wintertime.</li>
            <li> This lotion is a staple for me. As long as I use it consistently, it gets rid of those little bumps on the back of my arms!</li>
            <li> This product contains methylparaben, propylparaben which have been shown in studies to release potentially cancer-causing chemicals. Amazon did not list these ingredients in product description.  Now I have to throw it away because to return it would cost me as much as the product itself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m stationed near the North Pole, it&#x27;s not a very humid place, so whatever I thought I knew about dry skin, chapped lips, and winterburn, I&#x27;ve had to forget and learn from scratch. With -80 windchill and 175 mph winds, skin care is an absolute must here. I trust Aveeno, it works, it doesn&#x27;t feel like oil or plastic, it has that familiar oatmeal scent. One application after a morning shower and shave and i&#x27;m good to go all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had very itchy skin. This stuff is The solution.  The oil part locks in moisture while the lotion component keeps it from leaving a greasy feeling.  I only wish they sold it in a bigger size!</li>
            <li> I love the feel of the this lotion and the fact that it has moisturizing oils.  Aveeno products are great to use in the drying desert area I reside in.  Aveeno always!</li>
            <li> This product is hard to find on shelves in my area, on the rare occasion I or my mom would see it we would buy up like 3 bottles at a time. I have just started buying it on Amazon instead. I love that it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my hands greasy (I HATE having greasy hands) but still leaves my hands feeling soft and moisturized. The scent is light and pleasant, similar to the scent of the other aveeno products. I&#x27;ll also use it on my legs after shaving and on any other dry/itchy patches I might have on my skin and the oatmeal in it really does seem to help calm the itching.</li>
            <li> Not as expected in oil form.  It&#x27;s like another moisturizer.  Also quite like the natural scent of the lotion.  Good for someone allergic to strong artificial scent like me~</li>
            <li> Love this Moisturiser and use it in conjunction with the &amp;#34;Aveeno Shower and Bath Oil with Natural Soothing Oatmeal&amp;#34;. Fabulous for dry skin! Nice light scent!</li>
            <li> I decided I was done with expensive, fragranced moisturizers I could only find at the department stores.  This body moisturizer smells nice and gives a nice glow to the skin without being greasy.  Application feels very luxurious and I wondered whether it would be too emollient but it soaks into the skin nicely while leaving a moist appearance to the skin which lasts pretty much all day.  Some moisturizers I could feel sitting on my skin all day - even once I&#x27;d get into bed at night, like I had a layer of plastic coating on my skin but Aveeno Creamy Moisturizing Oil seems to be perfect.  Usually, I don&#x27;t get through one bottle of any product before I move on, however, I just purchased my third bottle of this.  I think it&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> Ive always been a lover of Aveeno products.. I absolutely hate creams and lotions because of the sticky-ness hence the reason i decided trying this product... (as the product description advertised - not sticky)&lt;br /&gt;Was soo glad I bought this.. Exact to description definitely not sticky and leaves your skin soft and moisturized..&lt;br /&gt;I would not be buying anything else after this!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best lotions I have ever tried. It leaves your skin moisturized, silky and gives you a fresh, natural scent. The scent is subtle and the texture is light so you don&#x27;t feel like you have greasy all over you. Aveeno definitely knows skin.</li>
            <li> The liquid soap at the office is so drying, so I started bringing my own.  While my moisturizing soap keeps my hands from being as dry, they are still in need of lasting moisture.  Now, instead of being so dry they hurt, they&#x27;re just uncomfortable dry.  I have been spending tons of money for hand creams that are supposed to be lasting, thick and creamy but so far they have all fallen short.  Lately, even the SebaMed which for me moisturizes much better than everything I have tried prior, isn&#x27;t emoillent enough so I have to keep reapplying between hand washings.  It does make my hands super soft though being 5.5 PH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I like this Aveeno creamy moisturizing oil a little better than the aforementioned product.  I use it exclusively as a hand lotion.  It has a soft, neutral scent and moisturizes without feeling greasy.  I still have to apply it between hand washings but a little less often.  Lately I&#x27;ve been using them together (I start with Aveeno and end with SebaMed).  So far, this has been my best and longest lasting solution.  Maybe I&#x27;ll experiment by adding quick absorbing, natural oil into it to see if that helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my Aveeno Creamy Moisturizing Oil at the local drugstore for too much.  Amazon lists it for about 40% less so I&#x27;m ordering one for the house through Amazon.  I&#x27;m going to fill some travel sized bottles I have on hand so that I can keep some in my purse.</li>
            <li> I hate that you can&#x27;t get this lotion in the stores anymore by far the best Aveeno lotion they have</li>
            <li> I too have LOVED this product and have been using it for almost 2 years.  The Aveeno line of moisturizers was initially recommended to me by a nurse working for my plastic surgeon who was doing my breast reconstruction after cancer &amp; undergoing a mastectomy.  Unbelievably enough, I just recently found out I have another, different type of breast cancer (2nd diagnosis) and will be having another mastectomy in 2 weeks.... so IMAGINE MY SURPRISE when I just now read someone elses comment about the parabens (methyl, propyl, etc.) contained in this product and their connection to cancers and other health issues.  It is difficult to understand how Johnson &amp; Johnson can put these chemicals into the Aveeno \\&quot;Active Naturals\\&quot; line of products and OMG....  the label even says \\&quot;dermatologist recommended.\\&quot;  I am shocked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be shopping for a new moisturizer TOMORROW!!</li>
            <li> This prouduct is non geasy and really keeps dry skin smooth!&lt;br /&gt;I use Aveeno products but some items are hard to find.</li>
            <li> I suffer from dry cracked hands and this product does not sting my hands as other brands do. I recommend this product to people with itchy dry skin.</li>
            <li> A bottle of this lotion sits at my desk, next to my sink, and next to my bed.  It moisturizes without being greasy. As someone with strong allergies towards scents, I have to be careful with product choices, and this has pleasant neutral scent that doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies, and if my boyfriend finds himself in need of lotion this scent isn&#x27;t offputting or girly to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon stopped offering this as a Subscribe and Save option a few months back, and now they don&#x27;t stock it themselves. Since then, the price has increasingly gone up and now is what I consider pretty outrageous. I can buy 3 bottles at my local drugstore for this price.</li>
            <li> This variety of Aveeno lotion has become hard to find locally. I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s still available on Amazon. Despite the product name, the reason I like this particular variety is that it doesn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling oily or goopy. It does, however, do a great job of relieving the dryness and accompanying itchiness that comes with frequent hand washing in hot water with institutional soap.</li>
            <li> I buy this product for my spouse, who favors it over the Aveeno Lotion Moisturizer. He says that this product stays on with his hydrocortisone cream.He says that the product keeps his hands from drying out and it doesn&#x27;t easily wash off. Contrary to what I thought, it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue. I prefer to buy it online, as not many local stores stock it. I received the product within the time promised and in excellent condition. I will continue to purchase this product as long as my spouse uses it. I recommend this moisturizing oil to anyone needing long-lasting skin moisture.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, keeps your skin moist without being greasy</li>
            <li> Not greasy and dries smooth on your body. Smells pretty pleasant and clean not so much of the scent but more of the smooth creamy feel.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it is not greasy and it stays on all day.  I will recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Aveeno lotion is the best, it&#x27;s not greasy and not watery!  Really works well for sensitive skin and dry skin!</li>
