            <li>The wig  that came was of great quality.</li>
            <li>but all in all it is the best wig I bought worth the money</li>
            <li>Exactly as shown in photo,awesome wig for great price!</li>
            <li>This is amazing quality</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really soft (not shiny at all) and it fits perfectly.</li>
            <li>It came in on time and it is the best quality I have ever gotten it is soft.</li>
            <li>This wig is more like a Hetalia cosplay wig.</li>
            <li>It was soft, looks good, nice material.</li>
            <li>One has shorter bangs than the other which makes it perfect for Kaneki.</li>
            <li>But for the price and quality, easily overlooked.</li>
            <li>great wig just blow dry it a bit to make it a better</li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li>Awesome wig great quality for the price a little small still love it though got here</li>
            <li>It was very high quality for the price, fit well, was perfectly styled and arrived a week and a half before the quoted date.</li>
            <li>needed this wig for a Kaneki Cosplay, but I guess my dream isn&#x27;t gonna come true...</li>
            <li>or if it was normal but im satisfied with buying this.</li>
            <li>The wig I received is more of a light shade of GRAY as opposed to WHITE.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft!!!</li>
            <li>it was ok but a bit smaller to me&amp;#62;A&amp;#60;</li>
            <li>Once I put the wig safely away I found white strands from the wig on my shirt</li>
            <li>Exactly has I wanted it</li>
            <li>all messy (not much just brushed it to make it look better) and it was awesome!</li>
            <li>super early ordered it on 6th of DEC.</li>
            <li>it has a little grayish tint, but overall it&#x27;s pretty good quality</li>
            <li>good quality material, although the netting is slightly see-through in the back.</li>
            <li>It even came a week and a half before it was scheduled to :))</li>
            <li>This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered from happylifehere and let me make this clear</li>
            <li>On top of that, even with some styling the wig is rather thin and you can see the cap.</li>
            <li>Only complaint I have is that it&#x27;s more of a grey than white.</li>
            <li>but clearly the wig is GREY.</li>

            <li> But you do have have to blowdry it down to calm down the fluffyness of the hair</li>
            <li> it is too small for me, the sides of my head show too much...</li>
            <li> The hair is too long and too poofy for kaneki.</li>
            <li> Kaneki has short white hair that doesnt go past the nape.</li>
            <li> but when it arrived i was a little disappointed.it looked really short</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very noticeable, though.</li>
            <li> Item was as expected.</li>
            <li> Honesty,  its a little grey..</li>
            <li> BUT IT WAS SMALL.</li>
            <li> Very small wig and way shorter than the photo.</li>
            <li> Also hardly covers the wig cap at all!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with the false labeling of a white wig and now I am forced to hurry and find another solution.</li>

            <li> It was very high quality for the price, fit well, was perfectly styled and arrived a week and a half before the quoted date.</li>

            <li> good quality material, although the netting is slightly see-through in the back. It&#x27;s not very noticeable, though.</li>
            <li> Nothing like the picture but it works for kaneki and haise, I bought two wigs and the irony is that they&#x27;re different.  One has shorter bangs than the other which makes it perfect for Kaneki. This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered from happylifehere and let me make this clear these wigs are sorta styled already. I bought a hinata/ haikyuu cosplay wig from them and when I took it out the package it curled up by itself.</li>
            <li> This wig is perfect :D It&#x27;s really soft (not shiny at all) and it fits perfectly. This is amazing quality you should definitely get it!! It even came a week and a half before it was scheduled to :))</li>
            <li> NOT as pictured! The wig I received is more of a light shade of GRAY as opposed to WHITE. If you look at the picture I attached the label even states that it&#x27;s supposed to be WHITE but clearly the wig is GREY. On top of that, even with some styling the wig is rather thin and you can see the cap. Very disappointed with the false labeling of a white wig and now I am forced to hurry and find another solution.</li>
            <li> I like the cut and length.. my only issue is with the color~ it has a little grayish tint, but overall it&#x27;s pretty good quality</li>
            <li> Awesome wig great quality for the price a little small still love it though got here super early ordered it on 6th of DEC. Got here on the 13th of DEC. And wasn&#x27;t suppose to get here till the 2nd of Jan. So that&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li> it was ok but a bit smaller to me&amp;#62;A&amp;#60;</li>
            <li> Very small wig and way shorter than the photo. Also hardly covers the wig cap at all!</li>
            <li> The wig  that came was of great quality. It was soft, looks good, nice material. BUT IT WAS SMALL. DAMN IT.&lt;br /&gt;I needed this wig for a Kaneki Cosplay, but I guess my dream isn&#x27;t gonna come true... it is too small for me, the sides of my head show too much...</li>
            <li> Item was as expected.</li>
            <li> Great quality and the hairnet was the perfect addition</li>

            <li> Honesty,  its a little grey.. but when it arrived i was a little disappointed.it looked really short and it was curly in the back, but one i straightened it and cut it to my liking  and i got to say it is a really good wig and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is not a Tokyo ghoul Keneki Ken wig, this is just some white wig sold with said total. This wig is more like a Hetalia cosplay wig. The hair is too long and too poofy for kaneki. Kaneki has short white hair that doesnt go past the nape. This could be used for it but this is not a kaneki Ken cosplay wig.</li>
            <li> Exactly as shown in photo,awesome wig for great price!</li>
            <li> great wig just blow dry it a bit to make it a better</li>
            <li> I goty wig and my cosplay for kaneki ken is finally coming along!!! I put on my wig and brushed it since it was all messy (not much just brushed it to make it look better) and it was awesome! Once I put the wig safely away I found white strands from the wig on my shirt I font know if it was supposed to do that or if it was normal but im satisfied with buying this.</li>
            <li> Exactly has I wanted it</li>
