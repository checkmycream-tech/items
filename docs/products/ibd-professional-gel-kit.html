            <li>This kit by ibd is great.  </li>
            <li>She mentioned that she didn&#x27;t have most of the stuff she needed for Gel nails, so I figured this would be perfect.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product, it will help me to learn how to do beautiful nails.</li>
            <li>My daughter loved this.</li>
            <li>I loved my kit.  </li>
            <li>The gel is very easy to work with and it self levels which is great.</li>
            <li>This was a very good investment its easy to use</li>
            <li>I was able to apply gel on my own nails with an incredible result.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>The IBD Professional Gel Kit is wonderful.</li>
            <li>as well they are very fast!!!</li>
            <li>But, this kit seems to cover most of the basics needed to get going yourself.</li>
            <li>I love gel more than acrylic because gel won&#x27;t stay until you shine it</li>
            <li>For a better result, I bought a dehydrate and a cuticle oil too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the nails would stay on longer</li>
            <li>I truly do love it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lift, it looks natural and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Now I haven&#x27;t used the product yet, because I&#x27;m waiting on my UV Lamp, but I&#x27;m quite sure the results will be fantastic.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and the kit comes with almost everything you need.</li>
            <li>then....I still love the way my nails look when i make the time to put a full set on.</li>
            <li>When it arrived, I was pretty impressed at the size of the kit, and how much actually came with it.</li>
            <li>they are not come with a UV light dryer and the gel won&#x27;t stay without the dryer.</li>
            <li>I thought this kit came with a UV light.</li>
            <li>so I won&#x27;t know how the product works until I get a UV light.</li>
            <li>Hope that the product will make up for not having the UV light.</li>
            <li>Gel is super easy to work with.  </li>
            <li>You can find the full size in Amazon tho.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You have everything you basically need and it worth the money on the first use!</li>
            <li>i believe it&#x27;s a very complete kit, either if your a professional of if your starting, it has so many products and the dvd which is great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun.</li>
            <li>I suggest to see some useful videos in the internet (youtube) to learn all the tricks.</li>
            <li>you are applying the gel yourself without help, it may take longer than in a manicure, but it worth it 100 times.</li>
            <li>My sister is a professional nail tech, but deals mostly in acrylic nails.</li>
            <li>The clear would have been the most versatile component of this kit.</li>
            <li>Otherwise this is worth the money because I&#x27;ve looked everywhere</li>
            <li>On the other hand, the DVD would be good for those who have never done or had their nails done before.</li>
            <li>I purchased these as my first trial gel product and I must say I am pleased so far with the outcome.</li>
            <li>The first one came in less than great condition, bottles where broke, stuff was leaking, I put in my complaint and they replaced it quickly and even through in a bonus as a gesture of good will.</li>
            <li>So I am pretty bummed right now.</li>
            <li>It would be more beneficial if it came with a dehydrator as well,since that is most necessary instead of two kind of sealants and a white and one color gel paints instead of the same two colors.</li>
            <li>they ship very fast</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife for christmas, she loves it very much.</li>
            <li>The Gel kit is enough for many applications.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First of all, buyers have to know that....</li>
            <li>I will let my wife order more of this stuff, and from the same seller as well.</li>
            <li>Very nice set for the money, nearly everything needed to complete a manicure, only additional purchase I had to make was the foil nail guide tips.</li>
            <li>I bought an intense seal instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I think the glue I used didnt help plus the fact that I think I really need to practice.</li>
            <li>Shipped really fast</li>
            <li>and I received my order very will packaged.</li>
            <li>* most of the produces are mini size that only enough for couple uses.</li>
            <li>Seriously, no hole.  </li>
            <li>The instruction helps a lot I highly recommend you read them before you start.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to learn how to do my own nails; who has time to keep running in for a fill or change of color?</li>
            <li>but I am not a professional and it did take me a while to do a full set on myself...</li>
            <li>I reordered all new stuff.</li>
            <li>Love how convenient the packaging is, just all together in the little box!</li>
            <li>Love the kit, has pink, white, and clear gels.  </li>
            <li>I should have done what I was going to do in the first place and buy each individual item.</li>
            <li>But when i opened it all the clear builder gel had leaked out and messed up everything in the box.</li>
            <li>I guess that speaks of the quality of this kit (and thats from a professional nail tech).</li>
            <li>When I received by box, I left it unopened for a week until I was ready to do my daughters nails.  </li>
            <li>I live in Trinidad and received this product much sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>I paid right around $60, and figured that because it was a \\&quot;Professional\\&quot; kit, that it would be small, and not include much based on the price.</li>
            <li>The initial investment is a bit high, but it pays the price over an initial gel nails application and 2 or 3 fillings, and believe, you&#x27;ll have impecable nails whenever and wherever you want.</li>
            <li>It did not dry my nails.</li>
            <li>If you used to go to a nail salon and tired for the long wait and over charging, this is the place you going for!! :)</li>

            <li> If you used to go to a nail salon and tired for the long wait and over charging, this is the place you going for!! :)</li>
            <li> It comes out really nice and all my friends are shocked that I did that by myself.</li>
            <li> I would have saved money in the long run.  </li>
            <li> Since being a resident of Canada, it took me a long time to find a supplier that delivers to Canada.</li>
            <li> Be careful in its use, though.</li>
            <li> Be careful with your material, too.</li>
            <li> For those that want to start but not sure of all the products to get or how to use them properly.  </li>
            <li> The other thing is there should be nail dehydrator included for 70+ dollars.</li>
            <li> Not useful.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be it does not come with a hydrator for your nails.</li>
            <li> I e-mailed the seller and was told to check the black bag.  </li>
            <li> Also, i&#x27;m a little obsessive when it comes to detail - so that could be one of the reasons it took me a little longer.  </li>
            <li> However, the customer services is a little lacking.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s missing the nail bed dehydrator, tip blender, and the nails that come with it</li>
            <li> Its missing the forms for building the gel nail.</li>
            <li> I then found out that is was missing the nail wipes.  </li>
            <li> I would advice to invest in a small electrical nail drill to help removing the gel when doing the filling.</li>
            <li> I really am not pleased with what happened.</li>
            <li> When she opened it on Christmas afternoon, she was shocked that I had spent atleast 150-200 dollars on her present.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for what you get and too hard to do yourself.</li>
            <li> I will not have to sit in a nail salon and spend all the money for someone else to do my nails no more !!!</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> It has almost everything youneed as a base for beggining your home gel nails.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s hard to learn how to do my own nails; who has time to keep running in for a fill or change of color? But, this kit seems to cover most of the basics needed to get going yourself. It&#x27;s fun.</li>
            <li> Gel is super easy to work with.  Love the kit, has pink, white, and clear gels.  As well as two tubs of the techno red color gel.</li>
            <li> The gel kit comes with an explanatory DVD that&#x27;s very good. I was able to apply gel on my own nails with an incredible result. It doesn&#x27;t lift, it looks natural and beautiful. I would advice to invest in a small electrical nail drill to help removing the gel when doing the filling. Be careful in its use, though. Don&#x27;t forget to buy the UV lamp too. The initial investment is a bit high, but it pays the price over an initial gel nails application and 2 or 3 fillings, and believe, you&#x27;ll have impecable nails whenever and wherever you want. The Gel kit is enough for many applications.&lt;br /&gt;Please consider that you need time, patience and ability to do it. Don&#x27;t rush! Take your time to learn, watch the DVD, take notes, and allow yourself some learning curve. Be careful with your material, too. I suggest to see some useful videos in the internet (youtube) to learn all the tricks. It&#x27;s of incredible help.&lt;br /&gt;When you are applying the gel yourself without help, it may take longer than in a manicure, but it worth it 100 times. I love it! I love it!</li>
            <li> This was a very good investment its easy to use and they last I will not have to sit in a nail salon and spend all the money for someone else to do my nails no more !!!</li>
            <li> i believe it&#x27;s a very complete kit, either if your a professional of if your starting, it has so many products and the dvd which is great.</li>
            <li> When i received this checked everything in case. Found that one of the gel glues had a hole in it. Contacted them to replace it was told they didn&#x60;t have any. But told me they would give me back a 1:50 told them to keep it. went to the store and pick it up for 4:50.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved this. It arrived on time. The only problem we had was one of the bottles leaked and made everything sticky. We cleaned everything and everything is great.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister. I paid right around $60, and figured that because it was a \\&quot;Professional\\&quot; kit, that it would be small, and not include much based on the price. When it arrived, I was pretty impressed at the size of the kit, and how much actually came with it. My sister is a professional nail tech, but deals mostly in acrylic nails. She mentioned that she didn&#x27;t have most of the stuff she needed for Gel nails, so I figured this would be perfect. When she opened it on Christmas afternoon, she was shocked that I had spent atleast 150-200 dollars on her present. I guess that speaks of the quality of this kit (and thats from a professional nail tech).</li>
            <li> Too expensive for what you get and too hard to do yourself. I would have returned it but I did try to use it. It is now in my closet collecting dust.</li>
            <li> First of all, buyers have to know that....&lt;br /&gt;* they are not come with a UV light dryer and the gel won&#x27;t stay without the dryer. You have to buy a dryer from somewhere else.&lt;br /&gt;** most of the produces are mini size that only enough for couple uses. You can find the full size in Amazon tho.&lt;br /&gt;*** the instant seal DOESN&#x27;T work. I bought an intense seal instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;besides that this gel kit is perfect! You have everything you basically need and it worth the money on the first use! I love gel more than acrylic because gel won&#x27;t stay until you shine it so you have a lot of play time to work on it. The instruction helps a lot I highly recommend you read them before you start. For a better result, I bought a dehydrate and a cuticle oil too. It comes out really nice and all my friends are shocked that I did that by myself. If you used to go to a nail salon and tired for the long wait and over charging, this is the place you going for!! :)</li>
            <li> Not useful. It did not dry my nails. Very poor quality. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to \\&quot;get started\\&quot;. I&#x27;ve had my nails done for years at the salon, and decided to save myself some money and do it myself.  It&#x27;s missing the nail bed dehydrator, tip blender, and the nails that come with it SUCK!  I should have done what I was going to do in the first place and buy each individual item. I would have saved money in the long run.  On the other hand, the DVD would be good for those who have never done or had their nails done before.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with the product all of the gels work great! Love how convenient the packaging is, just all together in the little box! Can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product, it has all I need to start off doing my own gel nails. I was also extremely happy with Choice Warehouse and their customer service. Would definately recommend using them!</li>
            <li> It has almost everything youneed as a base for beggining your home gel nails. Its missing the forms for building the gel nail.</li>
            <li> Best gel I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This kit was not at all what I was expecting. This kit is like acrylic nails NOT gel nails that you get in the salon. I reordered all new stuff.</li>
            <li> I loved my kit.  It is great....but I am not a professional and it did take me a while to do a full set on myself...a couple of hours.  Also, i&#x27;m a little obsessive when it comes to detail - so that could be one of the reasons it took me a little longer.  I&#x27;m sure the nails would stay on longer but I think the glue I used didnt help plus the fact that I think I really need to practice. I did have some lifting - but I dont think its the product.....I&#x27;m going to emphasize that I think its the practice that will make all the difference.&lt;br /&gt;Even then....I still love the way my nails look when i make the time to put a full set on.</li>
            <li> Very nice set for the money, nearly everything needed to complete a manicure, only additional purchase I had to make was the foil nail guide tips.</li>
            <li> I purchased these as my first trial gel product and I must say I am pleased so far with the outcome. They are easy to use and the kit comes with almost everything you need. It would be more beneficial if it came with a dehydrator as well,since that is most necessary instead of two kind of sealants and a white and one color gel paints instead of the same two colors.</li>
            <li> I live in Trinidad and received this product much sooner than expected. But when i opened it all the clear builder gel had leaked out and messed up everything in the box. The clear would have been the most versatile component of this kit. I really am not pleased with what happened. I&#x27;ve not yet used anything but will update this review when i do and increase or decrease my rating as necessary.</li>
            <li> I thought this kit came with a UV light. I was mistaken so I won&#x27;t know how the product works until I get a UV light. So I am pretty bummed right now. Hope that the product will make up for not having the UV light. Shipped really fast and that was a plus.</li>
            <li> This is a great beginners kit. For those that want to start but not sure of all the products to get or how to use them properly.  This kit has everything plus a wonderful step by step manual along with an instruction did.</li>
            <li> Since being a resident of Canada, it took me a long time to find a supplier that delivers to Canada. After searching, I found this to b the only one as well they are very fast!!! I got the order with 2 weeks, despite the postal service strikes that were happening at the time. Now I haven&#x27;t used the product yet, because I&#x27;m waiting on my UV Lamp, but I&#x27;m quite sure the results will be fantastic. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;so stay tuned for that review. Otherwise this is worth the money because I&#x27;ve looked everywhere and this is the only place you can get this product for the price.</li>
            <li> The IBD Professional Gel Kit is wonderful. I truly do love it. The gel is very easy to work with and it self levels which is great. My only complaint would be it does not come with a hydrator for your nails. My order arrived within 3 days of ordering so they ship very fast and I received my order very will packaged. I had no leaking of any of my products. I definitely recommend this product...</li>
            <li> I really liked this product, it will help me to learn how to do beautiful nails. I recommend this sellet</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for christmas, she loves it very much. The first one came in less than great condition, bottles where broke, stuff was leaking, I put in my complaint and they replaced it quickly and even through in a bonus as a gesture of good will. I will let my wife order more of this stuff, and from the same seller as well.</li>
            <li> This kit by ibd is great.  However, the customer services is a little lacking.  When I received by box, I left it unopened for a week until I was ready to do my daughters nails.  I then found out that is was missing the nail wipes.  I e-mailed the seller and was told to check the black bag.  I had already done that after watching videos on u-tube.  I sent another e-mail and Ryan asked me if there was a hole in the bag.  Seriously, no hole.  I finally got them after a week of asking.  That is why the 4 stars.  The other thing is there should be nail dehydrator included for 70+ dollars.</li>
            <li> Y does this product burns my nails under the UV lamp it hurts like hell.. I had this product for a while and haven&#x27;t use it again</li>
