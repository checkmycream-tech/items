            <li>Great live prevention!</li>
            <li>Smells great and leaves my hair and beard feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>Most of the sulfate free stuff has no lather, or smells like medicine.</li>
            <li>Then WalMart began to sell it, but they can&#x27;t seem to keep it in stock; so glad to see it available via Amazon.</li>
            <li>Based on the reviews and ingredients, I really expected this product to be the best.</li>
            <li>My scalp didn&#x27;t feel as clean as I would have liked after using it, but my hair was clean without feeling stripped.</li>
            <li>Luckily I found this that had both!</li>
            <li>I have to use sulfate free shampoo, as I have rosacea, and it goes bonkers when sulfates get on my face.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s fantastic to</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo,makes my hair and scalp so fresh and clean</li>
            <li>Works great on my dry scalp but doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune.</li>
            <li>I have medium length hair and it doesn&#x27;t rinse clean  --  </li>
            <li>I feel like it didn&#x27;t clean at all  </li>
            <li>For me, I was hoping for more of a pure mint smell with a &amp;#34;medicinal&amp;#34; sensation on my scalp from the tea tree...</li>
            <li>It actually leaves my hair feeling and looking good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because my scalf is so healthy thanks to this item.</li>
            <li>Not &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34;, just fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh clean scent thats not overpowering</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo for the fact that it offers mint smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The smell of the mint is so unexpected for a hair product, but I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having to get used to having soft smooth hair!</li>
            <li>My hair is more soft after using of this product.</li>
            <li>Although the product has a nice fragrance and feels full in your hand, the final outcomes leaves much to be desired.</li>
            <li>really wanted to love this product, as I have had great luck with their Morrocan Oil and Coconut Water lines, but this product left my hair too dry for my liking.</li>
            <li>My first choice is Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special shampoo, but it costs about 2.5 times as much as the OGX.</li>
            <li>the kind of week where you go home, open the freezer, decide anything is too much work to cook, and then just go to sleep without washing your hair or changing out of your work clothes)</li>
            <li>It is also very gentle to color.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle.  </li>
            <li>This stuff smells exactly like Chocolate Chip Mint ice cream...</li>
            <li>always make sure to stock them enough in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>bought my first bottle of Organix Tea Tree Mint shampoo about three years ago.  </li>
            <li>Good for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Really good change for my dry, curly, short hair.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t mind the smell quite so much and really like the way my hair feels after I wash it because it doesn&#x27;t tangle much.  </li>
            <li>After I had my daughter my hair became very</li>
            <li>While the conditioner will help out, the smell and lack of tea tree &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; was the real deal-breaker for me.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t wash my hair for a whole week and it wasn&#x27;t getting greasy.</li>
            <li>It may work for some people, but the tea tree oil was way too much for my scalp.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I use it on my part golden retreiver for her sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have oily, straight hair</li>
            <li>But for people with straight or oily hair should not use it.</li>
            <li>Both of my boys use it, they really like the scent too.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to finally find an affordable shampoo that doesn&#x27;t contain laurel / laureth sulfate.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s rich enough that you might not even need conditioner with it</li>
            <li>After trying many different shampoos and conditioners, I finally stumbled across this set.</li>
            <li>I am glad I have this now to fall back on and enough to share with others!  </li>
            <li>so I highly doubt that I didn&#x27;t wash it all out</li>
            <li>I have had a fairly large bald spot near my temple for years.  </li>
            <li>The tea tree oil is a natural antibacterial, so you know your hair is getting as clean as possible.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I have wasted money on conditioner that I thought was shampoo.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t feel the normal tingle when using a shampoo of this type.  </li>
            <li>and you have an extra refreshing treatment for dry scalp and hair.  </li>
            <li>Not heavy, so as to typically leave your hair oily on the second day, but firms up my natural wavy hair, giving it a strong, non-frizzy smooth natural wave that holds through the week.</li>
            <li>The old green bottle and product were much much better.  </li>
            <li>(it had been a very busy week -</li>
            <li>We happen to have very soft water.  </li>
            <li>completely--  </li>
            <li>makes my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li>Instead, it dried my hair out even more than the sulfate-containing shampoos that cost a fourth of what this cost, so what&#x27;s the point of going out of my way to use this?</li>
            <li>I first bought this in Big Lots, but only saw it there one time.</li>
            <li>scalp is always crabby (itchy), this product seems to help it calm down.</li>
            <li>I shampoo on average once a week, using this product leaves my hair softer even right after I wash it than ever before.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product in hopes that this would soothe my itchy, flaky scalp and provide moisture to my natural African American hair.</li>

            <li> I purchased this product in hopes that this would soothe my itchy, flaky scalp and provide moisture to my natural African American hair.</li>
            <li> I do not understand why there is an absence of that peppermint feeling in this newest incarnation of this product.  </li>
            <li> only problem I have with this product is that when I get out of the shower and my hair dries, my hair, in some places, are a bit stiff and I have to rebrush my hair to make it normal.</li>
            <li> And, it lasts a really, really long time.</li>
            <li> I have had itching scalp for a long time , my wife found this shampoo on line and ordered from Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have ordered a bottle from Amazon and hope that it works as well as the well aged bottle I used above.</li>
            <li> still tried it but only using it every other day.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the matching conditioner in hopes it would act as a hydrating shampoo because I noticed my scalp was getting dry from the winter.</li>
            <li> I would probably recommend this shampoo to someone with very dry or wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, straight hair that is perms  and</li>
            <li> It is very thick, almost like lotion and doesn&#x27;t lather very well.</li>
            <li> has a lot to do with whether your water is hard or soft.  </li>
            <li> Not really a fan.  </li>
            <li> Not as expected.</li>
            <li> A little bit of it goes a long way.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the way it smells and the tingle in my hair! After I had my daughter my hair became very dr. I hoping the product line will help me with my moisture issue</li>
            <li> I was excited to finally find an affordable shampoo that doesn&#x27;t contain laurel / laureth sulfate. I&#x27;d heard the praises of tea tree oil and was expecting great things. Instead, it dried my hair out even more than the sulfate-containing shampoos that cost a fourth of what this cost, so what&#x27;s the point of going out of my way to use this?</li>
            <li> Not really a fan.  The shampoo must be used in moderation or it will be too thick and strip your hair of all its moisture.  While the conditioner will help out, the smell and lack of tea tree &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; was the real deal-breaker for me.  This stuff smells exactly like Chocolate Chip Mint ice cream...if that&#x27;s your thing, have at it.  For me, I was hoping for more of a pure mint smell with a &amp;#34;medicinal&amp;#34; sensation on my scalp from the tea tree...I got neither.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I have had a fairly large bald spot near my temple for years.  Have been to dermatologists and had injections in my scalp three times with no luck. I started using this shampoo about two months ago and I no longer have a bald spot. The hair is very thin but no bald spot!! Does my hair regrowth have anything to do with this shampoo? Who knows! But for now I love it. YAY!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Works great on my dry scalp but doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune. My first choice is Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special shampoo, but it costs about 2.5 times as much as the OGX.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo,makes my hair and scalp so fresh and clean</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t compare to others similar.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo for the fact that it offers mint smell.&lt;br /&gt;I have been a big fan of this product for the past 2-3 years.&lt;br /&gt;It is always an item on my bath tub, gym&#x27;s bag.&lt;br /&gt;I always make sure to stock them enough in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I do not like is that it is a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> Kids seem to like it. Plus no skin reaction.</li>
            <li> I have to use sulfate free shampoo, as I have rosacea, and it goes bonkers when sulfates get on my face. Most of the sulfate free stuff has no lather, or smells like medicine. Not this stuff! It smells wonderful! It lathers up like regular shampoo. It actually leaves my hair feeling and looking good. And, it lasts a really, really long time. It just takes a small drop to do the job. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have had itching scalp for a long time , my wife found this shampoo on line and ordered from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;It seemed that this shampoo cooled my scalp , eliminated the itching  and discomfort .&lt;br /&gt;I take small bottle of mint tree shampoo with me to all my trips , i decided not to irritate the scalp by usung other brand</li>
            <li> I bought this with the matching conditioner in hopes it would act as a hydrating shampoo because I noticed my scalp was getting dry from the winter. I loved the tingle I felt after the shower and it made my hair so silky. But that&#x27;s where the benefits ended. I started noticing my scalp felt very tight in the morning after I used this. Then I noticed more dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still tried it but only using it every other day. Then one day I forgot to wash my hair for a couple of days (it had been a very busy week - the kind of week where you go home, open the freezer, decide anything is too much work to cook, and then just go to sleep without washing your hair or changing out of your work clothes) and I noticed my hair wasn&#x27;t getting greasy at all. I didn&#x27;t wash my hair for a whole week and it wasn&#x27;t getting greasy. This shampoo was stripping the oils from my scalp. Never using it again. It may work for some people, but the tea tree oil was way too much for my scalp.</li>
            <li> I do not understand why there is an absence of that peppermint feeling in this newest incarnation of this product.  The old green bottle and product were much much better.  I will never use this garbage again.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. After trying many different shampoos and conditioners, I finally stumbled across this set. I have fairly damaged hair from bleaching and styling and it&#x27;s extremely frizzy due to the humidity and this makes my hair not frizzy and soft.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have with this product is that when I get out of the shower and my hair dries, my hair, in some places, are a bit stiff and I have to rebrush my hair to make it normal. It&#x27;s happened three times so I highly doubt that I didn&#x27;t wash it all out but I still love it and plan on trying out another set from this brand.</li>
            <li> Hydrating yet purifying, smells great!</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with the matching conditioner. Not heavy, so as to typically leave your hair oily on the second day, but firms up my natural wavy hair, giving it a strong, non-frizzy smooth natural wave that holds through the week. I love this. Also because of the tea tree oil, it is great as an anti-itch shampoo. I first bought this in Big Lots, but only saw it there one time. Then WalMart began to sell it, but they can&#x27;t seem to keep it in stock; so glad to see it available via Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo that keeps your scalp healthy and doesn&#x27;t smell like a field of flowers or a pina colada.  It is also very gentle to color.  Both men and women in the household like the smell and effectiveness.  Additionally, I use it on my part golden retreiver for her sensitive skin.  Her skin allergies are all gone, no hotspots, no dandruff, no more scratching.  Teatree oil is very effective and this is an easy way to get the benefits on skin under hair.</li>
            <li> I have oily, straight hair so I thought a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner would prevent my scalp from producing excess oil. However, it left my scalp feeling itchy and only exacerbated my oil problem. Since it&#x27;s sulfate-free, it doesn&#x27;t lather well, which means you have to use a lot of product. I would probably recommend this shampoo to someone with very dry or wavy hair. But for people with straight or oily hair should not use it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works wonders for my hair. The tea tree oil is a natural antibacterial, so you know your hair is getting as clean as possible.The smell of the mint is so unexpected for a hair product, but I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Really good change for my dry, curly, short hair.I shampoo on average once a week, using this product leaves my hair softer even right after I wash it than ever before.  I&#x27;m having to get used to having soft smooth hair!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, with a wonderful smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except I crave &amp;#34;Shamrock Shakes&amp;#34; while using it because it smells so wondeful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My scalp is always crabby (itchy), this product seems to help it calm down.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s fantastic to me.&lt;br /&gt;Lots of my hairs don&#x27;t disappear anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Because my scalf is so healthy thanks to this item.</li>
            <li> I love everything from this company, and this shampoo seems to be the best thing for my hair that I&#x27;ve tried. Smells incredible.</li>
            <li> Cleans without drying out the hair and scalp. Very gentle.  Pleasant smell.  Good for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in hopes that this would soothe my itchy, flaky scalp and provide moisture to my natural African American hair. The product doesn&#x27;t say that it works for dandruff, but I made an assumption based on the tea tree oil - my mistake. There was NO tingle when using this product, which I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lathers extremely well and as it lathered, it felt like it was hydrating my hair (as it says on the bottle). However, as soon as I rinsed it out, my hair felt somewhat stripped. I immediately followed up with my Shea Moisture Moisture Retention Shampoo and Conditioner to restore some of the moisture, and I&#x27;m still not convinced that it is back yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to love this product, as I have had great luck with their Morrocan Oil and Coconut Water lines, but this product left my hair too dry for my liking.</li>
            <li> https://youtu.be/bMs35QLmOyw</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells great (the minty scent helps me wake up in the morning) and it&#x27;s rich enough that you might not even need conditioner with it</li>
            <li> I got this just for the smell!  Have used it myself, but it&#x27;s wrong for my hair.  Both of my boys use it, they really like the scent too.  Not &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34;, just fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Best hydrating shampoo I&#x27;ve ever come across! Love it!</li>
            <li> works well and smells nice - does what it should!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too fond of the smell and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that hydrating.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves my hair and beard feeling very soft. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of tea tree mint....</li>
            <li> this shampoo is not very good  - I have medium length hair and it doesn&#x27;t rinse clean  --  You feel like this residue is still on your hair  ---  I had hard time rinsing out - with this and conditioner and it leaves a residue that didn&#x27;t rinse completely--  I feel like it didn&#x27;t clean at all  and it doesn&#x27;t rinse out  -</li>
            <li> I like the way this hydrating tea tree mint shampoo lathers my hair. It does make my scalp feel good, too. A little bit of it goes a long way. I have very thick, straight hair that is perms  and this shampoo leaves my hair looking nice and not tangled. I have been pleased with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair is more soft after using of this product.</li>
            <li> I like the shampoo, but realized its the same thing they sell at Walmart.</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo out when I went to buy the Moroccan Argan Creme and saw that it was out of stock. It wasn&#x27;t as hydrating as I had hoped it would be, but not bad if used with a good conditioner. My scalp didn&#x27;t feel as clean as I would have liked after using it, but my hair was clean without feeling stripped. The shampoo basically did what it was supposed to do, but I am not sure that I would buy it again. The needs of my hair tend to change with the seasons (despite living in Florida), so maybe I will give it another try in the summer.</li>
            <li> DISAPPOINTED...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXPECTED MORE OF A TINGLING SENSATION TO HELP RELIEVE ITCH.  EFFECTIVELY CLEANED AND OK BODY.</li>
            <li> Mix refreshing mint with tea tree and you have an extra refreshing treatment for dry scalp and hair.  I am glad I have this now to fall back on and enough to share with others!  This is some of best shampoo for the price!</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair moisturized without weighing it down.  I love the smell, too!</li>
            <li> smells great makes my hair feel soft. the mint isn&#x27;t over powering which is wonderful.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff. i regreat i ran out of it. i now see this brandin the stores. i got it for cheaper here on amazon! its wonderful!</li>
            <li> It is very thick, almost like lotion and doesn&#x27;t lather very well.</li>
            <li> Not as expected. Based on the reviews and ingredients, I really expected this product to be the best. Although the product has a nice fragrance and feels full in your hand, the final outcomes leaves much to be desired.</li>
            <li> Searched and searched for a shampoo that worked for my daughter&#x27;s dandruff. My hairstylist advised that mint was good for dandruff as was tea tree oil. Luckily I found this that had both! It has a fresh clean scent thats not overpowering and my daughter is flake free!</li>
            <li> Great live prevention!</li>
            <li> Christmas present for someone else.  They were very happy.</li>
            <li> The only  thing I don&#x27;t like about this shampoo is the smell.  I don&#x27;t find it at all pleasant, but I think I must be in a minority of one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my first bottle of Organix Tea Tree Mint shampoo about three years ago.  I used it, but hated the smell so I put it in the closet for three&lt;br /&gt;years.  I ran out of shampoo and found this in the closet.  I didn&#x27;t mind the smell quite so much and really like the way my hair feels after I wash it because it doesn&#x27;t tangle much.  I used the entire bottle and thought I had bought another of the same thing.  Opened it, squirted some in my hand when I was in the shower and realized I had bought the conditioner instead of the shampoo.  Darn!  Please shampoo companies---write shampoo or conditioner in BIG letters on the bottle--or put a big C or S somewhere on the front.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I have wasted money on conditioner that I thought was shampoo.  The only thing I use conditioner for is to shave my legs.  Conditioner makes my hair too soft and makes it feel dirty within hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether or not you like a shampoo has a lot to do with whether your water is hard or soft.  We happen to have very soft water.  I&#x27;m not sure I would work as well on my hair if I had hard water.  However, I do take a small bottle of it with me when I  travel and it still works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered a bottle from Amazon and hope that it works as well as the well aged bottle I used above.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t feel the normal tingle when using a shampoo of this type.  It feels like it leaves a residue in my hair after a shower.</li>
