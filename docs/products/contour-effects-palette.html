            <li>For the interior, the palette didn&#x27;t seem to have as great of an appearance as it does in the pictures; however, the quality of the make up itself was actually pretty good!</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and can still use the darkest shade for contouring (with a very light hand and good blending).</li>
            <li>Came in very fast and in perfect condition!</li>

            <li>: I have very light skin</li>
            <li>If this highlighter is used very, very lightly, you will not look like a disco ball...</li>
            <li>Very Cheap looking.</li>
            <li>I recommend this it blends easily just love love it!</li>
            <li>mine arrived quickly and in good condition.</li>
            <li>The caked powder disintegrated on its very own very soon after I got it!</li>
            <li>I am going to try this for the very first time, just arrived today but looks good.</li>
            <li>Great for accenting and bringing out certain bone structures</li>
            <li>The contour color is very dark on my fair skin, however when used in moderation, it works perfectly for what I like.</li>
            <li>Okay so I like this pallet but not for contouring.</li>
            <li>I like the guide on the top</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>It came out OK</li>

            <li>I love makeup</li>
            <li>The bronzer  and contour powder are better than I thought they would be.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t blend as well as I&#x27;d like compared to more liquid foundation kits.</li>

            <li>my favorite has got to be the highlighter in the trio</li>
            <li>Love it but makes my face look bumpy breaks me out sometimes</li>
            <li>buy one if you wants to be happy with your makeup</li>
            <li>Love the photo instructions on the box and worked well for my skin tone/ type</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I got my palette two days later and it was perfect.</li>
            <li>GLAD</li>
            <li>Perfect, totally wroth</li>
            <li>need to order more.</li>
            <li>Love the contour &amp; directions it comes with</li>
            <li>I would love to have tried it as it seems to be just what I was looking for and those who received the palette undamaged seemed to like it.</li>
            <li>Overall it is great!</li>
            <li>Will be purchasing again for sure.</li>
            <li>I wish it was more matte with a bit of shimmer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this for sure if you have olive/tan skin.</li>
            <li>I love this, I have no problems.</li>
            <li>Colors are great and very blend able.</li>
            <li>need to ship better....</li>
            <li>I have been looking for many years</li>
            <li>her face is coming back, and our plans are to make her beautiful (still) again!!!!  </li>
            <li>I love this contour effects...</li>
            <li>The concept is awesome - and I can use the final color for another purpose.</li>
            <li>, just what I was looking for :)</li>
            <li>I Love it ...</li>
            <li>very pigmented, great for the price</li>
            <li>Love it :) came in such perfect condition..</li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s perfect especially for the price</li>
            <li>It blends well and the highlight isn&#x27;t to overwhelming.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s just okay.  </li>
            <li>Have not tried...but love the packaging and the informational cover explaining usage.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone who is beginning makeup because of the top part having instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>The price are kind of cheap..</li>
            <li>I love the contouring guide provided on the package.</li>
            <li>This is definitely better for those who have lighter skin, though.</li>
            <li>so if you have darker skin it may work better for you</li>
            <li>More colors than I needed, but I am sure if I play with it more, I can come up with some blending that could use more.</li>
            <li>Works great, just be gentle with it.</li>
            <li>I love this product I bought it from five below.</li>
            <li>and the diagram on the inside sure does help.</li>
            <li>Id love this</li>
            <li>Love it already can&#x27;t wait to use it</li>
            <li>I love it..</li>
            <li>* :) thank you</li>
            <li>Love the coverage and color</li>
            <li>Should  get a better shipping process.</li>
            <li>Love the colors</li>
            <li>The highlighter is probably my favorite.</li>
            <li>Love this product for learning how to contour.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off buying the BH Cosmetics contour palette for $12.</li>
            <li>so use lightly!</li>
            <li>I also find that I have to use more of the darker color because of the lack of pigment.</li>
            <li>This palette is ok, but i don&#x27;t think I would buy it again.</li>
            <li>but I love that this enhances your features.</li>
            <li>I wish it was packaged better.</li>
            <li>love the palette but when I received it in the mail most of the powders were busted</li>
            <li>I love this contour effects.</li>
            <li>I love the highlighting color.</li>
            <li>i love this product</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t love it</li>
            <li>The bronzer and highlighter are OK.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>It looks more like eyeshadow than anything.</li>
            <li>great product delivery was fast and the product does what its meant to do.</li>
            <li>Really love it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it, for sure.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t quite sure about the quality because of the price.</li>
            <li>I would recommended this for sure</li>
            <li>Love this bag.</li>
            <li>I love playing the this contouring kit.  </li>
            <li>this kit I love.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I think there is a better kit you could get that works better with blending.</li>
            <li>love it I will buy it again</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, but comes in a nicely made pallet.</li>
            <li>I love using it.</li>
            <li>/time was great, very punctual.</li>
            <li>but it IS able to be layered to how you want it.</li>
            <li>And it didnt :3</li>
            <li>I am so glad to have amazonprime and this was returned with out a hassle.</li>
            <li>Contouring is my love</li>
            <li>Be sure to read about the highlight its NOT matte</li>
            <li>but I did think it was going to be more creamy</li>
            <li>but its more like a powder</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>if it comes in tact its a great kit, but if very well may arrive in pieces and as a result you will not be able to create desired contour effect.</li>
            <li>I love the quantity and quality of this thing</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>and im completely in love with the outcome of the product</li>
            <li>Love this contour kit.</li>
            <li>Love this brand, and love the pallete.</li>
            <li>love the highlight though..</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Tip for those wiith fairer skin: USE A LIGHT HAND!</li>
            <li>Nice highlight to light</li>
            <li>The colors are wonderful for every skin tone from fair to dark, for the fairer skin tones I would just use a light hand with your brush.</li>
            <li>I am able to color and contour with this one kit for a beautiful natural look with emphasis.  </li>
            <li>Decent size and great colors.</li>
            <li>I think its a great starter product for beginners who are learning and don&#x27;t want to spend so much on a high end set.</li>
            <li>Really love the texture of the product easy to blend love it</li>
            <li>Pretty good product for the price.</li>
            <li>But the pigment and smoothness of the colors is pretty good&#x27;, and even tho</li>
            <li>Such an amazing palette for this price!!</li>
            <li>Works amazingly and super pigmented.</li>
            <li>and I love how easy it is to use.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy love</li>
            <li>Also make sure you have a good set of brushes it makes the application that much easier.</li>
            <li>It was very straightforward and easy for a beginner like me to get used to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very light skinned, so I was worried the colors would be too dark on me, but they were perfect.</li>
            <li>When my package arrived it was all broke up and the directions aren&#x27;t very good, definitely will be finding this product else where.</li>
            <li>Great for a professional entertainer that&#x27;s of color.</li>
            <li>Love it and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>one of the better contouring powders that are cheap.</li>
            <li>I like this contour palette, good step by step instructions and blends very well☺</li>
            <li>All I can say is it&#x27;s a good thing I didn&#x27;t spend too much money on it.</li>
            <li>The color comes off very easily on the brush, and it&#x27;s super easy to blend without losing the effect.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the application of the highlighter but the other two are great!</li>
            <li>other than that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>I was most excited about).</li>
            <li>Anyway, for 10 bucks, 2 out of three is not bad!</li>
            <li>The palette is so easy to use</li>
            <li>its so easy to use and eveytime I wear it</li>
            <li>All in all easy to use.</li>
            <li>With those easy to follow directions my results are posted below.</li>
            <li>It was easy and even to apply</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and has easy to use instructions</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t chalky and I found it easy to blend, but I probably won&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li>The instructions are well but the product does not apply easy and does not stay on.</li>
            <li>Easy to blend.</li>
            <li>Came in very quickly.</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if your skin breaks out easily.</li>
            <li>Blends easily  </li>
            <li>this product is easy to use...</li>
            <li>i thought with the guide it would be easy</li>
            <li>Good deal for a highly pigmented contour pallet.</li>
            <li>I could not believe how cheap this was, and such a good product!</li>
            <li>I did also receive a black eyeliner crayon with my purchase which was wonderful.</li>
            <li>The powder is so light, it easily overfills the applicator brush thus wasting a lot of product.</li>
            <li>Which is totally fine if the product isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li>It came perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>and they even gave me a free matte lipstick a beautiful berry toned red!</li>
            <li>i haven&#x27;t used the highlight because i love my MAC soft &amp; gentle, but i will always be using this contour shade for that beautiful definition on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>This was a win for me especially because it was affordable and it was so easy for me (a beginner to use)</li>
            <li>This palette comes with a contour shade to define your features, a bronzer to warm up the skin and a highlight to bring a glow to certain parts of your skin.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect little go to contouring kits.</li>
            <li>which is a huge no when you want to contour.</li>
            <li>The colors are nice, I really like the highlighter when I thought it would be way to light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m a huge fan of the product.</li>
            <li>Overall happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>cheap .</li>
            <li>Plus youtube tutorials for City Color Contour Effects are available.</li>
            <li>Happy Friday 13th.</li>
            <li>but this one seemed to fit my needs.</li>
            <li>But if you apply lightly  it works quite well.</li>
            <li>I love this contour kit works great just like the expensive brands I am so happy with this product</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I enjoy the colors in this, I just can&#x27;t use it with my skintone as I wanted to do.</li>
            <li>Overall happy with it.</li>
            <li>Quality appears cheap and powdery.</li>
            <li>This contour is so smooth to apply on skin and it brings out my cheekbones.</li>
            <li>so use with a light hand and build</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light on the skin, and doesn&#x27;t make you feel greasy.</li>
            <li>Now, I am in no way an expert, but I am a Makeup Enthusiast and a free lance Makeup Artist.</li>
            <li>The highlight powder was amazing, shows up really well.</li>
            <li>Light feel, and really smooth.</li>
            <li>Thank you for the free lipstick</li>
            <li>My makeup was packaged securely, and did not break or crack in transit.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly</li>
            <li>but it was cheap.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and blends super easy.</li>
            <li>Contouring kit is great for aspiring MUA&#x27;s or anyone that wants to play around with highlighting and contouring without investing too much money.</li>
            <li>I have used other products that do a better job, but for the price, this is a really great product.</li>
            <li>Very fun.</li>
            <li>really love this product but for $5 its more worth it then on amazon ;D</li>
            <li>Super easy to get contouring effects with this product.</li>
            <li>bronzer is a nice medium matte bronze or good for contouring on fair skin.&lt;br /&gt;The dark contour is nice and dark, but not vampirish.</li>
            <li>this is so easy and quick to use.  </li>
            <li>totally worth the price!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>Im pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive it just to find out</li>
            <li>So far very pleased with this item.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind this, the compact is wonderful for everyday use or if you want to try contouring on a budget!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to try this</li>
            <li>/&gt;i love the product overall though and blend out amazing</li>
            <li>Specially if you are beginning to contour.</li>
            <li>It was well packaged, I&#x27;m super excited to use it</li>
            <li>If you are looking for FULL coverage this would not be the product for you.</li>
            <li>Good product overall</li>
            <li>This contour effects are really cool..</li>
            <li>Have to really get it on my brush to be able to apply it.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on something that I wasn&#x27;t sure I really wanted or needed to use all the time.</li>
            <li>It will last you a good while.</li>
            <li>If you’re dark as Kelly Roland or Gabriel Union, don’t buy (both beautiful women).</li>
            <li>Its not bad.</li>
            <li>For the price, the product is not bad.</li>
            <li>Not bad at all im getting ready to purchase 2 more for my sisters.</li>
            <li>In my uneducated opinion it works well enough, but it doesn&#x27;t blend as easily as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>I gave this product five stars because it&#x27;s easy to apply and does exactly what it is discribed to do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to use worth the contour guide right on the case.  </li>
            <li>Other then that it really is a great product to use to contour your face.</li>
            <li>I was not willing to pay $25+ for a contour kit, and I am so happy I did my research and found this gem.</li>
            <li>I use this product on both my mother (who is a white woman), and myself (biracial light skinned woman), the product is super easy to apply and ultimately gives your face a beautiful look.</li>
            <li>I super love my new contouring kit!</li>
            <li>This Contour kit is great for first learners in how to actually apply contouring and get the right effects.</li>
            <li>but it makes me super orange</li>
            <li>the product was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I tried it will definitely buy more of their products</li>
            <li>This product is more pigmented and better quality than an urban decay palette I have</li>
            <li>Of course, mainly because I&#x27;m in love with the bronzer</li>
            <li>Overall, pretty nice contouring palette!</li>
            <li>And it was delivered  quickly</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s not a terrible product to have while saving up for a better contour kit.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, too.</li>
            <li>This may not be the best product to use if you&#x27;re African American</li>
            <li>My package arrive fairly quick however I received the product came damaged</li>
            <li>In a way , whereas the dark brown is great for cheek defining .</li>
            <li>Thank you so very much!</li>
            <li>Even using it lightly on my skin, it looks like a pretty definitive line.</li>
            <li>and the tones are very pretty.</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty light</li>
            <li>the shade part is pretty dark, so for fair skin people might not be able to use that.</li>
            <li>I bought this long time ago and it&#x27;s still good to use</li>
            <li>The colors are very true to what&#x27;s in the pan , good color payoff , creamy texture with little fall out .</li>
            <li>The highlighter is something that you should use sparingly because it is very light and if you use too much you will have to blend for a long time, it even doubled as a nice eyeshadow, and I use it to highlight my brow one as well.</li>
            <li>First time I have this product and it seems to work really well.  :-)</li>
            <li>Works very well goes onto to skin easily.</li>
            <li>, let it dry and after that it will work, of course not as good as its supposed to.</li>
            <li>Also very soft and pigmented :3</li>
            <li>If you want to save a couple bucks, I&#x27;d suggest looking there first!</li>
            <li>And it arrived so fast!!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s big, love it!</li>
            <li>I gave it 5 stars cause this product is exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>I love it but the white highlighter broke easily</li>
            <li>It blends well and looks great on my super pale skin.</li>
            <li>WOW this is a winner, contoured as expected, and I love the diagram on the package, makes knowing where to apply very easy!</li>
            <li>AMAZING product, especially for the cost.</li>
            <li>I have already used it and it works amazingly for only $6.95 you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>so this was really fun to play with.</li>
            <li>Comes with the instruction on how to apply it on the cover too which I thought was pretty cool.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this product; this is light powdery but has enough weight to be not so caky.</li>
            <li>I love how it make my face look natural</li>
            <li>/face hydrating mist before applying this as it helps the make up set more naturally and makes it so you don&#x27;t have to touch up your face</li>
            <li>The white powder is nice for a highlighting effect though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also came intact which I&#x27;m guessing is rare according to the reviews.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is any good, if arrived crushed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally worth it...</li>
            <li>It really gives a nice natural look.</li>
            <li>It would be worth the 10 dollars</li>
            <li>SOOOOO worth the money.</li>
            <li>very simple palette nice in the face.</li>
            <li>however i wish the colors looked more natural.</li>
            <li>But well worth the money, I think.</li>
            <li>mine came with the Bronze and Highlight completely damaged which was very dissapointing, however a really nice agent from Amazon named Oscar offered a refund to me since the product could not be exchanged.</li>
            <li>It came earlier than expected which was great!</li>
            <li>I would prefer a cream colored or more natural highlight.  </li>
            <li>this so worth it</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m still gona be able to use the highlighter out of the old compact</li>
            <li>I love how this contour powder glides on so soft.  </li>
            <li>I received the package nicely and I didn&#x27;t start wearing until like a week later because I didn&#x27;t have the right contouring brush</li>
            <li>Very nice use ot everyday.</li>
            <li>much for being excited.</li>
            <li>received the product right away,  in prefect condition.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get the right</li>
            <li>and I receive right away with no damage.</li>
            <li>Delivered right on time.</li>
            <li>I really like this product as it is easy to apply, comes with clear instructions, goes on smooth, and it is all neatly packed into 1 container.</li>
            <li>it came in clean and ready for use as well as on time.</li>
            <li>i have been looking for a contour shade dark enough to show, and this is the perfect color.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a contouring color that was not too warm (most all of them out there are - trust me, I have searched far and wide) and that would also not break my budget.</li>
            <li>The high lighter is fine and the bronzer is okay if you only use the littlest bit</li>
            <li>Great for contouring though I only use the dark and light.</li>
            <li>I use what&#x27;s left everyday and it contours beautifully and is lightweight and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a very nice product that I would definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too upset though because the price is very reasonable for what you get.</li>
            <li>It is possible for me to use it, but I have to apply it very lightly and build it up.</li>
            <li>Delivery was very fast</li>
            <li>Got exactlly what I was expecting very fast delivery</li>
            <li>I feel that this pallet is just as nice as the more exspensive ones for far less money.</li>
            <li>If you have skin that&#x27;s dry, easily irritated, or ezxema come on what are you doing shopping for cheap stuff to put on your skin?   </li>
            <li>Very good palette but mine was broken upon arrival, so I had to fix it mysrlf</li>
            <li>Just bought this exact product at a &amp;#34;Five Below&amp;#34; store for under $5...</li>
            <li>It is comparable to my higher quality nyx items.</li>
            <li>Tells you exactly where to apply it etc</li>
            <li>I am beyond pleased, and will be ordering one of the same colors for her, b/c she has just lost her husband and</li>
            <li>It should be a more universal set of colors, though, for contouring and highlighting, if it is going to be marketed to every woman.</li>
            <li>colors are pigmented and the highlight is really pretty.</li>
            <li>First time trying to highlight &amp; contour</li>
            <li>This made me look funny.</li>
            <li>it shipped pretty fast!</li>
            <li>Only thing is i wish the gighliggter stood out more.</li>
            <li>I ordered a higher quality contour palette and we will see how that measures</li>
            <li>, first contour and</li>
            <li>this is my first time doing contour</li>
            <li>(Also I received this item pretty fast!)</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>Sure, for some women of the same race you may not use all of the colors.</li>
            <li>Only used once, but i love it.</li>
            <li>I would most definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m use to wearing higher quality make up.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>only downside is that the top does not snap into place; it&#x27;s a magnetic cardboard.</li>
            <li>I really love this but only if it camr with the brush</li>
            <li>This was my first venture into the contouring world and OH.MY.GOD.</li>
            <li>&amp; i will definitely buy it again :))</li>
            <li>The white ( the one used for highlighting) is mostly glidder .</li>
            <li>If it cost more I would make a bigger deal out of it but with the price and the fact I can still use it</li>
            <li>Overall I am satisfied with my order.</li>
            <li>It did happen and I was pretty upset.</li>
            <li>Funny.</li>
            <li>Works well, this is the first contouring kit I have purchased so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s an OK product.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping !</li>
            <li>You can always add more, but if you&#x27;re not careful you can put way too much on</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m really pleased;</li>
            <li>I must admit I was kind of hesitated at first by other reviews</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t really what I expected, I wish it would blend in better than it does!</li>
            <li>The highlight is perfect it&#x27;s not a dull white it a real pretty yet subtle shimmer and</li>
            <li>The white, highlighter, goes on very light and the bronzer really has to be brushed in to blend but overall good.</li>
            <li>The 2 brown colors are amazing for contouring; however, the highlither is really pigmented and shimmer than what I expected.</li>
            <li>I really wanted one, but wasn&#x27;t will to for the more pricy big name cosmetic brands.</li>
            <li>Good quality for such a low price.</li>
            <li>The only good one is the middle bronzer.</li>
            <li>I really like the brown and bronze for contouring, but I don&#x27;t love the white for highlighting.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy using everyday:)</li>
            <li>It is a good practice item though but definitely should have sent it back since it was damaged when it arrived</li>
            <li>The product gets picked up very easily by a brush, so you do have to be careful about that.</li>
            <li>I have bought quite a few City Colors products and have been very pleased with the brand.</li>
            <li>Once I figured that out, the contouring affects were great, and I knew what to do with other make-up used for the same purpose.</li>
            <li>First off, the powder is very chalky and falls off the brush.</li>
            <li>I have a dark skin complexion and the pallet looked nice on my skin.</li>
            <li>The instructions, on the inside of the kit top, show exactly where to place each one of the three wide circle encased make-ups and for what purpose.</li>
            <li>im surprised it came intact lucky me.</li>
            <li>Large to medium size palette.</li>
            <li>I already am going to buy a few more to have on hand!</li>
            <li>Glowy finish and very natural looking if done right.</li>
            <li>Nice little kit for beginners</li>
            <li>This palette is really nice.. if you have a dark skin tone!</li>
            <li>Since there is a bronzer in the makeup, my face has become super dark and no longer matches my neck (without the make on), however, it applies easily and doesn&#x27;t get &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The transition shade hardly picked up on the brushes yet the highlight color was extremely bright.</li>
            <li>The product is good, but the contouring shade is hard to blend.</li>
            <li>The darker color is HARDER to blend, but only because it is SO pigmented, so it&#x27;s relatively easy to overdo it, and that color is going to stick right where you put it unless you use a light hand.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented and blends well.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very pigmented</li>
            <li>The highlighter is really shimmery.</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for anyone with tan skin because it doesn&#x27;t seem to show up very well</li>
            <li>I am very please with it.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for me .</li>
            <li>Medium color is really orange on me.</li>
            <li>The colours are very nice,highlighter is also a bit shimmery.</li>
            <li>Came with no contour brush and thought it was cream really powder not impress might give it away</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really tell you about the quality of it</li>
            <li>much  because i havent used it</li>
            <li>It goes on very well and the contour color stayed on all day for me.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, as described</li>
            <li>Just a bit much for a wrinkled face. . .</li>
            <li>I would give 5 stars if I didn&#x27;t have to re-apply quite as much</li>
            <li>It was ready for use.</li>
            <li>Thanks again</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, but once recieved one out of the three contourin.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fast shipping.</li>
            <li>really upset</li>
            <li>The Contour Effects was so much better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I also think the bronze is a bit much.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t use it because I don&#x27;t like that</li>
            <li>i am very satisfield.</li>
            <li>I am very upset that the powders were all cracked.</li>
            <li>My palette came in one piece, no broken powders.</li>
            <li>and I really like this product.</li>
            <li>but my mother does not, this product really makes her cheekbones pop</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier to use this powder versus cream countour kits</li>
            <li>The pallets can work on practically any skin tone, the time of look you get depends on how much of the product you use and how well you blend.</li>
            <li>Packaged very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks(;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very shiny and shimmery when you put it on</li>
            <li>Very pigmented .</li>
            <li>Came before scheduled delivery and arrived very well wrapped &amp; in tact (had my fingers crossed).</li>
            <li>All colors are matte, and blend really well.</li>
            <li>I am a beginner in contouring, and the instructions inside the pallet were very helpful.</li>
            <li>The package came on time which was great, but just like some of the reviews it came broken.</li>
            <li>The colors are powder, and very pigmented.  </li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s actually really helpful.</li>
            <li>Colors look great, but powder was all broken up.</li>
            <li>very easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fits a lot of makeup and brushes are tucked away and ready for use.</li>
            <li>it works really well</li>
            <li>The bronze powder is very orange.</li>
            <li>Came with more than expected.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The colors are very well pigmented and the guide is very helpful.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest this palette!</li>
            <li>It was better than expected for the money.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li>Everything is great, except it came in broken.</li>
            <li>the contour powder looks very muddy on the skin.</li>
            <li>I really like the bronzer in this palette</li>
            <li>Not so much my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented, have been receiving compliments every since I started using it.</li>
            <li>it came very broken but this item is still very good.</li>
            <li>Looks exactly like picture, new to contouring</li>
            <li>Other than that it came fast and safe.</li>
            <li>Perfect for everyday wear in case you are saving your expensive stuff for special occasions!</li>
            <li>Love this, easy to apply, has a little graphic to help.</li>
            <li>Overall i think this is a good product for somebody curious about or new to contouring.</li>
            <li>The bronze is decent but I think the real issue is that these are too powdery/fine</li>
            <li>First my palette came in good condition not chiped or broken.</li>
            <li>The contouring color is not a universal color, and is way too dark for my fair skin.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and was glad it wasn&#x27;t mess up thanks</li>
            <li>This is the First time I have had a contour kit but from what I know the product should be more of a foundation texture and this product is powder its hard to blend and you have to apply foundation first</li>
            <li>The product is good but the packaging no good</li>
            <li>I am a dark skinned girl and I love this palette.</li>
            <li>The darkest color was essentially black on my skin... but as long as I use a really light hand, it looks OK.</li>
            <li>They were very helpful in trying to get me the new product and didn&#x27;t charge me for the replacement.  </li>
            <li>Came in wrapped perfectly, not broken up or damaged as some people received, I am new to contouring</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to contouring and the diagram was very helpful to me.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any issues because I&#x27;m careful with my makeup, but I could easily see the compact opening if jostled and then all three powders would get everywhere.</li>
            <li>I have a big set , but really you only need this, easy and don&#x27;t take too much room in traveling</li>
            <li>the highlighter was the main reason i bought it</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are better than much more expensive palettes.</li>
            <li>Be careful to not go off of the judgement of others until your own judgment is made final.</li>
            <li>It came in nice wrapping and it was larger than I expected.</li>
            <li>I am a beige in the summer (classic ivory in the winter)</li>
            <li>Good deal for the price, however the highlighter is literally stark white.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it was a decent price</li>
            <li>Only issue is that like many others one of my powders (white) was cracked and crumbled.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>About 5-7inches long.3 inches high.</li>
            <li>I already have naturally high cheekbones</li>
            <li>The colors are highly pigmented and work well for the intended use.</li>
            <li>I love it, took me a little bit to get used to using it</li>
            <li>Overall it was a decent product and was worth the price.</li>
            <li>my item came completely in tact and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I experienced difficultly blending the product.</li>
            <li>Really enhances natural color.  </li>
            <li>Came on time and looked great , nothing was broken!</li>
            <li>im happy about because i was hoping it wouldnt get here broken.!</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t wear makeup all over my face</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and love it</li>
            <li>This item arrived broken despite good packaging.  </li>
            <li>and overnight it was new</li>
            <li>Im new to contouring</li>
            <li>I am new to the world of contouring.</li>
            <li>Oh well, you live and you learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am new to this...</li>
            <li>The application instructions are very clear.</li>
            <li>high quality and arrived early.</li>
            <li>but when i received it the highlighter was cracked was really disappointed because it is a good palette and its cheap good quality but was broken and</li>
            <li>The dark contour is a little bit too dark but the others are perfect.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m new to this contouring business so the contour shade is definitely too dark for me even with a very light hand.</li>
            <li>The lightest shade too light for a dark skin, just looks like chalk.</li>
            <li>Looks exactly the same as the photo.</li>
            <li>Is for dark skin my sking is light</li>
            <li>The color is just a little darker than I anticipated but it is easy to work with.</li>
            <li>It is cheap, but works just like the branded ones for less.</li>
            <li>other than that get a higher quality contour kit if you really want to try something new.</li>
            <li>I love the colors, but my skin is very very pale and any non-blended part sticks out like a sore thumb.</li>
            <li>My only real problem though is that for my skin tone which is light ivory, it was a bit to dark I think.</li>
            <li>The contour is indeed a cooler toned brown, the bronzer is a warmer, orangey-rust toned brown, and the highlight is pure white shimmer.</li>
            <li>The price on here is crazy but it&#x27;s a great product especially for black people :)</li>
            <li>, the area, where I put the light color on, seemed a little reddish after washing out.</li>
            <li>Preferably go to your local make up store for a professional to teach you how to do certain</li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly and I was excited until I open it and see that it is broken....</li>
            <li>The white was very pearly and the darker shade did not blend well for me.</li>
            <li>and my face looks natural.</li>
            <li>I am getting ready for my wedding next year and have been experimenting with makeup that I plan to do myself.</li>
            <li>I was SO pleasantly surprised by the quality.</li>
            <li>I personally am very anti-sparkle, I am so, so, so specific about my highlight.</li>
            <li>Just as described the colors are  well natural, can&#x27;t wait to apply it on.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented and it&#x27;s know part of my daily makeup routine.</li>
            <li>so i had to fixed it with alcohol.</li>
            <li>I might actually purchase another one very soon.</li>
            <li>However, since I have sensitive skin it did cause me some irritation.</li>
            <li>The white part is very shimmery, not matte color like rest</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t pay anything extra for fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The colors are very pigmented and they last.</li>
            <li>Two of the three powders were completely cracked and unusable on arrival.</li>
            <li>and you have to really rub the different parts to get powdery product to apply.  </li>
            <li>Another plus is that the contouring and bronzing colors are COMPLETELY MATTE (as they should be to achieve the desired effect).  </li>
            <li>it came three days early.</li>
            <li>I received my product about a week late, but other than that it&#x27;s a really good contouring kit.</li>
            <li>but you can buy the exact same thing for no extra price (except maybe tax) at a Five Below store.</li>
            <li>However, you can get the exact same one at your local 5 Below.</li>
            <li>This was relatively inexpensive for the amount of product provided, however, this was my first experience with a multiple product package</li>
            <li>( I&#x27;m not good at contouring, I need a lot more practice)</li>
            <li>Excited to open this product surprisingly the contour is broken!!!</li>
            <li>Even gives you a little diagram on how to contour which was super helpful.</li>
            <li>But after speaking with the company, i got a replacement and got a new one in the mail days later.</li>
            <li>I like this contour palette just that the colors on it are so good that applying too much on the brush and onto your face will look bad...</li>
            <li>This was my first contouring product that I have tried and although I broke the dark powder (completely my fault)</li>
            <li>While reading reviews I saw how many people received a completely ruined and broken set</li>
            <li>so I was able to carefully remove the plastic cellophane and dump the crushed highlighter into an old empty powder compact I had layin around &#x27;</li>
            <li>unless you have much darker skin, the contouring is far too dark.</li>
            <li>I probably shouldn&#x27;t be surprised considering its low price point.</li>
            <li>Contour and bronzer are very pigmented, the highlight I&#x27;m not really a fan of.</li>
            <li>When I was looking at the comments I saw that many came broken.</li>
            <li>It blends super well and they even give newbies a little guideline on the back.  </li>
            <li>However, like many other reviews stated, mine came busted :/</li>
            <li>When I received this the bronze shade was cracked , other than that I really like it</li>
            <li>FYI, this kit is compact powder instead of cream which makes it really light on your face since creams feel pretty heavy and thick.</li>
            <li>It makes it very difficult to use and on top of that it waste most of it when I try to use it.</li>
            <li>A lot of people complained that they got theirs back opened and broken, but mine came in good shape and tightly compacted 5 stars!! :)</li>
            <li>I myself, am an African American young woman</li>
            <li>I am disappointed that most of the reviews were true about that.</li>
            <li>The highlighter at first is a little powdery</li>
            <li>I have heard great things about this kit but am disappointed in the so diction it was delivered.</li>
            <li>I have very olive tan skin and even I found this to be too dark for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Really pigmented barley need to touch your brush to the pallet but was to dark for my skin tone</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t really work on dark skin women.  </li>
            <li>This would be nice for you folks that are experiencing the contour powder being broken due to the shipping.</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous to buy this wih the mixed reviews but it came in and was not broken at all!</li>
            <li>The contour color is a little too dark for my tastes  - no matter how lightly I try to apply it.</li>
            <li>It does not last very long nor does it look natural.</li>
            <li>My package came fine without any broken pallets.</li>
            <li>&#x27;The highlighter was completely broken&#x27; into loose powder&#x27; , BUT the plastic that covers the 3 colors held most (sum got out)</li>

            <li> Amazing palette great for the price</li>

            <li> it gives good instructions</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m fairly pale.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Colors are good, but the highlight powder is sparkly/glittery.  </li>
            <li> I loved this cotour palette still figuring the correct way to contour my face</li>
            <li> but the products looks really good.</li>
            <li> and it came out good l,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light powder finishing touch, perfect setting with the fix+ if you have normal-to-dry skin like I do.</li>
            <li> was good enof&#x27;&#x27; that I will probly buy it again &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li> But the makeup itself is really good quality for what you are paying for.  </li>
            <li> Bronzer and contour were good.</li>
            <li> Instructions are easy!!</li>
            <li> I am delighted to report that I am very pleased with this contouring and highlighting pallet.</li>
            <li> I love this product I use it with cream contouring sticks and this on top makes me look flawless</li>
            <li> Love it great for contouring</li>
            <li> Once I master contouring I&#x27;m sure I will be happy</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> REALLY GREAT PRODUCT FOR CHEAP PRICE!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very smooth powder!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great will buy more</li>
            <li> Its a good add on to makeup I already own.</li>
            <li> The packaging is nice and compact and the quality of the product is probably about as good as you will get for the price.</li>
            <li> but all the powders show nicely and look good on my skin.</li>
            <li> the colors go nice with my fair skin.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, perfect colors for contouring :)</li>
            <li> My palette came in perfect condition and I  tryed it out right away.</li>
            <li> For the interior, the palette didn&#x27;t seem to have as great of an appearance as it does in the pictures; however, the quality of the make up itself was actually pretty good!</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and can still use the darkest shade for contouring (with a very light hand and good blending).</li>
            <li> Came in very fast and in perfect condition!</li>
            <li> Interesting!  </li>
            <li> and I love them!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>

            <li> this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> The highlighter is amazing, couldn&#x27;t believe it when I used it.</li>
            <li> darker colors are great but the light color doesn&#x27;t show up on me</li>

            <li> Okay, this IS a good product, yes.</li>
            <li> Nice brown tones but the highlight color is a bit to glittery.</li>
            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> This is the kind of make up</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice warm tone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly tan during the summer (though not cocoa brown tan), but I&#x27;d never be able to use these colors without a tan...</li>
            <li> The quality is not the best, but it work very well.</li>

            <li> It is super easy to apply and stays on great.</li>
            <li> I have very light skin</li>
            <li> : I have very light skin</li>
            <li> If this highlighter is used very, very lightly, you will not look like a disco ball...</li>
            <li> Very Cheap looking.</li>
            <li> I recommend this it blends easily just love love it!</li>
            <li> mine arrived quickly and in good condition.</li>
            <li> The caked powder disintegrated on its very own very soon after I got it!</li>
            <li> I am going to try this for the very first time, just arrived today but looks good.</li>
            <li> Great for accenting and bringing out certain bone structures</li>
            <li> The contour color is very dark on my fair skin, however when used in moderation, it works perfectly for what I like.</li>
            <li> Okay so I like this pallet but not for contouring.</li>
            <li> I like the guide on the top</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> It came out OK</li>
            <li> , maybe I need more practice.  </li>

            <li> I love makeup</li>
            <li> The bronzer  and contour powder are better than I thought they would be.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t blend as well as I&#x27;d like compared to more liquid foundation kits.</li>

            <li> and I love how bleadable the powders are</li>
            <li> I love the way it looks on my medium skin tone.</li>
            <li> but I really love this product.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Its an ok palette.</li>
            <li> my favorite has got to be the highlighter in the trio</li>
            <li> Love it but makes my face look bumpy breaks me out sometimes</li>
            <li> buy one if you wants to be happy with your makeup</li>
            <li> Love the photo instructions on the box and worked well for my skin tone/ type</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I got my palette two days later and it was perfect.</li>
            <li> GLAD</li>
            <li> Perfect, totally wroth</li>
            <li> need to order more.</li>
            <li> Love the contour &amp; directions it comes with</li>
            <li> I would love to have tried it as it seems to be just what I was looking for and those who received the palette undamaged seemed to like it.</li>
            <li> Overall it is great!</li>
            <li> Will be purchasing again for sure.</li>
            <li> I wish it was more matte with a bit of shimmer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this for sure if you have olive/tan skin.</li>
            <li> I love this, I have no problems.</li>
            <li> Colors are great and very blend able.</li>
            <li> need to ship better....</li>
            <li> I have been looking for many years</li>
            <li> her face is coming back, and our plans are to make her beautiful (still) again!!!!  </li>
            <li> I love this contour effects...</li>
            <li> The concept is awesome - and I can use the final color for another purpose.</li>
            <li> , just what I was looking for :)</li>
            <li> I Love it ...</li>
            <li> very pigmented, great for the price</li>
            <li> Love it :) came in such perfect condition..</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s perfect especially for the price</li>
            <li> It blends well and the highlight isn&#x27;t to overwhelming.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s just okay.  </li>
            <li> Have not tried...but love the packaging and the informational cover explaining usage.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone who is beginning makeup because of the top part having instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Otherwise it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> The price are kind of cheap..</li>
            <li> I love the contouring guide provided on the package.</li>
            <li> This is definitely better for those who have lighter skin, though.</li>
            <li> so if you have darker skin it may work better for you</li>
            <li> More colors than I needed, but I am sure if I play with it more, I can come up with some blending that could use more.</li>
            <li> Works great, just be gentle with it.</li>
            <li> I love this product I bought it from five below.</li>
            <li> and the diagram on the inside sure does help.</li>
            <li> Id love this</li>
            <li> Love it already can&#x27;t wait to use it</li>
            <li> I love it..</li>
            <li> * :) thank you</li>
            <li> Love the coverage and color</li>
            <li> Should  get a better shipping process.</li>
            <li> Love the colors</li>
            <li> The highlighter is probably my favorite.</li>
            <li> Love this product for learning how to contour.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off buying the BH Cosmetics contour palette for $12.</li>
            <li> so use lightly!</li>
            <li> I also find that I have to use more of the darker color because of the lack of pigment.</li>
            <li> This palette is ok, but i don&#x27;t think I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> but I love that this enhances your features.</li>
            <li> I wish it was packaged better.</li>
            <li> love the palette but when I received it in the mail most of the powders were busted</li>
            <li> I love this contour effects.</li>
            <li> I love the highlighting color.</li>
            <li> i love this product</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t love it</li>
            <li> The bronzer and highlighter are OK.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> It looks more like eyeshadow than anything.</li>
            <li> great product delivery was fast and the product does what its meant to do.</li>
            <li> Really love it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it, for sure.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t quite sure about the quality because of the price.</li>
            <li> I would recommended this for sure</li>
            <li> Love this bag.</li>
            <li> I love playing the this contouring kit.  </li>
            <li> this kit I love.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I think there is a better kit you could get that works better with blending.</li>
            <li> love it I will buy it again</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, but comes in a nicely made pallet.</li>
            <li> I love using it.</li>
            <li> /time was great, very punctual.</li>
            <li> but it IS able to be layered to how you want it.</li>
            <li> And it didnt :3</li>
            <li> I am so glad to have amazonprime and this was returned with out a hassle.</li>
            <li> Contouring is my love</li>
            <li> Be sure to read about the highlight its NOT matte</li>
            <li> but I did think it was going to be more creamy</li>
            <li> but its more like a powder</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> if it comes in tact its a great kit, but if very well may arrive in pieces and as a result you will not be able to create desired contour effect.</li>
            <li> I love the quantity and quality of this thing</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> and im completely in love with the outcome of the product</li>
            <li> Love this contour kit.</li>
            <li> Love this brand, and love the pallete.</li>
            <li> love the highlight though..</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Tip for those wiith fairer skin: USE A LIGHT HAND!</li>
            <li> Nice highlight to light</li>
            <li> The colors are wonderful for every skin tone from fair to dark, for the fairer skin tones I would just use a light hand with your brush.</li>
            <li> I am able to color and contour with this one kit for a beautiful natural look with emphasis.  </li>
            <li> Decent size and great colors.</li>
            <li> I think its a great starter product for beginners who are learning and don&#x27;t want to spend so much on a high end set.</li>
            <li> Really love the texture of the product easy to blend love it</li>
            <li> Pretty good product for the price.</li>
            <li> But the pigment and smoothness of the colors is pretty good&#x27;, and even tho</li>
            <li> Such an amazing palette for this price!!</li>
            <li> Works amazingly and super pigmented.</li>
            <li> and I love how easy it is to use.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy love</li>
            <li> Also make sure you have a good set of brushes it makes the application that much easier.</li>
            <li> It was very straightforward and easy for a beginner like me to get used to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very light skinned, so I was worried the colors would be too dark on me, but they were perfect.</li>
            <li> When my package arrived it was all broke up and the directions aren&#x27;t very good, definitely will be finding this product else where.</li>
            <li> Great for a professional entertainer that&#x27;s of color.</li>
            <li> Love it and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> one of the better contouring powders that are cheap.</li>
            <li> I like this contour palette, good step by step instructions and blends very well☺</li>
            <li> All I can say is it&#x27;s a good thing I didn&#x27;t spend too much money on it.</li>
            <li> The color comes off very easily on the brush, and it&#x27;s super easy to blend without losing the effect.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the application of the highlighter but the other two are great!</li>
            <li> other than that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I was most excited about).</li>
            <li> Anyway, for 10 bucks, 2 out of three is not bad!</li>
            <li> The palette is so easy to use</li>
            <li> its so easy to use and eveytime I wear it</li>
            <li> All in all easy to use.</li>
            <li> With those easy to follow directions my results are posted below.</li>
            <li> It was easy and even to apply</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and has easy to use instructions</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t chalky and I found it easy to blend, but I probably won&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li> The instructions are well but the product does not apply easy and does not stay on.</li>
            <li> Easy to blend.</li>
            <li> Came in very quickly.</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if your skin breaks out easily.</li>
            <li> Blends easily  </li>
            <li> this product is easy to use...</li>
            <li> i thought with the guide it would be easy</li>
            <li> Good deal for a highly pigmented contour pallet.</li>
            <li> I could not believe how cheap this was, and such a good product!</li>
            <li> I did also receive a black eyeliner crayon with my purchase which was wonderful.</li>
            <li> The powder is so light, it easily overfills the applicator brush thus wasting a lot of product.</li>
            <li> Which is totally fine if the product isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> It came perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> and they even gave me a free matte lipstick a beautiful berry toned red!</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t used the highlight because i love my MAC soft &amp; gentle, but i will always be using this contour shade for that beautiful definition on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> This was a win for me especially because it was affordable and it was so easy for me (a beginner to use)</li>
            <li> This palette comes with a contour shade to define your features, a bronzer to warm up the skin and a highlight to bring a glow to certain parts of your skin.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect little go to contouring kits.</li>
            <li> which is a huge no when you want to contour.</li>
            <li> The colors are nice, I really like the highlighter when I thought it would be way to light.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m a huge fan of the product.</li>
            <li> Overall happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> cheap .</li>
            <li> Plus youtube tutorials for City Color Contour Effects are available.</li>
            <li> Happy Friday 13th.</li>
            <li> but this one seemed to fit my needs.</li>
            <li> But if you apply lightly  it works quite well.</li>
            <li> I love this contour kit works great just like the expensive brands I am so happy with this product</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I enjoy the colors in this, I just can&#x27;t use it with my skintone as I wanted to do.</li>
            <li> Overall happy with it.</li>
            <li> Quality appears cheap and powdery.</li>
            <li> This contour is so smooth to apply on skin and it brings out my cheekbones.</li>
            <li> so use with a light hand and build</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light on the skin, and doesn&#x27;t make you feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Now, I am in no way an expert, but I am a Makeup Enthusiast and a free lance Makeup Artist.</li>
            <li> The highlight powder was amazing, shows up really well.</li>
            <li> Light feel, and really smooth.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the free lipstick</li>
            <li> My makeup was packaged securely, and did not break or crack in transit.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly</li>
            <li> but it was cheap.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and blends super easy.</li>
            <li> Contouring kit is great for aspiring MUA&#x27;s or anyone that wants to play around with highlighting and contouring without investing too much money.</li>
            <li> I have used other products that do a better job, but for the price, this is a really great product.</li>
            <li> Very fun.</li>
            <li> really love this product but for $5 its more worth it then on amazon ;D</li>
            <li> Super easy to get contouring effects with this product.</li>
            <li> bronzer is a nice medium matte bronze or good for contouring on fair skin.&lt;br /&gt;The dark contour is nice and dark, but not vampirish.</li>
            <li> this is so easy and quick to use.  </li>
            <li> totally worth the price!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Im pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive it just to find out</li>
            <li> So far very pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind this, the compact is wonderful for everyday use or if you want to try contouring on a budget!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to try this</li>
            <li> /&gt;i love the product overall though and blend out amazing</li>
            <li> Specially if you are beginning to contour.</li>
            <li> It was well packaged, I&#x27;m super excited to use it</li>
            <li> If you are looking for FULL coverage this would not be the product for you.</li>
            <li> Good product overall</li>
            <li> This contour effects are really cool..</li>
            <li> Have to really get it on my brush to be able to apply it.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on something that I wasn&#x27;t sure I really wanted or needed to use all the time.</li>
            <li> It will last you a good while.</li>
            <li> If you’re dark as Kelly Roland or Gabriel Union, don’t buy (both beautiful women).</li>
            <li> Its not bad.</li>
            <li> For the price, the product is not bad.</li>
            <li> Not bad at all im getting ready to purchase 2 more for my sisters.</li>
            <li> In my uneducated opinion it works well enough, but it doesn&#x27;t blend as easily as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> I gave this product five stars because it&#x27;s easy to apply and does exactly what it is discribed to do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to use worth the contour guide right on the case.  </li>
            <li> Other then that it really is a great product to use to contour your face.</li>
            <li> I was not willing to pay $25+ for a contour kit, and I am so happy I did my research and found this gem.</li>
            <li> I use this product on both my mother (who is a white woman), and myself (biracial light skinned woman), the product is super easy to apply and ultimately gives your face a beautiful look.</li>
            <li> I super love my new contouring kit!</li>
            <li> This Contour kit is great for first learners in how to actually apply contouring and get the right effects.</li>
            <li> but it makes me super orange</li>
            <li> the product was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I tried it will definitely buy more of their products</li>
            <li> This product is more pigmented and better quality than an urban decay palette I have</li>
            <li> Of course, mainly because I&#x27;m in love with the bronzer</li>
            <li> Overall, pretty nice contouring palette!</li>
            <li> And it was delivered  quickly</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s not a terrible product to have while saving up for a better contour kit.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, too.</li>
            <li> This may not be the best product to use if you&#x27;re African American</li>
            <li> My package arrive fairly quick however I received the product came damaged</li>
            <li> In a way , whereas the dark brown is great for cheek defining .</li>
            <li> Thank you so very much!</li>
            <li> Even using it lightly on my skin, it looks like a pretty definitive line.</li>
            <li> and the tones are very pretty.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty light</li>
            <li> the shade part is pretty dark, so for fair skin people might not be able to use that.</li>
            <li> I bought this long time ago and it&#x27;s still good to use</li>
            <li> The colors are very true to what&#x27;s in the pan , good color payoff , creamy texture with little fall out .</li>
            <li> The highlighter is something that you should use sparingly because it is very light and if you use too much you will have to blend for a long time, it even doubled as a nice eyeshadow, and I use it to highlight my brow one as well.</li>
            <li> First time I have this product and it seems to work really well.  :-)</li>
            <li> Works very well goes onto to skin easily.</li>
            <li> , let it dry and after that it will work, of course not as good as its supposed to.</li>
            <li> Also very soft and pigmented :3</li>
            <li> If you want to save a couple bucks, I&#x27;d suggest looking there first!</li>
            <li> And it arrived so fast!!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s big, love it!</li>
            <li> I gave it 5 stars cause this product is exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I love it but the white highlighter broke easily</li>
            <li> It blends well and looks great on my super pale skin.</li>
            <li> WOW this is a winner, contoured as expected, and I love the diagram on the package, makes knowing where to apply very easy!</li>
            <li> AMAZING product, especially for the cost.</li>
            <li> I have already used it and it works amazingly for only $6.95 you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> so this was really fun to play with.</li>
            <li> Comes with the instruction on how to apply it on the cover too which I thought was pretty cool.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this product; this is light powdery but has enough weight to be not so caky.</li>
            <li> I love how it make my face look natural</li>
            <li> /face hydrating mist before applying this as it helps the make up set more naturally and makes it so you don&#x27;t have to touch up your face</li>
            <li> The white powder is nice for a highlighting effect though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also came intact which I&#x27;m guessing is rare according to the reviews.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is any good, if arrived crushed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally worth it...</li>
            <li> It really gives a nice natural look.</li>
            <li> It would be worth the 10 dollars</li>
            <li> SOOOOO worth the money.</li>
            <li> very simple palette nice in the face.</li>
            <li> however i wish the colors looked more natural.</li>
            <li> But well worth the money, I think.</li>
            <li> mine came with the Bronze and Highlight completely damaged which was very dissapointing, however a really nice agent from Amazon named Oscar offered a refund to me since the product could not be exchanged.</li>
            <li> It came earlier than expected which was great!</li>
            <li> I would prefer a cream colored or more natural highlight.  </li>
            <li> this so worth it</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m still gona be able to use the highlighter out of the old compact</li>
            <li> I love how this contour powder glides on so soft.  </li>
            <li> I received the package nicely and I didn&#x27;t start wearing until like a week later because I didn&#x27;t have the right contouring brush</li>
            <li> Very nice use ot everyday.</li>
            <li> much for being excited.</li>
            <li> received the product right away,  in prefect condition.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the right</li>
            <li> and I receive right away with no damage.</li>
            <li> Delivered right on time.</li>
            <li> I really like this product as it is easy to apply, comes with clear instructions, goes on smooth, and it is all neatly packed into 1 container.</li>
            <li> it came in clean and ready for use as well as on time.</li>
            <li> i have been looking for a contour shade dark enough to show, and this is the perfect color.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a contouring color that was not too warm (most all of them out there are - trust me, I have searched far and wide) and that would also not break my budget.</li>
            <li> The high lighter is fine and the bronzer is okay if you only use the littlest bit</li>
            <li> Great for contouring though I only use the dark and light.</li>
            <li> I use what&#x27;s left everyday and it contours beautifully and is lightweight and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a very nice product that I would definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too upset though because the price is very reasonable for what you get.</li>
            <li> It is possible for me to use it, but I have to apply it very lightly and build it up.</li>
            <li> Delivery was very fast</li>
            <li> Got exactlly what I was expecting very fast delivery</li>
            <li> I feel that this pallet is just as nice as the more exspensive ones for far less money.</li>
            <li> If you have skin that&#x27;s dry, easily irritated, or ezxema come on what are you doing shopping for cheap stuff to put on your skin?   </li>
            <li> Very good palette but mine was broken upon arrival, so I had to fix it mysrlf</li>
            <li> Just bought this exact product at a &amp;#34;Five Below&amp;#34; store for under $5...</li>
            <li> It is comparable to my higher quality nyx items.</li>
            <li> Tells you exactly where to apply it etc</li>
            <li> I am beyond pleased, and will be ordering one of the same colors for her, b/c she has just lost her husband and</li>
            <li> It should be a more universal set of colors, though, for contouring and highlighting, if it is going to be marketed to every woman.</li>
            <li> colors are pigmented and the highlight is really pretty.</li>
            <li> First time trying to highlight &amp; contour</li>
            <li> This made me look funny.</li>
            <li> it shipped pretty fast!</li>
            <li> Only thing is i wish the gighliggter stood out more.</li>
            <li> I ordered a higher quality contour palette and we will see how that measures</li>
            <li> , first contour and</li>
            <li> this is my first time doing contour</li>
            <li> (Also I received this item pretty fast!)</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> Sure, for some women of the same race you may not use all of the colors.</li>
            <li> Only used once, but i love it.</li>
            <li> I would most definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m use to wearing higher quality make up.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> only downside is that the top does not snap into place; it&#x27;s a magnetic cardboard.</li>
            <li> I really love this but only if it camr with the brush</li>
            <li> This was my first venture into the contouring world and OH.MY.GOD.</li>
            <li> &amp; i will definitely buy it again :))</li>
            <li> The white ( the one used for highlighting) is mostly glidder .</li>
            <li> If it cost more I would make a bigger deal out of it but with the price and the fact I can still use it</li>
            <li> Overall I am satisfied with my order.</li>
            <li> It did happen and I was pretty upset.</li>
            <li> Funny.</li>
            <li> Works well, this is the first contouring kit I have purchased so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s an OK product.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping !</li>
            <li> You can always add more, but if you&#x27;re not careful you can put way too much on</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m really pleased;</li>
            <li> I must admit I was kind of hesitated at first by other reviews</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t really what I expected, I wish it would blend in better than it does!</li>
            <li> The highlight is perfect it&#x27;s not a dull white it a real pretty yet subtle shimmer and</li>
            <li> The white, highlighter, goes on very light and the bronzer really has to be brushed in to blend but overall good.</li>
            <li> The 2 brown colors are amazing for contouring; however, the highlither is really pigmented and shimmer than what I expected.</li>
            <li> I really wanted one, but wasn&#x27;t will to for the more pricy big name cosmetic brands.</li>
            <li> Good quality for such a low price.</li>
            <li> The only good one is the middle bronzer.</li>
            <li> I really like the brown and bronze for contouring, but I don&#x27;t love the white for highlighting.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy using everyday:)</li>
            <li> It is a good practice item though but definitely should have sent it back since it was damaged when it arrived</li>
            <li> The product gets picked up very easily by a brush, so you do have to be careful about that.</li>
            <li> I have bought quite a few City Colors products and have been very pleased with the brand.</li>
            <li> Once I figured that out, the contouring affects were great, and I knew what to do with other make-up used for the same purpose.</li>
            <li> First off, the powder is very chalky and falls off the brush.</li>
            <li> I have a dark skin complexion and the pallet looked nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> The instructions, on the inside of the kit top, show exactly where to place each one of the three wide circle encased make-ups and for what purpose.</li>
            <li> im surprised it came intact lucky me.</li>
            <li> Large to medium size palette.</li>
            <li> I already am going to buy a few more to have on hand!</li>
            <li> Glowy finish and very natural looking if done right.</li>
            <li> Nice little kit for beginners</li>
            <li> This palette is really nice.. if you have a dark skin tone!</li>
            <li> Since there is a bronzer in the makeup, my face has become super dark and no longer matches my neck (without the make on), however, it applies easily and doesn&#x27;t get &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The transition shade hardly picked up on the brushes yet the highlight color was extremely bright.</li>
            <li> The product is good, but the contouring shade is hard to blend.</li>
            <li> The darker color is HARDER to blend, but only because it is SO pigmented, so it&#x27;s relatively easy to overdo it, and that color is going to stick right where you put it unless you use a light hand.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented and blends well.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very pigmented</li>
            <li> The highlighter is really shimmery.</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for anyone with tan skin because it doesn&#x27;t seem to show up very well</li>
            <li> I am very please with it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me .</li>
            <li> Medium color is really orange on me.</li>
            <li> The colours are very nice,highlighter is also a bit shimmery.</li>
            <li> Came with no contour brush and thought it was cream really powder not impress might give it away</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really tell you about the quality of it</li>
            <li> much  because i havent used it</li>
            <li> It goes on very well and the contour color stayed on all day for me.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, as described</li>
            <li> Just a bit much for a wrinkled face. . .</li>
            <li> I would give 5 stars if I didn&#x27;t have to re-apply quite as much</li>
            <li> It was ready for use.</li>
            <li> Thanks again</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, but once recieved one out of the three contourin.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fast shipping.</li>
            <li> really upset</li>
            <li> The Contour Effects was so much better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I also think the bronze is a bit much.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t use it because I don&#x27;t like that</li>
            <li> i am very satisfield.</li>
            <li> I am very upset that the powders were all cracked.</li>
            <li> My palette came in one piece, no broken powders.</li>
            <li> and I really like this product.</li>
            <li> but my mother does not, this product really makes her cheekbones pop</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier to use this powder versus cream countour kits</li>
            <li> The pallets can work on practically any skin tone, the time of look you get depends on how much of the product you use and how well you blend.</li>
            <li> Packaged very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks(;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very shiny and shimmery when you put it on</li>
            <li> Very pigmented .</li>
            <li> Came before scheduled delivery and arrived very well wrapped &amp; in tact (had my fingers crossed).</li>
            <li> All colors are matte, and blend really well.</li>
            <li> I am a beginner in contouring, and the instructions inside the pallet were very helpful.</li>
            <li> The package came on time which was great, but just like some of the reviews it came broken.</li>
            <li> The colors are powder, and very pigmented.  </li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s actually really helpful.</li>
            <li> Colors look great, but powder was all broken up.</li>
            <li> very easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fits a lot of makeup and brushes are tucked away and ready for use.</li>
            <li> it works really well</li>
            <li> The bronze powder is very orange.</li>
            <li> Came with more than expected.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The colors are very well pigmented and the guide is very helpful.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest this palette!</li>
            <li> It was better than expected for the money.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> Everything is great, except it came in broken.</li>
            <li> the contour powder looks very muddy on the skin.</li>
            <li> I really like the bronzer in this palette</li>
            <li> Not so much my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented, have been receiving compliments every since I started using it.</li>
            <li> it came very broken but this item is still very good.</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like picture, new to contouring</li>
            <li> Other than that it came fast and safe.</li>
            <li> Perfect for everyday wear in case you are saving your expensive stuff for special occasions!</li>
            <li> Love this, easy to apply, has a little graphic to help.</li>
            <li> Overall i think this is a good product for somebody curious about or new to contouring.</li>
            <li> The bronze is decent but I think the real issue is that these are too powdery/fine</li>
            <li> First my palette came in good condition not chiped or broken.</li>
            <li> The contouring color is not a universal color, and is way too dark for my fair skin.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and was glad it wasn&#x27;t mess up thanks</li>
            <li> This is the First time I have had a contour kit but from what I know the product should be more of a foundation texture and this product is powder its hard to blend and you have to apply foundation first</li>
            <li> The product is good but the packaging no good</li>
            <li> I am a dark skinned girl and I love this palette.</li>
            <li> The darkest color was essentially black on my skin... but as long as I use a really light hand, it looks OK.</li>
            <li> They were very helpful in trying to get me the new product and didn&#x27;t charge me for the replacement.  </li>
            <li> Came in wrapped perfectly, not broken up or damaged as some people received, I am new to contouring</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to contouring and the diagram was very helpful to me.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issues because I&#x27;m careful with my makeup, but I could easily see the compact opening if jostled and then all three powders would get everywhere.</li>
            <li> I have a big set , but really you only need this, easy and don&#x27;t take too much room in traveling</li>
            <li> the highlighter was the main reason i bought it</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are better than much more expensive palettes.</li>
            <li> Be careful to not go off of the judgement of others until your own judgment is made final.</li>
            <li> It came in nice wrapping and it was larger than I expected.</li>
            <li> I am a beige in the summer (classic ivory in the winter)</li>
            <li> Good deal for the price, however the highlighter is literally stark white.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it was a decent price</li>
            <li> Only issue is that like many others one of my powders (white) was cracked and crumbled.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> About 5-7inches long.3 inches high.</li>
            <li> I already have naturally high cheekbones</li>
            <li> The colors are highly pigmented and work well for the intended use.</li>
            <li> I love it, took me a little bit to get used to using it</li>
            <li> Overall it was a decent product and was worth the price.</li>
            <li> my item came completely in tact and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I experienced difficultly blending the product.</li>
            <li> Really enhances natural color.  </li>
            <li> Came on time and looked great , nothing was broken!</li>
            <li> im happy about because i was hoping it wouldnt get here broken.!</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t wear makeup all over my face</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and love it</li>
            <li> This item arrived broken despite good packaging.  </li>
            <li> and overnight it was new</li>
            <li> Im new to contouring</li>
            <li> I am new to the world of contouring.</li>
            <li> Oh well, you live and you learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am new to this...</li>
            <li> The application instructions are very clear.</li>
            <li> high quality and arrived early.</li>
            <li> but when i received it the highlighter was cracked was really disappointed because it is a good palette and its cheap good quality but was broken and</li>
            <li> The dark contour is a little bit too dark but the others are perfect.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m new to this contouring business so the contour shade is definitely too dark for me even with a very light hand.</li>
            <li> The lightest shade too light for a dark skin, just looks like chalk.</li>
            <li> Looks exactly the same as the photo.</li>
            <li> Is for dark skin my sking is light</li>
            <li> The color is just a little darker than I anticipated but it is easy to work with.</li>
            <li> It is cheap, but works just like the branded ones for less.</li>
            <li> other than that get a higher quality contour kit if you really want to try something new.</li>
            <li> I love the colors, but my skin is very very pale and any non-blended part sticks out like a sore thumb.</li>
            <li> My only real problem though is that for my skin tone which is light ivory, it was a bit to dark I think.</li>
            <li> The contour is indeed a cooler toned brown, the bronzer is a warmer, orangey-rust toned brown, and the highlight is pure white shimmer.</li>
            <li> The price on here is crazy but it&#x27;s a great product especially for black people :)</li>
            <li> , the area, where I put the light color on, seemed a little reddish after washing out.</li>
            <li> Preferably go to your local make up store for a professional to teach you how to do certain</li>
            <li> It arrived very quickly and I was excited until I open it and see that it is broken....</li>
            <li> The white was very pearly and the darker shade did not blend well for me.</li>
            <li> and my face looks natural.</li>
            <li> I am getting ready for my wedding next year and have been experimenting with makeup that I plan to do myself.</li>
            <li> I was SO pleasantly surprised by the quality.</li>
            <li> I personally am very anti-sparkle, I am so, so, so specific about my highlight.</li>
            <li> Just as described the colors are  well natural, can&#x27;t wait to apply it on.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented and it&#x27;s know part of my daily makeup routine.</li>
            <li> so i had to fixed it with alcohol.</li>
            <li> I might actually purchase another one very soon.</li>
            <li> However, since I have sensitive skin it did cause me some irritation.</li>
            <li> The white part is very shimmery, not matte color like rest</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t pay anything extra for fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pigmented and they last.</li>
            <li> Two of the three powders were completely cracked and unusable on arrival.</li>
            <li> and you have to really rub the different parts to get powdery product to apply.  </li>
            <li> Another plus is that the contouring and bronzing colors are COMPLETELY MATTE (as they should be to achieve the desired effect).  </li>
            <li> it came three days early.</li>
            <li> I received my product about a week late, but other than that it&#x27;s a really good contouring kit.</li>
            <li> but you can buy the exact same thing for no extra price (except maybe tax) at a Five Below store.</li>
            <li> However, you can get the exact same one at your local 5 Below.</li>
            <li> This was relatively inexpensive for the amount of product provided, however, this was my first experience with a multiple product package</li>
            <li> ( I&#x27;m not good at contouring, I need a lot more practice)</li>
            <li> Excited to open this product surprisingly the contour is broken!!!</li>
            <li> Even gives you a little diagram on how to contour which was super helpful.</li>
            <li> But after speaking with the company, i got a replacement and got a new one in the mail days later.</li>
            <li> I like this contour palette just that the colors on it are so good that applying too much on the brush and onto your face will look bad...</li>
            <li> This was my first contouring product that I have tried and although I broke the dark powder (completely my fault)</li>
            <li> While reading reviews I saw how many people received a completely ruined and broken set</li>
            <li> so I was able to carefully remove the plastic cellophane and dump the crushed highlighter into an old empty powder compact I had layin around &#x27;</li>
            <li> unless you have much darker skin, the contouring is far too dark.</li>
            <li> I probably shouldn&#x27;t be surprised considering its low price point.</li>
            <li> Contour and bronzer are very pigmented, the highlight I&#x27;m not really a fan of.</li>
            <li> When I was looking at the comments I saw that many came broken.</li>
            <li> It blends super well and they even give newbies a little guideline on the back.  </li>
            <li> However, like many other reviews stated, mine came busted :/</li>
            <li> When I received this the bronze shade was cracked , other than that I really like it</li>
            <li> FYI, this kit is compact powder instead of cream which makes it really light on your face since creams feel pretty heavy and thick.</li>
            <li> It makes it very difficult to use and on top of that it waste most of it when I try to use it.</li>
            <li> A lot of people complained that they got theirs back opened and broken, but mine came in good shape and tightly compacted 5 stars!! :)</li>
            <li> I myself, am an African American young woman</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that most of the reviews were true about that.</li>
            <li> The highlighter at first is a little powdery</li>
            <li> I have heard great things about this kit but am disappointed in the so diction it was delivered.</li>
            <li> I have very olive tan skin and even I found this to be too dark for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Really pigmented barley need to touch your brush to the pallet but was to dark for my skin tone</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t really work on dark skin women.  </li>
            <li> This would be nice for you folks that are experiencing the contour powder being broken due to the shipping.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous to buy this wih the mixed reviews but it came in and was not broken at all!</li>
            <li> The contour color is a little too dark for my tastes  - no matter how lightly I try to apply it.</li>
            <li> It does not last very long nor does it look natural.</li>
            <li> My package came fine without any broken pallets.</li>
            <li> &#x27;The highlighter was completely broken&#x27; into loose powder&#x27; , BUT the plastic that covers the 3 colors held most (sum got out)</li>
            <li> It did arrive broken as many others said, I&#x27;ll just have to be extra careful with it.  </li>
            <li> I was nervous to order this product due to the mixed reviews of poor packaging but omg am I glad I went for it.</li>
            <li> highlight is just a very flat white, I don&#x27;t like shimmer or glow as a rule but the flatness of this totally matte white does nothing for my highlight areas.</li>
            <li> but as for the other 2 they are much too pigmented for my skin tone and not very blendable....</li>
            <li> I was excited about receiving this, but then I opened it and it was already broken</li>
            <li> but when mixed with a base powder creates a nice natural glow rather than the over glossy white as it comes</li>
            <li> The major issue is that the colors are not right for African American skin, which I have.</li>
            <li> The item was ok but it arrived half broken</li>
            <li> But seriously speaking, who uses all of the colors right away?</li>
            <li> When I wear makeup I usually go for a matte look, the shimmer in the highlighter makes you VERY shiny &amp; shimmery.</li>
            <li> you will need to use a tiny bit and it will go a LONG way.  </li>
            <li> Arrived on time but received the white colored highlight broken the other two were fine.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous with the mixed reviews on this but was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> The middle circle had broken into many little pieces and there was dust from it on the other two products.</li>
            <li> Very streaky and hard to blend.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I bought this product because there were so many bad reviews, but I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Also on my light skin the Highlighting color is useless.</li>
            <li> Bigger than I expected</li>
            <li> But you get what you pay for, it&#x27;s not a professional kit or anything.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have about this contour palette is really just that the white/highlighter color is extremely shimmery.</li>
            <li> It is flyaway dust that doesn&#x27;t adhere to your skin and simply makes a giant mess.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m very new to the conturing game, this product provides instructions &amp; makes it very simple.</li>
            <li> The two dark colors are so close to the same color</li>
            <li> Nothing was broken and the colours were exactly what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> loose powder everywhere.</li>
            <li> Loose product falls out every time..</li>
            <li> It has a picture that shows you where people typically put the different shades on their face.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this  pallet, colors are pigmented nicely, and I was never good at contouring my face.</li>
            <li> and luckily nothing was broken!</li>
            <li> Pan size is smaller than expected but not tiny, the pans are shallow and if you are a regular wearer of bronzer</li>
            <li> Well it came on time it just a mess when u open it</li>
            <li> A little smaller than a brick.</li>
            <li> The colors are a little darker than what is actually pictured.</li>
            <li> So far, I can say it can last a year at the very least.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the second you touch your face, this product will wipe off.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I do not really like this product,</li>
            <li> But not what I expected</li>
            <li> Not really as pigmented as I thought it would be and</li>
            <li> but I added a few drops of alcohol and mixed it up</li>
            <li> The 2 bronzer pans were completely empty and the highlight was crumbled and unusable.</li>
            <li> crushed.</li>
            <li> no one wants to purchase something and when they get it ,it&#x27;s broken</li>
            <li> I received the item all crushed up and unusable.</li>
            <li> It performs exactally as I expected.</li>
            <li> Contour is darker than expected and highlight is lighter than expected when applied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very fond of this type of packaging but the product gets no dings on this.  </li>
            <li> The palette exterior holder is a lot thinner quality thinner quality than I expected.</li>
            <li> Though, depending on the type of brush you use, just be careful on getting the powder all over the place.  </li>
            <li> but when i opened it the highlighter was crushed.</li>
            <li> but they were crushed when they arrived.</li>
            <li> Was not as I expected.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s harder to blend.</li>
            <li> one of the puff cake is totally broken, but it too time consuming to send it back, so I just fixed it by myself</li>
            <li> Still the other 2 colors work for a wide range of skin tones including darker-skinned lovelies as well.</li>
            <li> so when I 1st saw the colors I thought it might be a little too dark for me, but it wasn&#x27;t, just don&#x27;t cake it on our face, Will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The high lighter part was broken</li>
            <li> The highlight is basically a white powder with very little shimmer.</li>
            <li> and I use the colors for other things like eyebrows etc.</li>
            <li> The product came as expected!</li>
            <li> I received this product in a box of 2 other items.</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY</li>
            <li> This was march darker than I expected -- in fact, I use the dark pallet color to color in my eyebrows rather than as a bronzer.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> You only have to use a small amount .</li>
            <li> This palette just doesn&#x27;t have the pigment some other palettes have.</li>
            <li> I have also purchased other products from this brand</li>
            <li> but I like the bronzer other than that its poop</li>
            <li> but these powders are extremely pigmented.  </li>
            <li> Powder works well with liquid foundation/concealer but isn&#x27;t bad with a powder foundation as it&#x27;s easy to blend.</li>
            <li> If you were to studying briefly you&#x27;ll notice that the negative comments about the palette are either coming from customers who received a BROKEN UP palette (who should obviously &amp; totally blame the sender for their carelessness in packaging), and the other side of the negative comments reside from a few fellow customers who aren&#x27;t using the palette to their advantage, they don&#x27;t know how to apply the powders exactly, or they just can not blend the product.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that the colours are a little hard to blend into your natural skin tone.</li>
            <li> but when it came it wasn&#x27;t broken a little messy but not broken ....</li>
            <li> The darkest color is a tad too dark</li>
            <li> This product is not worth $10.</li>
            <li> I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t show up on my dark skin, but took a chance.</li>
            <li> I did not like at all, not worth buying.</li>
            <li> but it was a bit dark for my complexion</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only complaint.</li>
            <li> how dark the color are</li>
            <li> The dark contour color seems to take a bit of work to blend</li>
            <li> Colors are way to dark.</li>
            <li> The colors seem to blend well with my skin tone (pale with pink undertones).</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t use because it is very very dark and didn&#x27;t blend as well as the other two,</li>
            <li> The dark contour is a little dark</li>
            <li> Mediocre for a cheap makeup but not great.</li>
            <li> I bought it at Five Below for less than $5.</li>
            <li> Im obsessed with the high lighter.</li>
            <li> I received the product and it was a mess.</li>
            <li> I was looking for some name brand Kits but was on tight budget</li>
            <li> It was also tightly packaged so that nothing was wrecked.</li>
            <li> The contour is a bit too dark for my skin (I have fairly pale skin)</li>
            <li> For me the color is a little bit dark, and not easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> the texture is a little chalky.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed because I was really excited to receive this.</li>
            <li> The powder is a little clumpy.</li>
            <li> rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the contour is a little too brown, not any gray undertones so to me</li>
            <li> When I applied it to my skin, the brush strokes were visible and little lines of pigments stuck to my skin.</li>
            <li> , there is even a little diagram on the inside of the lid with suggestions on how to use it.</li>
            <li> It was broken into pieces,  nothing left just a mess</li>
            <li> I put it in&#x27; but the contour pallet looks a little trashy with one missing &#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li> This is extremely pigmented!!</li>
            <li> thought it was cream and what is not and arrived broken, do not come back to buy it and do not recommend it at all</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Came just like it was suppose to I actually thought it was going to be broken</li>
            <li> White part was broken up when I received it which is what another reviewer said happens.</li>
            <li> and it feels heavy when wearing it.</li>
            <li> Too harsh to blend in skin.</li>
            <li> The white one was broken</li>
            <li> White part came broken.</li>
            <li> Everything came messy and all over the place</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;ll have a heck of a time correcting anything too heavy</li>
            <li> White makeup pallet was broken and crumbled when I got it.</li>
            <li> but I use it everyday</li>
            <li> It makes everyday contouring</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a chance to use this a few times now.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> came with the highlighting powder missing.</li>
            <li> Received this a few days ago</li>
            <li> The colors when I put them on make my face look pale</li>
            <li> I have pale skin</li>
            <li> From other reviews I see that this is something that&#x27;s common with this product.</li>
            <li> I know it doesn&#x27;t have 6 or 8 colors, but honestly, I&#x27;m not working on other people; this is all I need.</li>
            <li> Its totally a mess!</li>
            <li> It looks like a dark line and no matter how hard you brush over it, it won&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li> I usually use my finger to get rid of the harsh lines from the contour powder.</li>
            <li> I forgot what happens when i put the wrong stuff on my face, apparently.</li>
            <li> I saw pictures of the other broken items and they all seem to be broken on the same side (contour side).</li>
            <li> The highlight was a little cracked but still usable!</li>
            <li> so the little diagram it came with helped!</li>
            <li> I am disappointed but not that shocked at the condition of this palette since I read many reviews saying the same.</li>
            <li> This pallate is really good , but sadly when I revieved it, it was broken :(</li>
            <li> the broken loose highlighter in it&#x27;s spot &#x27;</li>
            <li> I was shocked it came so fast.</li>
            <li> Wrong product:Received corrective concealer palette instead... isn&#x27;t even the same brand</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how I like it</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be small</li>
            <li> I am not sure what happened</li>
            <li> I really only use the contour powder which can be difficult to blend.</li>
            <li> What a waste!</li>
            <li> Not sure whether it will cause allergy...</li>
            <li> When I received this products the powders were all broken, was really excited to try this product :(  </li>
            <li> my highlight came broken in pieces but could use other 2 and seems work</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t broken like some other reviews.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews where product arrived broken.</li>
            <li> was concerned because a lot of the other reviews said their item arrived broken.</li>
            <li> Thank god I didn&#x27;t receive mine broken like some other reviews.  </li>
            <li> I naively assumed there would be something to apply it to my face with. :/</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for I guess, but it went straight in the garbage upon arrival. :(</li>
            <li> but I was unable to remove the plastic due to the broken and crushed contouring powder.</li>
            <li> its really dramatic and dark</li>
            <li> its just really hard to blend out</li>
            <li> I can hardly see it on my skin</li>
            <li> I use primer before any foundation or contouring and this product is really hard to apply, blend and remove.</li>
            <li> i would say its a bit hard to blend also.</li>
            <li> If youre just starting out with learning and applying contouring or just need a delicate yet noticeable contouring of your face, order this set today!!!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not worth a penny!!!</li>
            <li> It came broken into little pieces though</li>
            <li> Hard to blend and to thick.</li>
            <li> Sucks.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> I like it for a subtle contouring for the office.</li>

            <li> /&gt;This is just ridiculous!!</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this I had read all the bad reviews and how it was broken</li>
            <li> I was looking so forward to using this and learning to contour, then when I opened the package it looked awful due to the powders being cracked....</li>

            <li> have sparkles in them which make it awkward to use to contour - shines like shiny eye shadow.</li>
            <li> I was really afraid that it would break in the mail by looking at the reviews</li>
            <li> it didnt blend at all and made my face look dirty</li>

    <ol>
            <li> When I opened the package the highlight tray was destroyed even with the plastic still on, there was highlight powder everywhere, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Just bought this exact product at a &amp;#34;Five Below&amp;#34; store for under $5... The white was very pearly and the darker shade did not blend well for me. Mediocre for a cheap makeup but not great.</li>
            <li> Okay so I like this pallet but not for contouring. The colors are powder not a creme. I like the guide on the top and I use the colors for other things like eyebrows etc.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it as yet, however I&#x27;m giving it one star because I received it broken</li>
            <li> The colors are nice but it does not stay on and its not that pigmented to the skin, great for every day use.</li>
            <li> Great value. Very pigmented and blends well. My item arrived in one piece. Overall happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I am going to try this for the very first time, just arrived today but looks good.</li>
            <li> Amazing palette great for the price</li>
            <li> I love this and it&#x27;s perfect for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Interesting!  First time I have this product and it seems to work really well.  :-)</li>
            <li> my highlight came broken in pieces but could use other 2 and seems work</li>
            <li> I do not really like this product, thought it was cream and what is not and arrived broken, do not come back to buy it and do not recommend it at all</li>
            <li> When I received this the bronze shade was cracked , other than that I really like it and it&#x27;s very pigmented</li>
            <li> this product came damaged it was falling apart in the white color and fell out all over my couch when i opened it</li>
            <li> It did arrive broken as many others said, I&#x27;ll just have to be extra careful with it.  The guide on the package was a big help so I knew where to apply.  It came out OK, maybe I need more practice.  Overall it was a decent product and was worth the price.</li>
            <li> Bigger than I expected but it&#x27;s really nice I love it  &amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Came on time</li>
            <li> one of the puff cake is totally broken, but it too time consuming to send it back, so I just fixed it by myself and I am trying to put up with it.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how this make up works because I received it completely broken and unusable. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I really liked this contour palette! will buy again!</li>
            <li> Highlight came completely broken into pieces- also thought it was cream not powder. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Loved it!!! Will buy again and tell everyone!!! Great starter pallet.</li>
            <li> Great deal for the price! Perfect for everyday wear in case you are saving your expensive stuff for special occasions! Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Came just like it was suppose to I actually thought it was going to be broken but it is perfectly in good condition</li>
            <li> I love makeup so this was really fun to play with.</li>
            <li> The highlighter is really shimmery. The bronzer  and contour powder are better than I thought they would be. Its a good add on to makeup I already own. I would recommend this because contour pallets can be pricey but just get a different highlighter.</li>
            <li> Did not use it  was broken when receive it, so I had to return it. I didn&#x27;t reorder it. I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because I like how they show you how to contour.</li>
            <li> I do not know why I thought this was a concealer. The lightest shade too light for a dark skin, just looks like chalk.</li>
            <li> My product came broke the delivery sucked! Im giving it two stars because i like the product.</li>
            <li> I have very olive tan skin and even I found this to be too dark for my skin tone. It doesn&#x27;t blend as well as I&#x27;d like compared to more liquid foundation kits. This is like pressed powder, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting. I probably shouldn&#x27;t be surprised considering its low price point. Please click the link below if this review has been helpful :)</li>
            <li> It works really well I was suprised</li>
            <li> Bought April 2015. The product came as expected! I super love my new contouring kit! FYI, this kit is compact powder instead of cream which makes it really light on your face since creams feel pretty heavy and thick. It does a well-blended contour of the face provided that you do great in your painting skills. ^^ Comes with the instruction on how to apply it on the cover too which I thought was pretty cool. It is cheap, but works just like the branded ones for less. Must try!  September 2016 Update: It&#x27;s been more than a year since I have purchased this and I am still using the same palette. So far, I can say it can last a year at the very least. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> leaves blotches and doesn&#x27;t blend well!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. But not what I expected</li>
            <li> Not really as pigmented as I thought it would be and the texture is a little chalky. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for anyone with tan skin because it doesn&#x27;t seem to show up very well</li>
            <li> Love it great for contouring</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it I feel so glamorous when I contour and highlight with my city color I totally recommend it .</li>
            <li> I received this item broken. But after speaking with the company, i got a replacement and got a new one in the mail days later. They were very helpful in trying to get me the new product and didn&#x27;t charge me for the replacement.  Thank you! Love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m olive skinned and the dark and lighter brown makes my skin look really dirty</li>
            <li> Picture says it all, really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Received in excellent conditions. Great product for the price!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product and it comes with instructions on how to apply, WONDERFUL!</li>
            <li> The colours are very nice. I am very please with it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the application of the highlighter but the other two are great!</li>
            <li> The white, highlighter, goes on very light and the bronzer really has to be brushed in to blend but overall good.</li>
            <li> The highlighter came cracked so it made a mess and unable to use . The product is good but the packaging no good</li>
            <li> This is a great buy, I just wish there was another option for the highlight.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me . But it did arrive on time</li>
            <li> Great for contouring though I only use the dark and light. Medium color is really orange on me.</li>
            <li> Instructions are easy!! Love the way my make looked using this contour kit..</li>
            <li> I was anticipating the arrival of this product until I opened the package. The highlighting section was completely broken. Maybe if they packaged differently this would help.</li>
            <li> It arrived busted up but I added a few drops of alcohol and mixed it up and overnight it was new again.&lt;br /&gt;I have fair skin and this is not for me!</li>
            <li> White part was broken up when I received it which is what another reviewer said happens. For the price you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Nicely packaged. There were a lot of reviews stating that the items were broken Mine came perfect. Great quality. Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Mine was not broken came within a few days of ordering it. I love it, took me a little bit to get used to using it but it is awesome. I have medium skin tone and it works great with me.</li>
            <li> I am delighted to report that I am very pleased with this contouring and highlighting pallet. I debated over it for several days. I really wanted one, but wasn&#x27;t will to for the more pricy big name cosmetic brands. I feel that this pallet is just as nice as the more exspensive ones for far less money.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this product; this is light powdery but has enough weight to be not so caky. I could see pictures coming out awesome and my face looks natural. I am getting ready for my wedding next year and have been experimenting with makeup that I plan to do myself. This will be in my routine for sure.</li>
            <li> You have to use a lot for this to work, it was not the best and it made me sneeze a lot.</li>
            <li> Since there is a bronzer in the makeup, my face has become super dark and no longer matches my neck (without the make on), however, it applies easily and doesn&#x27;t get &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  Perfect for contouring.  The darkest color is a tad too dark so I mix it with the middle color.</li>
            <li> I received my product in this condition. Im afraid to take off the plastic. Its totally a mess!</li>
            <li> These were very hard to blend.</li>
            <li> Very nice use ot everyday.</li>
            <li> I like this contour palette, good step by step instructions and blends very well☺</li>
            <li> The colours are very nice,highlighter is also a bit shimmery.Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Use this often ! The medium brown color is great as a bronzer In a way , whereas the dark brown is great for cheek defining . I never use the white , way to&lt;br /&gt;Pale for my skin and doesn&#x27;t blend well</li>
            <li> it arrived BROKEN into a thousand pieces and i was unable to return</li>
            <li> The palette is so easy to use and I love how bleadable the powders are</li>
            <li> Perfect. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Came with no contour brush and thought it was cream really powder not impress might give it away</li>
            <li> its so easy to use and eveytime I wear it I get so many comments about how great my makeup looks! totally worth the price!</li>
            <li> I love it but the white highlighter broke easily</li>
            <li> The order was delivered in no time and this contour palet is just amazing !</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to ordering this item online, however when I purchased it at FiveBelow I was SO pleasantly surprised by the quality. The contour is indeed a cooler toned brown, the bronzer is a warmer, orangey-rust toned brown, and the highlight is pure white shimmer. I personally am very anti-sparkle, I am so, so, so specific about my highlight. So this highlight, for me, was alright. It is mostly shimmer, but I can detect some faint sparkle in it. That&#x27;s the only reason I&#x27;m not giving the palette 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture however is very, very impressive for a drugstore-type item. It is comparable to my higher quality nyx items. It is very, very finely milled and SO pigmented. I disagree with others about this not being blendable, I&#x27;ve not had that issue. The darker color is HARDER to blend, but only because it is SO pigmented, so it&#x27;s relatively easy to overdo it, and that color is going to stick right where you put it unless you use a light hand.</li>
            <li> This is a great pallet, the pigmentation is great! I love the way it looks on my medium skin tone.</li>
            <li> Just as described the colors are  well natural, can&#x27;t wait to apply it on. The only thing is the instructions, I thought it would of shown how to apply it on.I must admit I was kind of hesitated at first by other reviews but I really love this product. Package well  seal.</li>
            <li> Not the best but does the job</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I was looking for</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t get to use it since I got mines broken.</li>
            <li> 100% satisfied, I&#x27;m absolutely in love!  I can&#x27;t wait to do my makeup for my graduation ceremony... I&#x27;ll definitely buy again later on.</li>
            <li> This is really nice for a beginner. The color comes off very easily on the brush, and it&#x27;s super easy to blend without losing the effect.</li>
            <li> It came in one peice so I was happy that it didn&#x27;t break or anything. The bronzer and highlight are very nice and I love them! The contour is a bit too dark for my skin (I have fairly pale skin) but that&#x27;s okay. Overall it&#x27;s a very nice product that I would definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> Simply, a nice product. Honestly, it exceeded my expectations.  Good quality for such a low price. Great for beginners, with easy to understand instructions. Came on time, damage-free. I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again in the future.</li>
            <li> Its an ok palette. Im obsessed with the high lighter.</li>
            <li> Terrible, the shine powder las broken. :( you should have yo be carefull whit this things.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good palette I just need to learn how to use it. I tried it once and I looked dirty. ( I&#x27;m not good at contouring, I need a lot more practice) my item came completely in tact and fast delivery. Once I master contouring I&#x27;m sure I will be happy I added this to my collection. I have medium brown ethnic skin and the shade part is pretty dark, so for fair skin people might not be able to use that. Fyi</li>
            <li> Works amazingly and super pigmented.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have about this contour palette is really just that the white/highlighter color is extremely shimmery. When I wear makeup I usually go for a matte look, the shimmer in the highlighter makes you VERY shiny &amp; shimmery.</li>
            <li> I have a dark skin complexion and the pallet looked nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> cheap . doesn&#x27;t blend well.</li>
            <li> i like this product, with a bit of practice you can actually reframe your facial features like a pro. Easy to use and blends super easy.</li>
            <li> Great for people learning the basics of contour and highlighting.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this 0 stars! I received this product in a box of 2 other items. When I opened the box it looked like dust was all over my items but when I opened the contour kit I realized it was bronzer. The 2 bronzer pans were completely empty and the highlight was crumbled and unusable. I was so disappointed because I was really excited to receive this. I have heard great things about this kit but am disappointed in the so diction it was delivered.</li>
            <li> I saw this palette being used on a YouTube tutorial and I just had to get it.  The product came packaged excellent and the quality was very good and versatile.  I am able to color and contour with this one kit for a beautiful natural look with emphasis.  Definitely recommend buying.  Next time, I am ordering 2</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really tell you about the quality of it much  because i havent used it but when it came it wasn&#x27;t broken a little messy but not broken .... So that&#x27;s a plus</li>
            <li> I LOVED this! I purchased this on the Amazon website and it was cheaper on Amazon than on the City Colors website. I did also receive a black eyeliner crayon with my purchase which was wonderful. The palette has a darker contour color, a bronzer, and a highlighter. It goes on very well and the contour color stayed on all day for me. I have bought quite a few City Colors products and have been very pleased with the brand.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to everyone !!! Great pallet ..  nice for highlighting and contouring. Decent size and great colors. And what makes it a plus it&#x27;s that I got it on time</li>
            <li> great product.  i&#x27;m very new to the conturing game, this product provides instructions &amp; makes it very simple.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay product I honestly thought I&#x27;d like it more than I do.... my favorite has got to be the highlighter in the trio but as for the other 2 they are much too pigmented for my skin tone and not very blendable....which is a huge no when you want to contour. It could also be the types of primer or foundation that I wear but products work different for everyone this is just my experience. I&#x27;m not too upset though because the price is very reasonable for what you get.</li>
            <li> I love how it make my face look natural</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, as described</li>
            <li> i love this set really good</li>
            <li> I have a big set , but really you only need this, easy and don&#x27;t take too much room in traveling</li>
            <li> Very difficult to blend</li>
            <li> Colors worked well with my skin tone. It was very straightforward and easy for a beginner like me to get used to. It has a picture that shows you where people typically put the different shades on their face. I would definitely recommend this product! Also make sure you have a good set of brushes it makes the application that much easier.</li>
            <li> Still learning how to blend.</li>
            <li> It was what I wanted but when I received the package  it was all broke up.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this item 2 times and have received it perfectly this item is really good for it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> Love it but makes my face look bumpy breaks me out sometimes</li>
            <li> This pallate is really good , but sadly when I revieved it, it was broken :(</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for! Great for a professional entertainer that&#x27;s of color. Well packaged, applies easily &amp; beautifully. The application instructions are very clear. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and was glad it wasn&#x27;t mess up thanks</li>
            <li> I really like this product as it is easy to apply, comes with clear instructions, goes on smooth, and it is all neatly packed into 1 container. If you are looking for FULL coverage this would not be the product for you. This is medium at best.</li>
            <li> I tried to return but there&#x27;s no returns on this item. I thought it was cream based but it&#x27;s powder and it feels heavy when wearing it.</li>
            <li> This product is not worth $10. It is flyaway dust that doesn&#x27;t adhere to your skin and simply makes a giant mess.</li>
            <li> Loved it!!! I would totally compare this to the smash box version</li>
            <li> My dislike has nothing to do with the product and a lot with age.  Just a bit much for a wrinkled face. . . maybe for Halloween?</li>
            <li> Very good!!! buy one if you wants to be happy with your makeup</li>
            <li> This is not a good product for women of color, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> decieving marketing,I was ordering only Mac products.And this is not a Mac product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used Contour before. This was simple to apply and came with a picture guide on the inside. Plus youtube tutorials for City Color Contour Effects are available.</li>
            <li> Super easy to get contouring effects with this product.</li>
            <li> Looks exactly the same as the photo. Love the photo instructions on the box and worked well for my skin tone/ type</li>
            <li> Very pigmented and it&#x27;s know part of my daily makeup routine.</li>
            <li> Wonderful.  I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t show up on my dark skin, but took a chance. I love it and it even came with a lip color pencil as a gift.</li>
            <li> I did not like at all, not worth buying.</li>
            <li> Great product at great price!</li>
            <li> Love it!  Will definitely buy this again!  It is well packaged and perfect!</li>
            <li> it came broken but i culd not retur it now  im in the hospital since Feb wen i come out i hope it will be soon a will send it back can I????</li>
            <li> I love this palette! While reading reviews I saw how many people received a completely ruined and broken set and I was worried. But I took the chance since the price was great and it paid off! I got my palette two days later and it was perfect. Nothing was broken and the colours were exactly what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using a nice make up/face hydrating mist before applying this as it helps the make up set more naturally and makes it so you don&#x27;t have to touch up your face all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the colours are a little hard to blend into your natural skin tone. I usually use my finger to get rid of the harsh lines from the contour powder.</li>
            <li> AMAZING PRODUCT! SO PIGMENTED FOR A LOW PRICE!! EXTREMELY GLAD I FOUND IT😀</li>
            <li> Got it quick.. looks very nice...but the highlighter was broken to pieces when I got it..was bummed about that. All in all easy to use.</li>
            <li> Really great product!! Happy with the outcome and my first time buy</li>
            <li> Very good. The package was in good shape and its very good</li>
            <li> Perfect, totally wroth</li>
            <li> Okay, this IS a good product, yes. But I bought it for 7.50 here and found it at my local five below for cheaper. If you want to save a couple bucks, I&#x27;d suggest looking there first!</li>
            <li> I would buy this palette again. The color is just a little darker than I anticipated but it is easy to work with. For the price this product is great! I would give 5 stars if I didn&#x27;t have to re-apply quite as much but I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I USE THIS DAILY!!! Im new to contouring so this is perfect. It shows u on the front his to apply. I was nervous from the reviews because i thought it would be broken upon arrival but nope!! It was ready for use. Im almost out n need to order more. Bu give it try! U cant beat $7!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointing to receive this product broken and unusable!</li>
            <li> Such an amazing palette for this price!! I love it! And it arrived so fast!! Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> The contour was broken and all over the packaging when it arrived.  Disappointing.</li>
            <li> arrived on time and do the work!</li>
            <li> So far really nice just waiting on the perfect brushes</li>
            <li> Love the contour &amp; directions it comes with</li>
            <li> The two dark colors are so close to the same color you can&#x27;t tell them apart. and no applicator came with it. I naively assumed there would be something to apply it to my face with. :/</li>
            <li> The order was damaged</li>
            <li> Bought on thurs and recieved that Monday ! In perfect condition! None of the powders were broken ! Thanks again</li>
            <li> Before the brushes I ordered as well , but it&#x27;s okay because the product seems nice.</li>
            <li> Love this product.!! Specially if you are beginning to contour.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, but once recieved one out of the three contourin. Powdered was broken and all over the package.</li>
            <li> Got it today took about a week to make it to Dallas Texas. Great product. Great packaging. Large to medium size palette. About 5-7inches long.3 inches high.A little smaller than a brick.As thin as a iPad or two clip boards lol. Would of given 5 stars if the contour brush was included. Happy Friday 13th. Stay away from Lakes!!</li>
            <li> I loved it. The colors palletes are big and well pigmented</li>
            <li> The powder was broken and unusable on arrival. The colors seem to be as described but I was unable to remove the plastic due to the broken and crushed contouring powder. I would love to have tried it as it seems to be just what I was looking for and those who received the palette undamaged seemed to like it. I am disappointed but not that shocked at the condition of this palette since I read many reviews saying the same. I should have chosen a different set but this one seemed to fit my needs. The search continues.</li>
            <li> It came in broken had to return it.</li>
            <li> Very nice contour kit and got here in 3 business days! The only thing it doesn&#x27;t state is that the white (highlight) sorta has a shimmer to it, but other than that, it&#x27;s great! Can&#x27;t wait to use it!</li>
            <li> I am not big on makeup and purchased this to try it out before spending money on something else. In my uneducated opinion it works well enough, but it doesn&#x27;t blend as easily as I would have liked. The packaging is nice and compact and the quality of the product is probably about as good as you will get for the price.</li>
            <li> It came broken and unusable! It will also not let me return or exchange the project.</li>
            <li> Good. Learning still though.</li>
            <li> i like the highlighter.  Definitely adds some brightness to your look. The dark contour is a little dark but i use the bronzer and it works. Overall it is great!</li>
            <li> Good quality for its price.  Arrived promptly with no defects.</li>
            <li> I bought this long time ago and it&#x27;s still good to use and it&#x27;s fast shipping. Thank you</li>
            <li> I am new to the world of contouring. I just wanted to see what the fuss was about so I ordered this simple kit to try out . let me just say it is AMAZING for the quality and price .on the inside of the kit it tells you how to apply! With those easy to follow directions my results are posted below. I would definitely Recommend !</li>
            <li> This product was great! It was easy and even to apply</li>
            <li> I received the package nicely and I didn&#x27;t start wearing until like a week later because I didn&#x27;t have the right contouring brush but when I used it,  it made my face look good</li>
            <li> Good product overall but you can buy the exact same thing for no extra price (except maybe tax) at a Five Below store. It&#x27;s only $5 there and you get it as soon as you buy it</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this! The dark contour is a little bit too dark but the others are perfect. Will be purchasing again for sure.</li>
            <li> good product but it came broken.</li>
            <li> Nice brown tones but the highlight color is a bit to glittery. I wish it was more matte with a bit of shimmer</li>
            <li> The powder is a little clumpy.</li>
            <li> Highlight is not pigmented enough to work. It doesn&#x27;t blend well&lt;br /&gt; At all. But if you apply lightly  it works quite well. it came in clean and ready for use as well as on time.</li>
            <li> Very fun. I be practicing with it</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know it would be in powder form. None of the colors blend well.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect little go to contouring kits. I have struggled with trying to find a contouring color that worked with my skin tone that didn&#x27;t look like I had dirt on my face or appeared orangy. I&#x27;d recommend this for sure if you have olive/tan skin. Weird combination I know....</li>
            <li> It turns me orange. The high lighter is fine and the bronzer is okay if you only use the littlest bit but it makes me super orange</li>
            <li> I love this, I have no problems.</li>
            <li> Came in very fast and in perfect condition! Colors are great and very blend able. I was worried about the highlighter not showing up but nope it works great. I couldn&#x27;t be any happier with this contour kit and can&#x27;t beat the price!!</li>
            <li> Unusable broken in a thousand pieces&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Nice. Ordered 2, but one was. crushed.</li>
            <li> Upset that I couldn&#x27;t use this product.. Had to return because 2 out of the 3 were damaged</li>
            <li> When I received this product one of them was broken. ....need to ship better.... no one wants to purchase something and when they get it ,it&#x27;s broken</li>
            <li> I like the effects but the highlighter was broke and smashed</li>
            <li> Sold at 5 below for $5!!!! Horrible quality, face ended up shiny, makeup blended horribly.</li>
            <li> The highlight portion of this product was smashed when I received it. It makes it very difficult to use and on top of that it waste most of it when I try to use it.</li>
            <li> When I received this products the powders were all broken, was really excited to try this product :(  I would purchase again but don&#x27;t want another broken product. really upset</li>
            <li> Love it! Tells you exactly where to apply it etc</li>
            <li> Highlighter was broken into a million pieces when I received it.</li>
            <li> Does it come with brushes?</li>
            <li> The Contour Effects was so much better than I expected.  I no longer have to go through a full morning of putting makeup on, I just contour and go.!!!!!  This is the kind of make up I have been looking for many years and it took me 40 + years to find a seller to have what I needed....I am beyond pleased, and will be ordering one of the same colors for her, b/c she has just lost her husband and her face is coming back, and our plans are to make her beautiful (still) again!!!!  Thank you so very much!</li>
            <li> Works well. It came broken into little pieces though</li>
            <li> I was surprise when I received the shipment the contour was broking. The quality is really bad. I don&#x27;t recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product but I think for it being a contour kit it shouldn&#x27;t have such a glittery effect. My only real problem though is that for my skin tone which is light ivory, it was a bit to dark I think. But if you are going for a darker tone then it should work for you. I also think the bronze is a bit much.</li>
            <li> great item for beginners&lt;br /&gt;the highlighting powder does not blend well but when mixed with a base powder creates a nice natural glow rather than the over glossy white as it comes</li>
            <li> For the price, this was perfect! And fits nicely in my makeup bag!!! Makes contouring and highlighting so easy!!!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and has easy to use instructions</li>
            <li> Never received the correct item, I got an ink cartridge</li>
            <li> Very good palette but mine was broken upon arrival, so I had to fix it mysrlf</li>
            <li> I love this contour effects... One of my favorites !!</li>
            <li> The 2 brown colors are amazing for contouring; however, the highlither is really pigmented and shimmer than what I expected. I really don&#x27;t use it because I don&#x27;t like that is so pigmented. For it&#x27;s price I think it&#x27;s a pretty good kit!</li>
            <li> Too harsh to blend in skin. The only good one is the middle bronzer. It&#x27;s a nice warm tone. All others are awfulllll</li>
            <li> I love this product I use it with cream contouring sticks and this on top makes me look flawless</li>
            <li> This Contour kit is great for first learners in how to actually apply contouring and get the right effects. The instructions, on the inside of the kit top, show exactly where to place each one of the three wide circle encased make-ups and for what purpose. The major issue is that the colors are not right for African American skin, which I have. I needed to adjust and leave out the lightest color in order to achieve the desired affects. Once I figured that out, the contouring affects were great, and I knew what to do with other make-up used for the same purpose. The concept is awesome - and I can use the final color for another purpose. It should be a more universal set of colors, though, for contouring and highlighting, if it is going to be marketed to every woman.</li>
            <li> I love this palette, the colors are nice, just what I was looking for :)</li>
            <li> I love this contour kit works great just like the expensive brands I am so happy with this product</li>
            <li> i am very satisfield. thank yoi</li>
            <li> The white powder came shattered (which ironically was the shade I was most excited about).</li>
            <li> I just received this palette and it is all broken...not liking this since I paid for it</li>
            <li> I Love it ... it came in perfect condition...</li>
            <li> Worst experience , all broken</li>
            <li> I was nervous to order this product due to the mixed reviews of poor packaging but omg am I glad I went for it. This has taken my contouring to the next level!</li>
            <li> I am a dark skinned girl and I love this palette. However, you can get the exact same one at your local 5 Below. It&#x27;s only 5 dollars. This would be nice for you folks that are experiencing the contour powder being broken due to the shipping.</li>
            <li> great product. colors are pigmented and the highlight is really pretty. the product was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> The item was ok but it arrived half broken so i had to fixed it with alcohol.</li>
            <li> The white one was broken</li>
            <li> very pigmented, great for the price</li>
            <li> This was march darker than I expected -- in fact, I use the dark pallet color to color in my eyebrows rather than as a bronzer. Even using it lightly on my skin, it looks like a pretty definitive line. The white powder is nice for a highlighting effect though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I enjoy the colors in this, I just can&#x27;t use it with my skintone as I wanted to do. I&#x27;m fairly tan during the summer (though not cocoa brown tan), but I&#x27;d never be able to use these colors without a tan...</li>
            <li> First my palette came in good condition not chiped or broken. I would of definitely gave it 5 stars if the white wasn&#x27;t so glittery, I thought it was going to be matte color. If you go real light with it it will give you a shimmer look. Awesome beginner palette</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, thank you.</li>
            <li> I experienced difficultly blending the product.</li>
            <li> Loved the slimmer effects on cheek bones and highlights.</li>
            <li> Love it :) came in such perfect condition..</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery</li>
            <li> I have yet to use the product. I am very upset that the powders were all cracked. I am just going to throw this away. I was looking so forward to using this and learning to contour, then when I opened the package it looked awful due to the powders being cracked....</li>
            <li> The colors when I put them on make my face look pale</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t really what I expected, I wish it would blend in better than it does!</li>
            <li> My package came fine without any broken pallets. I like this contour but the colors are difficult to blend at times. I love the colors, but my skin is very very pale and any non-blended part sticks out like a sore thumb. Overall happy with it.</li>
            <li> The shipping was great. My palette came in one piece, no broken powders. Have not used the product, but can&#x27;t wait to try it out!</li>
            <li> Great for accenting and bringing out certain bone structures</li>
            <li> First time trying to highlight &amp; contour and it&#x27;s perfect especially for the price I&#x27;m so glad I tried it will definitely buy more of their products</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price! I was looking for something to try out and I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Love this, easy to apply, has a little graphic to help. I like it for a subtle contouring for the office.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and this is the perfect contour palette on a budget. It blends well and the highlight isn&#x27;t to overwhelming. I will buy again after I&#x27;m done with this one.</li>
            <li> I like the product, especially for the price.  I really like the brown and bronze for contouring, but I don&#x27;t love the white for highlighting.  There&#x27;s just something about it that&#x27;s just okay.  I have used other products that do a better job, but for the price, this is a really great product.</li>
            <li> no problems at all. im surprised it came intact lucky me.</li>
            <li> This made me look funny. After blending it made my skin look like I had 10 different shades. I know how to apply makeup and contour effects so I am not doing something wrong. This looks awful and I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> It came cracked :/&lt;br /&gt;The highlight part of the pallet was fully crumbled.</li>
            <li> Have not tried...but love the packaging and the informational cover explaining usage.</li>
            <li> Quality appears cheap and powdery. Doesn&#x27;t feel like it adheres to the skin well.  It doesn&#x27;t create any contour effects.</li>
            <li> I recommend this it blends easily just love love it!</li>
            <li> Product was like described. high quality and arrived early.</li>
            <li> I like this product but it was a bit dark for my complexion</li>
            <li> I use this product on both my mother (who is a white woman), and myself (biracial light skinned woman), the product is super easy to apply and ultimately gives your face a beautiful look. I already have naturally high cheekbones but my mother does not, this product really makes her cheekbones pop and she always asks to borrow the palette! I would recommend to anyone who is beginning makeup because of the top part having instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW it shipped pretty fast!</li>
            <li> Its not bad. Haven&#x27;t used the bronzer because i have a preferred one. But the contouring powder is good. Only thing is i wish the gighliggter stood out more.</li>
            <li> White part came broken. Otherwise it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> Received a damaged contour kit!</li>
            <li> Really pigmented barley need to touch your brush to the pallet but was to dark for my skin tone I&#x27;m tan so I suggest something lighter</li>
            <li> Contour and bronzer are very pigmented, the highlight I&#x27;m not really a fan of.</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be a cream instead its a powder</li>
            <li> received damaged. loose powder everywhere. disappointed</li>
            <li> This contour effects are really cool.. Easy to apply and feels good... The packaged was very simple, no damaged at all and the tones are very pretty. The price are kind of cheap.. The quality is not the best, but it work very well.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time but received the white colored highlight broken the other two were fine.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this palette! A lot of people complained that they got theirs back opened and broken, but mine came in good shape and tightly compacted 5 stars!! :)</li>
            <li> The contouring color is not a universal color, and is way too dark for my fair skin. It wasn&#x27;t chalky and I found it easy to blend, but I probably won&#x27;t use it again. I ordered a higher quality contour palette and we will see how that measures up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also came intact which I&#x27;m guessing is rare according to the reviews.</li>
            <li> Everything came messy and all over the place</li>
            <li> Wrong product:Received corrective concealer palette instead... isn&#x27;t even the same brand</li>
            <li> Love it! Shipping was on point and I use it a lot! Wasn&#x27;t broken like some other reviews. Definitely worth it! Even gives you a little diagram on how to contour which was super helpful. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> I received the item all crushed up and unusable. Very disappointed with item :(</li>
            <li> I received the product and it was a mess. The middle circle had broken into many little pieces and there was dust from it on the other two products. I am not pleasedw with this at all. The instructions are well but the product does not apply easy and does not stay on.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. It performs exactally as I expected.</li>
            <li> I have very light skin and this is perfect. I love the contouring guide provided on the package.</li>
            <li> Love it! It&#x27;s so much easier to use this powder versus cream countour kits</li>
            <li> I currently have this kit and I was very disappointed at the fact that the dark shade crumbled. From other reviews I see that this is something that&#x27;s common with this product. Yet, you get what you pay for. Other than that....I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the pigmentation. The transition shade hardly picked up on the brushes yet the highlight color was extremely bright. The contour shade well...that&#x27;s gone. So there you have it.</li>
            <li> I thought the product would be Creamy. and when I got it in the mail the highlighter was broken :(</li>
            <li> Amazing count our palette!!!</li>
            <li> This product is more pigmented and better quality than an urban decay palette I have and I love it! This is definitely better for those who have lighter skin, though.</li>
            <li> This contour is so smooth to apply on skin and it brings out my cheekbones. The lipstick that came with it is also a beautiful color!</li>
            <li> BUY IT IN FIVE BELOW FOR ONLY $5 !!!&lt;br /&gt;I really love this product but for $5 its more worth it then on amazon ;D</li>
            <li> Contour is darker than expected and highlight is lighter than expected when applied. I ended up having to put powder over the contour. Have to really get it on my brush to be able to apply it. Not a horrible buy, perfect for beginners I guess? but wouldn&#x27;t buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: I have very light skin so if you have darker skin it may work better for you</li>
            <li> My sister bought this palette from five below and it was 5 dollars only !</li>
            <li> More colors than I needed, but I am sure if I play with it more, I can come up with some blending that could use more.</li>
            <li> Works great, just be gentle with it. Mine got tossed around and it broke the powder went everywhere</li>
            <li> I love this product I bought it from five below. The price on here is crazy but it&#x27;s a great product especially for black people :)</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start with the packaging - this palette is in a cardboard palette format.  I&#x27;m not very fond of this type of packaging but the product gets no dings on this.  Pan size is smaller than expected but not tiny, the pans are shallow and if you are a regular wearer of bronzer/contour- like myself you will probably hit pan rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the contour is a little too brown, not any gray undertones so to me this just looks like you&#x27;re trying to use bronzer for contour.&lt;br /&gt;The bronzer is a nice color but you&#x27;ll have a heck of a time correcting anything too heavy so use with a light hand and build up.&lt;br /&gt;The highlight is just a very flat white, I don&#x27;t like shimmer or glow as a rule but the flatness of this totally matte white does nothing for my highlight areas.</li>
            <li> It arrived very quickly and I was excited until I open it and see that it is broken.... Disappointed and wasted my&lt;br /&gt;Money for nothing.</li>
            <li> The product was damaged when I received it so not only did I pay double the listed price on the manufacturer website but I cannot use...powder is EVERYWHERE!</li>
            <li> The powder is so light, it easily overfills the applicator brush thus wasting a lot of product. However, I do like the look and feel.</li>
            <li> Simple, no-fuss contour palette. I think the colors and quality are great for price. So far very impressed!!</li>
            <li> Works so well! I also use the contour as eyebrow shadow</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I bought this product because there were so many bad reviews, but I absolutely love it. The bronzer is probably my Favourite thing in the palette. The highlighter is something that you should use sparingly because it is very light and if you use too much you will have to blend for a long time, it even doubled as a nice eyeshadow, and I use it to highlight my brow one as well. The contour shade is perfect for casting shadows along the jawline to give that chiseled look. I am a beginner and my friends think my contour skills are on point. The pallets can work on practically any skin tone, the time of look you get depends on how much of the product you use and how well you blend. And mine came in perfect condition. Would I buy it again? Of course, mainly because I&#x27;m in love with the bronzer and I&#x27;ve practically hit pan.  This was a win for me especially because it was affordable and it was so easy for me (a beginner to use) and the diagram on the inside sure does help.</li>
            <li> Id love this but when i received it the highlighter was cracked was really disappointed because it is a good palette and its cheap good quality but was broken and the highlighter was the main reason i bought it</li>
            <li> Received the wrong product. Irritated.</li>
            <li> White makeup pallet was broken and crumbled when I got it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this product. It doesn&#x27;t blend well at all. I lost $$$</li>
            <li> Great for quick contouring. Powder works well with liquid foundation/concealer but isn&#x27;t bad with a powder foundation as it&#x27;s easy to blend.</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it. Works well for just starting out with contouring.</li>
            <li> Great makeup!!! A MUST in your face!!!</li>
            <li> Love it already can&#x27;t wait to use it</li>
            <li> This was my first contouring product that I have tried and although I broke the dark powder (completely my fault) I still use it. I believe you can use it on any skin tone. You would just need to apply it lighter or darker as needed.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the highlighter as it&#x27;s meant for (contouring) because it&#x27;s a bit shimmery for me. But I use it to define my brows and it works awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all it&#x27;s a great starter Contour kit.</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like picture, new to contouring so I&#x27;m not sure how I like it yet but all the powders show nicely and look good on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love it.. Great lil set.. Came in one piece too *thumbs up* :) thank you</li>
            <li> this product is amazing., first contour and best so farand price is great..this is my first time doing contour and i luv it..  i would definetely recommend this to everyone out there..</li>
            <li> Works great for me and I&#x27;m a beginner.</li>
            <li> Came broken but whatevs you should expect that when buying powered products online</li>
            <li> Works very well goes onto to skin easily. You only have to use a small amount . I love to add the bronzer to my cheeks to give me a warm look . Easy to blend. I would recommend only using foundation brushes to apply and use a blush brush to blend. This is a powder so a sponge would not work that well</li>
            <li> AMAZING product, especially for the cost. I might actually purchase another one very soon.</li>
            <li> Good deal for a highly pigmented contour pallet.</li>
            <li> Love the coverage and color</li>
            <li> I gave this product five stars because it&#x27;s easy to apply and does exactly what it is discribed to do. However, since I have sensitive skin it did cause me some irritation. Other then that it really is a great product to use to contour your face. Please remeber that all skin types are diffrent...</li>
            <li> Came in very quickly. No damaged or anything. Packaged very well. Works awesome too!</li>
            <li> The high lighter is terrible. It does nothing</li>
            <li> The palette exterior holder is a lot thinner quality thinner quality than I expected. For the interior, the palette didn&#x27;t seem to have as great of an appearance as it does in the pictures; however, the quality of the make up itself was actually pretty good! It&#x27;s light on the skin, and doesn&#x27;t make you feel greasy. Im pretty satisfied. Though, depending on the type of brush you use, just be careful on getting the powder all over the place.  Overall, pretty nice contouring palette! (Also I received this item pretty fast!)</li>
            <li> Glowy finish and very natural looking if done right.</li>
            <li> This is the best coutour palette. I will order this again</li>
            <li> Works great but it is a powder not a cream</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is any good, if arrived crushed. Should  get a better shipping process.</li>
            <li> 2 Pallets were broken</li>
            <li> The highlight was a little cracked but still usable! Love the colors</li>
            <li> I received it yesterday and instantly had to check it out. I love it! I&#x27;m very light skinned, so I was worried the colors would be too dark on me, but they were perfect. I will say this, there can be very easy fallout, so just prepare for that. That&#x27;s the only complaint. The colors are beautiful and pigmented. The highlighter is probably my favorite. It looks beautiful on the skin and truly brings focus to whatever part it is you&#x27;re highlighting. Oh, and thank God mine wasn&#x27;t delivered all broken.</li>
            <li> I am a certified makeup artist, and I believe the City Color Contour Effects palette is a value beyond compare.&lt;br /&gt;The highlighter is luminescent, but not white and ghostly.&lt;br /&gt;The bronzer is a nice medium matte bronze or good for contouring on fair skin.&lt;br /&gt;The dark contour is nice and dark, but not vampirish. It has great color payoff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are better than much more expensive palettes. It&#x27;s a must-buy for the novice or experienced makeup enthusiast.</li>
            <li> The white part is very shimmery, not matte color like rest</li>
            <li> Pretty good product for the price.</li>
            <li> I thought this palette was going to be like a concealer formula but ITS POWDER!!! I use the bronzer over my foundation and use the highlight under my brow but that&#x27;s not what I bought this for. This is everything but a contour kit!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it does. Great tutorials.</li>
            <li> Now, I am in no way an expert, but I am a Makeup Enthusiast and a free lance Makeup Artist. If you were to studying briefly you&#x27;ll notice that the negative comments about the palette are either coming from customers who received a BROKEN UP palette (who should obviously &amp; totally blame the sender for their carelessness in packaging), and the other side of the negative comments reside from a few fellow customers who aren&#x27;t using the palette to their advantage, they don&#x27;t know how to apply the powders exactly, or they just can not blend the product. Which is totally fine if the product isn&#x27;t for you. But be honest with your reasonings. I myself, am an African American young woman and I find the palette to be in my favor. Sure, for some women of the same race you may not use all of the colors. But seriously speaking, who uses all of the colors right away? It&#x27;s a learning and &amp;#34;owning it&amp;#34; process. Be careful to not go off of the judgement of others until your own judgment is made final.</li>
            <li> the packaging is bad..item cracked</li>
            <li> REALLY GREAT PRODUCT FOR CHEAP PRICE!</li>
            <li> It came in just like the picture and i havent used it but it is good contour</li>
            <li> This is extremely pigmented!! Which is great and it blends easily. It arrived in perfect condition , not broken at all.</li>
            <li> Really love the texture of the product easy to blend love it</li>
            <li> It arrived just as seen in the photo, with no broken parts but in perfect conditions, this is my ideal contourn palette and at this price the best! Very happy with my purchase, I recommend to anyone looking for a simple but a good palette.</li>
            <li> Love this product for learning how to contour.</li>
            <li> Only used once, but i love it. Getting my makeup game on fleek.&lt;br /&gt;Lol, I hate that word btw.</li>
            <li> The darkest color was essentially black on my skin... but as long as I use a really light hand, it looks OK. The highlight powder was amazing, shows up really well. Bronze was great also.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally worth it... I was looking for some name brand Kits but was on tight budget so I bought this and I loved it... it has good pigmentation and I would refer it to others for sure</li>
            <li> First off, the powder is very chalky and falls off the brush. When I applied it to my skin, the brush strokes were visible and little lines of pigments stuck to my skin. It does not last very long nor does it look natural. I tried to return the palette but it wasn&#x27;t eligible for returns...highly disappointed. You&#x27;re better off buying the BH Cosmetics contour palette for $12.</li>
            <li> Really enhances natural color.  Light feel, and really smooth.</li>
            <li> When I got it the highlight was all crumbly. 😕</li>
            <li> Really great product, very pigmented and very easy to blend!</li>
            <li> I like this contour palette just that the colors on it are so good that applying too much on the brush and onto your face will look bad...so use lightly!</li>
            <li> This palette just doesn&#x27;t have the pigment some other palettes have. Also on my light skin the Highlighting color is useless. I also find that I have to use more of the darker color because of the lack of pigment. This palette is ok, but i don&#x27;t think I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Received packages thank you</li>
            <li> the colors go nice with my fair skin. its just really hard to blend out once part o it hits my skin it will stay that way.</li>
            <li> Really good product and amazing price :)</li>
            <li> Just so you know it is not cream, it&#x27;s a powder contour kit</li>
            <li> Very disappointing to receive this product broken and unusable!</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE!!! received the product right away,  in prefect condition. I read other reviews where product arrived broken. However, that was not the case for mine. Tried it out and am amazed @ the difference. I normally don&#x27;t wear makeup all over my face but I love that this enhances your features.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy that I purchased this, it has everything I need in one palette that is slim and compact easy to travel with. The colors are very true to what&#x27;s in the pan , good color payoff , creamy texture with little fall out . The colors are wonderful for every skin tone from fair to dark, for the fairer skin tones I would just use a light hand with your brush. This palette comes with a contour shade to define your features, a bronzer to warm up the skin and a highlight to bring a glow to certain parts of your skin. I have also purchased other products from this brand and I have not been disappointed with any of them they have great quality products.</li>
            <li> The lighter tone has a lot of glitter... I thought it was matte palette.</li>
            <li> One of my best countouring kit. Thanks(;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very shiny and shimmery when you put it on but I use it everyday</li>
            <li> i love this!!! i have been looking for a contour shade dark enough to show, and this is the perfect color. the bronzer is great as well to blend the contour with. i haven&#x27;t used the highlight because i love my MAC soft &amp; gentle, but i will always be using this contour shade for that beautiful definition on my cheeks. I bought 3!!!</li>
            <li> Came in good condition  was scared because of the reviews I give it 5 stars :)</li>
            <li> Came broken , wouldn&#x27;t recommend to buy this product online.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented . Good value for the price .</li>
            <li> when i purchased this i got the palette perfectly but when i opened it the highlighter was crushed. i still use the bronze and contour tho</li>
            <li> Loved this product. Perfect for contouring.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for something diff. I don&#x27;t like the way it appears on my skin. I use the Kim Kardashian tutorial but I still don&#x27;t like the way it looks. :(</li>
            <li> This is a great product.. Love it!</li>
            <li> Came before scheduled delivery and arrived very well wrapped &amp; in tact (had my fingers crossed). Product is excellent for value!</li>
            <li> I had to return it  because  it was damaged. Power all over the place. Very poorly packaged.</li>
            <li> Terrible I&#x27;m so disappointed in it coming messed up I want my money back</li>
            <li> Not happy at all! When my package arrived it was all broke up and the directions aren&#x27;t very good, definitely will be finding this product else where.</li>
            <li> Sucks. Mine was broken, makeup was in pieces. /:</li>
            <li> The high lighter part was broken</li>
            <li> It was completely broken inside. You get what you pay for I guess, but it went straight in the garbage upon arrival. :(</li>
            <li> Loved it! Came on time and looked great , nothing was broken!</li>
            <li> Best contour pallete ever !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot of great things about this product and I&#x27;m sure the product itself is amazing. I was so excited to receive it just to find out both the darker contour and highlight were broken! I wish it was packaged better. I want to reorder, but I&#x27;m afraid it will break again.</li>
            <li> Love it and it&#x27;s cheap. Highly pigmented excellent quality, easy to blend. The highlighter is amazing, couldn&#x27;t believe it when I used it.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in perfect condition. Contouring kit is great for aspiring MUA&#x27;s or anyone that wants to play around with highlighting and contouring without investing too much money. I would most definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> love the palette but when I received it in the mail most of the powders were busted</li>
            <li> Great seller, great product</li>
            <li> Very easy to use has directions to help assist.</li>
            <li> Well it came on time it just a mess when u open it</li>
            <li> the only reason why i give this a 4 star instead of a 2 or 3 is because i love how it wears but the darkest color was mostly broken the seller has to work on that !&lt;br /&gt;i love the product overall though and blend out amazing</li>
            <li> Thank you for the free lipstick</li>
            <li> Broken.&lt;br /&gt;Edit:&lt;br /&gt;Yes it came very broken but this item is still very good. I use what&#x27;s left everyday and it contours beautifully and is lightweight and smooth.  It&#x27;s also easy to use worth the contour guide right on the case.  The shipping is the only issue</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be small but it&#x27;s big, love it!</li>
            <li> I will be ordering these again I love this contour effects. I never try them before and these stay put on my face.</li>
            <li> This Item Came BROKEN . You&#x27;d think after reading all the bad reviews, you would fix the problem.&lt;br /&gt;So much for being excited.</li>
            <li> Nice and lightweight contour kit for getting started! I love the highlighting color.</li>
            <li> This could be bought at Five and Below for FIVE DOLLARS so this is not a good deal. Also if you are darkskin dont get this product it makes your skin look ashy.</li>
            <li> The colors are a little darker than what is actually pictured. Thankfully, they work well with my skin tone, especially since it&#x27;s summer time. The product gets picked up very easily by a brush, so you do have to be careful about that. The colors are nice, I really like the highlighter when I thought it would be way to light. All colors are matte, and blend really well. I am a beginner in contouring, and the instructions inside the pallet were very helpful. It really gives a nice natural look. My makeup was packaged securely, and did not break or crack in transit. So far very pleased with this item. I am definitely thinking this will be a continuous purchase.</li>
            <li> If I could give it no stars I would, it&#x27;s came completely broken. It would be worth the 10 dollars BUT it is crushed and unusable so disappointed</li>
            <li> I like this. one of the better contouring powders that are cheap.</li>
            <li> It is a powder contour kit. The highlighter is very strong. A little goes a long way. It came in nice wrapping and it was larger than I expected. Nice product, also comes with directions on where to apply.</li>
            <li> WOW this is a winner, contoured as expected, and I love the diagram on the package, makes knowing where to apply very easy!</li>
            <li> Came with prime really great but it is powder.</li>
            <li> Love it! I could not believe how cheap this was, and such a good product! 10 stars!</li>
            <li> Why did I buy this? Seriously, what am I dumb or something? If you have skin that&#x27;s dry, easily irritated, or ezxema come on what are you doing shopping for cheap stuff to put on your skin?   I&#x27;m use to wearing higher quality make up. I forgot what happens when i put the wrong stuff on my face, apparently. After two applications this make up had my entire face covered in a rash.  The contouring diagram was helpful even though I had to return the product.  It doesn&#x27;t included brushes and the colors have sparkles in them which make it awkward to use to contour - shines like shiny eye shadow. It&#x27;s been three weeks since I used this product and my skin is still healing.</li>
            <li> Is for dark skin my sking is light and i looked awful  with this colors.&lt;br /&gt;I dont think  that they specific  say on the description  how dark the color are</li>
            <li> its really dramatic and dark</li>
            <li> great contouring kit!</li>
            <li> Love the colors I get compliments on my flawless makeup all the time</li>
            <li> Came on  time,,,,happy with product!</li>
            <li> unless you have much darker skin, the contouring is far too dark. I am a beige in the summer (classic ivory in the winter) and this looked horrible on me. I like the bronzer and highlighter but cannot use the contouring. Maybe as a brow powder??</li>
            <li> SOOOOO worth the money. I was not willing to pay $25+ for a contour kit, and I am so happy I did my research and found this gem. I know it doesn&#x27;t have 6 or 8 colors, but honestly, I&#x27;m not working on other people; this is all I need. I am totally happy with this product. I am fair skinned and can still use the darkest shade for contouring (with a very light hand and good blending). This palette is insanely pigmented and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was really afraid that it would break in the mail by looking at the reviews but it came with no issue at all. Got in in 2 days.</li>
            <li> as ordered as stated. thank you</li>
            <li> The caked powder disintegrated on its very own very soon after I got it! I keep in in my bathroom in an organizer, and use it maybe once in the mornings; it never fell or anything...the white color just cracked up! I am very disappointed.! I am giving it 3 starts because the product shattered on its own.</li>
            <li> very simple palette nice in the face. it arrived safely they package it in a very safe way. i love this product</li>
            <li> Mine came all broken :(</li>
            <li> it didnt blend at all and made my face look dirty</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous with the mixed reviews on this but was pleasantly surprised. Came in wrapped perfectly, not broken up or damaged as some people received, I am new to contouring so  I think its a great starter product for beginners who are learning and don&#x27;t want to spend so much on a high end set.</li>
            <li> Received it as a gift. I didn&#x27;t love it but I like it for it was given by a dear friend.</li>
            <li> I thought it was matte but no its all powder.</li>
            <li> love this product it contours so beautifully love it!</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous to buy this wih the mixed reviews but it came in and was not broken at all! The price as well is wonderful! I already am going to buy a few more to have on hand!</li>
            <li> Great product .I was a bit concerned that it would arrive broken,but it didn&#x27;t. It was well packaged, I&#x27;m super excited to use it</li>
            <li> Great quality, shipping was quick</li>
            <li> Love it!  :-)  Im a cosmetologist in training &amp; just learning how to contour correctly.  This little palette is the perfect starter &amp; has been of great help in my contouring perfection.  ;-)</li>
            <li> I am not sure what happened but they were crushed when they arrived.</li>
            <li> The product is good, but the contouring shade is hard to blend. It looks like a dark line and no matter how hard you brush over it, it won&#x27;t go away. The bronzer and highlighter are OK.</li>
            <li> The package came on time which was great, but just like some of the reviews it came broken.</li>
            <li> colors are very pigmented, it was shipped perfectly however i wish the colors looked more natural.</li>
            <li> Was not as I expected.</li>
            <li> Beautiful I must say.... came perfect... love it</li>
            <li> This is a great contour kit. The colors are powder, and very pigmented.  I use it everyday and love it</li>
            <li> To begin with, this is dust and not matte as I thought. It looks more like eyeshadow than anything. I would not recommend it</li>
            <li> I gave it 5 stars cause this product is exactly what I wanted! This is amazing best contouring makeup I have ever used!</li>
            <li> great product delivery was fast and the product does what its meant to do.</li>
            <li> Really love it. .. works great. . And it was delivered  quickly</li>
            <li> I like that it has a guide on it, because I&#x27;m just learning how to contour so that&#x27;s actually really helpful. The product itself has a nice pigmentation to it. Works well for my skin tone, which is very fair but not quite porcelain, doesn&#x27;t look unnatural and people did think my face looked thinner. I would recommend it, for sure. Mine did NOT come damaged.</li>
            <li> Colors look great, but powder was all broken up.</li>
            <li> Great ONE!! Enjoy using everyday:)</li>
            <li> I love this product! I saw a Smashbox compact very similar to this one at Sephora and wanted something I could try without the $45 price tag. While it probably isn&#x27;t the same quality, I have no complaints about this compact. The colors are perfect for layering with blush on my olive skin tone. It makes everyday contouring very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that the top does not snap into place; it&#x27;s a magnetic cardboard. I haven&#x27;t had any issues because I&#x27;m careful with my makeup, but I could easily see the compact opening if jostled and then all three powders would get everywhere. If you don&#x27;t mind this, the compact is wonderful for everyday use or if you want to try contouring on a budget!</li>
            <li> I love this palette but its too expensive on here.I bought it at Five Below for less than $5. It fell apart after a while so 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I really love this but only if it camr with the brush</li>
            <li> I ordered on the 22nd. It was shipped out on the 23rd, and I got it today. 5-25-15. I was shocked it came so fast. I didn&#x27;t pay anything extra for fast shipping. My palette came in perfect condition and I  tryed it out right away. It blends well and looks great on my super pale skin. I wasn&#x27;t quite sure about the quality because of the price. But it has exceeded my expectations. I would recommended this for sure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never contoured before so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on something that I wasn&#x27;t sure I really wanted or needed to use all the time. The contour color is very dark on my fair skin, however when used in moderation, it works perfectly for what I like. The colors are highly pigmented and work well for the intended use. But you get what you pay for, it&#x27;s not a professional kit or anything. But well worth the money, I think. My only complaint is that the second you touch your face, this product will wipe off.&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned because a lot of the other reviews said their item arrived broken. So I really liked that my item came bubble wrapped and undamaged.</li>
            <li> When i opened the package.  It was broken into pieces,  nothing left just a mess</li>
            <li> Love this bag. Fits a lot of makeup and brushes are tucked away and ready for use. Will purchase again for a friend.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and it&#x27;s easy to blend!</li>
            <li> The contour was very hard to blend and just ended up looking weird at the end. The highlight was absolutely gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Chalky does not blend well, makes you break out</li>
            <li> Awesome, has instructions and all</li>
            <li> I love playing the this contouring kit.  Easy to use and great results!</li>
            <li> this kit I love. it&#x27;s simple and blends well</li>
            <li> This was my first venture into the contouring world and OH.MY.GOD. this is so easy and quick to use.  It blends super well and they even give newbies a little guideline on the back.  I will definitely repurchase this and would recommend this to EVERYONE!</li>
            <li> I was excited about receiving this, but then I opened it and it was already broken so I haven&#x27;t tried it. I am disappointed that most of the reviews were true about that.</li>
            <li> No complaints. Nicely pigmented.</li>
            <li> i recieved this exteremely early in perfect condition! it works really well &amp; i will definitely buy it again :))</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t blend well but I like the bronzer other than that its poop</li>
            <li> mine came with the Bronze and Highlight completely damaged which was very dissapointing, however a really nice agent from Amazon named Oscar offered a refund to me since the product could not be exchanged. If this happens to anyone else try empting up the products and addsome ethylical alcohol and mix, let it dry and after that it will work, of course not as good as its supposed to.</li>
            <li> Product was broken to pieces when I received it</li>
            <li> contouring is something I just started to do and I love the chart on the inside of the cover!!! HELPS ME LEARN</li>
            <li> Wonderful! It&#x27;s very smooth powder! Contours wonderfully!! (: I&#x27;d buy it again and again!</li>
            <li> It came perfectly fine. Although I thought it was cream and its not that&#x27;s my bad. Other than that it came fast and safe. havent used it yet</li>
            <li> I use this everyday. I love it. It will last you a good while.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t try it yet but I just know this will beat my face real good!!</li>
            <li> Mine wasn&#x27;t broken. The one thing I didn&#x27;t know it is a powder. The white ( the one used for highlighting) is mostly glidder . You have to keep putting it on in order to be white white</li>
            <li> This is the First time I have had a contour kit but from what I know the product should be more of a foundation texture and this product is powder its hard to blend and you have to apply foundation first i wouldn&#x27;t recommend it I think there is a better kit you could get that works better with blending. this product is so difficult to blend.</li>
            <li> For the price, the product is not bad. The bronze powder is very orange. I really only use the contour powder which can be difficult to blend. The highlight is basically a white powder with very little shimmer. Overall, it&#x27;s not a terrible product to have while saving up for a better contour kit.</li>
            <li> love it I will buy it again</li>
            <li> Super great. Came with more than expected. Fast shipping. It was also tightly packaged so that nothing was wrecked.</li>
            <li> Nice little kit for beginners</li>
            <li> This a great Starter Kit for beginners. It is super easy to apply and stays on great.</li>
            <li> it came in 3 days! perfect .</li>
            <li> Love this. It&#x27;s cheap, but comes in a nicely made pallet. The colors are very well pigmented and the guide is very helpful. Arrived quickly, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to try this and luckily nothing was broken!</li>
            <li> If you never done contour.&lt;br /&gt;Start here. It&#x27;s the perfect item or gift for somebody just getting started!&lt;br /&gt;Sleek packaging. Wonderful guide.</li>
            <li> This palette is really nice.. if you have a dark skin tone! I have porcelain ivory skin, and I was looking for a contouring palette to accentuate my features. It came earlier than expected which was great! It is possible for me to use it, but I have to apply it very lightly and build it up. The instructions on the inside of the palette create a good look, but I hope to find some other great techniques as well! I highly suggest this palette!</li>
            <li> Nice colors. Highlight was broken.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the right product!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the contour effects powder palette with the highlight, bronzer and contour. But instead I got the contour &amp; correct cream palette :-/&lt;br /&gt;This is just ridiculous!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, perfect colors for contouring :) love it !</li>
            <li> It was better than expected for the money.</li>
            <li> I haved order this product and I receive right away with no damage. I love using it. I will recommend this....</li>
            <li> Awsome!! Very happy with the product plus dilivery date/time was great, very punctual. I have already used it and it works amazingly for only $6.95 you can&#x27;t beat it. Not bad at all im getting ready to purchase 2 more for my sisters.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a chance to use this a few times now. My skin is pretty light and I&#x27;m new to this contouring business so the contour shade is definitely too dark for me even with a very light hand. The bronzer shade is awesome and will be getting lots of use. The highlighter at first is a little powdery and once you blend it in its almost gone but it IS able to be layered to how you want it. Overall i think this is a good product for somebody curious about or new to contouring.</li>
            <li> Received and the make up was broken.</li>
            <li> item was broken and all over the place. It looked like it was sold like that</li>
            <li> Good but I don&#x27;t like the way it shows up on my skin completion.</li>
            <li> I loved this it came wraped around 3 layers lf bubble wrap 😁😁 wich im happy about because i was hoping it wouldnt get here broken.! And it didnt :3 if ure planning on buying this and are scared of it coming broken i bought it off kolorizeme.! I recommend to buy it from them. Also very soft and pigmented :3</li>
            <li> This is a great beginners contour palette! The colors are very pigmented and they last. And for the price you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even get to try the product! Two of the three powders were completely cracked and unusable on arrival. All I can say is it&#x27;s a good thing I didn&#x27;t spend too much money on it. What a waste!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the powder kind, used it twice already fades after an hour of wearing it.</li>
            <li> This item arrived broken despite good packaging.  I was disappointed as the product appears very hard and you have to really rub the different parts to get powdery product to apply.  This was relatively inexpensive for the amount of product provided, however, this was my first experience with a multiple product package and I would not try again unless it was a name brand.  It is a good practice item though but definitely should have sent it back since it was damaged when it arrived but I didn&#x27;t as there was no paperwork accompanying it.</li>
            <li> Delivered right on time. Haven&#x27;t used it yet but i did a swatch on my wrist. The colors seem to blend well with my skin tone (pale with pink undertones). The dark contour color seems to take a bit of work to blend but with some practice I think it will work well. The highlight did come in pieces. If it cost more I would make a bigger deal out of it but with the price and the fact I can still use it I won&#x27;t complain too much. Overall I am satisfied with my order.</li>
            <li> Awesome, have had many complements</li>
            <li> Only used it once, not too bad. It&#x27;s great to use to practice contouring, other than that get a higher quality contour kit if you really want to try something new. Preferably go to your local make up store for a professional to teach you how to do certain make up tricks and treat yourself to some make up!</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this I had read all the bad reviews and how it was broken and I thought oh well maybe that won&#x27;t happen to me. NOOOOO!!! It did happen and I was pretty upset. I am so glad to have amazonprime and this was returned with out a hassle. Sadly I don&#x27;t have my makeup. Oh well, you live and you learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. I saw pictures of the other broken items and they all seem to be broken on the same side (contour side). Funny.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. When I received my package, my highlight was all crumbled up and seeping over into the bronzer and contour....so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I purchased this kit! I was looking for a contouring color that was not too warm (most all of them out there are - trust me, I have searched far and wide) and that would also not break my budget. The contouring and bronzing colors work great on my somewhat fair, autumn-toned skin. Another plus is that the contouring and bronzing colors are COMPLETELY MATTE (as they should be to achieve the desired effect).  The only con for this kit is that I personally prefer a matte highlighter as well. If this highlighter is used very, very lightly, you will not look like a disco ball...I still prefer to use Maybelline&#x27;s Dream Lumi Touch for highlighting, however. Anyway, for 10 bucks, 2 out of three is not bad! Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Loose product falls out every time..darker colors are great but the light color doesn&#x27;t show up on me so it doesn&#x27;t work for me as intended.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time as promised all in one piece. Works well, this is the first contouring kit I have purchased so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to but I like it.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t last and it&#x27;s not the easiest way to contour. Overall, it&#x27;s an OK product.</li>
            <li> Contouring is my love</li>
            <li> Good deal for the price, however the highlighter is literally stark white. I would prefer a cream colored or more natural highlight.  This one only works if you are Snow White.....  Still the other 2 colors work for a wide range of skin tones including darker-skinned lovelies as well.</li>
            <li> This may not be the best product to use if you&#x27;re African American that&#x27;s a darker skin tone (Take it from me lol)</li>
            <li> Be sure to read about the highlight its NOT matte it&#x27;s fulllll of sparkles!</li>
            <li> was a gift to my daughter who is a makeup junkie ! And it made her happy  ! So I give it an extra star for that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a novice when is comes to this stuff it gives good instructions</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t got to use this item yet but I did think it was going to be more creamy but its more like a powder so I&#x27;ll see what happens it came in not broken up as others have said mine came in perfectly wrapped</li>
            <li> Everything is great, except it came in broken. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the white, it is too white and doesnt blend well. The oher 2 colors work well though.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when i got this product. it came damaged so i had to return it. The product itself i cannot give you a proper review.</li>
            <li> came with the highlighting powder missing. the contour powder looks very muddy on the skin. I like the bronzer though</li>
            <li> My package arrive fairly quick however I received the product came damaged</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!! I received it all broken. Never buying again.</li>
            <li> Love it love it! And especially for the price !!</li>
            <li> Colors are way to dark. Hard to blend and to thick.</li>
            <li> I received my product about a week late, but other than that it&#x27;s a really good contouring kit. The highlight is perfect it&#x27;s not a dull white it a real pretty yet subtle shimmer and the colors blend well. Very happy with my city colors!!</li>
            <li> When I was looking at the comments I saw that many came broken. I was nervous buying this, when I received the package I opened it up and it was all in tact. The reason why I gave it three stars was because when I applied it on I could not blend it. The makeup made me look like a stripped cat or tiger. The Palette also broke my skin out so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if your skin breaks out easily.</li>
            <li> Great product!! I love it</li>
            <li> I really like the bronzer in this palette it is very nice color on me. The highlighter wasn&#x27;t that great in my opinion it has a bit of a chalky appearance. The contour color I probably won&#x27;t use because it is very very dark and didn&#x27;t blend as well as the other two,</li>
            <li> Mine arrived in perfect condition. I didn&#x27;t get broken in transit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m a huge fan of the product. The contour color is a little too dark for my tastes  - no matter how lightly I try to apply it. The bronze is decent but I think the real issue is that these are too powdery/fine so they don&#x27;t apply well. I tried the highlight color but it&#x27;s TOO white. Not shimmery at all. I can hardly see it on my skin (I&#x27;m fairly pale.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it was a decent price so I&#x27;m not too upset about the product not working out.</li>
            <li> Great product, but this is my second attempt at ordering this palette and it arrived with the highlighter powder totally smashed. Ordering this product is a risk....if it comes in tact its a great kit, but if very well may arrive in pieces and as a result you will not be able to create desired contour effect.</li>
            <li> Colors are good, but the highlight powder is sparkly/glittery.  Anyone over 30 wouldn&#x27;t like this.</li>
            <li> I loved this cotour palette still figuring the correct way to contour my face but yeah I love the quantity and quality of this thing thank you</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this  pallet, colors are pigmented nicely, and I was never good at contouring my face. But this pallet gives you the step by step instructions on  where  to contour bronze and highlight your face.  Delivery was very fast it came three days early.</li>
            <li> I received it today and I love it</li>
            <li> Very streaky and hard to blend.</li>
            <li> Got my contour  kit on time. Looking very good.  I have to try it but the products looks really good.</li>
            <li> Received this a few days ago and I love how easy it is to use.  This is my 1st contour kit so the little diagram it came with helped! I have pale skin so when I 1st saw the colors I thought it might be a little too dark for me, but it wasn&#x27;t, just don&#x27;t cake it on our face, Will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> I gave it a 3 cause when it came all 3 colors broke apart I managed to fix some and it came out good l, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> its the worst thing ever I use primer before any foundation or contouring and this product is really hard to apply, blend and remove.</li>
            <li> Great for price. Blends easily  Great price</li>
            <li> I am new to this...this product is easy to use...</li>
            <li> Got exactlly what I was expecting very fast delivery and im completely in love with the outcome of the product</li>
            <li> Found very hard to blend</li>
            <li> Love this contour kit. My first time contouring and this worked excellent for me I followed the steps and it&#x27;s easy love this so worth it</li>
            <li> If youre just starting out with learning and applying contouring or just need a delicate yet noticeable contouring of your face, order this set today!!! Great product!</li>
            <li> For me the color is a little bit dark, and not easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the area, where I put the light color on, seemed a little reddish after washing out. Not sure whether it will cause allergy...</li>
            <li> Excited to open this product surprisingly the contour is broken!!! I know it&#x27;s only $7 but it&#x27;s not worth a penny!!! Don&#x27;t waist your money on this product...warning future buyers!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Nice product .. Fast shipping !</li>
            <li> Very Cheap looking. I ended up returning it.</li>
            <li> Arrived broken and cracked, and it&#x27;s not returnable. Very unhappy</li>
            <li> works great!! thank you!</li>
            <li> Great item for all women to have, it gives you that voom voom feeling</li>
            <li> I just received my order and I must say, I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!! It&#x27;s a light powder finishing touch, perfect setting with the fix+ if you have normal-to-dry skin like I do.</li>
            <li> &#x27;The highlighter was completely broken&#x27; into loose powder&#x27; , BUT the plastic that covers the 3 colors held most (sum got out) the broken loose highlighter in it&#x27;s spot &#x27;so I was able to carefully remove the plastic cellophane and dump the crushed highlighter into an old empty powder compact I had layin around &#x27; so I&#x27;m still gona be able to use the highlighter out of the old compact I put it in&#x27; but the contour pallet looks a little trashy with one missing &#x27;&#x27; But the pigment and smoothness of the colors is pretty good&#x27;, and even tho it was broke the price was good enof&#x27;&#x27; that I will probly buy it again &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t really work on dark skin women.  If you’re dark as Kelly Roland or Gabriel Union, don’t buy (both beautiful women).</li>
            <li> Product works well, there is even a little diagram on the inside of the lid with suggestions on how to use it. Only issue is that like many others one of my powders (white) was cracked and crumbled.  Still totally useable.</li>
            <li> Not so much my skin tone. Still works good !</li>
            <li> Love this brand, and love the pallete.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented, have been receiving compliments every since I started using it.</li>
            <li> just got it today and i ordered it 4 days ago!! wonderful product creamy and the pigmentation is great! DIDNT come cracked! Very good size and they even gave me a free matte lipstick a beautiful berry toned red!</li>
            <li> Just got it today but the bronz was broken...love the highlight though.. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again..</li>
            <li> This is amazing and for the price can&#x27;t beat that !!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contour my friends and they love it!!!! It&#x27;s a great will buy more and I recommend !!!!</li>
            <li> I love how this contour powder glides on so soft.  The powder arrivedin excellent condition.</li>
            <li> Thank god I didn&#x27;t receive mine broken like some other reviews.  I&#x27;m a beginner when it comes to contouring so obviously its not working the way I&#x27;d like, but it will come with practice.  But the makeup itself is really good quality for what you are paying for.  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love it. Receive the product in perf condition.</li>
            <li> Rating it a one star because I didn&#x27;t even get to try it! I received it broken 😥</li>
            <li> This product or wonders for me !</li>
            <li> im not great with makeup but i wanted to learn.  i thought with the guide it would be easy but these powders are extremely pigmented.  you will need to use a tiny bit and it will go a LONG way.  i would say its a bit hard to blend also.</li>
            <li> This palette is awesome!! mine arrived quickly and in good condition. I&#x27;m new to contouring and the diagram was very helpful to me. Tip for those wiith fairer skin: USE A LIGHT HAND! You can always add more, but if you&#x27;re not careful you can put way too much on and it&#x27;s harder to blend. Overall I&#x27;m really pleased; great product for the price.</li>
            <li> 😍😍😍 perfect n fast shipping</li>
            <li> Nice highlight to light</li>
            <li> This is a powder pallet. I couldn&#x27;t contour with this. I would ask for my money back but it was cheap. You get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Highlight was broken when I received the package. Can&#x27;t use it at all. Bronzer and contour were good.</li>
            <li> the product itself, for the price, is absolutely wonderful! However, like many other reviews stated, mine came busted :/</li>
