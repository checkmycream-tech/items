            <li>I am very happy with the hot towel cabinet.</li>
            <li>I love mine!  </li>
            <li>We are using this to keep receiving blankets warm for our newborn.  </li>
            <li>She always settled with a warm Blanket when in the NICU.</li>
            <li>What kind of company tells you to call to find your package?</li>
            <li>you will just get warm moist towels....</li>
            <li>I own my own 1 chair studio.</li>
            <li>This is a great product in full functional condition.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great size, and my facial/body wrap gal can fit 13 towels in it, which is how many she needs for a mud wrap.  </li>
            <li>The size is perfect for sitting on top of my counter without taking up too much room.</li>
            <li>Good price, ships fast, good product.  </li>
            <li>Great for my first massage client of the day.</li>
            <li>this uv sterilizer &amp; towel warmer is a great product,i really like this two in one item, its great thanks</li>
            <li>has the UV light for sanitation as well!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>id love to give them 6 stars</li>
            <li>I read many reviews before deciding to buy this warmer.  </li>
            <li>I am so pleased with the warmer Robb</li>
            <li>How many towels can you put in the warmer.  </li>
            <li>The warming process does not take much time and the effect is great.</li>
            <li>My wife love it.</li>
            <li>just the right size and keeps the towels nice and WARM</li>
            <li>Just wish the UV portion came with special UV bags to put dirtied utensils into then submit for the UV lighting...Have to find your own..</li>
            <li>I was looking for a warmer for my massage therapy practice and needed something that would warm quickly.  </li>
            <li>Great price for the product and fast free shipping.</li>
            <li>Then add more, they are not too hot and feel great when used right away.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is a great size at a good price.</li>
            <li>Great product so far.</li>
            <li>I think it is a fair price for what I get and how much it is used.  </li>
            <li>This had great reviews, but in reality the warmer takes 4 hours to get towels warm, which is way too long.</li>
            <li>It has a strong smell that takes some time to get used to.</li>
            <li>I own a Day Spa and we needed a hot towel cadi in the Manicure area</li>
            <li>you were using them a couple of times a week for an hour or two each time, they might be fine for a year or two (and I suspect that&#x27;s what all the 5 star reviewers are doing.)  </li>
            <li>That worked fine.</li>
            <li>What a worthy purchase from Amazon!</li>
            <li>It holds 8 towels very comfortably for me, doesn&#x27;t take up to much room, and I Love that is</li>
            <li>Perfect for my little salon and holds 10 to 12 towels</li>
            <li>Very happy with this little guy.</li>
            <li>I bought this last month and it worked great until this morning when it stopped heating.  </li>
            <li>In another review I gave 4 stars because I thought the uv light didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>Great for anyone who is just starting off.</li>
            <li>I hope it continues to work for the residents in which I use the towels on because they definitely enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Once I got it out of the box and plugged it in, the heat light didn&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li>UV light did.</li>
            <li>Even though the light didn&#x27;t turn on I thought maybe it&#x27;s just the light that was out.</li>
            <li>It was a great price for someone just starting out.</li>
            <li>Tried to buy this cheap brand and have ended up wasting time and money on return shipping.</li>
            <li>Towels heat up just as they and UV light works fine with still the original bulb installed.</li>
            <li>Very excited to have received unit so quickly, seems to heat up quickly.  </li>
            <li>Plenty of space I can fit a ton of face size towels for shaves and facials don&#x27;t listen to the negative people this towel warmer is perfect</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve only had them for about two weeks, but so far, they work perfectly.</li>
            <li>perfect, hot very fast a bit small but perfect with my small massage room.</li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly and just as pictured.  </li>
            <li>The towel warmer was shipped promptly and received quickly.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly but the uv light will not come on and it does not get hot just lukewarm.</li>
            <li>The UV light indicator doesn&#x27;t consistently work.  </li>
            <li>The cabbie doesn&#x27;t get as warm as the last two I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li>(so that&#x27;s probably why it&#x27;s not getting warm enough).  </li>
            <li>Even towels that I started out really hot cool off a bit, but still are warm enough to do the job.</li>
            <li>Received the product on time and so far all of the therapists love them.  </li>
            <li>Holds enough towels for a days work and heats them nicely.</li>
            <li>I do not have to cool the towels down and the warm stones just need a quick dip in cool water.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not interested to ship it back from Hawaii to get one that works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>2 towels being heated for about 30-40 minutes don&#x27;t get super hot.</li>
            <li>Just the right size.  </li>
            <li>Stays clean, heats up fast and stays heated</li>
            <li>Does not take long to warm towels.  </li>
            <li>How long does it take to warm them?  </li>
            <li>It is a little smaller than I thought, but temperature is perfect for facials!</li>
            <li>At this point, this is actually my most valuable baby purchase beyond the basic necessities.</li>
            <li>If i put 2 towels in, they get hot in 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>First, they claiimed there was no warranty.  </li>
            <li>It is working well to enhance my hot stone massages.</li>
            <li>In addition, there is no rubber gasket that seals the door completely; you can see and feel light and heat escaping through gaps in the door</li>
            <li>However, the temperature isn&#x27;t as hot as I would like it to be.</li>
            <li>The towels are not on a thermostat and come out extremely hot, as I like them.  </li>
            <li>Towels get hot but not to hot to touch.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what I purchased it for.</li>
            <li>I screwed it in a little more and it works fine.</li>
            <li>but they stay warm longer than other towel warmers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This is the 2nd one I&#x27;ve gotten (for 2 different spa locations) - heats up nicely, super warm &amp; toasty.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not so large that it takes up too much space.</li>
            <li>I would&#x27;ve liked the towels to get a little warmer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much space in my treatment room</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Up fast too!!!!&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>The product works very well.</li>
            <li>Item as described, fast shipping...</li>
            <li>It warms up the towels fast.  </li>
            <li>I plugged in straight from box and Nothing.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get warm enough unless left on overnight!</li>
            <li>Most of our units were in use probably 4 to 5 days a week, for probably 5 to 8 hours a day, but even the ones used only a couple times a week developed</li>
            <li>Working out of a small salon with very limited space, this cabinet helps meet our essential sanitary procedures and protocols to  provide our clients with a safe, healthy, refreshing, and relaxing skin care session.</li>
            <li>I am a massage therapist and have compared other products - they are all fairly similar and this is a good one for the price.</li>
            <li>Cabi can hold up to 10 hand towels, but most importantly, can hold heat really well, in such little timing.</li>
            <li>arrived fast brand new</li>
            <li>Perfect size, holds just enough towels, wet and dry mixed.</li>
            <li>I mainly need the unit for warming towels</li>
            <li>Heats towels up in a decent amount of time, I have yet to have a problem with it yet.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this towel warmer,especially because of the price.</li>
            <li>I love this little guy.</li>
            <li>There is no gasket seal around the door, you can see the UV light when the door is closed.  </li>
            <li>It broke today right before I had a facial client.</li>
            <li>Just make sure the towels are wet enough before you put them in the machine.</li>
            <li>I really like that it&#x27;s the 2 in 1, and that the UV light is only on when the door is closed (when you switch on the UV option).</li>
            <li>We were willing to pay $400-500 for reallygood towel warmers, but what we ultimately ended up going with were $35 turkey roasters.  </li>
            <li>bought for my daughter to use washing her face and she loves having the constant &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; towels ready and waiting for her to use!</li>
            <li>We ordered a total of 7 towel warmers and they are exactly what we needed.  </li>
            <li>I have been using hot towel cabi&#x27;s for 10+ years on a daily basis with no issue.</li>
            <li>Within four months, all four of them developed problems.  </li>
            <li>Overall it is a reasonable priced item.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had any problems with it so far.</li>
            <li>I bought this product to use on a personal level and it is very light weight, small and does the job.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>They work extremely well, keep the towels hot, hold more towels than these tiny units do, and cost less than half as much.</li>
            <li>Kind of very unprofessional wish someone would have responded to this matter i usually never write bad reviews.</li>
            <li>Overall a quality piece of equipment so far.</li>
            <li>The build quality of these is definitely not suited to a professional environment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Worse, when the problems developed, Mix Wholesale did everything possible to try and avoid any responsibility.  </li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re going to use them on a daily basis in a professional setting...</li>
            <li>but i had a bigger one and felt it was far to bulky</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, in looking around, nearly all of the towel warmers you see on Amazon (and most everywhere else) are cheap Chinese crap.  </li>
            <li>Spend a little extra on Hot Towel Cabi brand.</li>

            <li> you were using them a couple of times a week for an hour or two each time, they might be fine for a year or two (and I suspect that&#x27;s what all the 5 star reviewers are doing.)  </li>
            <li> That worked fine.</li>
            <li> What a worthy purchase from Amazon!</li>
            <li> It holds 8 towels very comfortably for me, doesn&#x27;t take up to much room, and I Love that is</li>
            <li> Perfect for my little salon and holds 10 to 12 towels</li>
            <li> Very happy with this little guy.</li>
            <li> I bought this last month and it worked great until this morning when it stopped heating.  </li>
            <li> In another review I gave 4 stars because I thought the uv light didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Great for anyone who is just starting off.</li>
            <li> I hope it continues to work for the residents in which I use the towels on because they definitely enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Once I got it out of the box and plugged it in, the heat light didn&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li> UV light did.</li>
            <li> Even though the light didn&#x27;t turn on I thought maybe it&#x27;s just the light that was out.</li>
            <li> It was a great price for someone just starting out.</li>
            <li> Tried to buy this cheap brand and have ended up wasting time and money on return shipping.</li>
            <li> Towels heat up just as they and UV light works fine with still the original bulb installed.</li>
            <li> Very excited to have received unit so quickly, seems to heat up quickly.  </li>
            <li> Plenty of space I can fit a ton of face size towels for shaves and facials don&#x27;t listen to the negative people this towel warmer is perfect</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve only had them for about two weeks, but so far, they work perfectly.</li>
            <li> perfect, hot very fast a bit small but perfect with my small massage room.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly and just as pictured.  </li>
            <li> The towel warmer was shipped promptly and received quickly.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly but the uv light will not come on and it does not get hot just lukewarm.</li>
            <li> The UV light indicator doesn&#x27;t consistently work.  </li>
            <li> The cabbie doesn&#x27;t get as warm as the last two I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li> (so that&#x27;s probably why it&#x27;s not getting warm enough).  </li>
            <li> Even towels that I started out really hot cool off a bit, but still are warm enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> Received the product on time and so far all of the therapists love them.  </li>
            <li> Holds enough towels for a days work and heats them nicely.</li>
            <li> I do not have to cool the towels down and the warm stones just need a quick dip in cool water.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not interested to ship it back from Hawaii to get one that works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> 2 towels being heated for about 30-40 minutes don&#x27;t get super hot.</li>
            <li> Just the right size.  </li>
            <li> Stays clean, heats up fast and stays heated</li>
            <li> Does not take long to warm towels.  </li>
            <li> How long does it take to warm them?  </li>
            <li> It is a little smaller than I thought, but temperature is perfect for facials!</li>
            <li> At this point, this is actually my most valuable baby purchase beyond the basic necessities.</li>
            <li> If i put 2 towels in, they get hot in 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> First, they claiimed there was no warranty.  </li>
            <li> It is working well to enhance my hot stone massages.</li>
            <li> In addition, there is no rubber gasket that seals the door completely; you can see and feel light and heat escaping through gaps in the door</li>
            <li> However, the temperature isn&#x27;t as hot as I would like it to be.</li>
            <li> The towels are not on a thermostat and come out extremely hot, as I like them.  </li>
            <li> Towels get hot but not to hot to touch.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what I purchased it for.</li>
            <li> I screwed it in a little more and it works fine.</li>
            <li> but they stay warm longer than other towel warmers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd one I&#x27;ve gotten (for 2 different spa locations) - heats up nicely, super warm &amp; toasty.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so large that it takes up too much space.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve liked the towels to get a little warmer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much space in my treatment room</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Up fast too!!!!&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
            <li> Works really well.  </li>
            <li> The product works very well.</li>
            <li> Item as described, fast shipping...</li>
            <li> It warms up the towels fast.  </li>
            <li> I plugged in straight from box and Nothing.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get warm enough unless left on overnight!</li>
            <li> Most of our units were in use probably 4 to 5 days a week, for probably 5 to 8 hours a day, but even the ones used only a couple times a week developed</li>
            <li> Working out of a small salon with very limited space, this cabinet helps meet our essential sanitary procedures and protocols to  provide our clients with a safe, healthy, refreshing, and relaxing skin care session.</li>
            <li> I am a massage therapist and have compared other products - they are all fairly similar and this is a good one for the price.</li>
            <li> Cabi can hold up to 10 hand towels, but most importantly, can hold heat really well, in such little timing.</li>
            <li> arrived fast brand new</li>
            <li> Perfect size, holds just enough towels, wet and dry mixed.</li>
            <li> I mainly need the unit for warming towels</li>
            <li> Heats towels up in a decent amount of time, I have yet to have a problem with it yet.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this towel warmer,especially because of the price.</li>
            <li> I love this little guy.</li>
            <li> There is no gasket seal around the door, you can see the UV light when the door is closed.  </li>
            <li> It broke today right before I had a facial client.</li>
            <li> Just make sure the towels are wet enough before you put them in the machine.</li>
            <li> I really like that it&#x27;s the 2 in 1, and that the UV light is only on when the door is closed (when you switch on the UV option).</li>
            <li> We were willing to pay $400-500 for reallygood towel warmers, but what we ultimately ended up going with were $35 turkey roasters.  </li>
            <li> bought for my daughter to use washing her face and she loves having the constant &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; towels ready and waiting for her to use!</li>
            <li> We ordered a total of 7 towel warmers and they are exactly what we needed.  </li>
            <li> I have been using hot towel cabi&#x27;s for 10+ years on a daily basis with no issue.</li>
            <li> Within four months, all four of them developed problems.  </li>
            <li> Overall it is a reasonable priced item.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any problems with it so far.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use on a personal level and it is very light weight, small and does the job.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> They work extremely well, keep the towels hot, hold more towels than these tiny units do, and cost less than half as much.</li>
            <li> Kind of very unprofessional wish someone would have responded to this matter i usually never write bad reviews.</li>
            <li> Overall a quality piece of equipment so far.</li>
            <li> The build quality of these is definitely not suited to a professional environment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Worse, when the problems developed, Mix Wholesale did everything possible to try and avoid any responsibility.  </li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re going to use them on a daily basis in a professional setting...</li>
            <li> but i had a bigger one and felt it was far to bulky</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, in looking around, nearly all of the towel warmers you see on Amazon (and most everywhere else) are cheap Chinese crap.  </li>
            <li> Spend a little extra on Hot Towel Cabi brand.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price if you have to buy a new one every month.</li>
            <li> Only after threatening to go to Amazon and file a formal complaint did they suddenly become willing to give us a refund for the units, but even then, we ended up paying the return shipping, which amounted to about 30% of the cost of the units.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seems like a fire hazard to me....does not dry towels that are not already dry...</li>
            <li> Anyway, it&#x27;s a decent product, but I would buy it elsewhere for cheaper because the price was already raised 10 dollars since I bought it a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> everything else is sterile WHITE &amp; this came in a strange cream color.</li>
            <li> Nice towel warmer, it is one of the lesser expensive models as I usually purchase.  </li>
            <li> Totally what I expected.</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to heat up.</li>
            <li> As I look over other reviews this is mentioned several times.</li>
            <li> A little smaller than I expected it to be.  </li>
            <li> just what i expected.</li>
            <li> They &amp;#34;generously&amp;#34; offered to repair the units if we paid the postage both ways (which would have been roughly equivalent to the purchase price.  </li>
            <li> Do you wet them?  </li>
            <li> How wet should they be?  </li>
            <li> and my paddle brush fell apart,be careful to always turn the sanitizer off when not in use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not certain that the UV works.  </li>
            <li> It will hold 4 basic receiving blankets and two small baby blankets rolled up.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to other customers.</li>
            <li> Stopped working within 3 months, but it&#x27;s past the return date, and technical support won&#x27;t return my phone calls and messages.</li>
            <li> it was just a little loose from travel.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it does collect a bit of water on the tipoff the door  </li>
            <li> All four of the units developed large cracks around the inside bezel, allowing water to leak into the base of the unitl  </li>
            <li> Three of the units eventually stopped heating entirely; one developed a bad electrical smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Far from being &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; units, these are extremely cheap Chinese crap -- no brand name, no company name at all.  </li>
            <li> It does take a little while to heat up, maybe 30 minutes, so just plan accordingly.  </li>
            <li> ; used it all the time for head massages and conditioners or anything that needs a little heat to process as well.</li>
            <li> I wish they got a little hotter</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No heat, no light.</li>
            <li> Takes hours to heat 4 small hand towels.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed that UV light does not work.  </li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t get it because of people&#x27;s negative comments.</li>
            <li> The sterlizer is broken and the heater works though ive tried to contact the company  and yet no response.</li>
            <li> so I automatically assumed nothing was wrong with it.</li>
            <li> Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> Too bad the design is faulted.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed with this purchase.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this cab for about a month.  It works perfectly.</li>
            <li> We are using this to keep receiving blankets warm for our newborn.  Works great!  She always settled with a warm Blanket when in the NICU. At this point, this is actually my most valuable baby purchase beyond the basic necessities. I did not experience any order issues with this product.  It will hold 4 basic receiving blankets and two small baby blankets rolled up.</li>
            <li> The UV light indicator doesn&#x27;t consistently work.  I&#x27;m not certain that the UV works.  I mainly need the unit for warming towels so I&#x27;m not interested to ship it back from Hawaii to get one that works perfectly.  Other than that it is a great size at a good price.</li>
            <li> This does a great job at warming my towels and wash cloths. I have had this for over a year now and have not had any problems with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this last month and it worked great until this morning when it stopped heating.  Not worth the price if you have to buy a new one every month.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a towel warmer but it&#x27;s good to know it can be used as a sterilizer also. I would&#x27;ve liked the towels to get a little warmer. Overall a quality piece of equipment so far.</li>
            <li> this uv sterilizer &amp; towel warmer is a great product,i really like this two in one item, its great thanks</li>
            <li> So far it is working like I expected it to. Warms 6-8 facial towels in about 30 minutes. Great product so far.</li>
            <li> I love this little guy. If i put 2 towels in, they get hot in 20 minutes. Great for my first massage client of the day. Then add more, they are not too hot and feel great when used right away. In another review I gave 4 stars because I thought the uv light didn&#x27;t work but it turned out it was just a little loose from travel. I screwed it in a little more and it works fine. Love this machine!</li>
            <li> Works great - Just wish the UV portion came with special UV bags to put dirtied utensils into then submit for the UV lighting...Have to find your own..I&#x27;m still looking... Otherwise, is a great price for a good unit.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly and just as pictured.  Depending on towel size it can hold about 8-10.  Does not take long to warm towels.  Great price for the product and fast free shipping.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this purchase. In fact I plan on ordering another for the hairstylist at the Salon/spa for their mens beard trims.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly but the uv light will not come on and it does not get hot just lukewarm. I guess you get what pay for.</li>
            <li> Works great. I don&#x27;t have much space in my treatment room so this works great. I can put about 10 or 12 towels in it.</li>
            <li> Just and update on this product.. I&#x27;ve had it for about 1 month now and it&#x27;s still working great. Towels heat up just as they and UV light works fine with still the original bulb installed. Great buy! Hope it continue to be so.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd one I&#x27;ve gotten (for 2 different spa locations) - heats up nicely, super warm &amp; toasty.  Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> works perfectly. just what i expected.</li>
            <li> The sterlizer is broken and the heater works though ive tried to contact the company  and yet no response. Kind of very unprofessional wish someone would have responded to this matter i usually never write bad reviews.</li>
            <li> Totally what I expected. I really like that it&#x27;s the 2 in 1, and that the UV light is only on when the door is closed (when you switch on the UV option). The heating element works perfectly to heat my towels to the right temperature. I would recommend this to other customers.</li>
            <li> Towel warmer is in great shape! its a great size and keeps the towels a perfect hot temperature. It does take a little while to heat up, maybe 30 minutes, so just plan accordingly.  It holds 8 towels very comfortably for me, doesn&#x27;t take up to much room, and I Love that is has the UV light for sanitation as well!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get warm enough unless left on overnight! Really disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase and it fits perfect at my HOME SPA.&lt;br /&gt;Warms Up fast too!!!!&lt;br /&gt;great piece to have it!</li>
            <li> We had a total of four of these we bought for use in our office.  Within four months, all four of them developed problems.  All four of the units developed large cracks around the inside bezel, allowing water to leak into the base of the unitl  The UV sterilization circut in one unit broke (it was not the bulb, as we swapped a known-working bulb from another unit)  Three of the units eventually stopped heating entirely; one developed a bad electrical smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Far from being &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; units, these are extremely cheap Chinese crap -- no brand name, no company name at all.  The build quality of these is definitely not suited to a professional environment. Most of our units were in use probably 4 to 5 days a week, for probably 5 to 8 hours a day, but even the ones used only a couple times a week developed problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worse, when the problems developed, Mix Wholesale did everything possible to try and avoid any responsibility.  First, they claiimed there was no warranty.  Then, they claimed it was only 90 days. When asked for a written copy of the warranty, we told there was none.  They &amp;#34;generously&amp;#34; offered to repair the units if we paid the postage both ways (which would have been roughly equivalent to the purchase price.  Only after threatening to go to Amazon and file a formal complaint did they suddenly become willing to give us a refund for the units, but even then, we ended up paying the return shipping, which amounted to about 30% of the cost of the units.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you were using them a couple of times a week for an hour or two each time, they might be fine for a year or two (and I suspect that&#x27;s what all the 5 star reviewers are doing.)  But if you&#x27;re going to use them on a daily basis in a professional setting... don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, in looking around, nearly all of the towel warmers you see on Amazon (and most everywhere else) are cheap Chinese crap.  We were willing to pay $400-500 for reallygood towel warmers, but what we ultimately ended up going with were $35 turkey roasters.  They work extremely well, keep the towels hot, hold more towels than these tiny units do, and cost less than half as much.</li>
            <li> We have had this in our salon for a couple months now and it&#x27;s still working great.</li>
            <li> Works really well.  A little smaller than I expected it to be.  It is working well to enhance my hot stone massages.</li>
            <li> bought for my daughter to use washing her face and she loves having the constant &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; towels ready and waiting for her to use! It&#x27;s not so large that it takes up too much space. It works great!</li>
            <li> I am so upset I ordered this warmer back in May, but didn&#x27;t start using it until June. It broke today right before I had a facial client. I do not recommend purchasing this brand again.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these. Both work great. They hold about 5-7 hand towels. I would order a larger size next time for my couples massage room. Perfect for a one-room, one therapist situation.</li>
            <li> This cabi is perfect for a part-time massage therapist or nail tech that will be servicing about 4-5 clients a day.  Cabi can hold up to 10 hand towels, but most importantly, can hold heat really well, in such little timing. I would highly recommend this towel warmer,especially because of the price.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for doing facials. The product works very well. My only issue was that the company lost my package at some point and told me to call Fed Ex to find where the package was. What kind of company tells you to call to find your package? Why couldn&#x27;t they call themselves? Anyway, it&#x27;s a decent product, but I would buy it elsewhere for cheaper because the price was already raised 10 dollars since I bought it a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> This towel warmer does the job, and does it well.  It&#x27;s a great size, and my facial/body wrap gal can fit 13 towels in it, which is how many she needs for a mud wrap.  Love this!</li>
            <li> The cabbie doesn&#x27;t get as warm as the last two I&#x27;ve had.  In addition, there is no rubber gasket that seals the door completely; you can see and feel light and heat escaping through gaps in the door (so that&#x27;s probably why it&#x27;s not getting warm enough).  If it wasn&#x27;t such a hassle to to return it, I would have.</li>
            <li> Working out of a small salon with very limited space, this cabinet helps meet our essential sanitary procedures and protocols to  provide our clients with a safe, healthy, refreshing, and relaxing skin care session.</li>
            <li> Seems like a fire hazard to me....does not dry towels that are not already dry...you will just get warm moist towels....</li>
            <li> The item was purchased as a gift for my granddaughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> UV light was broken when we opened the package &amp; plugged it in. Had to send back, but couldn&#x27;t exchange it, so then had to find another cabinet.</li>
            <li> Delivery was perfect. Takes a looooooong time to heat up! And the the color was not as stated so it stands out like sore thumb in the clinic....everything else is sterile WHITE &amp; this came in a strange cream color. No customer service reply when I called.</li>
            <li> Love this two in one! Great for anyone who is just starting off. Great customer service and shipping.</li>
            <li> just the right size and keeps the towels nice and WARM</li>
            <li> Functions well and I like the horizontal door, since the bottom hinge types can leak with time.  Like all good tools, it &amp;#34;disappears&amp;#34;  because you don&#x27;t have too think about it.</li>
            <li> Love it. Works great. I almost didn&#x27;t get it because of people&#x27;s negative comments. Plenty of space I can fit a ton of face size towels for shaves and facials don&#x27;t listen to the negative people this towel warmer is perfect</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to heat up.</li>
            <li> Heats towels up in a decent amount of time, I have yet to have a problem with it yet. I hope it continues to work for the residents in which I use the towels on because they definitely enjoy it.</li>
            <li> There is no gasket seal around the door, you can see the UV light when the door is closed.  Takes hours to heat 4 small hand towels.  I did like the option of having either heat, UV or both.  Too bad the design is faulted.</li>
            <li> Item as described, fast shipping...THX!!!!</li>
            <li> I am SO VERY HAPPY.  Good decision on my part!  It is a little smaller than I thought, but temperature is perfect for facials!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.  Just the right size.  However, the temperature isn&#x27;t as hot as I would like it to be.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the hot towel cabinet. Have one already...same size...but didn&#x27;t have the UV sterilizer feature.  Great addition.  Cabby holds atleast 6 towels depending on size of towel. Delivery within 3 days of ordering. Very Happy</li>
            <li> arrived fast brand new</li>
            <li> perfect, hot very fast a bit small but perfect with my small massage room. id love to give them 6 stars</li>
            <li> Perfect for my little salon and holds 10 to 12 towels</li>
            <li> Very excited to have received unit so quickly, seems to heat up quickly.  Very disappointed that UV light does not work.  As I look over other reviews this is mentioned several times.</li>
            <li> Nice towel warmer, it is one of the lesser expensive models as I usually purchase.  I have it turned on about 10 hours per day, 6 days per week.  These warmers last me about a year to 14 months at that rate.  I think it is a fair price for what I get and how much it is used.  The towels are not on a thermostat and come out extremely hot, as I like them.  I would recommend this item and will purchase it again.  Good price, ships fast, good product.  I am a massage therapist and have compared other products - they are all fairly similar and this is a good one for the price.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews before deciding to buy this warmer.  I was looking for a warmer for my massage therapy practice and needed something that would warm quickly.  This had great reviews, but in reality the warmer takes 4 hours to get towels warm, which is way too long.</li>
            <li> The uv towel warmer has been an asset to my business.  Works great.  It warms up the towels fast.  I am so pleased with the warmer Robb</li>
            <li> I own a Day Spa and we needed a hot towel cadi in the Manicure area this is perfect size and easy to operate.</li>
            <li> Consider adding instructions for how to handle towels.  Do you wet them?  How wet should they be?  How long does it take to warm them?  How many towels can you put in the warmer.  I followed up on youtube</li>
            <li> The towel warmer was shipped promptly and received quickly. The size is perfect for sitting on top of my counter without taking up too much room. The temperature is perfect. I do not have to cool the towels down and the warm stones just need a quick dip in cool water. My only complaint is that it does collect a bit of water on the tipoff the door  but there is a tray that catches it so it does not get anywhere. I&#x27;m very happy</li>
            <li> Making it short, I got the unit, turned it on, after an hour it broke. Changed the fuse and nada. Nothign worked. Sent it back and bought  another one of a massage supply website.</li>
            <li> Stopped working within 3 months, but it&#x27;s past the return date, and technical support won&#x27;t return my phone calls and messages.</li>
            <li> I own my own 1 chair studio. Indidnt need a massive towel warmer. I needed a Uv sterilizer. And here it is! Perfect size compact and the warmer makes towels the perfect temp. I love mine!  Get this!</li>
            <li> great; used it all the time for head massages and conditioners or anything that needs a little heat to process as well. AH</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any complaints...it&#x27;s a great towel warmer and uv. Great space saver as well. I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I like that it keeps my tools sanitized,it&#x27;s bulky but doesn&#x27;t hold a lot of content. You can&#x27;t use the towel warmer and sanitizer at the same time I didn&#x27;t know that at time if purchase, you have to pick or choose which one. It has a strong smell that takes some time to get used to. I left it on overnight and my paddle brush fell apart,be careful to always turn the sanitizer off when not in use.</li>
            <li> I ordered this warmer for my facial room. The boxes were not damaged in anyway so I automatically assumed nothing was wrong with it. Once I got it out of the box and plugged it in, the heat light didn&#x27;t turn on. UV light did. That worked fine. Even though the light didn&#x27;t turn on I thought maybe it&#x27;s just the light that was out. After 20 mins I came back and opened the warmer and nothing... I checked and changed the fuse 3 times and still didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> We use it every day in our massage business.</li>
            <li> i give facials out of my home and this works great for traveling as well. Stays clean, heats up fast and stays heated</li>
            <li> Just used twice and it&#x27;s not working anymore</li>
            <li> I only use the towel warmer for pedicures and usually only do one at a time. 2 towels being heated for about 30-40 minutes don&#x27;t get super hot. Even towels that I started out really hot cool off a bit, but still are warm enough to do the job. I wish they got a little hotter but they stay warm longer than other towel warmers I&#x27;ve used. I would recommend it for anyone! It does a great job!</li>
            <li> This is a great product in full functional condition. The warming process does not take much time and the effect is great. What a worthy purchase from Amazon!</li>
            <li> This does not hold alot of towels at once but i had a bigger one and felt it was far to bulky anyways, it is very nice!</li>
            <li> We have this now for 3 Sunday&#x27;s home facials.  My wife love it. Towels get hot but not to hot to touch.  Works great.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use on a personal level and it is very light weight, small and does the job. When this item did arrive the UV sterilizer was burnt out, only used it once until I get the UV working.  Overall it is a reasonable priced item.</li>
            <li> Perfect Oven, does what it says it will do and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Perfect size, holds just enough towels, wet and dry mixed. Heats up quickly. Took a while researching towel cabinets before choosing. Great purchase</li>
            <li> Received the product on time and so far all of the therapists love them.  We ordered a total of 7 towel warmers and they are exactly what we needed.  We&#x27;ve only had them for about two weeks, but so far, they work perfectly.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I purchased it for. Holds enough towels for a days work and heats them nicely. Just make sure the towels are wet enough before you put them in the machine.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this little guy. It was a great price for someone just starting out. I received it within just a couple days. Haven&#x27;t had any problems with it so far.</li>
            <li> I plugged in straight from box and Nothing. No heat, no light. I have been using hot towel cabi&#x27;s for 10+ years on a daily basis with no issue. Tried to buy this cheap brand and have ended up wasting time and money on return shipping. Very frustrating. Spend a little extra on Hot Towel Cabi brand.</li>
