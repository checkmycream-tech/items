            <li>I love all the St. Ives products, including the scrub!</li>
            <li>Excellent for rather oily, large pore skins - I hope they continue producing it forever.</li>
            <li>Seems amazing that this brand is still around, so I decided to give it another try.  </li>
            <li>Works amazing</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling real smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with it and have even started using it on my legs in the shower.</li>
            <li>The apricot is nice smelling, and isn&#x27;t too overpowering for me.</li>
            <li>Apricot pit pieces seems to be the perfect type of &#x27;grit&#x27; - sugar or salt dissolve when you really try to scrub with them.</li>
            <li>also has a nice smell to it and doesnt leave the skin oily</li>
            <li>hey mix it up with warm water</li>

            <li>Nice smell.</li>
            <li>The rest of it feels kind of oily to me though, even though it claims not to be too oily.  </li>
            <li>This smells nice and feels nice.  </li>
            <li>good stuff for sure.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Smells nice</li>
            <li>It is a strong exfoliatant, but if you use it wisely it works wonders.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m older now and the problems are mostly gone, but I still think this stuff is the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>

            <li>I love St Ives Apricot Scrub.  </li>

            <li>It may be a bit premature to post a review after only one use, but my face felt a lot smoother and had a wonderful glow to it after using it today.  </li>

            <li>It just leaves my face wanting more of it.</li>

            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>My make up goes on more evenly.  </li>
            <li>You have to make sure to rinse all out, nostrils, around the eyes, etc-</li>

            <li>I love using this</li>
            <li>I love this scrub.  </li>
            <li>(the Grapefruit St Ives Scrub is better and gentler for my face).</li>
            <li>The reason I love this stuff, though, is because of what it does for my ARMS.</li>
            <li>St. Ives, Fresh Skin Apricot Scrub, 6oz is good, came on time and my wife likes it.</li>

            <li>Refreshing</li>
            <li>I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>But I love the smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I make sure to have a tube around at all</li>
            <li>think this item is more hazardous than the original.</li>
            <li>This has honestly always been my favorite way to clean my face.  </li>
            <li>Best of all it leaves my face feeling fresh, clean, and noticeably brighter after the first use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a pretty good endorsement.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;can absorb it more easily.  </li>
            <li>I have never, not even for hundreds of dollars, been able to so easily exfoliate and de-wrinkle my face with just one wash.</li>
            <li>Love love love this scrub my face feels clean</li>
            <li>I use it mainly on my body &amp; it makes my skin feel amazing, refreshed &amp; so smooth!!</li>
            <li>This scrub is very refreshing and is very gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li>The most important thing is that it does its job well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always great to use this 2-3 times a week and not everyday.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin too.</li>
            <li>I use this as my daily face wash and it feels so good on my skin!</li>
            <li>The best thing about this face scrub is that it&#x27;s not oily and doesn&#x27;t stick on your face, like other walnut scrubs.</li>
            <li>I have used other brands, and this one has been the best.</li>
            <li>The fresh invigorating feeling on my face and the refreshing clean feeling after using it are why I have been using it for many, many years.</li>
            <li>It washes off easily.</li>
            <li>easy to apply and use.</li>
            <li>Im not a fan of the strong smell</li>
            <li>I use it twice a week, and the scrub does its work just fine.</li>
            <li>I love the mild smell.</li>
            <li>I feel so good after using this, my face looks good, I feel fresh, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry!</li>
            <li>Its so good on my skin leaving it smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of the apricot scrub.</li>
            <li>Helps keep my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>An amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;The microbeads are something that I loooove to death, really exfoliates my skin</li>
            <li>After all, it&#x27;s so cheap that I had nothing to lose.</li>
            <li>and my face feels really smooth after using it.</li>
            <li>My face is always smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>Sulfate and paraben free - it sells itself.  </li>
            <li>I use it every day to wash off my makeup and leave my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>The price has doubled with shipping and from what I can tell it can&#x27;t be placed into Prime or a &gt;$35 free shipping order.  </li>
            <li>so I am adding microderm crystals to make my own for much cheaper.</li>
            <li>This simply makes your skin look great and feel like a baby&#x27;s bottom with a glow.</li>
            <li>and it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>Aside from that, it leaves my skin feeling really smooth and looking rejuvenated after every wash.</li>
            <li>It works great on my  skin and scrubs off all make up left over from my face cleanser.</li>
            <li>This removes all the dead skin and leaves my skin looking great!</li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic, and it seems to exfoliate well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product works well to smooth out my hard-working city skin and prevent breakouts.</li>
            <li>Helps smooth skin and prevent acne.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>It is gentle yet effective and I would recommend it to anyone looking to unclog pores, improve skin texture etc.</li>
            <li>and I my face always feels smooth after each use.</li>
            <li>We enjoy the product.</li>
            <li>I also wanted to mention that on occasion I use it on my feet  after a pedicure  to keep the heels and balls of feet smooth.</li>
            <li>and dirt cheap.</li>

            <li>After couple months using this product, his face is visibly cleaner and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have fresh, smooth skin every time I use this!</li>
            <li>Like most products, they get a good thing going and then cheat the consumer after they profit enough.</li>
            <li>it makes your skin baby soft and you smell good too</li>
            <li>Natural ingredients, good price, no animal testing.  </li>
            <li>I like a face wash or scrub that has some grit to it because it really helps to exfoliate the skin and this face scrub is definitely the best one that I&#x27;ve tried for exfoliating.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin really soft, feels good to apply and has not been tested on animals.</li>
            <li>It has natural smell and is a good scrub for body and face.</li>
            <li>St. Ives is normally like $5-$7 dollars at any Target or Walmart, with buying my combo of two face washes and the extra hand lotion, which I love and will buy more of, it was a great price for what I paid.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been to both ends of the high to low spectrum in terms of experimenting with skin care on a quest to find the perfect combination of products that will get the results I want.</li>
            <li>and helps keep my face smooth and clean in the morning.</li>
            <li>This product always makes my face feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>Smells great and left my skin feeling super smooth.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and even though I&#x27;m not a fan of every ingredient, it&#x27;s easy on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t used St. Ives Apricot Scrub in years because I&#x27;d moved on to higher priced and - I assumed - better scrubs.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite exfoliator - it&#x27;s pretty inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>product even has an unique use for those who snorkel or scuba-dive often, like me, and happen to knick coral and get it under the skin.  </li>
            <li>After the first time I used it my skin looked and felt healthier and more polished.</li>
            <li>scrub leaves my skin fresh and rejuvenated!</li>
            <li>First time users though should use many times a weekn in the beginning.</li>
            <li>I use small amount for my face and head and it works great!</li>
            <li>It is cheap and that makes people doubt it I think but sometimes simple or inexpensive products can be the most effective.</li>
            <li>The finely ground apricot seeds do the scrubbing work better than any soap while being gentle to the skin</li>
            <li>I think this is a great product and recommend to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li>I grew up with acne and have always been balancing a clean face with a greasy/dry face.</li>
            <li>It does clean.</li>
            <li>My skin is always refreshed and clean every after I use this.</li>
            <li>It smells good and your face feels fresh, clean and soft after using it.  </li>
            <li>Also the product left on my hands made for a nice hand scrub too :)</li>
            <li>I have combination dry and oily skin and this product works great for me</li>
            <li>Keeps my face clean.</li>
            <li>so I can get a clean shave.</li>
            <li>As far as scrub and face washes go, I love this!</li>
            <li>All my life I&#x27;ve had beautiful radiant skin due in part to using this product.</li>
            <li>I am sure this Apricot Scrub is good but I prefer the other.</li>
            <li>The beads are somewhat large, and I find them at the bottom of my shower when I&#x27;m done showering, but I continue to use it because I love the smell of the product and feel of my skin after I use it.</li>
            <li>Most stuff really dries my face out but this works like a charm.</li>
            <li>So of course when I saw it on Amazon for such a good deal I knew I had to use it again.</li>
            <li>I use this as a full body exfoliant, have been for years.</li>
            <li>and i had tried several types...and yes smoth and smell good</li>
            <li>it makes things much more cost efficient &amp; really does the job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to exfoliate your skin regularly because the air is getting more and more polluted, and this is the cheapest way to exfoliate your skin.</li>
            <li>I believe that you need 3 key things for good skin: antioxidants, sunscreen,and retinol.</li>
            <li>Keeps skin fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li>, I use it at least thrice a week to ensure the best results.</li>
            <li>This is a true Face Rescue product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now the product have become an absolute necessity in his healthy skin routine.</li>
            <li>It smells good, and it is really a big one for me.</li>
            <li>and I definitely notice the difference (a good difference) from before I started using this compared to after.</li>
            <li>I have used this scrub for awhile, and I noted to him that it was actually the thing that kept my own skin nice and clear - the exfoliation helped to scrub the skin nice and clean, and the salicylic acid helped to prevent new blemishes from appearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tend to get right off and leaves me with a smooth surface.  </li>
            <li>and it is great to use on the other parts of the body like the feet, elbows, and knees.</li>
            <li>Feels so clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>so Im lucky that way.</li>
            <li>This product smells yummy and is a mild scrub.</li>
            <li>and it went away quickly.</li>
            <li>Luckily, once rinsed off of the skin it doesn&#x27;t seem to stay this way.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe just not the best product for me, I still have another bottle of this that I will continue to use, but I definitely will be searching out a different product type in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe just not the best product for me, I still have another bottle of this that I will continue to use, but I definitely will be searching out a different product type in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the delivery was extremely quick, one day before the estimated time.</li>
            <li>It smells good and the coarse scrubbing elements in the soap are just right.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling incredibly soft and clean, unlike most face products.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this scrub for more than 30 year and cannot live without it.</li>
            <li>What I like most about this product is that it isn&#x27;t full of plastic bread but natural apricot kernel pieces.  </li>
            <li>This apricot scrub is good for oily and dry face skin.  </li>
            <li>This is the only face wash I have been able to find that does not make my skin break out, rash, or get zits/pimples!</li>
            <li>More cost effective &amp; less work for me that way.</li>
            <li>The quest for a perfect face scrub is always a tough one.  </li>
            <li>The exfoliation is effective and it smells great, but the grain can be a little too gritty for my face, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It smells kinda nice and it feels nice when I apply it to my face but other than that it doesn&#x27;t really seem to be doing anything positive for my skin.</li>
            <li>It really has changed: the scrub particles are finer than they used to be and, even though they provide fabulous exfoliation, there is nothing abrasive about this newer version.</li>
            <li>It is one of those amazing beauty products that actually work.</li>
            <li>It gently exfoliates my skin, leaving it smooth.  </li>
            <li>This scrub smells great, but it too harsh for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>10 stars for this amazing facial scrub!!!</li>
            <li>But this one leaves my skin fresh and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Useful for face and body.</li>
            <li>but, I tend to like more natural organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li>so it may be worth a purchase just to see how your skin reacts to it.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for months, works well and worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I personally have used many different types of St. Ives products and they work just a good as mega $$$$ products</li>
            <li>One of his friend recommed him to use St. Ives Fresh Skin Apricot Scrub....</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have skin problems, but I was looking for something to keep my skin fresh.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this exfoliant/scrub as much anymore because I&#x27;ve found that beta hydroxy acid (BHA) and alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) work more gently on my skin as exfoliants.</li>
            <li>Just use this scrub aggressively to remove the top layer of skin and the coral embedded under the surface layer of the skin, follow with bacitracin or neosporin and a band-aid and it&#x27;ll clear right up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my face very clean, clear, fresh and relaxed.</li>
            <li>Love this product as well as many other St Ives products.  </li>
            <li>It gets rid of dead skin, makes my face feel smoother, softer, and cleaner, and not to mention- pimple free!!!</li>
            <li>The price is right.</li>
            <li>Nothing replaces this product, so please just continue to keep making it just as it is right now.  </li>
            <li>All right.</li>
            <li>Whereas other more fancy/fashionable products feel greasy or too perfumy, this product does what it is supposed to do and your face feels clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It feels like I&#x27;m cleaning my whole face with tiny little sand and it feels wonderful and super clean.</li>
            <li>One thing I miss is that minty fresh clean face feeling I get from clean and clear</li>
            <li>One does not have to use much to clean the whole face.</li>
            <li>cheap enough and good enough.</li>
            <li>Although I rarely use it on my face since I use the oatmeal scrub on my face because I like that the beads in it are smaller than these, I still LOVE this scrub.</li>
            <li>It looks fine and smells just like my old one.</li>
            <li>It positively brightens up the face, and I&#x27;ve noticed the radiance right after use.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and easily removes old, dry, dead skin... revealing fresh, new, soft, supple skin :)</li>
            <li>and I have been keeping up with it since the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>First scrub ever.</li>
            <li>When I combine it with an electric facial brush or a face sponge it works even better.</li>
            <li>They bother your face at first</li>
            <li>Always use sunscreen too ;-).</li>
            <li>I have never used a facial scrub that works better than it does in</li>
            <li>scrub, but have since decided to be more frugal, especially for something that gets washed off of my face, anyway.</li>
            <li>Use twice a week for efficiency ;)</li>
            <li>Another plus is that it&#x27;s better for the environment than a lot of similar scrubs.</li>
            <li>I love this face scrub to use in the morning, because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary to &amp;</li>
            <li>It does an ok job, but ultimately, I&#x27;m looking for improvement, not \\&quot;ok\\&quot;.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but when you rub it into your face you can feel it on your skin, so you&#x27;re aware if you haven&#x27;t rinsed it</li>
            <li>I definitely would recommend this for those who are looking for a refreshing scrub/face-wash.</li>
            <li>In any case, how many of those ingredients can you actually pronounce?</li>
            <li>it has clear all my acne and has made my face smooth.</li>
            <li>At first I loved how it smelled but after a few days it started breaking me out a lot.</li>
            <li>Also, it did not cause my rosacea to flare up, and actually made it better.</li>
            <li>This is a quality product that really keeps the skin fresh.</li>
            <li>I like to think that it makes my facial skin look better, but that could just be my imagination.  </li>
            <li>It made my face very soft and clean.</li>
            <li>Made my face very soft and clean, didn&#x27;t cause break outs, and the size is huge.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The new design on the bottle is also pretty cool.</li>
            <li>Using this, very gently, every day leaves my face feeling soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>Not only does this product smell great, it really does keep your skin clear and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different products, but this is the only thing that continues to help prevent breakouts (usually don&#x27;t have much anymore, but now that I&#x27;m pregnant it came back :-P) and make my skin feel nice.</li>
            <li>The scrubbing particles really leave you with a clean feeling and it works better than other facewashes I have tried.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth although sometimes a bit dry.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective, but mild enough for daily use!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my face break out and it makes my skin feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li>My face always feels soft and clean when I use this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years and have been satisfied with the result: smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to have found this product on Amazon and at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s positively invigorating.  </li>
            <li>I love the product as a daily scrub, and if you really want to brighten your skin, use straight baking soda once a week.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased the green tea version of their scrub after seeing a review online, and the grain is MUCH finer, which made it feel more effective but also gentler.</li>
            <li>This scrub makes my skin very smooth and refreshed, and does not make it dry!</li>
            <li>A previous effective product has now been crippled by change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>St. Ives ain&#x27;t no saint, for certain.</li>
            <li>St. Ives ain&#x27;t no saint, for certain.</li>
            <li>I definitely don&#x27;t use it daily because I think that *would* be too harsh, but I love it for those days when I need a deeper clean and a nice exfoliation.</li>
            <li>So while it&#x27;s not necessarily false advertising, it is nonetheless deceiving.</li>
            <li>Gentle scrubbing with out drying her face out.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell</li>
            <li>maybe I was expecting this too much, but it basically feels like I threw my money away buying and using this.</li>
            <li>However, now that my hormones have ceased wreaking havoc, this product has become an absolute necessity in my healthy-skin routine.</li>
            <li>but I really like it.  </li>
            <li>It does all of it in a gentle way.</li>
            <li>But really works and leaves face</li>
            <li>The harder you scrub, the more of that &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; effect you get.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot St Ives.</li>
            <li>Exfoliates well (but, really so does sugar, baking soda, etc.)</li>
            <li>My face always feels baby soft and fresh after.</li>
            <li>I really like the roughness of the scrub.</li>
            <li>I follow up with a Benzoyl Peroxide treatment and that has really helped with my acne.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>Your face is left smooth</li>
            <li>it ended up really drying my face</li>
            <li>but I was not getting ready for the day</li>
            <li>It really helps to exfoliate your skin.</li>
            <li>I really wanted the St. Ives Timeless Skin instead.  </li>
            <li>When using it, remember to use gently pressure....</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>thought the price was very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really lather per</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still nothing that would really be bothersome.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>I shave my head, so shampoo doesn&#x27;t really factor in.  </li>
            <li>While it has never irritated my skin, I can imagine it could create an issue for those with especially sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>And, really, who knows about corn anymore?</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>My skin is very temperamental -</li>
            <li>I use it about once a week, and I can really tell the difference.</li>
            <li>It is gentle, moisturizing and exfoliating, all in one.</li>
            <li>The product is also fantastic, and I used it last night.</li>
            <li>I use it about 3 times a week, and each time I feel very refreshed.</li>
            <li>This product is gentle on my face and does not irritate the rosacea.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone who might be unsure of whether or not to try this!</li>
            <li>When I found that Amazon has this much cheaper here then</li>
            <li>I really like this face wash.  </li>
            <li>For those of us concerned with such things, it&#x27;s nice to know I&#x27;m not slathering potentially harmful chemicals all over my body.</li>
            <li>I leaves my skin clean, my only problem would be the large beads that it comes with.  </li>
            <li>Even though the packaging isn&#x27;t the same bright orange color it was before, it&#x27;s still exactly the same as it was back then - a fabulous exfoliant that can be used multiple times a week.</li>
            <li>It gets my face, back and bottom so squeaky clean and helps to minimize the acne.</li>
            <li>My main problem isn&#x27;t even so much that it was ineffective, but that it&#x27;s called an \\&quot;Apricot Scrub.\\&quot; Under Amazon&#x27;s product description</li>
            <li>It worked well and left my skin feeling clean and</li>
            <li>I tried multiple products but finally I got a product that is suitable to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was surprised that it got rid of some blackheads because the past washes I used didn&#x27;t do such a good job of it!</li>
            <li>different, o special.</li>
            <li>I got a sample size of this a while back and when it ran out I looked to Amazon for the full size.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>I would rate it higher if the packaging wasn&#x27;t misleading in it&#x27;s &amp;#34;100% natural EXFOLIANTS&amp;#34; claim.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend it because it&#x27;s also sulfate and paraben-free, which is great if you have sensitive skin like I do or don&#x27;t like harsh chemicals damaging your skin.</li>
            <li>i dont like exfoliating scrubs in the first place because i feel like it takes the natural oils off your face.  </li>
            <li>This one is just right, breaths new life into my skin and leaves it soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little rough, so I probably wouldn&#x27;t use it every day, but it&#x27;s great when I just feel like my skin is...blah.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still the only product on the market that makes my skin really glow and is sensitive skin friendly.</li>
            <li>With a moisturizing lotion, this is great for the treatment of dry skin and using it daily doesn&#x27;t seem to be an issue, especially when one frequently wears makeup.</li>
            <li>St Ives is more coarse and left smoother skin.  </li>
            <li>I have occasional one or two zits, but overall my face is much better.  </li>
            <li>I prefer physical exfoliants to chemical ones, and this is my current favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried more expensive exfoliation products but why pay more when this does the job.</li>
            <li>scrub is a mildly abrasive one that has enough texture you feel it working at your skin when you use it.  </li>
            <li>I am somewhat particular about my face wash and this one passes the test.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d recommend it to those with very sensitive skin, but it&#x27;s also really inexpensive</li>
            <li>It gently buffs my dead skin and makeup away after a long day and it smells really good.</li>
            <li>I think it would be better with a bit more soap or otherwise liquid; as is, it&#x27;s dry and hard to lather.</li>
            <li>and I have tried just about everything including high dose salicylic acid.  </li>
            <li>I used 2 or 3 times a week and do not find it harsh and it makes my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>In any case, highly recommended</li>
            <li>It comes with little beads which I make sure to rub all over the face.</li>
            <li>this scrub makes it easy for other products to penetrate after outer layer of skin is removed.</li>
            <li>Apricot scrub is bio-degradeable and is gentle for sensitive skin users.</li>
            <li>I use it every day and it really helps my skin stay clear of any blemish.</li>
            <li>It provided a gentle exfoliation and did not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This helps keep my face clear by thoroughly exfoliating while magically not irritating my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been struggling with acne for years now, and I&#x27;ve tried tons of various products, with varying rates of success.</li>
            <li>I use it once a day, after my normal cleanser.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am experimenting with my shoulders and chest and it leaves my skin soft, not sure if it&#x27;ll be effective on my shoulders.</li>
            <li>that say the product is too harsh for your skin, but I love it.</li>
            <li>Good price, usually beats local store prices.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been used many scrubs in order to remove dead cells, but since I choose this one I will have it for a lot of time.</li>
            <li>The scrub exfoliates the dead skin cells to reveal the smoother skin underneath leaving more youthful looking skin.</li>
            <li>more so that didn&#x27;t thrill me, but at least some of the ingredients were recognizable (like walnut shell for the scrubby roughness of the product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear to me that the hulls in the formula have been grinded down more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a VERY strong product; so I only use it every other week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only is it oil-free, it&#x27;s also free of parabens and skin-drying sulfates which is great for anyone seeking a product without a lot of harsh chemicals that can cause an imbalance and damage the delicate skin.</li>
            <li>Other ones don&#x27;t do much for me because their grain size is too small or big and texture is usually too smooth to make a difference, but this one is perfect.</li>
            <li>The only difference is the odor is different, but it works just fine, for the price I will continue purchasing this item.</li>
            <li>new.  </li>
            <li>We can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I have tried many name brand scrubs, and they turn my skin raw.</li>
            <li>This scrub is basic to clear skin if needed, and I would only use this occasionally not every day, cause it can be too drying to fair skin only if used to often.</li>
            <li>Use it mainly during the winter to exfoliate old skin.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive skin, and this product fits my skin type.</li>
            <li>but I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I actually appreciated that it wasn&#x27;t too strong of a scent because with all the other products you could use in your daily cleansing regime, scent is bound to be covered elsewhere and doesn&#x27;t need to be in everything.  </li>
            <li>Good facial scrub, helped clear my acne that was caused by some &#x27;african black soap\\&quot; that i bought on amazon.</li>
            <li>Just tried this scrub again and I was very pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>This is less powerful than neutrogena deep clean</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling smooth and clean without drying or causing that post-scrub redness and irritation that is common with a lot of facial scrubs.</li>
            <li>I have oily, acne-prone, AND sensitive skin (my skin gets red and inflamed if I so happen to look at it funny...)</li>
            <li>I really like Olay microbermabrasion in the little tub for exfoliating because its super concentrated.</li>
            <li>Its worth every single penny.  </li>
            <li>I found that to be a bit pricey so after hear such positive reviews about the St.Ives Apricot Face Scrub, I decided to try it out.</li>
            <li>I have large pores and constantly need to schedule facials to keep my blackheads under control.</li>
            <li>The fragrance does have some natural aspects to it, but it should be warned that this product has quite the large ingredient list, with several things I couldn&#x27;t pronounce, let alone spell if I needed to.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough for sensitive skin, but strong enough to really exfoliate off all the dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li>Let me say that I have very sensitive, dry skin on my face and this stuff works pretty well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The new product uses fine sand as the scrub, and as much as I&#x27;ve been trying to keep the sand out of my eyes, every time I&#x27;ve used this item, sand has gotten in my eyes and since the sand is so fine, it&#x27;s impossible to get it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sometimes the back of my upper arms will get bumps and feel rough -- but if I use this every day (or even as sparingly as every 3 days), I can tell a HUGE difference!</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling so soft, and feels much cleaner than washing with a regular face wash.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have any definitive views about the effects but so far I like it.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel SO soft and it brightens my complexion.</li>
            <li>but ive tried it once so far</li>
            <li>I use it all over my body and find my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li>I have been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>St. Ives hit the nail on the head with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also to be noted is St. Ives attention to natural ingredients and their attention to the environment.</li>
            <li>And it leaves your skin feeling soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>If they made it with natural ingredients, I would buy it by the gallons.</li>
            <li>It always left my blemished face look very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t break me out.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my adult blemishes under control.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for a few years, it always leaves my face cleansed and smooth .</li>
            <li>My face is soft.</li>
            <li>Recently, I started noticing that it seemed like this scrub had started not only exfoliating, but lightly scratching my skin, which wouldn&#x27;t be as noticeable on, say, my arms or legs, but was kind of uncomfortable on my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comforting to know that it&#x27;s got natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Instead, it uses 100% natural exfoliants.</li>
            <li>I used this scrub and it has completely removed all my blackheads and my skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not harsh on the skin at all.</li>
            <li>The skin is so soft aft the treatment.</li>
            <li>I tend to like natural products</li>
            <li>As far as its effects on my skin itself</li>
            <li>It cleans out my pores while keeping my face soft and nourished.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why we: Don&#x27;t formulate using parabens and phthalates; Use natural exfoliants, extracts, moisturizers and vitamins.\\</li>
            <li>dead skin free.</li>
            <li>My skin wasn&#x27;t red but it felt like it was crawling and very irritated.</li>
            <li>I guess my skin either didn&#x27;t like something in this scrub or is just too sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, combination, acne prone, aging skin.</li>
            <li>and I really wished I would have bought it earlier.</li>
            <li>I was young when I tried this product and it helps you take out the oils in your face</li>
            <li>At least for me, it has done so and for while I couldn&#x27;t find this product in stores any more.</li>
            <li>I have rosacea and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have no breakouts or redness, because the micro-beads are not harsh to my skin.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t burn like most, it definitely sloshes the dead skin</li>
            <li>The shape of the scrubbing \\&quot;beads\\&quot; are sharp, jagged shapes, which literally destroy healthy skin!</li>
            <li>Aside from the ingredients probably causing my irritation, I believe exfoliating your facial tissue to be too harsh (and scrubs like this with ground up pits can lead to micro cuts and scarring and just exacerbate more acne).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like course sand mixed with dry toothpaste (though it&#x27;s not painful or anything).</li>
            <li>I had these tiny little bumps on my nose and on my cheeks right under my eyes and this morning they were gone!!</li>
            <li>Moisturizer is absorbed much quicker and my pore are less obvious.</li>
            <li>but this product really clean the dead cells...</li>
            <li>Lovely exfoliating scrub with a subtle fragrance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used St. Ives products in the past and have been pleased with the results and this scrub is no different.</li>
            <li>I did notice that sometimes it tended to dry out my skin a little more, but this wasn&#x27;t something that happened every time I used the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did notice that sometimes it tended to dry out my skin a little more, but this wasn&#x27;t something that happened every time I used the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many expensive facial cleansers but really like the way St. Ives makes my face feel really cleansed.</li>
            <li>At other times I use a more creamy facial cleanser since I have dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Better yet, this scrub in formulated without Parabens which are not a good item to include in skincare products.</li>
            <li>a pea sized squeeze really goes a long way.</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve used this product and can not really determine if its the best.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d caution those with extra-sensitive skin to be careful using it the first time.</li>
            <li>The key to reviews on skin care products is to remember that everyone&#x27;s skin is different, and experimentation is key to finding the right balance for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After suffering from adult acne due to hormonal changes this past summer, and trying countless over the counter acne meds, as well as prescribed medications...that experience led me back to my beloved St. Ives scrub.</li>
            <li>unlike other reviewers, I really don&#x27;t see much change in the actual product with the packaging change.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my new facial and customer for life.</li>
            <li>I ended up purchasing several new tubes of the scrub because it was now disappearing twice as fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really believe ex-foliating my skin daily with this product is a big part of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>Its very grainy, larger particles than average, but I really don&#x27;t mind.  </li>
            <li>I use this scrub first, then use a buff puff with Trish McEvoy Moisture Retaining Bar to cleanse, dry off, tone with Clinique Clarifying Lotion 2, then jump back in the shower to rinse off the Clarifying Lotion.</li>
            <li>a few other chemicle peels 1x per week during the winter for more maintenance on my skin as the years pass.</li>
            <li>general rule of thumb is, \\&quot;if</li>
            <li>general rule of thumb is, \\&quot;if</li>
            <li>I have sensitive dry skin with mild rosacea and was looking for something that could scrub off the dead dry skin but not irritate my face too much.</li>
            <li>I immediately stopped using this and after a week or so of just water, my skin finally started to clear</li>
            <li>it took me years and years to finally find a routine that kept my skin clear.</li>
            <li>Not only does it clear up your complexion...</li>
            <li>Im a believer in starting young for skin preventitive maintenance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They even go on to say, \\&quot;Above all, we respect the natural world from which our ingredients are sourced, and are committed to preserving its vitality.</li>
            <li>its 25 ingredients, there are only 4 that are actually natural.</li>
            <li>Skin is baby soft and looks like I just got a facial.</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling extremely soft, despite my blemishes.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product and Neutrogena&#x27;s transparent facial bar since I was 12 years old</li>
            <li>I tried this a while back and found that it irritated my sensitive skin (even the one formulated for sensitive skin turned my face red).</li>
            <li>used this for a while, but unfortunately, I think my skin developed some kind of tolerance to it because it no longer has the same effect.</li>
            <li>This apricot scrub, while nice, unfortunately did not become my \\&quot;holy grail\\&quot; of scrubs though.  </li>
            <li>Using this for years and it is definitely keeping my skin smoother and less discoloring or dark spots than most 44 year olds.</li>
            <li>Just because a product fits one&#x27;s skin type doesn&#x27;t mean it would fit someone else&#x27;s.   </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not overwhelming and goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>I have an oily face and after a hard day of work or play I use this and it returns my skin to that clean neutral feeling.  </li>
            <li>I have my teen daughters now using the product at least once a week to help keep their skin smooth.  </li>
            <li>It not only exfoliates your skin in general but it helps out quite a bit when scrubbing off stubborn face makeup!</li>
            <li>Which means that there is barely any actual APRICOT in this APRICOT scrub.</li>
            <li>Obviously, using this product right after you shower will leave your face a little red, but it goes away quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to do it very carefully and gentle, otherwise my face would be left scratched.</li>
            <li>Washing plastic down the drain really isn&#x27;t something I like doing...</li>
            <li>I want an exfoliator tht has a very concentrated amount of scrubbers to do the job with less.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry but soft.</li>
            <li>BUT if you wear a full face of makeup like I do, then you definitely need to use makeup remover wipes or a toner to remove the remains of your makeup because it does not remove it all (at least not for me).</li>
            <li>The St. Ives Fresh Skin Apricot scrub is tough enough to get rid of blackheads, dirt, and oil but gentle enough to use everyday on my sensitive skin.</li>

            <li> My husband and many others have told me that I my face still looks as though I am still 21!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love this face scrub!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love!</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE this scrub!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleased to report that the breakouts have ceased!  </li>
            <li> I love all the St. Ives products, including the scrub!</li>
            <li> Excellent for rather oily, large pore skins - I hope they continue producing it forever.</li>
            <li> Seems amazing that this brand is still around, so I decided to give it another try.  </li>
            <li> Works amazing</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling real smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled with it and have even started using it on my legs in the shower.</li>
            <li> The apricot is nice smelling, and isn&#x27;t too overpowering for me.</li>
            <li> Apricot pit pieces seems to be the perfect type of &#x27;grit&#x27; - sugar or salt dissolve when you really try to scrub with them.</li>
            <li> also has a nice smell to it and doesnt leave the skin oily</li>
            <li> hey mix it up with warm water</li>
            <li> Also leaves your skin with a nice glow.</li>
            <li> it also smells nice.</li>
            <li> Smells nice though?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so effective</li>
            <li> Nice packaging from the seller.</li>
            <li> This scrub did a nice job freshening my skin and reducing the appearance of blackheads.</li>
            <li> Nice smell.</li>
            <li> The rest of it feels kind of oily to me though, even though it claims not to be too oily.  </li>
            <li> This smells nice and feels nice.  </li>
            <li> good stuff for sure.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Smells nice</li>
            <li> It is a strong exfoliatant, but if you use it wisely it works wonders.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m older now and the problems are mostly gone, but I still think this stuff is the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> but I found that I really liked this one better.  </li>

            <li> St. Ives makes a great product, very reasonably priced.</li>

            <li> Love love love this scrub.</li>
            <li> Be sure to moisturize.</li>

            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Why spend more?</li>
            <li> and it was better than the $25 - $30 scrubs from department store brands.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> First of all, it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I love it because it feels like I treated myself to a mini spa pampering session every time I use it.</li>
            <li> using this for years on my face and just love this product.</li>
            <li> I love St Ives Apricot Scrub.  </li>
            <li> it seems like you&#x27;d have to order it through some exotic company.</li>
            <li> It may be a bit premature to post a review after only one use, but my face felt a lot smoother and had a wonderful glow to it after using it today.  </li>
            <li> and my face feels so much better.</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> Bought more and will buy for others.  </li>
            <li> I love the convenience of ordering this on Amazon without ordering in bulk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this scrub for years, and i love it.</li>
            <li> It just leaves my face wanting more of it.</li>
            <li> but I think it provides more conditioning.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> My make up goes on more evenly.  </li>
            <li> You have to make sure to rinse all out, nostrils, around the eyes, etc-</li>
            <li> I found it works the best, when left alone for a month or more and then used again.</li>
            <li> I love using this</li>
            <li> I love this scrub.  </li>
            <li> (the Grapefruit St Ives Scrub is better and gentler for my face).</li>
            <li> The reason I love this stuff, though, is because of what it does for my ARMS.</li>
            <li> St. Ives, Fresh Skin Apricot Scrub, 6oz is good, came on time and my wife likes it.</li>
            <li> This scrub is gentle on your skin, but does a great job of exfoliating.</li>
            <li> but it scrubs nice and feels smooth after I use it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, too.</li>
            <li> And I have to purchase more again for him.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to keep this for your face, use it mostly all over.  </li>
            <li> But I am glad I was able to find again at Amazon because I love this product</li>
            <li> Refreshing</li>
            <li> I love the smell.  </li>
            <li> But I love the smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I make sure to have a tube around at all</li>
            <li> think this item is more hazardous than the original.</li>
            <li> This has honestly always been my favorite way to clean my face.  </li>
            <li> Best of all it leaves my face feeling fresh, clean, and noticeably brighter after the first use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a pretty good endorsement.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;can absorb it more easily.  </li>
            <li> I have never, not even for hundreds of dollars, been able to so easily exfoliate and de-wrinkle my face with just one wash.</li>
            <li> Love love love this scrub my face feels clean</li>
            <li> I use it mainly on my body &amp; it makes my skin feel amazing, refreshed &amp; so smooth!!</li>
            <li> This scrub is very refreshing and is very gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li> The most important thing is that it does its job well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always great to use this 2-3 times a week and not everyday.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin too.</li>
            <li> I use this as my daily face wash and it feels so good on my skin!</li>
            <li> The best thing about this face scrub is that it&#x27;s not oily and doesn&#x27;t stick on your face, like other walnut scrubs.</li>
            <li> I have used other brands, and this one has been the best.</li>
            <li> The fresh invigorating feeling on my face and the refreshing clean feeling after using it are why I have been using it for many, many years.</li>
            <li> It washes off easily.</li>
            <li> easy to apply and use.</li>
            <li> Im not a fan of the strong smell</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week, and the scrub does its work just fine.</li>
            <li> I love the mild smell.</li>
            <li> I feel so good after using this, my face looks good, I feel fresh, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry!</li>

            <li> An amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;The microbeads are something that I loooove to death, really exfoliates my skin</li>
            <li> After all, it&#x27;s so cheap that I had nothing to lose.</li>
            <li> and my face feels really smooth after using it.</li>
            <li> My face is always smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> Sulfate and paraben free - it sells itself.  </li>
            <li> I use it every day to wash off my makeup and leave my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> The price has doubled with shipping and from what I can tell it can&#x27;t be placed into Prime or a &gt;$35 free shipping order.  </li>
            <li> so I am adding microderm crystals to make my own for much cheaper.</li>
            <li> This simply makes your skin look great and feel like a baby&#x27;s bottom with a glow.</li>
            <li> and it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> Aside from that, it leaves my skin feeling really smooth and looking rejuvenated after every wash.</li>
            <li> It works great on my  skin and scrubs off all make up left over from my face cleanser.</li>
            <li> This removes all the dead skin and leaves my skin looking great!</li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic, and it seems to exfoliate well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product works well to smooth out my hard-working city skin and prevent breakouts.</li>
            <li> Helps smooth skin and prevent acne.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> It is gentle yet effective and I would recommend it to anyone looking to unclog pores, improve skin texture etc.</li>
            <li> and I my face always feels smooth after each use.</li>
            <li> We enjoy the product.</li>
            <li> I also wanted to mention that on occasion I use it on my feet  after a pedicure  to keep the heels and balls of feet smooth.</li>
            <li> and dirt cheap.</li>
            <li> smell is a light fruity scent that isn&#x27;t too objectionable.  </li>

            <li> After couple months using this product, his face is visibly cleaner and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I have fresh, smooth skin every time I use this!</li>
            <li> Like most products, they get a good thing going and then cheat the consumer after they profit enough.</li>
            <li> it makes your skin baby soft and you smell good too</li>
            <li> Natural ingredients, good price, no animal testing.  </li>
            <li> I like a face wash or scrub that has some grit to it because it really helps to exfoliate the skin and this face scrub is definitely the best one that I&#x27;ve tried for exfoliating.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin really soft, feels good to apply and has not been tested on animals.</li>
            <li> It has natural smell and is a good scrub for body and face.</li>
            <li> St. Ives is normally like $5-$7 dollars at any Target or Walmart, with buying my combo of two face washes and the extra hand lotion, which I love and will buy more of, it was a great price for what I paid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been to both ends of the high to low spectrum in terms of experimenting with skin care on a quest to find the perfect combination of products that will get the results I want.</li>
            <li> and helps keep my face smooth and clean in the morning.</li>
            <li> This product always makes my face feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Smells great and left my skin feeling super smooth.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell and even though I&#x27;m not a fan of every ingredient, it&#x27;s easy on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used St. Ives Apricot Scrub in years because I&#x27;d moved on to higher priced and - I assumed - better scrubs.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite exfoliator - it&#x27;s pretty inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> product even has an unique use for those who snorkel or scuba-dive often, like me, and happen to knick coral and get it under the skin.  </li>
            <li> After the first time I used it my skin looked and felt healthier and more polished.</li>
            <li> scrub leaves my skin fresh and rejuvenated!</li>
            <li> First time users though should use many times a weekn in the beginning.</li>
            <li> I use small amount for my face and head and it works great!</li>
            <li> It is cheap and that makes people doubt it I think but sometimes simple or inexpensive products can be the most effective.</li>
            <li> The finely ground apricot seeds do the scrubbing work better than any soap while being gentle to the skin</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product and recommend to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I grew up with acne and have always been balancing a clean face with a greasy/dry face.</li>
            <li> It does clean.</li>
            <li> My skin is always refreshed and clean every after I use this.</li>
            <li> It smells good and your face feels fresh, clean and soft after using it.  </li>
            <li> Also the product left on my hands made for a nice hand scrub too :)</li>
            <li> I have combination dry and oily skin and this product works great for me</li>
            <li> Keeps my face clean.</li>
            <li> so I can get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> As far as scrub and face washes go, I love this!</li>
            <li> All my life I&#x27;ve had beautiful radiant skin due in part to using this product.</li>
            <li> I am sure this Apricot Scrub is good but I prefer the other.</li>
            <li> The beads are somewhat large, and I find them at the bottom of my shower when I&#x27;m done showering, but I continue to use it because I love the smell of the product and feel of my skin after I use it.</li>
            <li> Most stuff really dries my face out but this works like a charm.</li>
            <li> So of course when I saw it on Amazon for such a good deal I knew I had to use it again.</li>
            <li> I use this as a full body exfoliant, have been for years.</li>
            <li> and i had tried several types...and yes smoth and smell good</li>
            <li> it makes things much more cost efficient &amp; really does the job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to exfoliate your skin regularly because the air is getting more and more polluted, and this is the cheapest way to exfoliate your skin.</li>
            <li> I believe that you need 3 key things for good skin: antioxidants, sunscreen,and retinol.</li>
            <li> Keeps skin fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li> , I use it at least thrice a week to ensure the best results.</li>
            <li> This is a true Face Rescue product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now the product have become an absolute necessity in his healthy skin routine.</li>
            <li> It smells good, and it is really a big one for me.</li>
            <li> and I definitely notice the difference (a good difference) from before I started using this compared to after.</li>
            <li> I have used this scrub for awhile, and I noted to him that it was actually the thing that kept my own skin nice and clear - the exfoliation helped to scrub the skin nice and clean, and the salicylic acid helped to prevent new blemishes from appearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tend to get right off and leaves me with a smooth surface.  </li>
            <li> and it is great to use on the other parts of the body like the feet, elbows, and knees.</li>
            <li> Feels so clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> so Im lucky that way.</li>
            <li> This product smells yummy and is a mild scrub.</li>
            <li> and it went away quickly.</li>
            <li> Luckily, once rinsed off of the skin it doesn&#x27;t seem to stay this way.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe just not the best product for me, I still have another bottle of this that I will continue to use, but I definitely will be searching out a different product type in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe just not the best product for me, I still have another bottle of this that I will continue to use, but I definitely will be searching out a different product type in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the delivery was extremely quick, one day before the estimated time.</li>
            <li> It smells good and the coarse scrubbing elements in the soap are just right.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling incredibly soft and clean, unlike most face products.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this scrub for more than 30 year and cannot live without it.</li>
            <li> What I like most about this product is that it isn&#x27;t full of plastic bread but natural apricot kernel pieces.  </li>
            <li> This apricot scrub is good for oily and dry face skin.  </li>
            <li> This is the only face wash I have been able to find that does not make my skin break out, rash, or get zits/pimples!</li>
            <li> More cost effective &amp; less work for me that way.</li>
            <li> The quest for a perfect face scrub is always a tough one.  </li>
            <li> The exfoliation is effective and it smells great, but the grain can be a little too gritty for my face, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It smells kinda nice and it feels nice when I apply it to my face but other than that it doesn&#x27;t really seem to be doing anything positive for my skin.</li>
            <li> It really has changed: the scrub particles are finer than they used to be and, even though they provide fabulous exfoliation, there is nothing abrasive about this newer version.</li>
            <li> It is one of those amazing beauty products that actually work.</li>
            <li> It gently exfoliates my skin, leaving it smooth.  </li>
            <li> This scrub smells great, but it too harsh for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> 10 stars for this amazing facial scrub!!!</li>
            <li> But this one leaves my skin fresh and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Useful for face and body.</li>
            <li> but, I tend to like more natural organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li> so it may be worth a purchase just to see how your skin reacts to it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for months, works well and worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I personally have used many different types of St. Ives products and they work just a good as mega $$$$ products</li>
            <li> One of his friend recommed him to use St. Ives Fresh Skin Apricot Scrub....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have skin problems, but I was looking for something to keep my skin fresh.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this exfoliant/scrub as much anymore because I&#x27;ve found that beta hydroxy acid (BHA) and alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) work more gently on my skin as exfoliants.</li>
            <li> Just use this scrub aggressively to remove the top layer of skin and the coral embedded under the surface layer of the skin, follow with bacitracin or neosporin and a band-aid and it&#x27;ll clear right up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my face very clean, clear, fresh and relaxed.</li>
            <li> Love this product as well as many other St Ives products.  </li>
            <li> It gets rid of dead skin, makes my face feel smoother, softer, and cleaner, and not to mention- pimple free!!!</li>
            <li> The price is right.</li>
            <li> Nothing replaces this product, so please just continue to keep making it just as it is right now.  </li>
            <li> All right.</li>
            <li> Whereas other more fancy/fashionable products feel greasy or too perfumy, this product does what it is supposed to do and your face feels clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It feels like I&#x27;m cleaning my whole face with tiny little sand and it feels wonderful and super clean.</li>
            <li> One thing I miss is that minty fresh clean face feeling I get from clean and clear</li>
            <li> One does not have to use much to clean the whole face.</li>
            <li> cheap enough and good enough.</li>
            <li> Although I rarely use it on my face since I use the oatmeal scrub on my face because I like that the beads in it are smaller than these, I still LOVE this scrub.</li>
            <li> It looks fine and smells just like my old one.</li>
            <li> It positively brightens up the face, and I&#x27;ve noticed the radiance right after use.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and easily removes old, dry, dead skin... revealing fresh, new, soft, supple skin :)</li>
            <li> and I have been keeping up with it since the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> First scrub ever.</li>
            <li> When I combine it with an electric facial brush or a face sponge it works even better.</li>
            <li> They bother your face at first</li>
            <li> Always use sunscreen too ;-).</li>
            <li> I have never used a facial scrub that works better than it does in</li>
            <li> scrub, but have since decided to be more frugal, especially for something that gets washed off of my face, anyway.</li>
            <li> Use twice a week for efficiency ;)</li>
            <li> Another plus is that it&#x27;s better for the environment than a lot of similar scrubs.</li>
            <li> I love this face scrub to use in the morning, because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary to &amp;</li>
            <li> It does an ok job, but ultimately, I&#x27;m looking for improvement, not \\&quot;ok\\&quot;.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but when you rub it into your face you can feel it on your skin, so you&#x27;re aware if you haven&#x27;t rinsed it</li>
            <li> I definitely would recommend this for those who are looking for a refreshing scrub/face-wash.</li>
            <li> In any case, how many of those ingredients can you actually pronounce?</li>
            <li> it has clear all my acne and has made my face smooth.</li>
            <li> At first I loved how it smelled but after a few days it started breaking me out a lot.</li>
            <li> Also, it did not cause my rosacea to flare up, and actually made it better.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product that really keeps the skin fresh.</li>
            <li> I like to think that it makes my facial skin look better, but that could just be my imagination.  </li>
            <li> It made my face very soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Made my face very soft and clean, didn&#x27;t cause break outs, and the size is huge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The new design on the bottle is also pretty cool.</li>
            <li> Using this, very gently, every day leaves my face feeling soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> Not only does this product smell great, it really does keep your skin clear and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different products, but this is the only thing that continues to help prevent breakouts (usually don&#x27;t have much anymore, but now that I&#x27;m pregnant it came back :-P) and make my skin feel nice.</li>
            <li> The scrubbing particles really leave you with a clean feeling and it works better than other facewashes I have tried.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth although sometimes a bit dry.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective, but mild enough for daily use!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my face break out and it makes my skin feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li> My face always feels soft and clean when I use this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years and have been satisfied with the result: smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad to have found this product on Amazon and at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s positively invigorating.  </li>
            <li> I love the product as a daily scrub, and if you really want to brighten your skin, use straight baking soda once a week.  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased the green tea version of their scrub after seeing a review online, and the grain is MUCH finer, which made it feel more effective but also gentler.</li>
            <li> This scrub makes my skin very smooth and refreshed, and does not make it dry!</li>
            <li> A previous effective product has now been crippled by change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> St. Ives ain&#x27;t no saint, for certain.</li>
            <li> St. Ives ain&#x27;t no saint, for certain.</li>
            <li> I definitely don&#x27;t use it daily because I think that *would* be too harsh, but I love it for those days when I need a deeper clean and a nice exfoliation.</li>
            <li> So while it&#x27;s not necessarily false advertising, it is nonetheless deceiving.</li>
            <li> Gentle scrubbing with out drying her face out.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell</li>
            <li> maybe I was expecting this too much, but it basically feels like I threw my money away buying and using this.</li>
            <li> However, now that my hormones have ceased wreaking havoc, this product has become an absolute necessity in my healthy-skin routine.</li>
            <li> but I really like it.  </li>
            <li> It does all of it in a gentle way.</li>
            <li> But really works and leaves face</li>
            <li> The harder you scrub, the more of that &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; effect you get.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot St Ives.</li>
            <li> Exfoliates well (but, really so does sugar, baking soda, etc.)</li>
            <li> My face always feels baby soft and fresh after.</li>
            <li> I really like the roughness of the scrub.</li>
            <li> I follow up with a Benzoyl Peroxide treatment and that has really helped with my acne.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> Your face is left smooth</li>
            <li> it ended up really drying my face</li>
            <li> but I was not getting ready for the day</li>
            <li> It really helps to exfoliate your skin.</li>
            <li> I really wanted the St. Ives Timeless Skin instead.  </li>
            <li> When using it, remember to use gently pressure....</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> thought the price was very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really lather per</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still nothing that would really be bothersome.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> I shave my head, so shampoo doesn&#x27;t really factor in.  </li>
            <li> While it has never irritated my skin, I can imagine it could create an issue for those with especially sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> And, really, who knows about corn anymore?</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> My skin is very temperamental -</li>
            <li> I use it about once a week, and I can really tell the difference.</li>
            <li> It is gentle, moisturizing and exfoliating, all in one.</li>
            <li> The product is also fantastic, and I used it last night.</li>
            <li> I use it about 3 times a week, and each time I feel very refreshed.</li>
            <li> This product is gentle on my face and does not irritate the rosacea.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone who might be unsure of whether or not to try this!</li>
            <li> When I found that Amazon has this much cheaper here then</li>
            <li> I really like this face wash.  </li>
            <li> For those of us concerned with such things, it&#x27;s nice to know I&#x27;m not slathering potentially harmful chemicals all over my body.</li>
            <li> I leaves my skin clean, my only problem would be the large beads that it comes with.  </li>
            <li> Even though the packaging isn&#x27;t the same bright orange color it was before, it&#x27;s still exactly the same as it was back then - a fabulous exfoliant that can be used multiple times a week.</li>
            <li> It gets my face, back and bottom so squeaky clean and helps to minimize the acne.</li>
            <li> My main problem isn&#x27;t even so much that it was ineffective, but that it&#x27;s called an \\&quot;Apricot Scrub.\\&quot; Under Amazon&#x27;s product description</li>
            <li> It worked well and left my skin feeling clean and</li>
            <li> I tried multiple products but finally I got a product that is suitable to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it got rid of some blackheads because the past washes I used didn&#x27;t do such a good job of it!</li>
            <li> different, o special.</li>
            <li> I got a sample size of this a while back and when it ran out I looked to Amazon for the full size.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I would rate it higher if the packaging wasn&#x27;t misleading in it&#x27;s &amp;#34;100% natural EXFOLIANTS&amp;#34; claim.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it because it&#x27;s also sulfate and paraben-free, which is great if you have sensitive skin like I do or don&#x27;t like harsh chemicals damaging your skin.</li>
            <li> i dont like exfoliating scrubs in the first place because i feel like it takes the natural oils off your face.  </li>
            <li> This one is just right, breaths new life into my skin and leaves it soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little rough, so I probably wouldn&#x27;t use it every day, but it&#x27;s great when I just feel like my skin is...blah.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still the only product on the market that makes my skin really glow and is sensitive skin friendly.</li>
            <li> With a moisturizing lotion, this is great for the treatment of dry skin and using it daily doesn&#x27;t seem to be an issue, especially when one frequently wears makeup.</li>
            <li> St Ives is more coarse and left smoother skin.  </li>
            <li> I have occasional one or two zits, but overall my face is much better.  </li>
            <li> I prefer physical exfoliants to chemical ones, and this is my current favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried more expensive exfoliation products but why pay more when this does the job.</li>
            <li> scrub is a mildly abrasive one that has enough texture you feel it working at your skin when you use it.  </li>
            <li> I am somewhat particular about my face wash and this one passes the test.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d recommend it to those with very sensitive skin, but it&#x27;s also really inexpensive</li>
            <li> It gently buffs my dead skin and makeup away after a long day and it smells really good.</li>
            <li> I think it would be better with a bit more soap or otherwise liquid; as is, it&#x27;s dry and hard to lather.</li>
            <li> and I have tried just about everything including high dose salicylic acid.  </li>
            <li> I used 2 or 3 times a week and do not find it harsh and it makes my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> highly recommended.</li>
            <li> In any case, highly recommended</li>
            <li> It comes with little beads which I make sure to rub all over the face.</li>
            <li> this scrub makes it easy for other products to penetrate after outer layer of skin is removed.</li>
            <li> Apricot scrub is bio-degradeable and is gentle for sensitive skin users.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and it really helps my skin stay clear of any blemish.</li>
            <li> It provided a gentle exfoliation and did not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This helps keep my face clear by thoroughly exfoliating while magically not irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with acne for years now, and I&#x27;ve tried tons of various products, with varying rates of success.</li>
            <li> I use it once a day, after my normal cleanser.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am experimenting with my shoulders and chest and it leaves my skin soft, not sure if it&#x27;ll be effective on my shoulders.</li>
            <li> that say the product is too harsh for your skin, but I love it.</li>
            <li> Good price, usually beats local store prices.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been used many scrubs in order to remove dead cells, but since I choose this one I will have it for a lot of time.</li>
            <li> The scrub exfoliates the dead skin cells to reveal the smoother skin underneath leaving more youthful looking skin.</li>
            <li> more so that didn&#x27;t thrill me, but at least some of the ingredients were recognizable (like walnut shell for the scrubby roughness of the product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear to me that the hulls in the formula have been grinded down more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a VERY strong product; so I only use it every other week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only is it oil-free, it&#x27;s also free of parabens and skin-drying sulfates which is great for anyone seeking a product without a lot of harsh chemicals that can cause an imbalance and damage the delicate skin.</li>
            <li> Other ones don&#x27;t do much for me because their grain size is too small or big and texture is usually too smooth to make a difference, but this one is perfect.</li>
            <li> The only difference is the odor is different, but it works just fine, for the price I will continue purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> new.  </li>
            <li> We can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I have tried many name brand scrubs, and they turn my skin raw.</li>
            <li> This scrub is basic to clear skin if needed, and I would only use this occasionally not every day, cause it can be too drying to fair skin only if used to often.</li>
            <li> Use it mainly during the winter to exfoliate old skin.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin, and this product fits my skin type.</li>
            <li> but I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I actually appreciated that it wasn&#x27;t too strong of a scent because with all the other products you could use in your daily cleansing regime, scent is bound to be covered elsewhere and doesn&#x27;t need to be in everything.  </li>
            <li> Good facial scrub, helped clear my acne that was caused by some &#x27;african black soap\\&quot; that i bought on amazon.</li>
            <li> Just tried this scrub again and I was very pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> This is less powerful than neutrogena deep clean</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling smooth and clean without drying or causing that post-scrub redness and irritation that is common with a lot of facial scrubs.</li>
            <li> I have oily, acne-prone, AND sensitive skin (my skin gets red and inflamed if I so happen to look at it funny...)</li>
            <li> I really like Olay microbermabrasion in the little tub for exfoliating because its super concentrated.</li>
            <li> Its worth every single penny.  </li>
            <li> I found that to be a bit pricey so after hear such positive reviews about the St.Ives Apricot Face Scrub, I decided to try it out.</li>
            <li> I have large pores and constantly need to schedule facials to keep my blackheads under control.</li>
            <li> The fragrance does have some natural aspects to it, but it should be warned that this product has quite the large ingredient list, with several things I couldn&#x27;t pronounce, let alone spell if I needed to.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough for sensitive skin, but strong enough to really exfoliate off all the dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li> Let me say that I have very sensitive, dry skin on my face and this stuff works pretty well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The new product uses fine sand as the scrub, and as much as I&#x27;ve been trying to keep the sand out of my eyes, every time I&#x27;ve used this item, sand has gotten in my eyes and since the sand is so fine, it&#x27;s impossible to get it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sometimes the back of my upper arms will get bumps and feel rough -- but if I use this every day (or even as sparingly as every 3 days), I can tell a HUGE difference!</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling so soft, and feels much cleaner than washing with a regular face wash.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have any definitive views about the effects but so far I like it.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel SO soft and it brightens my complexion.</li>
            <li> but ive tried it once so far</li>
            <li> I use it all over my body and find my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li> I have been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> St. Ives hit the nail on the head with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also to be noted is St. Ives attention to natural ingredients and their attention to the environment.</li>
            <li> And it leaves your skin feeling soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> If they made it with natural ingredients, I would buy it by the gallons.</li>
            <li> It always left my blemished face look very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t break me out.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my adult blemishes under control.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for a few years, it always leaves my face cleansed and smooth .</li>
            <li> My face is soft.</li>
            <li> Recently, I started noticing that it seemed like this scrub had started not only exfoliating, but lightly scratching my skin, which wouldn&#x27;t be as noticeable on, say, my arms or legs, but was kind of uncomfortable on my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comforting to know that it&#x27;s got natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Instead, it uses 100% natural exfoliants.</li>
            <li> I used this scrub and it has completely removed all my blackheads and my skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not harsh on the skin at all.</li>
            <li> The skin is so soft aft the treatment.</li>
            <li> I tend to like natural products</li>
            <li> As far as its effects on my skin itself</li>
            <li> It cleans out my pores while keeping my face soft and nourished.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why we: Don&#x27;t formulate using parabens and phthalates; Use natural exfoliants, extracts, moisturizers and vitamins.\\</li>
            <li> dead skin free.</li>
            <li> My skin wasn&#x27;t red but it felt like it was crawling and very irritated.</li>
            <li> I guess my skin either didn&#x27;t like something in this scrub or is just too sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, combination, acne prone, aging skin.</li>
            <li> and I really wished I would have bought it earlier.</li>
            <li> I was young when I tried this product and it helps you take out the oils in your face</li>
            <li> At least for me, it has done so and for while I couldn&#x27;t find this product in stores any more.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have no breakouts or redness, because the micro-beads are not harsh to my skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn like most, it definitely sloshes the dead skin</li>
            <li> The shape of the scrubbing \\&quot;beads\\&quot; are sharp, jagged shapes, which literally destroy healthy skin!</li>
            <li> Aside from the ingredients probably causing my irritation, I believe exfoliating your facial tissue to be too harsh (and scrubs like this with ground up pits can lead to micro cuts and scarring and just exacerbate more acne).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like course sand mixed with dry toothpaste (though it&#x27;s not painful or anything).</li>
            <li> I had these tiny little bumps on my nose and on my cheeks right under my eyes and this morning they were gone!!</li>
            <li> Moisturizer is absorbed much quicker and my pore are less obvious.</li>
            <li> but this product really clean the dead cells...</li>
            <li> Lovely exfoliating scrub with a subtle fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used St. Ives products in the past and have been pleased with the results and this scrub is no different.</li>
            <li> I did notice that sometimes it tended to dry out my skin a little more, but this wasn&#x27;t something that happened every time I used the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did notice that sometimes it tended to dry out my skin a little more, but this wasn&#x27;t something that happened every time I used the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many expensive facial cleansers but really like the way St. Ives makes my face feel really cleansed.</li>
            <li> At other times I use a more creamy facial cleanser since I have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Better yet, this scrub in formulated without Parabens which are not a good item to include in skincare products.</li>
            <li> a pea sized squeeze really goes a long way.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve used this product and can not really determine if its the best.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d caution those with extra-sensitive skin to be careful using it the first time.</li>
            <li> The key to reviews on skin care products is to remember that everyone&#x27;s skin is different, and experimentation is key to finding the right balance for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After suffering from adult acne due to hormonal changes this past summer, and trying countless over the counter acne meds, as well as prescribed medications...that experience led me back to my beloved St. Ives scrub.</li>
            <li> unlike other reviewers, I really don&#x27;t see much change in the actual product with the packaging change.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my new facial and customer for life.</li>
            <li> I ended up purchasing several new tubes of the scrub because it was now disappearing twice as fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really believe ex-foliating my skin daily with this product is a big part of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> Its very grainy, larger particles than average, but I really don&#x27;t mind.  </li>
            <li> I use this scrub first, then use a buff puff with Trish McEvoy Moisture Retaining Bar to cleanse, dry off, tone with Clinique Clarifying Lotion 2, then jump back in the shower to rinse off the Clarifying Lotion.</li>
            <li> a few other chemicle peels 1x per week during the winter for more maintenance on my skin as the years pass.</li>
            <li> general rule of thumb is, \\&quot;if</li>
            <li> general rule of thumb is, \\&quot;if</li>
            <li> I have sensitive dry skin with mild rosacea and was looking for something that could scrub off the dead dry skin but not irritate my face too much.</li>
            <li> I immediately stopped using this and after a week or so of just water, my skin finally started to clear</li>
            <li> it took me years and years to finally find a routine that kept my skin clear.</li>
            <li> Not only does it clear up your complexion...</li>
            <li> Im a believer in starting young for skin preventitive maintenance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They even go on to say, \\&quot;Above all, we respect the natural world from which our ingredients are sourced, and are committed to preserving its vitality.</li>
            <li> its 25 ingredients, there are only 4 that are actually natural.</li>
            <li> Skin is baby soft and looks like I just got a facial.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling extremely soft, despite my blemishes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product and Neutrogena&#x27;s transparent facial bar since I was 12 years old</li>
            <li> I tried this a while back and found that it irritated my sensitive skin (even the one formulated for sensitive skin turned my face red).</li>
            <li> used this for a while, but unfortunately, I think my skin developed some kind of tolerance to it because it no longer has the same effect.</li>
            <li> This apricot scrub, while nice, unfortunately did not become my \\&quot;holy grail\\&quot; of scrubs though.  </li>
            <li> Using this for years and it is definitely keeping my skin smoother and less discoloring or dark spots than most 44 year olds.</li>
            <li> Just because a product fits one&#x27;s skin type doesn&#x27;t mean it would fit someone else&#x27;s.   </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not overwhelming and goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> I have an oily face and after a hard day of work or play I use this and it returns my skin to that clean neutral feeling.  </li>
            <li> I have my teen daughters now using the product at least once a week to help keep their skin smooth.  </li>
            <li> It not only exfoliates your skin in general but it helps out quite a bit when scrubbing off stubborn face makeup!</li>
            <li> Which means that there is barely any actual APRICOT in this APRICOT scrub.</li>
            <li> Obviously, using this product right after you shower will leave your face a little red, but it goes away quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to do it very carefully and gentle, otherwise my face would be left scratched.</li>
            <li> Washing plastic down the drain really isn&#x27;t something I like doing...</li>
            <li> I want an exfoliator tht has a very concentrated amount of scrubbers to do the job with less.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry but soft.</li>
            <li> BUT if you wear a full face of makeup like I do, then you definitely need to use makeup remover wipes or a toner to remove the remains of your makeup because it does not remove it all (at least not for me).</li>
            <li> The St. Ives Fresh Skin Apricot scrub is tough enough to get rid of blackheads, dirt, and oil but gentle enough to use everyday on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly not a miracle product, and it doesn&#x27;t eliminate every blemish, but the difference is certainly clear.</li>
            <li> It has not dried out my skin, even after washing twice a day, vs some other facial washes.</li>
            <li> I am a little older and dont have a wrinkle on my face.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is subtle and fresh, like ripe apricot.</li>
            <li> This is the only personal care product that I&#x27;ve been using for anywhere close to this long.  </li>
            <li> and I can imagine a larger bottle lasting quite a long time, so there is a lot of value here.  </li>
            <li> I guess they think that the scrubbing agents are too harsh for older skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27 years old, and still suffer from occasional acne/pimples, however, since I&#x27;ve started using this product about a year and a half ago, my skin has improved dramatically...</li>
            <li> It cleans away dry dead skin cells and leaves the skin to breath.&lt;br /&gt;The oily skin it cleans very well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product regularly for a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I have begun using this apricot scrub, my skin has been noticeably clearer, much smoother, and the uneven pigmentation has become much, much less apparent.</li>
            <li> I tried other options, but there would either be too much or too little grit</li>
            <li> The other exfoliants I&#x27;ve tried are either too harsh leaving my skin feeling dry and stripped or too gentle to make a difference.</li>
            <li> In its ads for this product, St. Ives claims that apricots are the &amp;#34;key ingredient&amp;#34; because they are &amp;#34;known to contain one of the highest levels of carotenoids (think vitamin A) and super-effective antioxidants.&amp;#34;  HOWEVER, if you look at the ingredients list for this product, you will see that the only mention of anything apricot-related is the very last ingredient (Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Fruit Extract), which means that there is only very, very little apricot anything actually contained within this product.</li>
            <li> Its cheap, but hey it works, dont need a fancy names nor expensive prices to get what you want.  </li>
            <li> I use it now and it has actually lasted longer than I have expected.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really rough and gritty</li>
            <li> So, through every facial skin condition I have gone through as I have aged</li>
            <li> My skin is not sensitive</li>
            <li> been using for a long time...</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend over doing it with this product in items of scrubbing your face too long.</li>
            <li> breakout using this strangely, so I will not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> There is something in the base that makes this so good.</li>
            <li> I hate smelly, beauty products because they never smell good.</li>
            <li> I usually cycle into a new soap, shave-cream, shampoo, etc.</li>
            <li> My face is usually dry</li>
            <li> It works well for my (dry) skin.</li>
            <li> In the winter because my skin gets dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> Ive been having issues with my face being dry, i use it once a day</li>
            <li> (my face tends to dry but oily in the t zone).  </li>
            <li> For reference my skin is somewhat dry with problem areas being the chin and forehead.  </li>
            <li> For reference my skin is somewhat dry with problem areas being the chin and forehead.  </li>
            <li> In addition to stripping dry skin, the scrub helps with ingrown hairs as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It never leaves my face overly dry or overly scented.</li>
            <li> I moved to Los Angeles where it is really dry</li>
            <li> and my skin was extremely dry and flaky...</li>
            <li> I can not live with out it.</li>
            <li> It has all natural exfoliants so they will break down after you wash them down the drain and not build up in your septic tank or sewers.</li>
            <li> The only thing that has actively cut down on the amount of facial blemishes has been the apricot scrub.</li>
            <li> That really cleans your skin, but it&#x27;s not good for every day.  </li>
            <li> As long as I can find the green tea version, I will be buying it instead of the traditional apricot.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect to see 100% smoothness after the first day, but after a few applications the bumps/roughness on your arms will be gone or at least minimized.</li>
            <li> I like the exfoliant, as I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> and recently I noticed I have a few dry patches and figured I needed a scrub.</li>
            <li> Every other exfoliating scrub that I have tried has either left my skin feeling dry and tight or so oily</li>
            <li> I had tiny skin-colored little bumps all over my face</li>
            <li> I will only use this once a week and use another finer one everyday.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m careful and prefer not to use it whenever I feel my skin is breaking out.</li>
            <li> One of the few products I can use where I see an immediate effect that same day.</li>
            <li> To me a total waste of the intention.</li>
            <li> I have found myself buying a few different scrubs that dont work well</li>
            <li> It is usually rough on the skin.</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks there was no need to wear foundation because the imperfections were gone and haven&#x27;t come back since.</li>
            <li> Nothing got worse like what sometimes happens with a lot of products I try, but nothing really improved either.  </li>
            <li> One time I stumbled upon an article that says that dead skin cells that clogs the skin essentially cause the skin harder to breath, therefore pimples keep reappearing.  </li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive to try this scrub because I usually buy much more expensive scrubs</li>
            <li> There is nothing too sharp or rough in regards to the scrub part of the cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Soon, my face became less oily between washes, my pores shrank, and the dry skin was virtually eliminated.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing worse than drying out your skin which in turn makes you look older.</li>
            <li> I takes all the dry, dead skin off and even helps get down deep into the pour to get rid of any black heads.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Just a little bit went a long way</li>
            <li> When i first got it i realized i got the wrong product, meant to get Blemish Control and tried to return it</li>
            <li> And my skin bein oily was prone to pimples with other face scrubs.</li>
            <li> No idea what it does functionally other than get &amp;</li>
            <li> Other than avoiding the sun and using sun-screen, people insist I don&#x27;t look my age by a decade-</li>
            <li> In other words, it doesn&#x27;t do jack anymore.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a coarser grit than other exfoliating scrubs I&#x27;ve used, but again, it&#x27;s never given me issues.</li>
            <li> and I have suggested it to other friends time and time again.  </li>
            <li> And even boyfriends of past who were struggling with acne, this facial scrub worked like a charm.  </li>
            <li> I usually purchase the larger size but purchased this size for travel.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, you may have thought that those little rough bits are ground apricot kernels.</li>
            <li> My skin gets super oily in humidity and dries out badly in the winter or dry heat.  </li>
            <li> I picked this up recently after being tired of having dry flaky skin on my face during the winter.</li>
            <li> Hands down</li>
            <li> little one ounce bottle of this scrub lasted me two months; I tended to use it every other day rather than every day.  </li>
            <li> No more patchy dry skin.</li>
            <li> It has DRASTICALLY minimized my pores and my acne scars are MUCH less noticeable.</li>
            <li> It shrinks my black heads and shrinks my pores.</li>
            <li> Classic formula and you cannot go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> For the first three days or so using this product, I broke out like crazy all over my face.  </li>
            <li> I use it at least once a week to get the really dry patches off my skin in the mornings.  </li>
            <li> The little scrubbing balls have since been out lawed because it&#x27;s said they go into the ocean and fish eat them</li>
            <li> did notice a little bit of redness</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t exfoliate using thousands of little plastic microbeads which contaminate water and can build up in the plumbing.</li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t too harsh with it, too.</li>
            <li> It does not leave your skin burning or dried out like others I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I use this product to wash my face and neck everyday at the shower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Others wrote the peels are too harsh for them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this scrub for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I have bought &amp; used this product a few times over the years.</li>
            <li> but I dont want to waste them</li>
            <li> Thus, losing their ability to break away the dead skin.</li>
            <li> It takes off all the dead skin</li>
            <li> It smells nice and it feels like it gets the job done without having nasty chemicals all over my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s on the harsher side though - if you have sensitive skin be wary.</li>
            <li> I tried the green tea scrub before too at one point</li>
            <li> I get a lot of dead skin on my face.</li>
            <li> It slouches off all of the dead skin and cleans out my pores.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for everyday use.</li>
            <li> It removes dead skin, dirt and unwanted oils from your face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get that dried out feeling like some cleansers leave.</li>
            <li> Yes, it removes dead skin build up, but it also punctutes your skin, letting bacteria in.</li>
            <li> and it gets rid of dead skin cells, then the rest of the week I use a moisturizing face wash.</li>
            <li> If you have body acne you can use it in the shower, but trick is to leave it on the skin for a few minutes, don&#x27;t just rinse it off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few months.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s tried several things, to no avail, which is understandably frustrating.</li>
            <li> I have used a couple of face scrubs in the past few years, and, hands down, this one has the rest beat.  </li>
            <li> However, the little beads in it hurt my face!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of the exfoliating beads it can leave my face a little irritated depending on how hard I scrub my face.</li>
            <li> A harsh scrub for thick skin.  </li>
            <li> No more subscribe-and-save?  </li>
            <li> I noticed that the price for the quantity was lower than what I have been paying in the past</li>
            <li> After it I recommend an expensive face moisturizer such Clinique or Lancome.</li>
            <li> I usually use the Bath and Body Works face scrub which was $12.</li>
            <li> He had tried a stronger salicylic acid lotion prescribed by his dermatologist, but that had some unpleasant side effects, while doing nothing to clear his skin.</li>
            <li> Must apply moisturizer afterward or your face will feel very tight!</li>
            <li> I been using this for a month or two now, at least once or twice a week.  </li>
            <li> My wife has thin skin and cannot use this product; the abrasive is just to harsh for her skin.  </li>
            <li> yes, I mean DRAMATICALLY.   </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> being said, I am in my early twenties, I have oily/combination skin, and dreadful unevenness of skin tone due to acne scarring.</li>
            <li> As a guy I&#x27;m not a good judge of the effectiveness of these things</li>
            <li> I was never a person that got a lot of acne, just the occasional pimple or two, so this made me really shocked.</li>
            <li> and I hardly EVER have blemishes!</li>
            <li> Yeah, the crap that scrapes the dead skin off is made of natural ingredients, but everything else is relatively bad for your skin.</li>
            <li> My husband and my daughter are equally addicted to it.</li>
            <li> However, your search for apricot in the ingredients (amidst terrifyingly unpronounceable chemicals and carcinogens alike) ends at the very tail end with \\&quot;Prunus</li>
            <li> Their claim that they don&#x27;t use phthalates in their products is also definitely false. \\&quot;Frangrance\\&quot; &#x3D; phthalates.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use phthalates in their products is also definitely false. \\&quot;Frangrance\\&quot; &#x3D; phthalates.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried really expensive exfoliating face wash.  </li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t know wtf</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t know wtf</li>
            <li> My skin broke out into this weird texture.</li>
            <li> My spa people do not like that it is &amp;#34;grainy&amp;#34; - too bad, I like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had acne as bad as I did when using this, but I&#x27;ve heard that switching your cleansing routine can cause reactions like this, so I stuck it out.  </li>
            <li> I had foolishly been using a ridiculously expensive ($30 for 2oz!!)</li>
            <li> and I hate that.  </li>
            <li> Buy this instead of the exxxxxpensive crap.</li>
            <li> this -- I truly promise you, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> or it would smell awful, so I settled.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve studied scrubs, and this one is terrible for your skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Helps keep my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Its so good on my skin leaving it smooth and soft. It also smells so nice and does a great work</li>
            <li> product arrived as described. Although I had not paid attention to the fact that this is not the medicated version, My wife likes it. Gentle scrubbing with out drying her face out.</li>
            <li> I stock up on this at the drugstore, because they have really good sales - 2 for 1.  I love the product as a daily scrub, and if you really want to brighten your skin, use straight baking soda once a week.  That really cleans your skin, but it&#x27;s not good for every day.  This scrub is excellent for a daily face cleaner, and the baking soda is the best for a weekly cleaner.</li>
            <li> I use this as my daily face wash and it feels so good on my skin! It gently buffs my dead skin and makeup away after a long day and it smells really good. It has DRASTICALLY minimized my pores and my acne scars are MUCH less noticeable. I use it now and it has actually lasted longer than I have expected. BUT if you wear a full face of makeup like I do, then you definitely need to use makeup remover wipes or a toner to remove the remains of your makeup because it does not remove it all (at least not for me). Overall, I would recommend!!</li>
            <li> I love this scrub.  I keep it in my shower and use it to wash my face.  If I just use a face wash or soap, after a couple of days my skin starts to get bumpy around my hairline and I hate that.  Using this, very gently, every day leaves my face feeling soft and clean.  I like the scent as well.</li>
            <li> I used to use St. Ives scrubs all the time and loved them. The little scrubbing balls have since been out lawed because it&#x27;s said they go into the ocean and fish eat them and then we eat them and it&#x27;s now hazardous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new product uses fine sand as the scrub, and as much as I&#x27;ve been trying to keep the sand out of my eyes, every time I&#x27;ve used this item, sand has gotten in my eyes and since the sand is so fine, it&#x27;s impossible to get it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this item is more hazardous than the original.</li>
            <li> Good facial scrub, helped clear my acne that was caused by some &#x27;african black soap\\&quot; that i bought on amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times and it does nothing for my face. You get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> I brought this yesterday at CVS because someone was talking about it online. My face is usually dry and recently I noticed I have a few dry patches and figured I needed a scrub. So, I put this on last night and immediately loved it!!! It feels so nice and leaves your skin flawless. I had these tiny little bumps on my nose and on my cheeks right under my eyes and this morning they were gone!! I followed this with Vitamin E oil by Burt&#x27;s Bees but I plan on trying their firming moisturizer. I plan on buying my sister a bottle!! Oh and I&#x27;m glowing and my skin tone has evened out on one use.</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a reasonable price. I got this as an add-on. I have used this for years.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something really coarse this is for you. I will only use this once a week and use another finer one everyday.</li>
            <li> A harsh scrub for thick skin.  I have used this for years and I love it.  My wife has thin skin and cannot use this product; the abrasive is just to harsh for her skin.  I only use it once a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with acne for years now, and I&#x27;ve tried tons of various products, with varying rates of success. I saw the reviews on this, and got it on a whim.... I&#x27;ve only been using it for about two weeks, and it has already cleared up my face!! I&#x27;m amazed!! It leaves your skin feeling incredibly soft and clean, unlike most face products.  I would recommend this to anyone with acne problems - just try it, it&#x27;s not that expensive, and I think you&#x27;ll be really pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;I used this for a while, but unfortunately, I think my skin developed some kind of tolerance to it because it no longer has the same effect. It&#x27;s still a really refreshing scrub and I like using it, but I don&#x27;t rely on it for acne anymore. Not changing my star rating because I still really enjoy using it!</li>
            <li> I have severe acne and I have tried just about everything including high dose salicylic acid.  One time I stumbled upon an article that says that dead skin cells that clogs the skin essentially cause the skin harder to breath, therefore pimples keep reappearing.  makes sense, so I bought the scrub.  I tried the Loreal, it was okay, but the scrub particles are finer in loreal.  St Ives is more coarse and left smoother skin.  One month after using this product, my face is visibly cleaner.  I have occasional one or two zits, but overall my face is much better.  I use it daily.  The instruction says not to use it that often.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for about 2 yrs and I have been keeping up with it since the first time I used it. The scrubbing particles really leave you with a clean feeling and it works better than other facewashes I have tried.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used St. Ives Apricot Scrub in years because I&#x27;d moved on to higher priced and - I assumed - better scrubs. Just tried this scrub again and I was very pleasantly surprised! It really has changed: the scrub particles are finer than they used to be and, even though they provide fabulous exfoliation, there is nothing abrasive about this newer version. If you haven&#x27;t used St. Ives Apricot Scrub in a while, I suggest you give it another try. I&#x27;m thrilled with it and have even started using it on my legs in the shower. Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought it on a friend&#x27;s recommendation. It&#x27;s very good value for money. I love the mild smell. Don&#x27;t have any definitive views about the effects but so far I like it.</li>
            <li> I been using this for a month or two now, at least once or twice a week.  So far works great and smells really nice</li>
            <li> First scrub ever. Scrub forever!&lt;br /&gt;I love this scrub. It makes my face feel SO soft and it brightens my complexion. It does a great job of exfoliating my skin, and I kinda...love the smell :)</li>
            <li> When i first got it i realized i got the wrong product, meant to get Blemish Control and tried to return it but Amazon let me keep it and just refunded me. Im not a fan of the strong smell it makes me scared to apply to my face but ive tried it once so far and it&#x27;s really rough and gritty so i&#x27;ll only use it once in a while.</li>
            <li> As far as scrub and face washes go, I love this! It works well for my (dry) skin. Most stuff really dries my face out but this works like a charm. Love it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this scrub. Although I rarely use it on my face since I use the oatmeal scrub on my face because I like that the beads in it are smaller than these, I still LOVE this scrub. I love the smell, texture &amp; the end result. I use it mainly on my body &amp; it makes my skin feel amazing, refreshed &amp; so smooth!! Totally love it!</li>
            <li> I have used St. Ives products for since I was 15 I am now 52. So, through every facial skin condition I have gone through as I have aged, there has always been a St. Ives product for me Every other exfoliating scrub that I have tried has either left my skin feeling dry and tight or so oily I would get zits.  My husband and many others have told me that I my face still looks as though I am still 21!</li>
            <li> An amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;The microbeads are something that I loooove to death, really exfoliates my skin and it isn&#x27;t too harsh with it, too. I was surprised that it got rid of some blackheads because the past washes I used didn&#x27;t do such a good job of it! The apricot is nice smelling, and isn&#x27;t too overpowering for me. Overall, it&#x27;s a perfect face wash and I&#x27;m happy I ordered it. Really refreshing.</li>
            <li> What a wonderful product.I use it all over my body and find my skin is so soft.The price is right. You dont have to spend lots of money at a spa for the same experience.I love this product!</li>
            <li> This face wash is the best exfoliating face wash on the market. The smell is excellent and it works so well. I have been using it for almost five years and will never part from it!!</li>
            <li> Of course I have seen this in the drug stores for years and I tried it as a teenager, and it exfoliated good then. So of course when I saw it on Amazon for such a good deal I knew I had to use it again. It gets my face, back and bottom so squeaky clean and helps to minimize the acne. I do recommend.</li>
            <li> I use this to wash my face during showers and it is the best scrub I have ever used.  Whereas other more fancy/fashionable products feel greasy or too perfumy, this product does what it is supposed to do and your face feels clean and smooth.  I have an oily face and after a hard day of work or play I use this and it returns my skin to that clean neutral feeling.  It does not leave your skin burning or dried out like others I have tried.  It works, it&#x27;s inexpensive, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I believe all sorts of cosmetic/toiletry products are bound to get different opinion based on the person in question&#x27;s skin type... Just because a product fits one&#x27;s skin type doesn&#x27;t mean it would fit someone else&#x27;s.   As for me, I love this product. I&#x27;m 27 years old, and still suffer from occasional acne/pimples, however, since I&#x27;ve started using this product about a year and a half ago, my skin has improved dramatically... yes, I mean DRAMATICALLY.   I use this product to wash my face and neck everyday at the shower. It gets rid of dead skin, makes my face feel smoother, softer, and cleaner, and not to mention- pimple free!!!</li>
            <li> I prefer physical exfoliants to chemical ones, and this is my current favorite.I got a sample size of this a while back and when it ran out I looked to Amazon for the full size.&lt;br /&gt; It smells pleasant and isn&#x27;t pricey. The most important thing is that it does its job well. This is a staple part of my skincare routine now. It not only exfoliates your skin in general but it helps out quite a bit when scrubbing off stubborn face makeup!</li>
            <li> After reading a lot in magazines about this scrub I decided to give it a try. After all, it&#x27;s so cheap that I had nothing to lose. I have been pleasantly surprised. I really like the smell and my face feels really smooth after using it. When I combine it with an electric facial brush or a face sponge it works even better. I don&#x27;t feel it has encouraged any breakouts in my acne-prone skin but I&#x27;m careful and prefer not to use it whenever I feel my skin is breaking out.</li>
            <li> Great product and I leaves my skin clean, my only problem would be the large beads that it comes with.  They bother your face at first but you get used to it.  But overall, when I run out I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I use this as a full body exfoliant, have been for years. I love the smell and feel of it and my skin smells and feels great after a shower. One of my fav products!</li>
            <li> It smells kinda nice and it feels nice when I apply it to my face but other than that it doesn&#x27;t really seem to be doing anything positive for my skin. I dunno.. maybe I was expecting this too much, but it basically feels like I threw my money away buying and using this.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite exfoliator - it&#x27;s pretty inexpensive.  Apricot pit pieces seems to be the perfect type of &#x27;grit&#x27; - sugar or salt dissolve when you really try to scrub with them.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this face scrub is that it&#x27;s not oily and doesn&#x27;t stick on your face, like other walnut scrubs. And my skin bein oily was prone to pimples with other face scrubs. But this one leaves my skin fresh and hydrated. Do try people , you won&#x27;t regret :) !!</li>
            <li> One of the best scrub I&#x27;ve ever had. It made my face very soft and clean. I loved this product.</li>
            <li> I am an avowed product junkie. I&#x27;ve been to both ends of the high to low spectrum in terms of experimenting with skin care on a quest to find the perfect combination of products that will get the results I want. The key to reviews on skin care products is to remember that everyone&#x27;s skin is different, and experimentation is key to finding the right balance for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I am in my early twenties, I have oily/combination skin, and dreadful unevenness of skin tone due to acne scarring. I stayed away from apricot scrubs when I was younger because they caused breakouts. However, now that my hormones have ceased wreaking havoc, this product has become an absolute necessity in my healthy-skin routine. I use it once a day, after my normal cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have begun using this apricot scrub, my skin has been noticeably clearer, much smoother, and the uneven pigmentation has become much, much less apparent. Moisturizer is absorbed much quicker and my pore are less obvious. These results are the closest I have come to the goal of repairing my skin, ever - and simply with a tube of $7 product. St. Ives hit the nail on the head with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also to be noted is St. Ives attention to natural ingredients and their attention to the environment. For those of us concerned with such things, it&#x27;s nice to know I&#x27;m not slathering potentially harmful chemicals all over my body.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  I used 2 or 3 times a week and do not find it harsh and it makes my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> this is the only thing i use anymore it does the job and feels great. also has a nice smell to it and doesnt leave the skin oily</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been awhile since my teenage days when I bought this for the low price.  Seems amazing that this brand is still around, so I decided to give it another try.  I use this in the shower on my face and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  At other times I use a more creamy facial cleanser since I have dry skin.  This scrub is just perfect for that bit of extra cleaning in the steaming shower where the steam makes ail that scrubbing gentler on the face.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for me.  It smells good and I&#x27;ve tried really expensive exfoliating face wash.  I think this is a great product and recommend to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> After years of looking for something that worked for my face. I have settled on this. I grew up with acne and have always been balancing a clean face with a greasy/dry face. I&#x27;m older now and the problems are mostly gone, but I still think this stuff is the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and so reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> Love love love this scrub. It shrinks my black heads and shrinks my pores. Instantly clearer skin. Acne marks gone. Pimples gone. I am experimenting with my shoulders and chest and it leaves my skin soft, not sure if it&#x27;ll be effective on my shoulders.</li>
            <li> Great product. I have been using St. Ives scrub for a while. No complains. This scrub makes my skin very smooth and refreshed, and does not make it dry!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. My face is always smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. Works great on knees &amp; elbows too! I even use it on my underarms after epilating. Be sure to moisturize.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin, and this product fits my skin type. Made my face very soft and clean, didn&#x27;t cause break outs, and the size is huge.&lt;br /&gt;Others wrote the peels are too harsh for them. For me it is alright, so you probably should try it by yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it and I will purchase it. (:</li>
            <li> Sulfate and paraben free - it sells itself.  No idea what it does functionally other than get &amp;#34;road grime&amp;#34; off my face and chest from running and riding but I really like it.  My spa people do not like that it is &amp;#34;grainy&amp;#34; - too bad, I like it.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve used this product and can not really determine if its the best.&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy again, only because i never use it</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week, and the scrub does its work just fine. It leaves my face very clean, clear, fresh and relaxed. It does all of it in a gentle way. One does not have to use much to clean the whole face. It comes with little beads which I make sure to rub all over the face. It washes off easily. I have used other brands, and this one has been the best. Up to this moment, I do not think there is anything better for the price. Very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my skin feeling so smooth!  The beads are somewhat large, and I find them at the bottom of my shower when I&#x27;m done showering, but I continue to use it because I love the smell of the product and feel of my skin after I use it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this for years - used to when I was a teenager, but now in my 40&#x27;s and started having acne again!!!  This stuff still works!</li>
            <li> This is the only face wash I have been able to find that does not make my skin break out, rash, or get zits/pimples! I use it every day to wash off my makeup and leave my skin feeling smooth. The only thing is I recommend using it within 6 months as it starts to smell foul...</li>
            <li> Been using this product twice a week for years. One of the few products I can use where I see an immediate effect that same day. Classic formula and you cannot go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> I purchased two the same time. Useful for face and body. cheap enough and good enough. if i go back China, I will send it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this scrub for a few years now. It has a nice smell and even though I&#x27;m not a fan of every ingredient, it&#x27;s easy on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Did you know that this product is vegan?  It is!  And it leaves your skin feeling soft and supple.  Definitely a winner.</li>
            <li> This is the only personal care product that I&#x27;ve been using for anywhere close to this long.  I usually cycle into a new soap, shave-cream, shampoo, etc. every 3-5 years.  Nothing replaces this product, so please just continue to keep making it just as it is right now.  For the record, I&#x27;m almost 50.  Other than avoiding the sun and using sun-screen, people insist I don&#x27;t look my age by a decade-plus.  I really believe ex-foliating my skin daily with this product is a big part of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  No more subscribe-and-save?  The price has doubled with shipping and from what I can tell it can&#x27;t be placed into Prime or a &gt;$35 free shipping order.  Guess I won&#x27;t ordering this for a while from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This scrub is basic to clear skin if needed, and I would only use this occasionally not every day, cause it can be too drying to fair skin only if used to often. It does clean.</li>
            <li> it is simply the best product for face scrup ever...and i had tried several types...and yes smoth and smell good but this product really clean the dead cells...hey mix it up with warm water</li>
            <li> I have been using this forever. I love the way it makes my skin feel. definitely a must have. highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have bought &amp; used this product a few times over the years. Years ago this had concentrated scrubbers in it but now does NOT. To me a total waste of the intention. I want an exfoliator tht has a very concentrated amount of scrubbers to do the job with less. More cost effective &amp; less work for me that way. I have bought &amp; used MANY over the years. My skin is not sensitive so Im lucky that way. I really like Olay microbermabrasion in the little tub for exfoliating because its super concentrated. Overpriced though. I have found myself buying a few different scrubs that dont work well but I dont want to waste them so I am adding microderm crystals to make my own for much cheaper. I buy them here from Amazon  it makes things much more cost efficient &amp; really does the job. I also use Gly acid &amp; a few other chemicle peels 1x per week during the winter for more maintenance on my skin as the years pass. I still get my ID checked at 38 so something must be working! Im a believer in starting young for skin preventitive maintenance. Always use sunscreen too ;-). If anyone knows of any really good concentrated microderm, exfoliator, polish then reply post it please!!! Happy scrubbing!</li>
            <li> This simply makes your skin look great and feel like a baby&#x27;s bottom with a glow. I&#x27;ve tried more expensive exfoliation products but why pay more when this does the job. Might I add it smells so yummy.</li>
            <li> I use the scrub three times a week and each inexpensive tube lasts three months. As a guy I&#x27;m not a good judge of the effectiveness of these things but it seems to work well enough.</li>
            <li> but, I tend to like more natural organic ingredients.  But really works and leaves face&lt;br /&gt;looking new.  You can feel the difference once you put on a moisturizer, skin feels like it&lt;br /&gt;can absorb it more easily.  If they made it with natural ingredients, I would buy it by the gallons.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!!! It smells wonderful and easily removes old, dry, dead skin... revealing fresh, new, soft, supple skin :)</li>
            <li> I have been buying St Ives for the last several years. I have tried them all. But the best product for me has been the &amp;#34;Invigorating&amp;#34; scrub. It is usually rough on the skin. But in a good way. The harder you scrub, the more of that &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; effect you get. It always left my blemished face look very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since they changed the look of the package it hasn&#x27;t worked. It&#x27;s clear to me that the hulls in the formula have been grinded down more. Thus, losing their ability to break away the dead skin. A previous effective product has now been crippled by change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to forget St Ives and look for something else. Like most products, they get a good thing going and then cheat the consumer after they profit enough. Thanks a lot St Ives. I see you took the emphasis off Invigorating and not put it on &amp;#34;Fresh Skin&amp;#34;. In other words, it doesn&#x27;t do jack anymore.</li>
            <li> I have been using St. Ives Apricot scrub for years! The new design on the bottle is also pretty cool. The beads are plentiful and it provides excellent exfoliation. My face starts to peel in the winter and this gets the job done. Also leaves your skin with a nice glow.</li>
            <li> I love this apricot scrub it is amazing! it smells terrific and works wonders on your skin! :) it makes your skin baby soft and you smell good too</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. Excellent for rather oily, large pore skins - I hope they continue producing it forever.</li>
            <li> I have been using this scrub for years and I still love it.  It is a strong exfoliatant, but if you use it wisely it works wonders.  What I like most about this product is that it isn&#x27;t full of plastic bread but natural apricot kernel pieces.  Washing plastic down the drain really isn&#x27;t something I like doing...</li>
            <li> Let me say that I have very sensitive, dry skin on my face and this stuff works pretty well. Doesn&#x27;t burn like most, it definitely sloshes the dead skin away(I just use a wash rag with it), and my skin is noticeably clearer after wards. No more patchy dry skin. However, the little beads in it hurt my face! It feels like it&#x27;s scratching me as I&#x27;m washing. I have to do it very carefully and gentle, otherwise my face would be left scratched.</li>
            <li> Exfoliates well (but, really so does sugar, baking soda, etc.) I would rate it higher if the packaging wasn&#x27;t misleading in it&#x27;s &amp;#34;100% natural EXFOLIANTS&amp;#34; claim. Yeah, the crap that scrapes the dead skin off is made of natural ingredients, but everything else is relatively bad for your skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t break me out.  Great for exfoliating once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> Love using this int he shower. It feels like I&#x27;m cleaning my whole face with tiny little sand and it feels wonderful and super clean.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for more than 10 years now. It&#x27;s always great to use this 2-3 times a week and not everyday. My skin is always refreshed and clean every after I use this. It&#x27;s important to exfoliate your skin regularly because the air is getting more and more polluted, and this is the cheapest way to exfoliate your skin. I&#x27;m a guy and I&#x27;d totally recommend this.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Use it in the shower on face and neck each night. I believe that you need 3 key things for good skin: antioxidants, sunscreen,and retinol. Every day. this scrub makes it easy for other products to penetrate after outer layer of skin is removed.</li>
            <li> Love that this product does not contain micro-beads that can harm waterfowl and pollute the waterways as it makes it way to our oceans. Apricot scrub is bio-degradeable and is gentle for sensitive skin users. Theresa</li>
            <li> This is the best face scrub in the world! I&#x27;ve used it for years and I love it. I takes all the dry, dead skin off and even helps get down deep into the pour to get rid of any black heads. My face always feels baby soft and fresh after. I use it every day and it really helps my skin stay clear of any blemish. It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin too. I have very fair, sensitive skin and nothing else is better! And it smells so yummy!</li>
            <li> Works well.  I noticed a difference after only using twice,  it also smells nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thesilicic acid that prevents acne. Why spend more?</li>
            <li> Smells great and left my skin feeling super smooth. Great product</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive to try this scrub because I usually buy much more expensive scrubs and this was only a couple of dollars.  But this is the best scrub I have ever used. It was only about $2.50 on S&amp;S and it was better than the $25 - $30 scrubs from department store brands.  It smells good and your face feels fresh, clean and soft after using it.  It takes off all the dead skin so your makeup goes on smoother.  It has all natural exfoliants so they will break down after you wash them down the drain and not build up in your septic tank or sewers.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I have read mixed reviews before that say the product is too harsh for your skin, but I love it. I definitely don&#x27;t use it daily because I think that *would* be too harsh, but I love it for those days when I need a deeper clean and a nice exfoliation. It smells great and it always leaves my skin feeling great. I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d recommend it to those with very sensitive skin, but it&#x27;s also really inexpensive so it may be worth a purchase just to see how your skin reacts to it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this online and it was a great buy. I use it every morning and night so my skin could be cleansed. Great scrub for the face too and it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have used this for months and I dont see a difference in my face. Smells nice though?</li>
            <li> Not tested on animals makes it wonderful. A good cleanser.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Keeps skin fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li> I really like the roughness of the scrub. It smells nice and it feels like it gets the job done without having nasty chemicals all over my face. It has not dried out my skin, even after washing twice a day, vs some other facial washes. I follow up with a Benzoyl Peroxide treatment and that has really helped with my acne.</li>
            <li> I feel so good after using this, my face looks good, I feel fresh, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of the apricot scrub. First of all, it smells amazing! Aside from that, it leaves my skin feeling really smooth and looking rejuvenated after every wash. You&#x27;ll notice your skin looking clearer and brighter instantly. I definitely recommend it because it&#x27;s also sulfate and paraben-free, which is great if you have sensitive skin like I do or don&#x27;t like harsh chemicals damaging your skin. I love it because it feels like I treated myself to a mini spa pampering session every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Love this face scrub!</li>
            <li> been using for a long time... it does serves the purpose to clean.&lt;br /&gt;nothing different, o special. i buy for my teen children</li>
            <li> This is a great scrub that smells good and leaves your face feeling awesome. Amazing price through Subscribe and Save!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for months, works well and worth the cost. Its worth every single penny.  Give it a try.</li>
            <li> Pores are cleaner than ever! Acne scars are almost gone. Other ones don&#x27;t do much for me because their grain size is too small or big and texture is usually too smooth to make a difference, but this one is perfect. It&#x27;s on the harsher side though - if you have sensitive skin be wary.</li>
            <li> using this for years on my face and just love this product. unlike other reviewers, I really don&#x27;t see much change in the actual product with the packaging change.</li>
            <li> great product. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product smells yummy and is a mild scrub. It provided a gentle exfoliation and did not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this facial scrub for years now and have zero complaints. I have oily, acne-prone, AND sensitive skin (my skin gets red and inflamed if I so happen to look at it funny...) This helps keep my face clear by thoroughly exfoliating while magically not irritating my skin. It has a light and pleasant smell, and it&#x27;s cheap! It&#x27;s a coarser grit than other exfoliating scrubs I&#x27;ve used, but again, it&#x27;s never given me issues.</li>
            <li> I love St Ives Apricot Scrub.  I have never used a facial scrub that works better than it does in it&#x27;s price range.  The price was great from Amazon and I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Use it mainly during the winter to exfoliate old skin. Its cheap, but hey it works, dont need a fancy names nor expensive prices to get what you want.  I personally have used many different types of St. Ives products and they work just a good as mega $$$$ products</li>
            <li> Have used this for years. Absolutely love!</li>
            <li> I have been using St. Ives scrub and moisturizers, they are so gentle on my skin, they lift up oil and dirt without over drying, they prevent my skin from drying, they good for acne pron skin, they smell so good.</li>
            <li> I have used this quite a bit over the years and I have suggested it to other friends time and time again.  And even boyfriends of past who were struggling with acne, this facial scrub worked like a charm.  It leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth although sometimes a bit dry.  I tried the green tea scrub before too at one point but I found that I really liked this one better.  It really works.</li>
            <li> Went for a facial and the person giving me the facial extracted pieces of the scrub from my pores! Ew!</li>
            <li> I always buy St. Ives. It works great on my  skin and scrubs off all make up left over from my face cleanser. Good deal too.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of dead skin on my face. In the summer because my skin is peeling from the sun. In the winter because my skin gets dry and flaky. This removes all the dead skin and leaves my skin looking great!</li>
            <li> Love this face scrub!! It leaves my face feeling so soft, and feels much cleaner than washing with a regular face wash. It&#x27;s recommended to use 3 to 4 times a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years and have been satisfied with the result: smooth skin.  Obviously, using this product right after you shower will leave your face a little red, but it goes away quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product even has an unique use for those who snorkel or scuba-dive often, like me, and happen to knick coral and get it under the skin.  Just use this scrub aggressively to remove the top layer of skin and the coral embedded under the surface layer of the skin, follow with bacitracin or neosporin and a band-aid and it&#x27;ll clear right up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also have my wife use it on my back from time to time to help reduce the occasional back acne.</li>
            <li> Does a great job... Your face is left smooth, I use it at least thrice a week to ensure the best results.</li>
            <li> The consistency of this product threw me off a bit. It&#x27;s like course sand mixed with dry toothpaste (though it&#x27;s not painful or anything). The smell is fantastic, and it seems to exfoliate well. I think it would be better with a bit more soap or otherwise liquid; as is, it&#x27;s dry and hard to lather.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing product I have ever used on my face. I have never, not even for hundreds of dollars, been able to so easily exfoliate and de-wrinkle my face with just one wash. This is a true Face Rescue product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a VERY strong product; so I only use it every other week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s incredible to me how cheap this product is, and they have it at the drugstore, supermarket, etc. It&#x27;s so effective it seems like you&#x27;d have to order it through some exotic company. Yet, you can get this at Krogers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this -- I truly promise you, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad to have found this product on Amazon and at such a reasonable price. I had foolishly been using a ridiculously expensive ($30 for 2oz!!) scrub, but have since decided to be more frugal, especially for something that gets washed off of my face, anyway. It smells great and my skin looked fresh and polished afterward.</li>
            <li> What a great scrub! Will recomend. Nice packaging from the seller.</li>
            <li> I have used a couple of face scrubs in the past few years, and, hands down, this one has the rest beat.  It may be a bit premature to post a review after only one use, but my face felt a lot smoother and had a wonderful glow to it after using it today.  Plus the smell is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely going to be buying this again once it runs out!</li>
            <li> I have been using St Ives apricot face scrub for 20 years. I can not live with out it. It slouches off all of the dead skin and cleans out my pores. My husband and my daughter are equally addicted to it. It is one of those amazing beauty products that actually work.</li>
            <li> Feels so clean and fresh.  Makes me want to wash my face. I&#x27;m 48. It keeps my adult blemishes under control.</li>
            <li> Ive been having issues with my face being dry, i use it once a day and my face feels so much better. This product is so good and i love it.</li>
            <li> Feels wonderful on my skin and LOVE the smell!!  Bought more and will buy for others.  A great product :).</li>
            <li> This has been in my heart since I was 13 and I am not changing.  It still works great and it is a great price!  I guess they think that the scrubbing agents are too harsh for older skin but I don&#x27;t agree.</li>
            <li> I used to use the one for acne when I was teenager and recently I have been using this one, once a week. This scrub is a great exfoliator, it just made me break out.</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of ordering this on Amazon without ordering in bulk. Good price, usually beats local store prices.&lt;br /&gt;Product works well to smooth out my hard-working city skin and prevent breakouts. Must apply moisturizer afterward or your face will feel very tight!</li>
            <li> I used to use another brand, and this item came up while I was searching for something else on Amazon. I noticed that the price for the quantity was lower than what I have been paying in the past so I purchased it. The only difference is the odor is different, but it works just fine, for the price I will continue purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> i dont like exfoliating scrubs in the first place because i feel like it takes the natural oils off your face.  however i decided to give it a try because i develop pimples before my montlys and i figured i would use it infrequently during that period of time.  it ended up really drying my face (my face tends to dry but oily in the t zone).  i will not buy this product again but i will finish the bottle by using it to exfoliate my body.</li>
            <li> I have been used many scrubs in order to remove dead cells, but since I choose this one I will have it for a lot of time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many expensive facial cleansers but really like the way St. Ives makes my face feel really cleansed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using Neutrogena face scrub but this item made me throw it but what I don&#x27;t like is there is no foam at all just scrub</li>
            <li> Used St. Ive&#x27;s products a lot when I was younger and going through puberty. I recently moved to the coast and between the wind and winter my skin was starting to lose its glow :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I used the product at a friends and remembered the amazingness of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to apply and use. There is a scent but it&#x27;s not overwhelming and goes away quickly. Best of all it leaves my face feeling fresh, clean, and noticeably brighter after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice a little bit of redness but I was not getting ready for the day and it went away quickly. Also the product left on my hands made for a nice hand scrub too :)</li>
            <li> Helps smooth skin and prevent acne.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!&lt;br /&gt;A regular customer on here or in store.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years. I like it</li>
            <li> this is sulfate free and paraben free which is amazing! love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this scrub for years, and i love it. It really helps to exfoliate your skin. I use it 2-3 times a week after washing face, and also use it on my shoulders and back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for a few years, it always leaves my face cleansed and smooth . I recommend this product for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Rich and smooth and gives a good scrub! For the price very very good.  Feels clean and smells great! I scrub day and night neck included. Love it!</li>
            <li> Lovely exfoliating scrub with a subtle fragrance. Better yet, this scrub in formulated without Parabens which are not a good item to include in skincare products. This scrub did a nice job freshening my skin and reducing the appearance of blackheads. Allure magazine must agree with the viability of this product as the container boasts a Readers Choice Award Winner label of 2013! That&#x27;s a pretty good endorsement. I&#x27;ve used St. Ives products in the past and have been pleased with the results and this scrub is no different. My facial skin felt and looked smoother, and I tried it on my neck, chest and hands too. The scrub exfoliates the dead skin cells to reveal the smoother skin underneath leaving more youthful looking skin. St. Ives Apricot Scrub delivers on its&#x27; promise and is affordable to boot. A win-win for me!</li>
            <li> Recommended for everyone out there. Use twice a week for efficiency ;)</li>
            <li> Not only does this product smell great, it really does keep your skin clear and soft. It lasts awhile a pea sized squeeze really goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It is gentle yet effective and I would recommend it to anyone looking to unclog pores, improve skin texture etc.</li>
            <li> It just leaves my face wanting more of it. I sometimes scrub for minutes because it&#x27;s delicious and the results are dramatically good. After it I recommend an expensive face moisturizer such Clinique or Lancome.</li>
            <li> I use this face scrub twice a week and I my face always feels smooth after each use. I will use it at night as a facial and after drying my face I will use baby oil, which I think helps my skin. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend over doing it with this product in items of scrubbing your face too long. One minute of seems sufficient. It can leave your skin feeling raw/stripped instead of refreshed if you over do it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. I swear by it. It is my caffeine in the morning. The fresh invigorating feeling on my face and the refreshing clean feeling after using it are why I have been using it for many, many years. I am a little older and dont have a wrinkle on my face. My face is soft. I do believe in the antioxidant ingredients in this product. I would recommend it to anyone and always do,.</li>
            <li> Love love love this scrub my face feels clean and finally it can breath i just started using it so i dont know if it does brighten but i will keep using and see</li>
            <li> St. Ives is normally like $5-$7 dollars at any Target or Walmart, with buying my combo of two face washes and the extra hand lotion, which I love and will buy more of, it was a great price for what I paid. Cheaper than the store!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product regularly for a long time. The exfoliation is effective and it smells great, but the grain can be a little too gritty for my face, in my opinion. I tried other options, but there would either be too much or too little grit or it would smell awful, so I settled. Recently, I started noticing that it seemed like this scrub had started not only exfoliating, but lightly scratching my skin, which wouldn&#x27;t be as noticeable on, say, my arms or legs, but was kind of uncomfortable on my face. I recently purchased the green tea version of their scrub after seeing a review online, and the grain is MUCH finer, which made it feel more effective but also gentler. It also smelled amazing! As long as I can find the green tea version, I will be buying it instead of the traditional apricot.</li>
            <li> It positively brightens up the face, and I&#x27;ve noticed the radiance right after use. It&#x27;s comforting to know that it&#x27;s got natural ingredients. It&#x27;s effective, but mild enough for daily use!</li>
            <li> The St. Ives Fresh Skin Apricot scrub is tough enough to get rid of blackheads, dirt, and oil but gentle enough to use everyday on my sensitive skin. It leaves my face feeling smooth and clean without drying or causing that post-scrub redness and irritation that is common with a lot of facial scrubs. The fragrance is subtle and fresh, like ripe apricot. After the first time I used it my skin looked and felt healthier and more polished. Soon, my face became less oily between washes, my pores shrank, and the dry skin was virtually eliminated. Within a few weeks there was no need to wear foundation because the imperfections were gone and haven&#x27;t come back since. Not only is it oil-free, it&#x27;s also free of parabens and skin-drying sulfates which is great for anyone seeking a product without a lot of harsh chemicals that can cause an imbalance and damage the delicate skin. Another plus is that it&#x27;s better for the environment than a lot of similar scrubs. It doesn&#x27;t exfoliate using thousands of little plastic microbeads which contaminate water and can build up in the plumbing. Instead, it uses 100% natural exfoliants. I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I love this face scrub to use in the morning, because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary to &amp;#34;deep clean&amp;#34; my face after sleep. This is less powerful than neutrogena deep clean but I think it provides more conditioning. Great price and helps keep my face smooth and clean in the morning.</li>
            <li> I really wanted the St. Ives Timeless Skin instead.  This is just my opinion. I am sure this Apricot Scrub is good but I prefer the other.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it, Wife uses it. No complaints here. Good stocking stuffer. That is all I have to say about that...</li>
            <li> Went by the reviews when we bought this Apricot Scrub. It feels good on and has a nice smell. We enjoy the product.</li>
            <li> have solved in one month a facial rash that by doctors could not diagnose... I will never be without them again</li>
            <li> I have large pores and constantly need to schedule facials to keep my blackheads under control. I used this scrub and it has completely removed all my blackheads and my skin looks amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scrub leaves my skin fresh and rejuvenated! I use it about once a week so that I do not over exfoliate and it is great to use on the other parts of the body like the feet, elbows, and knees. It&#x27;s not harsh on the skin at all. I have combination dry and oily skin and this product works great for me, I would recommend this product to anyone….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my new facial and customer for life.</li>
            <li> What else can I say, but T Y</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I use it about 3-4 times a week.  It gently exfoliates my skin, leaving it smooth.  My make up goes on more evenly.  I have my teen daughters now using the product at least once a week to help keep their skin smooth.  When using it, remember to use gently pressure....I also wanted to mention that on occasion I use it on my feet  after a pedicure  to keep the heels and balls of feet smooth.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. Helps exfoliate skin without damaging. I usually purchase the larger size but purchased this size for travel.</li>
            <li> Works really well. Nice smell. A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I thought the price was very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it as an Amazon add-on</li>
            <li> It was made in 2009. It looks fine and smells just like my old one. Hope it would work. Haven&#x27;t used yet.</li>
            <li> and dirt cheap. My dermatologist recommends it, but not every day (it is quite abrasive). I uses it in the shower. You have to make sure to rinse all out, nostrils, around the eyes, etc- The skin is so soft aft the treatment.</li>
            <li> The quest for a perfect face scrub is always a tough one.  This apricot scrub, while nice, unfortunately did not become my \\&quot;holy grail\\&quot; of scrubs though.  It does an ok job, but ultimately, I&#x27;m looking for improvement, not \\&quot;ok\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scrub is a mildly abrasive one that has enough texture you feel it working at your skin when you use it.  There is nothing too sharp or rough in regards to the scrub part of the cleanser.  The rest of it feels kind of oily to me though, even though it claims not to be too oily.  Luckily, once rinsed off of the skin it doesn&#x27;t seem to stay this way.  It doesn&#x27;t really lather per say, but when you rub it into your face you can feel it on your skin, so you&#x27;re aware if you haven&#x27;t rinsed it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a light fruity scent that isn&#x27;t too objectionable.  It becomes stronger as you&#x27;re massaging it into your skin but it&#x27;s still nothing that would really be bothersome.  I actually appreciated that it wasn&#x27;t too strong of a scent because with all the other products you could use in your daily cleansing regime, scent is bound to be covered elsewhere and doesn&#x27;t need to be in everything.  The fragrance does have some natural aspects to it, but it should be warned that this product has quite the large ingredient list, with several things I couldn&#x27;t pronounce, let alone spell if I needed to.  I tend to like natural products more so that didn&#x27;t thrill me, but at least some of the ingredients were recognizable (like walnut shell for the scrubby roughness of the product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little one ounce bottle of this scrub lasted me two months; I tended to use it every other day rather than every day.  Just a little bit went a long way and I can imagine a larger bottle lasting quite a long time, so there is a lot of value here.  As far as its effects on my skin itself I didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference.  Nothing got worse like what sometimes happens with a lot of products I try, but nothing really improved either.  I didn&#x27;t change anything else in my routine so I know this wasn&#x27;t a result of a different product either.  For reference my skin is somewhat dry with problem areas being the chin and forehead.  So if you have a similar skin type you can probably expect to have the same results with using this product.  I did notice that sometimes it tended to dry out my skin a little more, but this wasn&#x27;t something that happened every time I used the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe just not the best product for me, I still have another bottle of this that I will continue to use, but I definitely will be searching out a different product type in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review by M.

            <li> This product is an oldie but goodie and does the trick when you need an exfoliant. I found it works the best, when left alone for a month or more and then used again. First time users though should use many times a weekn in the beginning. It&#x27;s just a great product that works.</li>
            <li> Delivered to your door for this price?  Great!  I use this stuff all the time. I shave my head, so shampoo doesn&#x27;t really factor in.  I use small amount for my face and head and it works great!</li>
            <li> I am somewhat particular about my face wash and this one passes the test. It smells good and the coarse scrubbing elements in the soap are just right. Keeps my face clean.</li>
            <li> This scrub is very refreshing and is very gentle on your skin. It removes dead skin, dirt and unwanted oils from your face. I love using this and I also use it once a month on my legs too to get a closer cleaner shave. I definitely would recommend this for those who are looking for a refreshing scrub/face-wash. It even smells good!</li>
            <li> This is the only facial scrub I will ever use. I use it about 4 times a week and use Neutrogena naturals moisturizer and I hardly EVER have blemishes! LOVE this scrub!</li>
            <li> I love this scrub.  It cleans out my pores while keeping my face soft and nourished.  I don&#x27;t get that dried out feeling like some cleansers leave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve studied scrubs, and this one is terrible for your skin. Yes, it removes dead skin build up, but it also punctutes your skin, letting bacteria in. You can&#x27;t see it with the human eye, but microscopic holes are torn into the skin! The shape of the scrubbing \\&quot;beads\\&quot; are sharp, jagged shapes, which literally destroy healthy skin! Please don&#x27;t use this! Use something with sugar, salt, or jojoba beads as the exfolient. They are rounded and won&#x27;t rip your skin open.</li>
            <li> This smells nice and feels nice.  Its very grainy, larger particles than average, but I really don&#x27;t mind.  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I picked this up recently after being tired of having dry flaky skin on my face during the winter. I was hoping it would be the same as the St. Ives Apricot Scrub I used over ten years ago. Even though the packaging isn&#x27;t the same bright orange color it was before, it&#x27;s still exactly the same as it was back then - a fabulous exfoliant that can be used multiple times a week. In addition to stripping dry skin, the scrub helps with ingrown hairs as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d caution those with extra-sensitive skin to be careful using it the first time. While it has never irritated my skin, I can imagine it could create an issue for those with especially sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using Apricot Scrub since middle school (which was a LOOONG time ago). Like one reviewer mentioned, if I use it too often on my face it actually causes me to break out - so I only use it once a week on my face (the Grapefruit St Ives Scrub is better and gentler for my face). The reason I love this stuff, though, is because of what it does for my ARMS. Sometimes the back of my upper arms will get bumps and feel rough -- but if I use this every day (or even as sparingly as every 3 days), I can tell a HUGE difference! I can also tell a difference when I forget to use it. Don&#x27;t expect to see 100% smoothness after the first day, but after a few applications the bumps/roughness on your arms will be gone or at least minimized. I also use this on my legs in the winter (occasionally) and all over before I get a spray tan.</li>
            <li> St. Ives, Fresh Skin Apricot Scrub, 6oz is good, came on time and my wife likes it. what else to say...</li>
            <li> Love this product as well as many other St Ives products.  I am a big fan.  Natural ingredients, good price, no animal testing.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best scrub I&#x27;ve ever tried. Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry but soft.I&#x27;ve been using this scrub for over a year.</li>
            <li> I usually use the Bath and Body Works face scrub which was $12. I found that to be a bit pricey so after hear such positive reviews about the St.Ives Apricot Face Scrub, I decided to try it out. After using it for a week, I noticed that I noticed that I was breaking out. I was never a person that got a lot of acne, just the occasional pimple or two, so this made me really shocked. I realized that it was the face scrub. So just a warning to people out there, this might break you out to!</li>
            <li> All right. So, I tried this stuff after a roommate of mine claimed that it cleared his skin up. It did nothing for me. Seriously. My main problem isn&#x27;t even so much that it was ineffective, but that it&#x27;s called an \\&quot;Apricot Scrub.\\&quot; Under Amazon&#x27;s product description it even says, \\&quot;Key ingredient: APRICOTS\\&quot; and goes on to describe all the glorious benefits of said fruit. However, your search for apricot in the ingredients (amidst terrifyingly unpronounceable chemicals and carcinogens alike) ends at the very tail end with \\&quot;Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Fruit Extract.\\&quot; Which means that there is barely any actual APRICOT in this APRICOT scrub. If you&#x27;re like me, you may have thought that those little rough bits are ground apricot kernels. Not so. They&#x27;re actually \\&quot;Juglans Regia (Walnut) Shell Powder.\\&quot; Maybe there should be giant pictures of walnuts instead of apricots on the tube? I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They even go on to say, \\&quot;Above all, we respect the natural world from which our ingredients are sourced, and are committed to preserving its vitality. That&#x27;s why we: Don&#x27;t formulate using parabens and phthalates; Use natural exfoliants, extracts, moisturizers and vitamins.\\&quot; You&#x27;re being DUPED. This product couldn&#x27;t be further from natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Juglans Regia (Walnut) Shell Powder, Glyceryl Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Zea Mays (Corn) Kernel Meal, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, PEG-100 Stearate, Cetyl Acetate, Ceteareth-20, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Polysorbate 60, Acetylated Lanolin Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Carbomer, Fragrance (Parfum), Phenethyl Alcohol, PPG-2 Methyl Ether, Limonene, Linalool, Methylisothiazolinone, Glycerin, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Fruit Extract.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of its 25 ingredients, there are only 4 that are actually natural. And, really, who knows about corn anymore? amiright? In any case, how many of those ingredients can you actually pronounce? Their claim that they don&#x27;t use phthalates in their products is also definitely false. \\&quot;Frangrance\\&quot; &#x3D; phthalates. End of story. St. Ives ain&#x27;t no saint, for certain. Want an ACTUAL apricot scrub? Try [[ASIN:B005I3RWSC Fundamental Face Scrub - 8 Oz. - Chemical Free Face Scrub - Made in USA]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My general rule of thumb is, \\&quot;if you don&#x27;t know wtf it is, don&#x27;t smear it on your face.\\&quot;y don&#x27;t use phthalates in their products is also definitely false. \\&quot;Frangrance\\&quot; &#x3D; phthalates.

            <li> great for morning, after runs, before you go out. Leaves my face feeling clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the exfoliating beads it can leave my face a little irritated depending on how hard I scrub my face. It never leaves my face overly dry or overly scented. good stuff for sure.</li>
            <li> This apricot scrub is good for oily and dry face skin.  It cleans away dry dead skin cells and leaves the skin to breath.&lt;br /&gt;The oily skin it cleans very well.  The finely ground apricot seeds do the scrubbing work better than any soap while being gentle to the skin</li>
            <li> St. Ives makes a great product, very reasonably priced. This scrub is gentle on your skin, but does a great job of exfoliating. It has a pleasant smell, and your face feels clean after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont spend big bucks on an exfoliant when this product does the job for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff. My brother started on this while he was deployed and recommended it to me. One thing I miss is that minty fresh clean face feeling I get from clean and clear but it scrubs nice and feels smooth after I use it.</li>
            <li> Using this for years and it is definitely keeping my skin smoother and less discoloring or dark spots than most 44 year olds.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive dry skin with mild rosacea and was looking for something that could scrub off the dead dry skin but not irritate my face too much. I started using this and was initially happy with the results. It worked well and left my skin feeling clean and dead skin free. About 4 or 5 uses in, everything changed. My skin broke out into this weird texture. I had tiny skin-colored little bumps all over my face and my face felt like sand paper. I&#x27;ve never seen my skin do this before. Everywhere I had used this scrub was bumpy and irritated. My skin wasn&#x27;t red but it felt like it was crawling and very irritated. I immediately stopped using this and after a week or so of just water, my skin finally started to clear up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I will NOT be using this anymore. I guess my skin either didn&#x27;t like something in this scrub or is just too sensitive.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful. I was very careful while purchasing it because my skin is very sensitive&lt;br /&gt;But after use, I just loved it.I tried multiple products but finally I got a product that is suitable to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell and feels great after a shower.I would say this is one of my fav products!</li>
            <li> My skin is very temperamental - it took me years and years to finally find a routine that kept my skin clear. Using this daily is an integral part of that routine. If I ever have to travel and I can&#x27;t find a travel size bottle of this at the store, I start to break out within a couple days. It&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li> This scrub smells great, but it too harsh for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I breakout using this strangely, so I will not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I use it about once a week, and I can really tell the difference. Love the smell, too.</li>
            <li> BEST FACE Scrub EVER it has clear all my acne and has made my face smooth. I will not STOP Using it .</li>
            <li> Great for face brightening.</li>
            <li> My go-to exfoliating scrub. I use it once or twice a week and it gets rid of dead skin cells, then the rest of the week I use a moisturizing face wash. This St. Ives scrub smells amazing and feels great on my skin!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! I&#x27;ve been using it for years now and it&#x27;s still the only product on the market that makes my skin really glow and is sensitive skin friendly. The other exfoliants I&#x27;ve tried are either too harsh leaving my skin feeling dry and stripped or too gentle to make a difference. This one is just right, breaths new life into my skin and leaves it soft. I use it on my décolletage area too when soaking in the tub. If you have body acne you can use it in the shower, but trick is to leave it on the skin for a few minutes, don&#x27;t just rinse it off.  And it smells good! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This has honestly always been my favorite way to clean my face.  I&#x27;ve tried many different products, but this is the only thing that continues to help prevent breakouts (usually don&#x27;t have much anymore, but now that I&#x27;m pregnant it came back :-P) and make my skin feel nice.</li>
            <li> For the first three days or so using this product, I broke out like crazy all over my face.  I&#x27;ve never had acne as bad as I did when using this, but I&#x27;ve heard that switching your cleansing routine can cause reactions like this, so I stuck it out.  Day five is here and I&#x27;m pleased to report that the breakouts have ceased!  I like the exfoliant, as I have very dry skin and it takes those flakes I tend to get right off and leaves me with a smooth surface.  With a moisturizing lotion, this is great for the treatment of dry skin and using it daily doesn&#x27;t seem to be an issue, especially when one frequently wears makeup.</li>
            <li> I have been using this scrub for more than 30 year and cannot live without it. My family and friends are hooked too. It is gentle, moisturizing and exfoliating, all in one. I use twice a day in the shower on face, chest, back, arms and hands. I use this scrub first, then use a buff puff with Trish McEvoy Moisture Retaining Bar to cleanse, dry off, tone with Clinique Clarifying Lotion 2, then jump back in the shower to rinse off the Clarifying Lotion. (Now using Rubbing Alcohol until I can find a Clinique Replacement, reformulated in 2011 which now contains the dreaded Salicylic acid). Skin is baby soft and looks like I just got a facial. I have tried many name brand scrubs, and they turn my skin raw. This one does not. There is something in the base that makes this so good. I have sensitive, combination, acne prone, aging skin.</li>
            <li> My son have severe acne since he was teenger.And he have tried just about everything.  One of his friend recommed him to use St. Ives Fresh Skin Apricot Scrub.... After couple months using this product, his face is visibly cleaner and smooth.  Now the product have become an absolute necessity in his healthy skin routine. And I have to purchase more again for him.</li>
            <li> Buy this instead of the exxxxxpensive crap.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product off and on for like 10 years... I like a face wash or scrub that has some grit to it because it really helps to exfoliate the skin and this face scrub is definitely the best one that I&#x27;ve tried for exfoliating. It is cheap and that makes people doubt it I think but sometimes simple or inexpensive products can be the most effective. It doesn&#x27;t make my face break out and it makes my skin feel soft and clean. That&#x27;s all I can ask for!</li>
            <li> At first I loved how it smelled but after a few days it started breaking me out a lot.</li>
            <li> the delivery was extremely quick, one day before the estimated time. The product is also fantastic, and I used it last night. It left my skin feeling extremely soft, despite my blemishes. Also, it did not cause my rosacea to flare up, and actually made it better.</li>
            <li> my wife loves this item it does job well great scent to it, would love to purchase again if needed.</li>
            <li> Works amazing and I really wished I would have bought it earlier. My skin is happy and so am I. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the product and it arrived in the specified time, so I recommend it to anyone who knows what they are buying.&lt;br /&gt;thanks God bless</li>
            <li> I have been using this product and Neutrogena&#x27;s transparent facial bar since I was 12 years old and I am now 43. All my life I&#x27;ve had beautiful radiant skin due in part to using this product. I swear by this scrub wholeheartedly. Anyone I&#x27;ve introduced this scrub to swears by it as well! After suffering from adult acne due to hormonal changes this past summer, and trying countless over the counter acne meds, as well as prescribed medications...that experience led me back to my beloved St. Ives scrub. I&#x27;m fully convinced that once my hormones came into balance, this scrubs formula got my skin back on track. Not only does it clear up your complexion...it takes years off your skin! A lot of people think I use the blemish control formula, however I only use this to keep the pH balance of my skin in tact. There&#x27;s nothing worse than drying out your skin which in turn makes you look older. 10 stars for this amazing facial scrub!!! Hands down I am St. Ives Invigorating Scrub&#x27;s #1 fan... It rocks!!!</li>
            <li> Not how I remember it but is alright...</li>
            <li> Perfect scrub for sensitive skin.  You don&#x27;t have to keep this for your face, use it mostly all over.  You will feel slicker and cleaner. It&#x27;s positively invigorating.  And for this price, I always keep it in hand.</li>
            <li> Whenever I feel the need to exfoliate my skin, this is my go-to face wash! It&#x27;s a little rough, so I probably wouldn&#x27;t use it every day, but it&#x27;s great when I just feel like my skin is...blah.</li>
            <li> This product always makes my face feel smooth and clean. I was young when I tried this product and it helps you take out the oils in your face that gives you pimples. At least for me, it has done so and for while I couldn&#x27;t find this product in stores any more. But I am glad I was able to find again at Amazon because I love this product and I think you will too.</li>
            <li> This products works! I don&#x27;t have skin problems, but I was looking for something to keep my skin fresh. I use it about 3 times a week, and each time I feel very refreshed. I&#x27;ve used this product for a few months. Unless you&#x27;re using a gallon each time, this product should last for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Refreshing&lt;br /&gt;- scrub cleans the skin without being overly abrasive&lt;br /&gt;- Smells nice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- none that I can think of&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 5/5. This is a quality product that really keeps the skin fresh.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best scrubs I have ever used.  I love the smell.  I use this with a couple of sprays of Dr. Bronners soap.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Frist off I hate smelly, beauty products because they never smell good. But I love the smell of this stuff. It makes my skin really soft, feels good to apply and has not been tested on animals. Whats not to like?</li>
            <li> been using this product for around 2 years.  Always felt refreshed after using it and it does a great job of exfoliating so I can get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> My skin gets super oily in humidity and dries out badly in the winter or dry heat.  I moved to Los Angeles where it is really dry and my skin was extremely dry and flaky...then came the acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this scrub daily for about a year now and my skin is smooth/moist without using any extra products.  I still get an occasional zit, but i think that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and sensitive skin.  This product is gentle on my face and does not irritate the rosacea. Very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> It is my second bottle and I absolutely love it. It has natural smell and is a good scrub for body and face.</li>
            <li> I love all the St. Ives products, including the scrub! The invigorating scrub has just enough micro-beads to do the job the label says! I have fresh, smooth skin every time I use this! I have no breakouts or redness, because the micro-beads are not harsh to my skin. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who might be unsure of whether or not to try this! When I found that Amazon has this much cheaper here then the stores have, I will never buy this from a store again, only from Amazon!</li>
            <li> Purchased for household</li>
            <li> It smells good, and it is really a big one for me. I bought is at a price very low, and I am content with that.</li>
            <li> I really like this face wash.  The grainy apricot seed is a great exfoliant.  My face always feels soft and clean when I use this.</li>
            <li> My fiance has had acne since he was a teenager. He&#x27;s tried several things, to no avail, which is understandably frustrating. I have used this scrub for awhile, and I noted to him that it was actually the thing that kept my own skin nice and clear - the exfoliation helped to scrub the skin nice and clean, and the salicylic acid helped to prevent new blemishes from appearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fiance&#x27;s skin is noticeably clearer. He had tried a stronger salicylic acid lotion prescribed by his dermatologist, but that had some unpleasant side effects, while doing nothing to clear his skin. The only thing that has actively cut down on the amount of facial blemishes has been the apricot scrub. I ended up purchasing several new tubes of the scrub because it was now disappearing twice as fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never minded his skin issues, but it makes me happy to see him happier with his skin. It&#x27;s certainly not a miracle product, and it doesn&#x27;t eliminate every blemish, but the difference is certainly clear.</li>
            <li> In its ads for this product, St. Ives claims that apricots are the &amp;#34;key ingredient&amp;#34; because they are &amp;#34;known to contain one of the highest levels of carotenoids (think vitamin A) and super-effective antioxidants.&amp;#34;  HOWEVER, if you look at the ingredients list for this product, you will see that the only mention of anything apricot-related is the very last ingredient (Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Fruit Extract), which means that there is only very, very little apricot anything actually contained within this product. I can&#x27;t stand it when companies do this. They think they can boast their product of having the benefits of simply when, in truth, there is only a tiny, tiny percentage of that &amp;#34;something&amp;#34; in it. So while it&#x27;s not necessarily false advertising, it is nonetheless deceiving.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling real smooth. Been using it for a couple weeks now and I definitely notice the difference (a good difference) from before I started using this compared to after. If you&#x27;re looking for a cost friendly product that does a good job, get this.</li>
            <li> I tried this a while back and found that it irritated my sensitive skin (even the one formulated for sensitive skin turned my face red). Aside from the ingredients probably causing my irritation, I believe exfoliating your facial tissue to be too harsh (and scrubs like this with ground up pits can lead to micro cuts and scarring and just exacerbate more acne). I&#x27;m happy that this works for others so well, but I&#x27;ll stick to my twice weekly homemade fruit acid peels.</li>
            <li> This is a good product but I have very sensitive skin but it did help my acne problem some.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best exfoliants/scrubs out there!  I use it at least once a week to get the really dry patches off my skin in the mornings.  It&#x27;s gentle enough for sensitive skin, but strong enough to really exfoliate off all the dead skin cells.  I make sure to have a tube around at all times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6/22/13 UPDATE:  I don&#x27;t use this exfoliant/scrub as much anymore because I&#x27;ve found that beta hydroxy acid (BHA) and alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) work more gently on my skin as exfoliants.</li>
            <li> I wash my face often, and this stuff feels great on my skin.  I like to think that it makes my facial skin look better, but that could just be my imagination.  In any case, highly recommended</li>
            <li> Been using St Ives facial scrub for over 10 years. Perfect for the shower. Great for oily and combination skin. Allure rated product.</li>
            <li> This is a great price on a staple in our house via subscribe and save. We can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
