            <li> This is the cologne I use most, and get the best results from it. Ladies like it and it stays on for reasonable time. Could last longer, so I gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> It was a fake. I have used this cologne for over 10 years. A favorite of my wife and co-workers. It smelled so terrible I had to throw it away. This is the second cologne I buy from Amazon that does not smell as it should. They both have been expensive colognes.</li>
