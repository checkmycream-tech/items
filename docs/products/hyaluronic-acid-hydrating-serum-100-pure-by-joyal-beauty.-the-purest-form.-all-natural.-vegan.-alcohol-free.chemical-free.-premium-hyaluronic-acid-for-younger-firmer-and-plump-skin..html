            <li>My skin feels smooth and looks more even in color.</li>
            <li>It is an excellent product and must be applied to a wet face.  </li>
            <li>, it is true, they are excellent products, I started using the Vit C and Hyalauronic Acid together for 3 weeks, then ordered the Retinol A (which was a free VIP product, so I only paid shipping of $5)</li>
            <li>It just glides on so easily.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this serum to my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>VERY fast delivery!!  </li>
            <li>I contacted Joyal and they quickly offered me this serum to try instead which was very kind (and unexpected).  </li>
            <li>so I can accurately access the effect of each item.</li>
            <li>That will prevent the drying feeling you get when using hyaluronic acid serums which I have experienced in the past.&lt;br /&gt;The texture is different from others as well.</li>
            <li>-Free  </li>
            <li>The acid is primarily used to treat damaged joints; the treatments come in the form of injections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>put one drop on your fingers rub it together both fingers of hands and lightly do circles on your face.</li>
            <li>I am happy to say, I have noticed a big improvement.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s means this company is delivering a great product for a price is typically double.</li>
            <li>I received this serum free for testing and review purposes</li>
            <li>it makes my face baby smooth, Make up application - a breeze.  </li>
            <li>It is GMO and Cruelty free.  </li>

            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>So Very Much,</li>
            <li>Adding some type of Hylauronic acid serum to your skin care regimen can help to hold in some of your skin’s natural moisture, prevent or reduce drying and help keep fine line and wrinkles at bay.</li>
            <li>I started seeing results within DAYS after my first use.</li>
            <li>I love Joyal Beauty products and will definitely reorder them once they run out.</li>
            <li>So, if someone is reading my review, they know exactly what and how I am using the Joyal Beauty products together.  </li>
            <li>So, 3 weeks ago, when I first start using Joyal Beauty products, I did just that.</li>
            <li>But, just short 3 weeks trying this product improved my skin this much, I am very confident this products help improve my skin tone to where it should be in near future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How about Customer Services and their support?  </li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid has been directly related, in more than one clinical trial, to increases in the sizes of tumors.</li>
            <li>you are considering using this acid, please talk with your clinician first.</li>
            <li>Almost through my first bottle- reording pronto-</li>
            <li>It has remained soft, smooth to the touch, plump and MOIST all day.</li>
            <li>This hyalauronic acid works much better than creams and the moisture seems to last longer.  </li>
            <li>The first bottle they sent was leaked.  </li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>It is not sticky or goopy, it goes on smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>Very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;I was given a complimentary sample of Joyal Beauty Vitamin C Serum for my view of the product.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.!</li>
            <li>I noticed the quality of this product immediately upon contact with my skin on the first day.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This was one of the first products I purchased from Joyal Beauty.  </li>
            <li>I love their commitment to keeping their product line pure and simple.  </li>
            <li>Did not remove the dark spots as promissed.......that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
            <li>I bought the hyalunoric acid before from a different brand and was a lot more expensive, so I decided to try this one, I have a healthy condition and have to careful with kind product I&#x27;m using, I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>My face was very oily before, but it has changed since I started using this Joyal beauty serum, it becomes soft and smooth to touch, even my husband noticed the change.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve previously had the pleasure of trying Joyal Beauty&#x27;s Hyaluronic Serum with Vitamin C and liked it very much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been waiting long to write this review as I wanted to make sure this product does work for me.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve been looking for a solution pretty much my whole life.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>Since then, my face is super sensitive and got red so easily even when I went into a room with some heat.</li>
            <li>I use is as recommended with water since it is so pure.</li>
            <li>Joyal Beauty Ultra Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum vs  hyaluronic acid 3% pure serum</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid 3% pure serum-</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid 3% pure serum-</li>
            <li>Pure Hyaluronic  </li>
            <li>It is silky smooth and leaves a soft smooth feeling to the skin once it is dry.</li>
            <li>I quite enjoyed it, but for my very dry skin and now the retinol, I need as much moisturizing as I can get.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin much smoother and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I don’t feel comfortable going out in public without some make up on my face.  </li>
            <li>Joyal Beauty Customer Service amazes me as much as their product line.  </li>
            <li>They are very reliable.  </li>
            <li>Wash my face with gentle face cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Wash my face with gentle face cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Wash my face with gentle face cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Wash my face with gentle face cleanser.  </li>
            <li>do see a difference and so fast .</li>
            <li>This is a real boon when it&#x27;s 95 degrees with humidity levels to match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s really nothing I don&#x27;t like about this serum.</li>
            <li>Seller was very responsive and immediately corrected an issue of a leaking bottle.</li>
            <li>It really worked the way this product claimed to do, and it is organic too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used two bottles so far and can confidently recommend this product to anyone who wants her skin to have fresher and younger look.  </li>
            <li>The line is still there, but it is much softer and isn&#x27;t very pronounced.  </li>
            <li>Also, after my purchase, Joyal Beauty emailed me detailed instructions on how to properly use each of the products I ordered.  </li>
            <li>so much more than I expected</li>
            <li>My face felt so smooth next morning!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product and the seller!</li>
            <li>It works for very well</li>
            <li>really well!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>The serum is really lightweight</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the product, pricing and customer service .I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Up until this point I was using milk of magnesia on my skin to control oil under my make up, but I am finding the oil in under control very well using the age defying serum - for me</li>
            <li>My wife really likes it.</li>
            <li>smooth my facial skin looks.</li>
            <li>Very Well.</li>
            <li>Today, My Face Is Much Softer To The Touch, And</li>
            <li>I wait a few minutes for it to absorb into the skin, and follow up with either rose hip oil (daytime) or night cream.</li>
            <li>I love all of the products I have so far and will definitely continue purchasing them.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>Skin felt good, looked nice, but was not able to use long enough to see if intended results could be achieved.</li>
            <li>(my pre-skin test is I apply new serum/creams on my neck first and if my skin doesn’t break out, I start using it)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another first time to try another new product.</li>
            <li>The serum makes my face so soft and right</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for other consumers like myself.</li>
            <li>Didnt last me a long time i think its a nice product .</li>
            <li>amber glass bottle has a pump that dispenses a single drop for easy</li>
            <li>Well i am not a big fan of wearing to much makeup i like natural products and do not want to look like barbie, i just want clear skin that looks healthy, and this is what i have found that does just that.</li>
            <li>Also, a big thanks to your customer service department for their quick response to my questions.  </li>
            <li>I have fine lines and dry skin</li>
            <li>The first one is 98% natural 5% HA+5% vitamin c+other anti-aging ingredients.  </li>
            <li>The first one is 98% natural 5% HA+5% vitamin c+other anti-aging ingredients.  </li>
            <li>used it more two weeks and feel skin keeps moisture whole night,now I use before bed only next</li>
            <li>I use it daily to reduce fine line wrinkles and to clear up blemishes.</li>
            <li>It has a 2% higher concentration of Hyaluronic acid and does a better job (didn&#x27;t think that was possible) of hydrating my dry skin.</li>
            <li>I am  a third way through my first bottle and my skin feels amazing every day....will definitely come back again...</li>
            <li>For dry or flaky skin, this serum will help with a moisture barrier, lock in hydration and smooth the texture of skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t look any different over all, but it sure does feel different.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to apply a lot every time you use it so this bottle will last quite a bit, i will definitely order more after i run</li>
            <li>I will definitely come back to this product, love the feeling after applying this to my face</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This serum leaves my face highly moisturized.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>but I will continue to be a customer because of their high quality products.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product and Joyal Beauty</li>
            <li>product is 100% pure, natural and vegan.  </li>
            <li>, I guess it takes a little more time.</li>
            <li>Stop all my skin care items (which it did little to help anyway, but better than not using any).  </li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>Its rare to find a skin care company with such high standards.  </li>
            <li>I have been using VC and HA serum for 3 days now, morning and night, after cleaning my face, I put 2 pumps of VC to my palm, then apply to my face with my fingers, followed by the HA serum, again 2 pumps (I add same amount of water to it), apply to my face with fingers, then massage, my skin quickly absorbed the serum</li>
            <li>Now one month later, I am still seeing the dermatologist for the super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>find it to be completely non-irritating and very useful for treating dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Joyal Beauty is a totally new brand to me</li>
            <li>I look on your website every day for new products.  </li>
            <li>Over the weekend I saw new serums.  </li>
            <li>Like that it&#x27;s very natural.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Hyaluronic Acid Serum in combination with Vitamin C serum for several months, I like it very much.</li>
            <li>before i had bought this i was a bit concerned because i have very sensitive skin and another product that i had used before this contained benzyl alcohol.</li>
            <li>I love my Joyal Hyaluronic Acid Serum, and my other Joyal products too.!!!  </li>
            <li>Living in a high altitude VERY dry climate, I know that most products--no matter the cost--leave my skin too dry.  </li>
            <li>skin looks so soft ,Will buy agin!</li>
            <li>Joyal Beauty&#x27;s HA serum first off has an efficient container - I prefer a bottle w/a pump so as to prevent any cross contamination with the formula versus a vial &amp; a dropper.</li>
            <li>you get when you try a brand/product for the first time and find out that it not only works but works</li>
            <li>Other then that not bad product..</li>
            <li>I also wrote another review here for other 3 items (Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum ,  Retinol Correcting Serum,  Ultra Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has worked very well both for me (mid twenties) and for my mother (50+) in that it keeps skin hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>It is a clear serum and has no fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The delivery was so prompt give the holiday busy season.  </li>
            <li>have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am amazed just short time, my skin tone improved so much.  </li>
            <li>Royal jelly and propolis preserve and restore proteins and enzymes for anti-aging action.</li>
            <li>It’s gentle enough to use it around eye</li>
            <li>Royal jelly and propolis preserve and restore proteins and enzymes for anti-aging action.</li>
            <li>It’s gentle enough to use it around eye</li>
            <li>So far used for a week.</li>
            <li>have found Hyaluronic Acid supplementation to be directly correlated to measured increases in skin moisture.</li>
            <li>suits the sensitive skin too.</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother and feels soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>Ive been using this a week now with rosehip seed oil and WOW.</li>
            <li>Sent me instructions on how to use it properly which was very helpful.</li>
            <li>and it is 100% all natural and vegan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NikkiD</li>
            <li>I have felt it soft before, but never like this.</li>
            <li>I have deep lines on my forehead which are becoming less noticeable.</li>
            <li>Joyal Beauty Hyaluronic Acid Serum is 100% all natural and has no other ingredients but Hyaluronic Acid which means lots of locked in moisture for your skin!  </li>
            <li>Love this, sometimes my skin will get really dry and tight.</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid is an important component of connective tissue and has dozens of medical uses, such as treating arthritis, promoting tissue growth and wound healing, and treating dry, flaky, or wrinkled skin.  </li>
            <li>I have found no magic cure unfortunately, but I have found products that help bring out the best in my skin.</li>
            <li>It is a clear, viscous, odorless substance that quickly absorbs into the skin without leaving a trace, so it can be applied under makeup or on sensitive skin, alone or in conjunction with other skin treatments such as oils or lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredient list as seen on the back of the bottle:&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m feeling very soft skin and seeing wrinkles starting to fade from this 57 year old face.</li>
            <li>When i got it i was almost half way empty due to a spill it looked as its closed pretty good</li>
            <li>This gets my skin back to normal within days.</li>
            <li>I try new products, I stop using everything I used prior to new skin care, so I know the results that I am getting is what I am using currently.  </li>
            <li>A new bottle arrived three days later.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new on using the hyaluronic acid and I choose the joyal beauty based on the reviews  I&#x27;ve been using it only for a week</li>
            <li>My skin breakout easily, but heals slowly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mild and not at all unpleasant, but I like 100% odor-free better.</li>
            <li>skin serum is different from the many others that I have tried because it is a simple 3% solution of botanical hyaluronic acid in water with a proprietary natural preservative, Leucidal, that is produced by a common, edible lactic acid bacteria, Leuconostoc kimchii.  </li>
            <li>It also works very well on dry hands and elbows!</li>
            <li>The second one is 100% natural 3% HA with the simplest ingredients.</li>
            <li>The second one is 100% natural 3% HA with the simplest ingredients.</li>
            <li>Awsome facial plumper and all natural.</li>
            <li>It has softened the circles under my eyes to barely noticeable and&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is also priced so much better than the creams that are ridiculous!</li>
            <li>However, since I have recently added the Retinol product (which can be quite drying at first due to it&#x27;s skin cell turnover properties), I have now switched to the Ultra Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizing Serum.  </li>
            <li>This serum is not only high quality but works like my more expensive brand.</li>
            <li>This stuff along with DMSO really helped my knee pain and other things too.</li>
            <li>I am usually put some kind of make up to cover uneven skin, even if it is just short distance to the store to pick up something.  </li>
            <li>I add a squirt-full of the serum to very wet hands and gently work it into my face.  </li>
            <li>, it has definitely helped decrease wrinkles and fade spots (freckles and other sun spots) and my skin looks much smoother.  </li>
            <li>any lines that were apparent prior to use.</li>
            <li>It takes consistent use over a few weeks-months</li>
            <li>At least no bad feelings yet.</li>
            <li>I have issues with both adult acne and dry skin</li>
            <li>but my skin has really really cleared up since using this and my pores feel and look tighter and less noticible.</li>
            <li>I think it has really helped soften my skin, maybe even helped a little with the wrinkles</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a whole lot of improvement in wrinkles but my skin looked brighter!!!!</li>

            <li> I put it on a clean face before bed and after my shower in the morning, It is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I love the feeling it gives my face and knowing that it is free of GMOs, 100% vegan and not tested on animals</li>
            <li> the most important part is to not move your face till it dries no expressions.</li>
            <li> I found myself becoming a fan of Joyal Beauty because I like the theme of being &amp;#34;Organic&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and looks more even in color.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent product and must be applied to a wet face.  </li>
            <li> , it is true, they are excellent products, I started using the Vit C and Hyalauronic Acid together for 3 weeks, then ordered the Retinol A (which was a free VIP product, so I only paid shipping of $5)</li>
            <li> It just glides on so easily.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this serum to my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> Within 3 days I noticed the plumping of my skin and the smoothing out of fine wrinkles  </li>
            <li> All of my friends of Asian descent (and older women in their families) have the most flawless and ageless skin I&#x27;ve seen in my life.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for your great products even for the most sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li> VERY fast delivery!!  </li>
            <li> I contacted Joyal and they quickly offered me this serum to try instead which was very kind (and unexpected).  </li>
            <li> so I can accurately access the effect of each item.</li>
            <li> That will prevent the drying feeling you get when using hyaluronic acid serums which I have experienced in the past.&lt;br /&gt;The texture is different from others as well.</li>
            <li> -Free  </li>
            <li> The acid is primarily used to treat damaged joints; the treatments come in the form of injections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My co-worker and my family all notice that my face is so smoothly and more bright recently.</li>
            <li> put one drop on your fingers rub it together both fingers of hands and lightly do circles on your face.</li>
            <li> I am happy to say, I have noticed a big improvement.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s means this company is delivering a great product for a price is typically double.</li>
            <li> I received this serum free for testing and review purposes</li>
            <li> it makes my face baby smooth, Make up application - a breeze.  </li>
            <li> It is GMO and Cruelty free.  </li>

            <li> If you have aging skin, it help promote tissue repair through increasing the skin&#x27;s elasticity and supporting healthy collagen production.  </li>
            <li> Many thanks!</li>
            <li> because some people might be allergic to some ingredients such as jojoba oil, and the original one is oil-free and best for those oily skin or sensitive skin types.</li>

            <li> So Very Much,</li>
            <li> Adding some type of Hylauronic acid serum to your skin care regimen can help to hold in some of your skin’s natural moisture, prevent or reduce drying and help keep fine line and wrinkles at bay.</li>
            <li> I started seeing results within DAYS after my first use.</li>
            <li> I love Joyal Beauty products and will definitely reorder them once they run out.</li>
            <li> So, if someone is reading my review, they know exactly what and how I am using the Joyal Beauty products together.  </li>
            <li> So, 3 weeks ago, when I first start using Joyal Beauty products, I did just that.</li>
            <li> But, just short 3 weeks trying this product improved my skin this much, I am very confident this products help improve my skin tone to where it should be in near future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How about Customer Services and their support?  </li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid has been directly related, in more than one clinical trial, to increases in the sizes of tumors.</li>
            <li> you are considering using this acid, please talk with your clinician first.</li>
            <li> Almost through my first bottle- reording pronto-</li>
            <li> It has remained soft, smooth to the touch, plump and MOIST all day.</li>
            <li> This hyalauronic acid works much better than creams and the moisture seems to last longer.  </li>
            <li> The first bottle they sent was leaked.  </li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> It is not sticky or goopy, it goes on smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> Very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;I was given a complimentary sample of Joyal Beauty Vitamin C Serum for my view of the product.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.!</li>
            <li> I noticed the quality of this product immediately upon contact with my skin on the first day.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This was one of the first products I purchased from Joyal Beauty.  </li>
            <li> I love their commitment to keeping their product line pure and simple.  </li>
            <li> Did not remove the dark spots as promissed.......that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
            <li> I bought the hyalunoric acid before from a different brand and was a lot more expensive, so I decided to try this one, I have a healthy condition and have to careful with kind product I&#x27;m using, I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> My face was very oily before, but it has changed since I started using this Joyal beauty serum, it becomes soft and smooth to touch, even my husband noticed the change.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously had the pleasure of trying Joyal Beauty&#x27;s Hyaluronic Serum with Vitamin C and liked it very much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting long to write this review as I wanted to make sure this product does work for me.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve been looking for a solution pretty much my whole life.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Since then, my face is super sensitive and got red so easily even when I went into a room with some heat.</li>
            <li> I use is as recommended with water since it is so pure.</li>
            <li> Joyal Beauty Ultra Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum vs  hyaluronic acid 3% pure serum</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid 3% pure serum-</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid 3% pure serum-</li>
            <li> Pure Hyaluronic  </li>
            <li> It is silky smooth and leaves a soft smooth feeling to the skin once it is dry.</li>
            <li> I quite enjoyed it, but for my very dry skin and now the retinol, I need as much moisturizing as I can get.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin much smoother and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I don’t feel comfortable going out in public without some make up on my face.  </li>
            <li> Joyal Beauty Customer Service amazes me as much as their product line.  </li>
            <li> They are very reliable.  </li>
            <li> Wash my face with gentle face cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Wash my face with gentle face cleanser.  </li>

            <li> do see a difference and so fast .</li>
            <li> This is a real boon when it&#x27;s 95 degrees with humidity levels to match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really nothing I don&#x27;t like about this serum.</li>
            <li> Seller was very responsive and immediately corrected an issue of a leaking bottle.</li>
            <li> It really worked the way this product claimed to do, and it is organic too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used two bottles so far and can confidently recommend this product to anyone who wants her skin to have fresher and younger look.  </li>
            <li> The line is still there, but it is much softer and isn&#x27;t very pronounced.  </li>
            <li> Also, after my purchase, Joyal Beauty emailed me detailed instructions on how to properly use each of the products I ordered.  </li>
            <li> so much more than I expected</li>
            <li> My face felt so smooth next morning!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the product and the seller!</li>
            <li> It works for very well</li>

            <li> I really appreciate the product, pricing and customer service .I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Up until this point I was using milk of magnesia on my skin to control oil under my make up, but I am finding the oil in under control very well using the age defying serum - for me</li>
            <li> My wife really likes it.</li>
            <li> smooth my facial skin looks.</li>
            <li> Very Well.</li>
            <li> Today, My Face Is Much Softer To The Touch, And</li>
            <li> I wait a few minutes for it to absorb into the skin, and follow up with either rose hip oil (daytime) or night cream.</li>
            <li> I love all of the products I have so far and will definitely continue purchasing them.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> Skin felt good, looked nice, but was not able to use long enough to see if intended results could be achieved.</li>
            <li> (my pre-skin test is I apply new serum/creams on my neck first and if my skin doesn’t break out, I start using it)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another first time to try another new product.</li>
            <li> The serum makes my face so soft and right</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for other consumers like myself.</li>
            <li> Didnt last me a long time i think its a nice product .</li>

            <li> Well i am not a big fan of wearing to much makeup i like natural products and do not want to look like barbie, i just want clear skin that looks healthy, and this is what i have found that does just that.</li>
            <li> Also, a big thanks to your customer service department for their quick response to my questions.  </li>
            <li> I have fine lines and dry skin</li>
            <li> The first one is 98% natural 5% HA+5% vitamin c+other anti-aging ingredients.  </li>
            <li> The first one is 98% natural 5% HA+5% vitamin c+other anti-aging ingredients.  </li>
            <li> used it more two weeks and feel skin keeps moisture whole night,now I use before bed only next</li>
            <li> I use it daily to reduce fine line wrinkles and to clear up blemishes.</li>
            <li> It has a 2% higher concentration of Hyaluronic acid and does a better job (didn&#x27;t think that was possible) of hydrating my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I am  a third way through my first bottle and my skin feels amazing every day....will definitely come back again...</li>
            <li> For dry or flaky skin, this serum will help with a moisture barrier, lock in hydration and smooth the texture of skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t look any different over all, but it sure does feel different.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to apply a lot every time you use it so this bottle will last quite a bit, i will definitely order more after i run</li>
            <li> I will definitely come back to this product, love the feeling after applying this to my face</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This serum leaves my face highly moisturized.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> but I will continue to be a customer because of their high quality products.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product and Joyal Beauty</li>
            <li> product is 100% pure, natural and vegan.  </li>
            <li> , I guess it takes a little more time.</li>
            <li> Stop all my skin care items (which it did little to help anyway, but better than not using any).  </li>
            <li> Wow!!</li>
            <li> Its rare to find a skin care company with such high standards.  </li>
            <li> I have been using VC and HA serum for 3 days now, morning and night, after cleaning my face, I put 2 pumps of VC to my palm, then apply to my face with my fingers, followed by the HA serum, again 2 pumps (I add same amount of water to it), apply to my face with fingers, then massage, my skin quickly absorbed the serum</li>
            <li> Now one month later, I am still seeing the dermatologist for the super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> find it to be completely non-irritating and very useful for treating dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Joyal Beauty is a totally new brand to me</li>
            <li> I look on your website every day for new products.  </li>
            <li> Over the weekend I saw new serums.  </li>
            <li> Like that it&#x27;s very natural.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Hyaluronic Acid Serum in combination with Vitamin C serum for several months, I like it very much.</li>
            <li> before i had bought this i was a bit concerned because i have very sensitive skin and another product that i had used before this contained benzyl alcohol.</li>
            <li> I love my Joyal Hyaluronic Acid Serum, and my other Joyal products too.!!!  </li>
            <li> Living in a high altitude VERY dry climate, I know that most products--no matter the cost--leave my skin too dry.  </li>
            <li> skin looks so soft ,Will buy agin!</li>
            <li> Joyal Beauty&#x27;s HA serum first off has an efficient container - I prefer a bottle w/a pump so as to prevent any cross contamination with the formula versus a vial &amp; a dropper.</li>
            <li> you get when you try a brand/product for the first time and find out that it not only works but works</li>
            <li> Other then that not bad product..</li>
            <li> I also wrote another review here for other 3 items (Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum ,  Retinol Correcting Serum,  Ultra Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It has worked very well both for me (mid twenties) and for my mother (50+) in that it keeps skin hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> It is a clear serum and has no fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The delivery was so prompt give the holiday busy season.  </li>
            <li> have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am amazed just short time, my skin tone improved so much.  </li>
            <li> Royal jelly and propolis preserve and restore proteins and enzymes for anti-aging action.</li>
            <li> It’s gentle enough to use it around eye</li>
            <li> Royal jelly and propolis preserve and restore proteins and enzymes for anti-aging action.</li>
            <li> It’s gentle enough to use it around eye</li>
            <li> So far used for a week.</li>
            <li> have found Hyaluronic Acid supplementation to be directly correlated to measured increases in skin moisture.</li>
            <li> suits the sensitive skin too.</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother and feels soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this a week now with rosehip seed oil and WOW.</li>
            <li> Sent me instructions on how to use it properly which was very helpful.</li>
            <li> and it is 100% all natural and vegan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NikkiD</li>
            <li> I have felt it soft before, but never like this.</li>
            <li> I have deep lines on my forehead which are becoming less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Joyal Beauty Hyaluronic Acid Serum is 100% all natural and has no other ingredients but Hyaluronic Acid which means lots of locked in moisture for your skin!  </li>
            <li> Love this, sometimes my skin will get really dry and tight.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid is an important component of connective tissue and has dozens of medical uses, such as treating arthritis, promoting tissue growth and wound healing, and treating dry, flaky, or wrinkled skin.  </li>
            <li> I have found no magic cure unfortunately, but I have found products that help bring out the best in my skin.</li>
            <li> It is a clear, viscous, odorless substance that quickly absorbs into the skin without leaving a trace, so it can be applied under makeup or on sensitive skin, alone or in conjunction with other skin treatments such as oils or lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredient list as seen on the back of the bottle:&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m feeling very soft skin and seeing wrinkles starting to fade from this 57 year old face.</li>
            <li> When i got it i was almost half way empty due to a spill it looked as its closed pretty good</li>
            <li> This gets my skin back to normal within days.</li>
            <li> I try new products, I stop using everything I used prior to new skin care, so I know the results that I am getting is what I am using currently.  </li>
            <li> A new bottle arrived three days later.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new on using the hyaluronic acid and I choose the joyal beauty based on the reviews  I&#x27;ve been using it only for a week</li>
            <li> My skin breakout easily, but heals slowly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mild and not at all unpleasant, but I like 100% odor-free better.</li>
            <li> skin serum is different from the many others that I have tried because it is a simple 3% solution of botanical hyaluronic acid in water with a proprietary natural preservative, Leucidal, that is produced by a common, edible lactic acid bacteria, Leuconostoc kimchii.  </li>
            <li> It also works very well on dry hands and elbows!</li>
            <li> The second one is 100% natural 3% HA with the simplest ingredients.</li>
            <li> The second one is 100% natural 3% HA with the simplest ingredients.</li>
            <li> Awsome facial plumper and all natural.</li>
            <li> It has softened the circles under my eyes to barely noticeable and&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is also priced so much better than the creams that are ridiculous!</li>
            <li> However, since I have recently added the Retinol product (which can be quite drying at first due to it&#x27;s skin cell turnover properties), I have now switched to the Ultra Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizing Serum.  </li>
            <li> This serum is not only high quality but works like my more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> This stuff along with DMSO really helped my knee pain and other things too.</li>
            <li> I am usually put some kind of make up to cover uneven skin, even if it is just short distance to the store to pick up something.  </li>
            <li> I add a squirt-full of the serum to very wet hands and gently work it into my face.  </li>
            <li> , it has definitely helped decrease wrinkles and fade spots (freckles and other sun spots) and my skin looks much smoother.  </li>
            <li> any lines that were apparent prior to use.</li>
            <li> It takes consistent use over a few weeks-months</li>
            <li> At least no bad feelings yet.</li>
            <li> I have issues with both adult acne and dry skin</li>
            <li> but my skin has really really cleared up since using this and my pores feel and look tighter and less noticible.</li>
            <li> I think it has really helped soften my skin, maybe even helped a little with the wrinkles</li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft and supple and looks plumper by the day, I luckily no longer have breakouts to worry about.</li>
            <li> I decided to use this serum combination for my daily routine from now on, and I gave up using other expensive and famous brand products.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my face out  - reacts well with current regime.</li>
            <li> I use it under my daily and nightly moisturizers and it has truly tamed my &amp;#34;perpetually dry and irritated&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have a very deep vertical line just above the brow line in the center of my forehead.  </li>
            <li> Especially if you&#x27;re someone sensitive to vitamin C or other ingredients in the other serum.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pure ingredients which is hard to find.</li>
            <li> My only wish is that the bottle is a bit bigger and it lasts a little longer.</li>
            <li> I can notice such a difference in my skin, I use organic coconut butter as my moisturizer, but only a small amount, cleanse with Simple face wash</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other brands and they are basically the same.  </li>
            <li> A little drop is enough so the bottle will last for a long time!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only had one other product from another line that I trust.</li>
            <li> My face was never flaky or dry during my trip.</li>
            <li> I can even use it over my lips which get really dry from time to time without worry.</li>
            <li> but I will disagree since my skin is dry &amp; it does need a lot of maintenance with the moisture part &amp; time</li>
            <li> Ow i forgot to mention another one of the bes things, it contains no alcohol to dry out your skin</li>
            <li> I no longer have dry patches on my face!</li>
            <li> I can use much  less and get the same effect.</li>
            <li> I have been using the products only about 4 days and already see less wrinkles and plumper skin.</li>
            <li> The extra boost of hyaluronic acid has made a dramatic improvement in my older skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have mixed skin, always feel tight on the cheek areas in the afternoon.  </li>
            <li> is something I am trying harder to incorporate into my skin care.</li>
            <li> Because of this problem, I have to be careful what I am putting on my face.  </li>
            <li> I apply it when my face is still wet</li>
            <li> Use it with wet skin.</li>
            <li> Contains no oil, it is not greasy,light enough to use everyday.  </li>
            <li> and i said not really</li>
            <li> I have heard about Hyaluronic Acid from other beauty bloggers and sites though I have never really used one.</li>
            <li> Their hyaluronic acid serum helps moisturize my skin from the inside out and make it much less dry and patchy.</li>
            <li> My skin requires on-going exfoliation to minimize breakouts--- afterwards my skin would sometimes feel dry and tight.  </li>
            <li> There is absolutely no scent!</li>
            <li> Due to break out, discontinued using.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other HA products and none did what this product does.</li>
            <li> Unlike Joyal&#x27;s other Hyaluronic  Acid serum that contains vitamin C &amp; E, this one has nothing added.</li>
            <li> It is especially helpful in delicate areas of the face, such as around the eyes, where harsh chemicals or perfumes can&#x27;t be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it was spilled all over my other orders.</li>
            <li> I want to try all of the other products in their line.</li>
            <li> My other has been discarded.  </li>
            <li> This product has 3% HA; the Ultra HA has 5% (with other moisturizing agents as well).  </li>
            <li> I live in Florida and find it tough to use a moisturizer in this climate.</li>
            <li> My skin glows and my little dry patches are gone around my nose.</li>
            <li> If you are in your late twenties and above.</li>
            <li> I cannot really tell any difference yet, but I didn&#x27;t have any allergic reaction or any uncomfortable feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 63 years old needless to say with quite a few lines on my face since using this stuff the lines are now disappearing around my eyes and my mouth which I didn&#x27;t think was possible.</li>
            <li> what other products I would try if I had not encountered Joyal Beauty&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum!</li>
            <li> I received their other serum via a review program but was unable to complete due to a ingredient my doctor said I couldn&#x27;t use during pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my face has really lost the tired and dull that I had been growing used to seeing in my mirror.  </li>
            <li> These trials typically concern the oral use of the acid.</li>
            <li> Joyal&#x27;s Hyaluronic Serum with Vitamin C has a slight fragrance from the Vitamin C.</li>
            <li> It is often hidden (although not through deception or malice) in a catch-all phrase like &amp;#34;Botanical Extracts&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I had a slight allergy</li>
            <li> and it dries really tight.</li>
            <li> so, I will post photos to my review after I have been using it a little bit longer.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product because it is cruelty free/vegan and free from all the nasty chemicals in personal care products.</li>
            <li> I need to update my review since I have been using the serum for a few months now.</li>
            <li> My face becomes supple and firm.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to use heavy face creams at all so serums</li>
            <li> They have a few products that I didn’t know the difference and how to use it all together.  </li>
            <li> This keeps skin plum and firm.</li>
            <li> My skin tone is very uneven (Patches of discoloration) from previous breakouts.  </li>
            <li> The big problem with them is that they usually line under my eyes and make me look tired and in need of some makeup.</li>
            <li> Being in the office with AC in the summer is tough because it makes my skin so dry.</li>
            <li> I’ve tried countless bottles of expensive creams/serums recommended by doctors, but it ended up just waste of money, effort and time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I’ve used ½ oz creams/serums that cost over $200.00 in the past and it did very little to help my skin.  </li>
            <li> I’ve used ½ oz creams/serums that cost over $200.00 in the past and it did very little to help my skin.  </li>
            <li> I usually use it after my shower which is on a dampened face.</li>
            <li> If you take note of the ingredients, you will find that you have purchased a small bottle of water- Hyaluronic Acid (3%) and there is leucidal in addition.</li>
            <li> either, something I used a matt moisturizer for - no more.</li>
            <li> Every morning my skin feels unbelievable.   </li>
            <li> Acid is so hard to find</li>
            <li> Clinical trials have also connected the acid to negative effects for people who take blood thinners.</li>
            <li> Tried cutting back on amount of product used, but break outs continued.  </li>
            <li> Even though I am well into my 40s, I still struggle with oily skin - at least until I started using this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too bad, sending back for refund.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use the product for fall and winter since the heater in winter is worse for my skin.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s made with the basics, so no need to worry about unnecessary ingredients that your skin may react with.  </li>
            <li> Within two weeks of using it, I had fewer thin lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t broken my skin out</li>
            <li> benzyl alcohol is very bad for sensitive skin, it can cause skin irritation and will make you itchy.</li>
            <li> I am afraid of cold and dry weather, but addicted to ski...........</li>
            <li> i would recommend anyone to use this instead of those expensive creams.</li>
            <li> so unfortunately....</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with this product.  </li>
            <li> the trick is after you wash your face pat your face with cold water</li>
            <li> I HATE THIS LINE.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Use this every morning.  I think it has really helped soften my skin, maybe even helped a little with the wrinkles</li>
            <li> I need to update my review since I have been using the serum for a few months now. I have to say that I still love it. Being in the office with AC in the summer is tough because it makes my skin so dry. Ever since I started to use the serum, my face is a lot more moist than before and I see significant decrease of winkles on my forehead. I will continue to use the product for fall and winter since the heater in winter is worse for my skin. My only wish is that the bottle is a bit bigger and it lasts a little longer.</li>
            <li> This Hyaluronic acid is 100% all natural and has no alcohol which is great! There is absolutely no scent! This is a must have bonus. Some tend to have a smoky like scent to them, which makes me not want to use it. That will prevent the drying feeling you get when using hyaluronic acid serums which I have experienced in the past.&lt;br /&gt;The texture is different from others as well. It is silky smooth and leaves a soft smooth feeling to the skin once it is dry. I do apply a vitamin C serum after as well as my moisturizer. Overall this is a pretty amazing serum. I love the feeling it gives my face and knowing that it is free of GMOs, 100% vegan and not tested on animals is something I am trying harder to incorporate into my skin care. I use is as recommended with water since it is so pure. I usually use it after my shower which is on a dampened face. It just glides on so easily. I was sent this for review, however this does not effect my review</li>
            <li> It is very hydrating, light, and has no smell! It is organic, vegan, and it is not tested on animals all of which are qualities I look for in skin care products. It has worked very well both for me (mid twenties) and for my mother (50+) in that it keeps skin hydrated and soft. It also works very well on dry hands and elbows! The way I use it is, after washing and applying  toner, I use one pump on my damp face and neck and one pump for my hands and elbows. I wait a few minutes for it to absorb into the skin, and follow up with either rose hip oil (daytime) or night cream. I no longer have dry patches on my face! The company also sends you an email with instructions on how to best use the HA serum and their customer service is top notch! I did a LOT of hunting before finally finding this serum and this one is a keeper! Highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredient list as seen on the back of the bottle:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS: 100% Natural&lt;br /&gt;Aqua (Water), Botanical Hyaluronic Acid (3%), Leucidal (Organic)&lt;br /&gt;*Alcohol-Free  *Paraben-Free  *Pthalate-Free  *Non-Comedogenic  *Fragrance-Free  *GMO-Free  *Cruelty-Free  *100% Vegan</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll see amazing look by using it!!</li>
            <li> Great product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I took it to Reno where I always ski with my family every year. I am afraid of cold and dry weather, but addicted to ski...........this time I mixed Hyaluronic serum with toner, after then I used moisturizer lotion. My face was never flaky or dry during my trip. However, it is very nice product.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and absorb fast.</li>
            <li> This product is surprisingly amazing! I started seeing results within DAYS after my first use. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give a 0 star! I don&#x27;t understand how people give five stars on this product. I only used three times and my face was all red and had a burn feeling, so I stopped using it. Since then, my face is super sensitive and got red so easily even when I went into a room with some heat. After that, my face face started to swollen and it did not go away for a month.  I went to see a dermatologist and she told me the product shaved off one layer of my skin. Now one month later, I am still seeing the dermatologist for the super sensitive skin. I definitely  don&#x27;t think this product work for me.</li>
            <li> I have bought the Vit C serum and use it with Hyalauronic Acid and Retinol A, all three combined are just working wonders on my skin, it is true, they are excellent products, I started using the Vit C and Hyalauronic Acid together for 3 weeks, then ordered the Retinol A (which was a free VIP product, so I only paid shipping of $5) I can notice such a difference in my skin, I use organic coconut butter as my moisturizer, but only a small amount, cleanse with Simple face wash and I can honestly say my skin is in excellent condition, soft and smooth, it does look different, even some of my lines seem to be disappearing, around my eyes and lips....and these were quite deep lines.....I love all of the products I have so far and will definitely continue purchasing them.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin much smoother and hydrated.</li>
            <li> It does a good job keeping skin moist. I mix with my serum and moisturizer. Morning and night, a must have beauty item.</li>
            <li> The best facial product I have ever used. I see and feel the difference of my skin after just couple weeks!</li>
            <li> looks great until now</li>
            <li> I learned Joyal Beauty products from an article, I decided to give it a try. I ordered 4 bottles ( 2 HA serum, 1 VC, and 1 timeless) from Amason. The delivery was so prompt give the holiday busy season.  I have been using VC and HA serum for 3 days now, morning and night, after cleaning my face, I put 2 pumps of VC to my palm, then apply to my face with my fingers, followed by the HA serum, again 2 pumps (I add same amount of water to it), apply to my face with fingers, then massage, my skin quickly absorbed the serum, finally I put on day or night cream. I already see the difference. My skin is so soft, smooth, and comfortable.  My face becomes supple and firm. I haven’t see my skin become brighter, I guess it takes a little more time. I love Joyal Beauty products and will definitely reorder them once they run out. Thanks to Joyal Beauty for such wonderful products!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product and Awesome service . In very pleased , fast shipping , and I&#x27;m happy with the results .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other brands and they are basically the same.  I like the pump.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, I love it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my face out  - reacts well with current regime. A little drop is enough so the bottle will last for a long time!</li>
            <li> My skin requires on-going exfoliation to minimize breakouts--- afterwards my skin would sometimes feel dry and tight.  I love how this serum locks in moisture and makes my skin feel nice after exfoliation and cleansing. I can even use it over my lips which get really dry from time to time without worry. I don&#x27;t like to use heavy face creams at all so serums will always be my preferred choice for any facial treatments.  I like that it&#x27;s made with the basics, so no need to worry about unnecessary ingredients that your skin may react with.  I have been using this serum for about a month now and I still have a ton left in the pump bottle. I feel for the price, the quality and the amount given this is a very good price.  The company was also great to work with.  I received their other serum via a review program but was unable to complete due to a ingredient my doctor said I couldn&#x27;t use during pregnancy. I contacted Joyal and they quickly offered me this serum to try instead which was very kind (and unexpected).  I am very happy with this brand and plan to do a full review on my beauty blog www.iliketotalkalot.com</li>
            <li> I am writing this review on 3 Joyal Beauty products. (Kojic acid, royal jelly serum, hyaluronic acid 3% )  Since I am using these products together, I feel this review should be posted on all items that I am using.  So, if someone is reading my review, they know exactly what and how I am using the Joyal Beauty products together.  I also wrote another review here for other 3 items (Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum ,  Retinol Correcting Serum,  Ultra Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely sensitive skin and I can’t just pick up facial products and start using it without pre-skin test.  My skin breakout easily, but heals slowly.  Because of this problem, I have to be careful what I am putting on my face.  My skin tone is very uneven (Patches of discoloration) from previous breakouts.  I have multiple visits to Skin care clinics run by dermatologist.  I’ve tried countless bottles of expensive creams/serums recommended by doctors, but it ended up just waste of money, effort and time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I want to share my experience using Joyal Beauty products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I try new products, I stop using everything I used prior to new skin care, so I know the results that I am getting is what I am using currently.  So, 3 weeks ago, when I first start using Joyal Beauty products, I did just that. Stop all my skin care items (which it did little to help anyway, but better than not using any).  Then, I did my pre-skin test on Joyal Beauty Products. (my pre-skin test is I apply new serum/creams on my neck first and if my skin doesn’t break out, I start using it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, does Joyal Beauty help my skin as advertised?  Yes, it sure did!  I am usually put some kind of make up to cover uneven skin, even if it is just short distance to the store to pick up something.  I don’t feel comfortable going out in public without some make up on my face.  This is 3rd weeks using Joyal Beauty products.  I am amazed just short time, my skin tone improved so much.  It improved my skin tone so much in such a short period of time, I actually went out shopping without putting any makeup.  I wish I had taken pictures before I started on Joyal products.  I still have spots of discoloration, but it is fading.  These scares/bruises didn’t get there overnight, so I don’t expect it to be disappeared overnight.  But, just short 3 weeks trying this product improved my skin this much, I am very confident this products help improve my skin tone to where it should be in near future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How about Customer Services and their support?  Joyal Beauty Customer Service amazes me as much as their product line.  It’s refreshing to know company who develop and sells product is ready to help you.  They are very reliable.  So, if you have any questions at all, I am sure you’ll get answers from them without the delay.  They have a few products that I didn’t know the difference and how to use it all together.  So, I sent email and I got my answers right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;//&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;//&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I asked and their reply to my questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My questions:  Please let me know the difference between these products.&lt;br /&gt;1) Joyal Beauty Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum vs  Kojic acid&lt;br /&gt;2) Joyal Beauty Retinol Correcting Serum. vs  royal jelly serum&lt;br /&gt;3) Joyal Beauty Ultra Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum vs  hyaluronic acid 3% pure serum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joyal Beauty Team replied:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those are our organic anti-aging serum line and they have some similar functions.&lt;br /&gt;Both vitamin c and kojic acid have brightening functions. Age defy serum(kojic acid+AHA+BHA) also has exfoliating effect and it can be used at night. Vitamin c serum, you can use it Am and Pm, but best used at Am to utilize vitamin C’s sun-protecting properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retinol serum(vitamin A) should be used only at night. Royal jelly serum is a bee product (contains organic honey,royal jelly,propolis) Royal jelly and propolis preserve and restore proteins and enzymes for anti-aging action. You may search &amp;#34; royal jelly, skin, benefit&amp;#34; to learn more info. It can be used at Am and Pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We designed 2 different HA serums. The first one is 98% natural 5% HA+5% vitamin c+other anti-aging ingredients.  The second one is 100% natural 3% HA with the simplest ingredients. Why? because some people might be allergic to some ingredients such as jojoba oil, and the original one is oil-free and best for those oily skin or sensitive skin types. One of our customers who has the hypersensitive skin told us this is the only skincare product she can apply to her eye area and does not stimulate her eyes. 3%HA has the thinner texture compared with 5% HA so its absorption is better.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;//&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;//&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This information (reply from Joyal Beauty Team) help me to know the best way for me to apply different products, so here is how I use at AM and PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My AM Skin Care:&lt;br /&gt;• Wash my face with gentle face cleanser.  Pat dry.&lt;br /&gt;• Apply Toner&lt;br /&gt;• Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum – I use this at AM to utilize vitamin C’s sun-protecting properties.&lt;br /&gt;• Royal jelly serum&lt;br /&gt;• Ultra Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum – I don’t use this around eyes.&lt;br /&gt;• Cosmetic (Make-up)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My PM Skin Care:&lt;br /&gt;• Remove Make Up using Make-up remover.&lt;br /&gt;• Wash my face with gentle face cleanser.  Pat dry.&lt;br /&gt;• Apply Toner&lt;br /&gt;• Kojic acid – This has exfoliating effect, so I use this at PM.&lt;br /&gt;• Retinol Correcting Serum&lt;br /&gt;• Hyaluronic acid 3% pure serum- I use this at night around eye area also.  It’s gentle enough to use it around eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When and if Joyal Beauty comes up with product for facial cleanser and toner, I will not hesitate to buy it.  I’ve used ½ oz creams/serums that cost over $200.00 in the past and it did very little to help my skin.  I really am glad I have a chance to try out Joyal Bauty.  It’s affordable (under $25.00 for 1 oz) and best of all,  in just short period of time, Joyal Beauty really improved how my skin tone to be more even and brighter.anic honey,royal jelly,propolis) Royal jelly and propolis preserve and restore proteins and enzymes for anti-aging action.

            <li> Great product, made by a wonderful company with even greater customer service. Highly recommended. It feels like this does good to my skin. Like that it&#x27;s very natural.</li>
            <li> This serum is great to layer under your favorite moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Bought this with Vitamin C. Love both.</li>
            <li> It has lived up to every one of its stars.</li>
            <li> skin looks so soft ,Will buy agin!</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid has been directly related, in more than one clinical trial, to increases in the sizes of tumors. Clinical trials have also connected the acid to negative effects for people who take blood thinners. These trials typically concern the oral use of the acid. Concerning topical uses, clinical trials have not shown evidence that the acid reduces face/neck/hand wrinkles and brown spots on the skin. The acid is primarily used to treat damaged joints; the treatments come in the form of injections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are considering using this acid, please talk with your clinician first.</li>
            <li> So far used for a week. Pretty good.</li>
            <li> If you take note of the ingredients, you will find that you have purchased a small bottle of water- Hyaluronic Acid (3%) and there is leucidal in addition. People, we must shop for value.</li>
            <li> Made my skin breakout</li>
            <li> Almost through my first bottle- reording pronto- my skin looks fantastic- already seeing a huge difference in my smile lines after 3 weeks of usage.</li>
            <li> Love this product goes on so nice it truly works .I do see a difference and so fast . You will be blown away how it makes your face feel and look.love it!!!.Pat</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a whole lot of improvement in wrinkles but my skin looked brighter!!!!</li>
            <li> Used for over a week now. Can&#x27;t tell any difference yet. At least no bad feelings yet.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the purchase. This serum leaves my face highly moisturized. Thumps up!</li>
            <li> Great! Still using it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this serum! I use it with equal amount of water and it just soaks into my skin!&lt;br /&gt;I just started and already notice a hydrating difference! I&#x27;m definitely going to continue&lt;br /&gt;using this daily serum.</li>
            <li> Awsome facial plumper and all natural. It works, it works, it works! It&#x27;s among my top 10 beauty picks</li>
            <li> I have not had any peeling issues from my Retin A since using this product! Before the Serum I peeled to the point of being embarrassed &amp; considering discontinuing the use of the Retin A which I need to use! Problem solved! :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously had the pleasure of trying Joyal Beauty&#x27;s Hyaluronic Serum with Vitamin C and liked it very much. I like this one better. It has a 2% higher concentration of Hyaluronic acid and does a better job (didn&#x27;t think that was possible) of hydrating my dry skin. I live in Florida and find it tough to use a moisturizer in this climate. By mid-morning, even the lightest begin to float somewhat on my face, rather like body lotions do. If you&#x27;ve ever experienced this with lotion on your legs or arms, you&#x27;ll know what I&#x27;m talking about. Moisturizers are supposed to disappear, not remain on the face all day. But I digress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With 5% hyaluronic acid, this serum has helped my skin retain more moisture, thus reducing the need for moisturizer. I can use much  less and get the same effect. In fact, on some days I&#x27;ve not used any moisturizer at all and felt no difference in my skin. It has remained soft, smooth to the touch, plump and MOIST all day. This is a real boon when it&#x27;s 95 degrees with humidity levels to match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reason I prefer this serum is that it has, quite literally, no fragrance at all. Joyal&#x27;s Hyaluronic Serum with Vitamin C has a slight fragrance from the Vitamin C. It&#x27;s mild and not at all unpleasant, but I like 100% odor-free better. There&#x27;s really nothing I don&#x27;t like about this serum. It&#x27;s one I&#x27;ll happily continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all of their products, Joyal Beauty is proud to tell us exactly what is in the bottle, making it easy for us to make our own decisions about what to buy. Have an allergy? Mine is roses. Many products contain Rosehips, which can trigger my allergy. It is often hidden (although not through deception or malice) in a catch-all phrase like &amp;#34;Botanical Extracts&amp;#34;. Because Joyal lists all the ingredients on Amazon, I can check any product before I commit. This practice is priceless to anyone with allergies and another reason to trust Joyal Beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Sample provided for review**</li>
            <li> feels good when applied on face.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for your great products even for the most sensitive skin!  I love, love my hyaluronic acid serum, the only moisturizer there is, in my opinion!  Also, a big thanks to your customer service department for their quick response to my questions.  Joyal Beauty goes above and beyond to satisfy its customers!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over three months now. So far I love it! It is safe, affordable and most important it is so effectively bring fundamental changes to my skin. My co-worker and my family all notice that my face is so smoothly and more bright recently. I strongly recommend this serum to my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT DEARLY!</li>
            <li> Very good product .I will order again</li>
            <li> love this serum, leave the skin very smoothe with the touch like a baby&#x27;s face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 63 years old needless to say with quite a few lines on my face since using this stuff the lines are now disappearing around my eyes and my mouth which I didn&#x27;t think was possible. I have deep lines on my forehead which are becoming less noticeable. the trick is after you wash your face pat your face with cold water put one drop on your fingers rub it together both fingers of hands and lightly do circles on your face. the most important part is to not move your face till it dries no expressions. within a week I noticed great improvement!</li>
            <li> Seller was very responsive and immediately corrected an issue of a leaking bottle. The product is silky smooth and feels great on the skin.  I use it every morning and evening.  No redness or irritation. Used in conjunction with Vit. C serum, it has definitely helped decrease wrinkles and fade spots (freckles and other sun spots) and my skin looks much smoother.  Neck lines are totally gone. It takes consistent use over a few weeks-months but it does work!  Dryness is especially gone.  Living in a high altitude VERY dry climate, I know that most products--no matter the cost--leave my skin too dry.  This hyalauronic acid works much better than creams and the moisture seems to last longer.  It is also priced so much better than the creams that are ridiculous! I also like that this is not an animal product--so feel good about it!</li>
            <li> Used according to directions by adding sufficient water to the product, but it broke me out. Tried cutting back on amount of product used, but break outs continued.  Due to break out, discontinued using.  Skin felt good, looked nice, but was not able to use long enough to see if intended results could be achieved.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Hyaluronic Acid Serum in combination with Vitamin C serum for several months, I like it very much. It really worked the way this product claimed to do, and it is organic too. I decided to use this serum combination for my daily routine from now on, and I gave up using other expensive and famous brand products. I have recommended this product and the Vitamin C serum to my daughter, my friends already. I found myself becoming a fan of Joyal Beauty because I like the theme of being &amp;#34;Organic&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t look any different over all, but it sure does feel different. The serum makes my face so soft and right after I put it on my face looks more &#x27;awake&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting long to write this review as I wanted to make sure this product does work for me.  I&#x27;ve used two bottles so far and can confidently recommend this product to anyone who wants her skin to have fresher and younger look.  It&#x27;s made my skin tighter and smoother.</li>
            <li> best hyaluronic acid serum ever....love it</li>
            <li> I received a coupon for a promotional price for this product so I thought I would give it a try.  I have been using this product about a week now and I am really enjoying it.  I ordered more than one product so I have been doing my product testing on different parts of my body so I can accurately access the effect of each item. I have been testing this product on my forehead.  I have a very deep vertical line just above the brow line in the center of my forehead.  I HATE THIS LINE. So I was very hopeful that this product would be able to help.  I am happy to say, I have noticed a big improvement.  The line is still there, but it is much softer and isn&#x27;t very pronounced.  I have only been using this product for a week so, I will post photos to my review after I have been using it a little bit longer.  I like how this product feels on my skin.  There is no fragrance and no additives.&lt;br /&gt;I can read and understand everything on the label.  I especially love how this company lists the ingredients and then explains in detail what they are for.  Also, after my purchase, Joyal Beauty emailed me detailed instructions on how to properly use each of the products I ordered.  I am very impressed by this company.  I love their commitment to keeping their product line pure and simple.  They make their products themselves right here in the USA. Its rare to find a skin care company with such high standards.  I will be ordering the Hyaluronic Acid serum with C next.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because it is cruelty free/vegan and free from all the nasty chemicals in personal care products. I also loved the fact that it only has 3 ingredients. I have been using this product every morning and every night before going to bed for about a month and I absolutely love it. It hydrates my skin and makes my skin firmer by making it more plump. Fine lines are less visible and my skin looks great. I&#x27;ve used other HA products and none did what this product does. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> AMAZING! Pure Hyaluronic  Acid is so hard to find and I&#x27;ve only had one other product from another line that I trust. This serum is not only high quality but works like my more expensive brand. That&#x27;s means this company is delivering a great product for a price is typically double. Unlike Joyal&#x27;s other Hyaluronic  Acid serum that contains vitamin C &amp; E, this one has nothing added. That means you can play around with you&#x27;re skin care regimen a bit more with this one. Especially if you&#x27;re someone sensitive to vitamin C or other ingredients in the other serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the women in my family have used Hyaluronic  Acid for years and it&#x27;s one of the most popular staples in Asian beauty products. All of my friends of Asian descent (and older women in their families) have the most flawless and ageless skin I&#x27;ve seen in my life. So there is defiantly truth to the hype. There&#x27;s also scientific studies that state:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Researchers have found Hyaluronic Acid supplementation to be directly correlated to measured increases in skin moisture. Microscopic skin surface analysis shows increased skin smoothness, and amelioration of wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So whether you&#x27;re trying to prevent wrinkles and premature aging like me, or correcting skin degeneration, this is a serum you don&#x27;t want to pass up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I was given this product by the company for review</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic Acid Serum I bought to use in combination with the vitamin C organic serum. Very happy with the product itself and with improves texture of skin.</li>
            <li> My skin glows and my little dry patches are gone around my nose.</li>
            <li> Love the product and customer service is awesome...highly recommend seller. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> works  ..so much more than I expected</li>
            <li> Excellent product. suits the sensitive skin too. Adding some type of Hylauronic acid serum to your skin care regimen can help to hold in some of your skin’s natural moisture, prevent or reduce drying and help keep fine line and wrinkles at bay.This product is a great value for money. If you are in your late twenties and above. Include this product in your skincare routine</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Within 3 days I noticed the plumping of my skin and the smoothing out of fine wrinkles  I would definitely buy it again and plan to do so.  The company is also very customer service oriented which is important to me.</li>
            <li> Love this, sometimes my skin will get really dry and tight. I&#x27;ve tried using heavy moisturizers, but they don&#x27;t really work.  This gets my skin back to normal within days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, don&#x27;t see the difference yet.</li>
            <li> I have tried many serums from different brands, love this one!  My face felt so smooth next morning!  I have mixed skin, always feel tight on the cheek areas in the afternoon.  This serum has totally solved the problem!  Great customer service as well!  They sent emails to teach you how the product should be used.  So I always have the humidifier on at night.  The first bottle they sent was leaked.  I sent them an email explaining the problem.  The response literally came minutes later.  A new bottle arrived three days later.  I highly recommend the product and the seller!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product at good price. please remember put several drops of water to mix it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this hyaluronic acid serum for awhile now and my skin feels and looks so much better. I have issues with both adult acne and dry skin so I&#x27;ve been looking for a solution pretty much my whole life. I have found no magic cure unfortunately, but I have found products that help bring out the best in my skin. I am extremely happy with Joyal Beauty products, I have found them to be high quality and actually work. Their hyaluronic acid serum helps moisturize my skin from the inside out and make it much less dry and patchy. My skin feels smooth and looks more even in color. They also send out an email after purchase explaining the proper order to use the serums in, I found this extra step to be not only helpful but it demonstrates how conscientious this company is about their products. I received this serum free for testing and review purposes but I will continue to be a customer because of their high quality products.</li>
            <li> Great product. Delivers in it&#x27;s promises. My skin feels very soft and supple and looks plumper by the day, I luckily no longer have breakouts to worry about. Ive also found my face never gets greasy or shiny anymore either, something I used a matt moisturizer for - no more. I put it on a clean face before bed and after my shower in the morning, It is very easy to apply. You don&#x27;t have to apply a lot every time you use it so this bottle will last quite a bit, i will definitely order more after i run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also before i had bought this i was a bit concerned because i have very sensitive skin and another product that i had used before this contained benzyl alcohol. benzyl alcohol is very bad for sensitive skin, it can cause skin irritation and will make you itchy. Good news for you this product has No benzyl alcohol at all. It is 100% safe to use if you have sensitive skin like i do. I have been using a bit and it is flawless i would recommend anyone to use this instead of those expensive creams. This is cheap and affordable and works great!</li>
            <li> love that this serum is 100% pure.  many products labeled as &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; have a lot of unwanted ingredients</li>
            <li> ....did not hydrate and broke my skin out.</li>
            <li> In the weeks that I&#x27;ve been applying this Hyaluronic Acid serum I have noticed that my face has really lost the tired and dull that I had been growing used to seeing in my mirror.  This serum is strictly hyaluronic acid and water, and I find it is a great boost to the other serums I use.  The extra boost of hyaluronic acid has made a dramatic improvement in my older skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply this serum after I wash my face and use my toner.  I add a squirt-full of the serum to very wet hands and gently work it into my face.  It glides on easily and gives great coverage.  It is a clear serum and has no fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample product from Joyal Beauty.</li>
            <li> Excellent! My face feels-and is refreshed!</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother and feels soft to the touch. I put it on under my eyes every morning after I take a shower. Within two weeks of using it, I had fewer thin lines around my eyes. I&#x27;m hooked and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product at a conscientious pricing! Thank you! Will always purchase from you! I enjoy the timeless serum from you and now this Hyaluronic! This is an instant face changer overnight! it makes my face baby smooth, Make up application - a breeze.  it smoothed all my fine lines away! I am 41 and have the face of a baby with this product help! Will not stop using this ever! Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Ive been using this a week now with rosehip seed oil and WOW. I dont know if its this or the oil or a combination of them both but it has really been great for my skin. I dont know if this is the cause but my skin has really really cleared up since using this and my pores feel and look tighter and less noticible. I just spray water on my face after I apply my witch hazel toner and then massage this serum in my skin and it dries really tight. And then I apply the rosehip seed oil and then go to sleep and my face has been looking better and better everyday. I love it!</li>
            <li> You can see the difference after the first time use and costumer service is great, I am very happy to find this product and ordered three more.</li>
            <li> It works for very well</li>
            <li> Received product on time with no problems. It does seems to be helping the neck area, time will tell.</li>
            <li> I like it. it does seem to improves the dryness of my skin.</li>
            <li> Nice consistency. Sent me instructions on how to use it properly which was very helpful. I like it and will buy it again. Pure ingredients which is hard to find.</li>
            <li> The product is great.My skin feel more moisture now.</li>
            <li> Smooth transaction, good product!</li>
            <li> This is the most incredible hyaluronic acid serum ever.  I use it with the Joyal Beauty Vitamin C Serum and the combination just makes my skin glow.  I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.  For those of us over 45, it is a must for any skin regimen.  Kudos to Joyal!!!</li>
            <li> It works well on me. My face was very oily before, but it has changed since I started using this Joyal beauty serum, it becomes soft and smooth to touch, even my husband noticed the change. I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these products for a couple of months now, and I do notice an improvement in my skin. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Did not see the results yet.</li>
            <li> very good, second time to buy, my skin getting better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new on using the hyaluronic acid and I choose the joyal beauty based on the reviews  I&#x27;ve been using it only for a week and I can tell the difference, my skin feels smooth &amp; hydrated I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid is an important component of connective tissue and has dozens of medical uses, such as treating arthritis, promoting tissue growth and wound healing, and treating dry, flaky, or wrinkled skin.  It is what binds water molecules to the skin cells and as we age, the amount of hyaluronic acid in the outer layer of the skin decreases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This skin serum is different from the many others that I have tried because it is a simple 3% solution of botanical hyaluronic acid in water with a proprietary natural preservative, Leucidal, that is produced by a common, edible lactic acid bacteria, Leuconostoc kimchii.  It is a clear, viscous, odorless substance that quickly absorbs into the skin without leaving a trace, so it can be applied under makeup or on sensitive skin, alone or in conjunction with other skin treatments such as oils or lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it to be completely non-irritating and very useful for treating dry skin.  It is especially helpful in delicate areas of the face, such as around the eyes, where harsh chemicals or perfumes can&#x27;t be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amber glass bottle has a pump that dispenses a single drop for easy application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joyal Beauty provided Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Serum for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> Gentle on my sensitive skin and works great as an anti aging product - these were my initial thoughts when I first started using this product. I use it under my daily and nightly moisturizers and it has truly tamed my &amp;#34;perpetually dry and irritated&amp;#34; skin! I honestly don&#x27;t know what else I would do or what other products I would try if I had not encountered Joyal Beauty&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum! I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for other consumers like myself. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> VERY fast delivery!!  Just started using this but feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> Another first time to try another new product. I have heard about Hyaluronic Acid from other beauty bloggers and sites though I have never really used one. And I want to emphasize that I will be raving about this product. Joyal Beauty&#x27;s HA serum first off has an efficient container - I prefer a bottle w/a pump so as to prevent any cross contamination with the formula versus a vial &amp; a dropper. And I want to emphasize that I will be raving about this product. I love, love this process on my dry skin. What I do is I mix it in with a wee bit of water then apply it generously onto my face &amp; neck. It dries fairly quick so then I can follow it immediately with my moisturizer. You might say that that is a lot of step but I will disagree since my skin is dry &amp; it does need a lot of maintenance with the moisture part &amp; time isn&#x27;t an issue. This is my absolute first time to try HA serum &amp; I love it. The results are amazing every morning, I wake up with a very smooth canvass &amp; paired with my current Vitamin C, it is just a marvelous duo. This is in my Holy Grail chart from now on.</li>
            <li> So far, so good. I think I will order this serum again. Hasn&#x27;t broken my skin out and it is not sticky or overly greasy. Give this a try.</li>
            <li> I will definitely come back to this product, love the feeling after applying this to my face</li>
            <li> Didnt last me a long time i think its a nice product . When i got it i was almost half way empty due to a spill it looked as its closed pretty good but it was spilled all over my other orders. Other then that not bad product..</li>
            <li> Joyal Beauty is a totally new brand to me and I LOVE testing out products from brands I have yet to discover.  Joyal Beauty sent me their Hyaluronic Acid Serum and there is nothing better than that feeling you get when you try a brand/product for the first time and find out that it not only works but works really well!&lt;br /&gt;The Joyal Beauty Hyaluronic Acid Serum is 100% all natural and has no other ingredients but Hyaluronic Acid which means lots of locked in moisture for your skin!  I apply it when my face is still wet or after I use my facial mist and that seems to help my skin soak up the moisture and give me that dewy (not greasy or oily) appearance.  The serum is really lightweight so it&#x27;s perfect to wear under makeup.  The  Hyaluronic Acid Serum not only helps lock the moisture in my skin it also makes is more supple and smooth.  For someone with oily skin I am always on the hunt for products that don&#x27;t leave me feeling oily or greasy.  I need something to help balance my skin out and the Joyal Beauty Hyaluronic Acid Serum does just that, it&#x27;s perfect for my oily skin and can even be used on acne-prone skin.  After all, oily skin and acne-prone skin need moisture too!</li>
            <li> It works perfect to me ,I would highly recommend it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;I used it more two weeks and feel skin keeps moisture whole night,now I use before bed only next will try use on morning.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this, I also ordered a Vit C serum (Even Glow Serum by Valentia). The combination of the two is doing a great job on my face. Since I started both these brands/solutions at the same time, I don&#x27;t know which to credit the improvement but I suspect both are contributing. I have been using the products only about 4 days and already see less wrinkles and plumper skin. I am amazed! I had just about given up. I wish I had a before and after ( same pose, lighting, etc) to show you. I really appreciate the product, pricing and customer service .I wrote Joyal Beauty with questions and got a timely, informative response. Please note: It is imperative to follow application instructions to get the hydrating effect.</li>
            <li> THe hyaluronic acid serum made by Joyal is absolutely wonderful! I use it daily to reduce fine line wrinkles and to clear up blemishes. We all wish to age gracefully and have healthy skin, this is the product that can do just that. I always thought i would just have to deal with the sun spots and freckles i get during warm weather, they even come if i wear sun screen. The big problem with them is that they usually line under my eyes and make me look tired and in need of some makeup. Well i am not a big fan of wearing to much makeup i like natural products and do not want to look like barbie, i just want clear skin that looks healthy, and this is what i have found that does just that. It is not sticky or goopy, it goes on smooth and clear. This serum is excellent under makeup and will not cause your foundation to smudge or wear off. I put this on twice a day and have used it for some time now with great results. I absolutely love this product! Ow i forgot to mention another one of the bes things, it contains no alcohol to dry out your skin and it is 100% all natural and vegan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NikkiD</li>
            <li> It is quite light and easy to put on with a instant cooling effect</li>
            <li> SO FAR SO GOOD.. I ACTUALLY COMBINE IT WITH MY JOYAL VITAMIN C SERUM....</li>
            <li> This stuff along with DMSO really helped my knee pain and other things too.</li>
            <li> This product has been absolutely WONDERFUL for me in controlling excess oil. Even though I am well into my 40s, I still struggle with oily skin - at least until I started using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up until this point I was using milk of magnesia on my skin to control oil under my make up, but I am finding the oil in under control very well using the age defying serum - for me that alone is worth 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is wonderful when you find a product that addresses a &amp;#34;issue&amp;#34; that you have and does so quickly. This is the second Joyal Beauty product I have tried and I have to say I am honestly impressed. I want to try all of the other products in their line. I sure hope they are as good as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joyal Beauty provided this sample for testing and review with no guarantee of a favorable review.</li>
            <li> Love it. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I just love it it really works</li>
            <li> My wife really likes it.</li>
            <li> Everything sounds great in product description BUT there is no manufacture or expiration date on the bottle, not even a batch number. Too bad, sending back for refund.</li>
            <li> Love this Serum, makes my skin hydrated and glowing...</li>
            <li> REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;This product is 100% pure, natural and vegan.  No oils,chemicals, alcohols or parabens.  It is GMO and Cruelty free.  The preservative used is Organic and made from fermented radishes.If you have aging skin, it help promote tissue repair through increasing the skin&#x27;s elasticity and supporting healthy collagen production.  This keeps skin plum and firm.For dry or flaky skin, this serum will help with a moisture barrier, lock in hydration and smooth the texture of skin.  Use it with wet skin.For oily or acneic skin, this serum also has antibacterial properties.  Contains no oil, it is not greasy,light enough to use everyday.  Keep the oily skin hydrated or it will produce more oil and sebum which cause more break outs.This bottle can in a 1 oz/30 ml spray bottle with a sealed cap.  Very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;I was given a complimentary sample of Joyal Beauty Vitamin C Serum for my view of the product.</li>
            <li> I would love to say this product was amazing!  I just couldn&#x27;t know. I had a slight allergy so unfortunately.... My skin did not allow me to give this product a fair shot for any review of any kind. I rated 4 stars for the customer service of the company. Prompt shipping, excellent follow up, and very informative.</li>
            <li> Great product have been using every day for 2 weeks and its working</li>
            <li> So far so good. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Good stuff ! I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff ! I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and can see a difference in&lt;br /&gt;how smooth my facial skin looks. It has softened the circles under my eyes to barely noticeable and&lt;br /&gt;improved any lines that were apparent prior to use. The customer service is great too.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and Joyal Beauty</li>
            <li> I bought the hyalunoric acid before from a different brand and was a lot more expensive, so I decided to try this one, I have a healthy condition and have to careful with kind product I&#x27;m using, I&#x27;m very satisfied. My mother in-law also bought it after  my experience. For now on I&#x27;m buying only from you guys</li>
            <li> Only been using it a week, but so far it seems to be doing a good job!</li>
            <li> First time using HA and love it, i can see improvements of skin already, was waiting to finish the bottle to give my honest opinion, also my skin is super semsitive, and have only seen positive results , Time to order next bottle again</li>
            <li> I only used the products over a month for now. I cannot really tell any difference yet, but I didn&#x27;t have any allergic reaction or any uncomfortable feeling. I&#x27;ll continue using it for sure. Besides, I like their customer service. They provided very detailed instructions how to use the products and followed up if any questions.</li>
            <li> Buy this serum.  It is the best.  I have been using this serum now since January 2015.  I am totally hooked.  This will be my skin care regimen.  My other has been discarded.  Every morning my skin feels unbelievable.   I look on your website every day for new products.  I would love to see a moisturizer with SPF.   I keep wanting to touch my face.  I have felt it soft before, but never like this. My face looks bright.  The lines by the end of my eyes have greatly diminshed. I am next working on the puppet lines.     Over the weekend I saw new serums.  I believe organic not quite sure. Then some of the serums were gone.  The word is spreading.</li>
            <li> Good,very detailed instruction.</li>
            <li> I love my Joyal Hyaluronic Acid Serum, and my other Joyal products too.!!!  Excellent customer service, I will definitely be a repeat customer.  Thank you so much.!</li>
            <li> Great Price and quality. Works for a burn I am trying to keep hydrated.</li>
            <li> I noticed the quality of this product immediately upon contact with my skin on the first day. Its been 2 weeks and I&#x27;m feeling very soft skin and seeing wrinkles starting to fade from this 57 year old face. Many thanks!</li>
            <li> I have fine lines and dry skin so i got this but it didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I&#x27;ve been using for several months now and don&#x27;t notice any difference to the lines or the dryness.their customer service contacted me and asked ifi was satisfied and i said not really so they issued me a refund. I would bit from this company again just bc of the satisfaction refund.</li>
            <li> very good , I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Wow!! I Bought This Product On July 2014, {100% Hyaluronic-Acid Serum-By Joyal-Beauty} and It Sure Has Been Working On My Face Very Well. Today, My Face Is Much Softer To The Touch, And The Wrinkles That I Had Before Using This Product, Has Been Vanishing Away. I Use It Every Morning And Every Night Before Bedtime. To Tell You Honestly, I Have Been Getting So Much Beautiful Compliments From My Dear Cousin, Friends And Family. They All Tell Me That At My Age, I Look Absolutely Amazing!! Well, I Am Turning The BIG 50 On Sept./12/ 2014. All I Can Say Is, I Sure Love This Product So Very Much, And I Am Definitely Looking Forward In Buying It Again. Believe Me, It&#x27;s All Worth It! Thank You Joyal Beauty Team, You Are Doing An Awesome Job, And Please Keep Up The Good Work!! Blessings!! :-)</li>
            <li> very good purchase, the serum is easy to be absorbed, and  no irritation.</li>
            <li> I love it! I will purchase later. Thanks!</li>
            <li> So far so good. Did not remove the dark spots as promissed.......that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
            <li> I am  a third way through my first bottle and my skin feels amazing every day....will definitely come back again...</li>
            <li> I use it &amp; it seems OK</li>
            <li> This was one of the first products I purchased from Joyal Beauty.  I loved the fact that it only had three (3!) ingredients.  That&#x27;s pure!  It is an excellent product and must be applied to a wet face.  However, since I have recently added the Retinol product (which can be quite drying at first due to it&#x27;s skin cell turnover properties), I have now switched to the Ultra Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizing Serum.  There is nothing wrong with this product.  I quite enjoyed it, but for my very dry skin and now the retinol, I need as much moisturizing as I can get.  This product has 3% HA; the Ultra HA has 5% (with other moisturizing agents as well).  I love these products and this company.  They do things right!</li>
