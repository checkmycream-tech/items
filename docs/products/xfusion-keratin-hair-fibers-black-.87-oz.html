            <li>Excellent always  need it</li>
            <li>Excellent product.  </li>
            <li>Awesome product and seller!!!!</li>
            <li>, this product is amazing!!</li>
            <li>Great price &amp; product.  </li>
            <li>Just great everybody can&#x27;t tell I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li>Experienced increased hairloss while using this product.  </li>
            <li>- it is very good and is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>also they fiber don&#x27;t stay put honestly</li>
            <li>The fibers seem to resist running much better than the spray hair powder I was using.  </li>
            <li>Later that day, I showed both my parents, who were equally impressed.  </li>
            <li>girls at work says I have lots of hair.they just don&#x27;t know be sure to part your hair where you need it</li>
            <li>LOVE it.</li>
            <li>An amazing cover up for your bald spot when going out for a special show or meeting.</li>
            <li>Good product; doesn&#x27;t bleed looks natural.</li>
            <li>With the front and crown of my hair thinning more every day, I am so pleased with the natural look that was achieved with XFusion hair fibers.  </li>
            <li>Now I can look forward to growing older &amp; looking good without worrying too much about my thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>In fairness, this problem holds true for both products.    </li>
            <li>I workout everyday &amp; sweat profusely, surprisingly the product does not run!  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!!!</li>
            <li>but I would recommend that you put this on first and then style your hair the way you want it and add hair spray to lock it in, otherwise the wind will blow it off.</li>
            <li>This product may work better when used with a fiber holding spray or something similar.</li>
            <li>I was &#x27;sold&#x27; on it from that first trial.</li>
            <li>This product has really changed my outlook on aging!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s original (only mildly receded) place.</li>
            <li>Although if you use the black powder, just make sure you wipe the area around you thoroughly because the powder gets all over the place!  </li>
            <li>This gives a much nicer finish at the salon, and in between visits, I can apply it if needed by myself.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>They really do cover up your thinning areas.  </li>
            <li>You dont need to use much</li>
            <li>I was very self-conscious of this and kept thinking there should be a way to camouflage it.</li>
            <li>I would reccomend to everyone who wants a fuller thicker appearance of hair.  </li>
            <li>XFusion is still a decent product</li>
            <li>This product does blend very well with my natural hair, however, it does not withstand windy situations as advertised.  </li>
            <li>It looks like my hair is nice and thick and the bald patches appear to have never existed.</li>
            <li>It took a little practice, but it&#x27;s easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>My hairdresser and I are getting very creative by mixing two shades to get the right color without looking artificial.  </li>
            <li>I am a 40 year old male with typical thinning on top of my head.</li>
            <li>but unfortunately you have to use a little more of XFusion to produce effective results in the coverage area.  </li>
            <li>Looks so natural.</li>
            <li>Their hair fibers made my scalp itch, can easily come off when you touch the fiber areas with your fingers, and the black hair fibers has a bit of a blue hue to it.</li>
            <li>I live in the deep south and humidity</li>
            <li>My hairdresser changed shops recently and they use Xfusion at the new shop.</li>
            <li>what a let down the color is not black is more like dark blue</li>
            <li>I sprinkle a bit on the thinning areas and like magic the thin spots Disappear.</li>
            <li>I started getting thin patches on the top of my head and bald spots on the left side and at the back where I have several crowns.</li>

            <li> but if I would&#x27;ve known it was the small size I would have paid an extra $20 for the bigger version sold by toppik...</li>

            <li> Other than that</li>

            <li> I began using product to address a slight receding hairline.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;the fiber don&#x27;t blend with my hair which happens to be black</li>
            <li> and it was messy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a perfect solution to thinning hair, but it&#x27;s relatively inexpensive and IT WORKS!</li>
            <li> I ordered a small container from them.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a crappy small .87 oz...</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product I had used caboki  and wanted to try something new</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed I will stick to caboki from now on.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> With the front and crown of my hair thinning more every day, I am so pleased with the natural look that was achieved with XFusion hair fibers.  My hairdresser and I are getting very creative by mixing two shades to get the right color without looking artificial.  I live in the deep south and humidity is always a problem.  The fibers seem to resist running much better than the spray hair powder I was using.  This gives a much nicer finish at the salon, and in between visits, I can apply it if needed by myself.</li>
            <li> Great price &amp; product.  I am a 42 African American female, who is experiencing thinning at the crown of my head.  I sprinkle a bit on the thinning areas and like magic the thin spots Disappear. Immediately after I apply the product, I spritz a little hair spray (only on that area).  It will last until my next shampoo, I recommend this product to everyone I know.  Gives you back your Self Confidence.</li>
            <li> I am African American and I read about this product in Essence Magazine and thought that I would try it and I must agree with their review - it is very good and is very easy to use.  I definitely plan on re-ordering again, again and again.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I been using these for a couple of years now.  They really do cover up your thinning areas.  You dont need to use much but I would recommend that you put this on first and then style your hair the way you want it and add hair spray to lock it in, otherwise the wind will blow it off.</li>
            <li> If I can recommend hair fibers, I would recommend not buying XFusion. Their hair fibers made my scalp itch, can easily come off when you touch the fiber areas with your fingers, and the black hair fibers has a bit of a blue hue to it.</li>
            <li> I decided to give XFusion a try after my current product (Toppik), which I had been using for years, double in price overnight.    This product is a less expensive and safe short term replacement for Toppik but unfortunately you have to use a little more of XFusion to produce effective results in the coverage area.  This product does blend very well with my natural hair, however, it does not withstand windy situations as advertised.  Also, do not attempt to wear this product to bed without protective head covering because it will get soil your linens and you MUST reapply when you get up.  In fairness, this problem holds true for both products.    XFusion is still a decent product and I do recommend it for temporary cosmetic hair cover-up.  This product may work better when used with a fiber holding spray or something similar.</li>
            <li> I am a 40 year old male with typical thinning on top of my head. My hair stylist used this product on me about two weeks ago, and I was blown away!  I could not tell that I was thinning at all!  Later that day, I showed both my parents, who were equally impressed.  It took a little practice, but it&#x27;s easy to apply.  I simply shake it on like a salt shaker, and apply any hair spray, and it lasts all day.  I realize this is only a cosmetic fix, but who cares.  Only negative might be if I were caught in the rain, or couldn&#x27;t control my perspiration.  It&#x27;s not a perfect solution to thinning hair, but it&#x27;s relatively inexpensive and IT WORKS!</li>
            <li> My husband ordered this product and he LOVES IT.</li>
            <li> Looks so natural. An amazing cover up for your bald spot when going out for a special show or meeting.</li>
            <li> Just great everybody can&#x27;t tell I&#x27;m using it. girls at work says I have lots of hair.they just don&#x27;t know be sure to part your hair where you need it</li>
            <li> Good product; doesn&#x27;t bleed looks natural.</li>
            <li> I started getting thin patches on the top of my head and bald spots on the left side and at the back where I have several crowns. I was very self-conscious of this and kept thinking there should be a way to camouflage it. My hairdresser changed shops recently and they use Xfusion at the new shop. I was &#x27;sold&#x27; on it from that first trial. I ordered a small container from them. Then I ordered this larger canister and a spray applicator. I find it stays in place and does not rub off when I put my hands in my hair. It looks like my hair is nice and thick and the bald patches appear to have never existed. LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Excellent always  need it</li>
            <li> Experienced increased hairloss while using this product.  I began using product to address a slight receding hairline.  After one month using Xfusion, my hairline had receded noticeably, and areas that were previous thinning becam almost entirely bald.  It has been 3 months since I discontinued using Xfusion, and my hairline has restored to it&#x27;s original (only mildly receded) place.</li>
            <li> I only bought this product because before I bought it, it said 1. Something oz....I thought it was a steal so I bought this instead of toppik...I get the package in the mail and it&#x27;s a crappy small .87 oz...the product works but if I would&#x27;ve known it was the small size I would have paid an extra $20 for the bigger version sold by toppik...I wish I would have taken a screen shot of the product details to back my story up because the product is no where to be found be a use it&#x27;s out of stock, my package didn&#x27;t come with product details and neither does the electronic invoice I got through email...I&#x27;ll chalk it up as a loss...</li>
            <li> I did not like this product because I did not like the smell and it was messy and I had to apply it daily.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!!!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product I had used caboki  and wanted to try something new&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews on amazon about Xfusion Keratin fiber and gave it a shot  what a let down the color is not black is more like dark blue&lt;br /&gt;the fiber don&#x27;t blend with my hair which happens to be black also they fiber don&#x27;t stay put honestly I was very disappointed I will stick to caboki from now on.</li>
            <li> My mom loves this product and doesn&#x27;t go a day without using it. We received this product well before the last date to receive it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I use it every day.  It makes my hair look a lot fuller.  I almost never leave home without it.  I will continue to use i&lt;br /&gt;Joe</li>
            <li> Anyone with thinning or balding needs this product.  It changed my life.  I would reccomend to everyone who wants a fuller thicker appearance of hair.  I don&#x27;t leave the house without it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and seller!!!!</li>
            <li> This product has really changed my outlook on aging!  Now I can look forward to growing older &amp; looking good without worrying too much about my thinning hair.  I workout everyday &amp; sweat profusely, surprisingly the product does not run!  XFusion stays put until you wash it out.  Although if you use the black powder, just make sure you wipe the area around you thoroughly because the powder gets all over the place!  Other than that, this product is amazing!!</li>
            <li> If you need to go to an event for a day or perhaps take a picture, then this product will work for you.  Warning, don&#x27;t touch it or allow others to touch while it&#x27;s on your head as the product will come off in your hands.</li>
