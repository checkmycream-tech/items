            <li>and it is in great shape,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>but it works great, water resistant, and seals great around the hairline.</li>
            <li>and they both work great.  </li>

            <li>I love this shower cap!</li>
            <li>This is excellent quality and very well priced.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that it doesn&#x27;t smell, and it fits well.  </li>
            <li>these shower caps accommodate nicely.  </li>
            <li>I also like the thickness, nice quality.</li>
            <li>I also liked the funky retro pattern and colors.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I cannot find them in stores and so was thrilled when I found Amazon had them.</li>
            <li>The size is nice but the design eventually comes off.</li>
            <li>Nice fit good quality</li>
            <li>I loved the pattern, as it is easy to find where ever I dropped by accident or on purpose.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s priced reasonably and the quality is very good.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a good fit, there&#x27;s plenty of room.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice shower cap and works and feels much better than those inexpensive ones.</li>
            <li>Great shower cap, fits nice, good quality (not thin and cheap).</li>
            <li>and it all fits under it just fine!</li>
            <li>This product is very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>Nice and roomy for longer hair...and super cute, too!</li>
            <li>It easily comes off, but it kind of freaks me out knowing that the color is leaking onto my head.  </li>
            <li>Its huge!</li>
            <li>I have been using it for more than 6months now...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really cute.  </li>
            <li>I look so cute in it when I step to take my showers.</li>
            <li>Since I haven&#x27;t been able to find one since, I&#x27;ve turned to the internet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But this one looked cute and the price was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Again, impossibly cute design.  </li>
            <li>comes in a really cute package.  </li>
            <li>I love the flower pattern of this shower cap.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair mostly dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad to have a sturdier one than the hotel disposable versions.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off going to the drug store and buying a pack of Goody shower caps.  </li>
            <li>I love this line because of the size.  </li>
            <li>and so glad I did.</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for, I should have known better.</li>
            <li>and it has a cute color.</li>
            <li>but I just love it.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>Cute design.  </li>
            <li>love it and will recommend it.</li>
            <li>Love this item.</li>
            <li>This is so much better than anything I&#x27;ve ever bought at the drug store.  </li>
            <li>Cute is not the issue here, but functionality.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion: for this price, you can probably do better.</li>
            <li>Well, kinda stylish...?  </li>
            <li>Has not split or cracked yet, so it seems to be performing well. :)</li>
            <li>I have used the cap more than 10 times and still give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li>Super cute (a.k.a not &#x27;mom&#x27; looking) and keeps the water out!</li>
            <li>have shoulder length hair and use purple and grey size rollers and it fits perfectly over them.</li>
            <li>The elastic is still strong after many uses, so no water gets in.</li>
            <li>She seems to like it and said it hasn&#x27;t leaked yet, so she is happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>The elastic is great, so far no problems.</li>
            <li>All my hair fits easily in the cap.</li>
            <li>, that won&#x27;t rip apart quickly or easily.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;d think that would be easy to find but it hasn&#x27;t been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice thick band that keeps all the water out and feels perfect on your head.  </li>
            <li>My cap is still going strong,</li>
            <li>This has a good band and is nice and big</li>
            <li>This is a first to actually own a shower cap and this cap fits well.  </li>
            <li>and she said it worked fine for her.</li>
            <li>Nice, cute, fun, and certainly functional.</li>
            <li>but I see why people with huge hair would.</li>
            <li>I have a huge head and lots of hair.</li>
            <li>The elastic is a comfy fit around my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love the fun,</li>
            <li>As promised it fit well and kept the water out.</li>
            <li>so I can easily fit all of my hair underneath it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable.</li>
            <li>No problems with the fit at all, it&#x27;s snug in the elastic and roomy elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>It has a secure fit and the construction is sturdy.</li>
            <li>: it doesn&#x27;t smell like vinyl when you take it out of the box; you can fit lots of hair in it</li>
            <li>I like because it is inexpensive and it will fit over my rollers etc and does not have a fabric liner.  </li>
            <li>As far as shower caps go it&#x27;s good quality.</li>
            <li>This is a bouffant style shower cap which is great for people with long hair, hair fits in it comfortably.  </li>
            <li>Love it -- thanks!</li>
            <li>Fun for the shower!</li>
            <li>Funky and fun!  </li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s large &amp; would be able to fit a lot of hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my third, as they don&#x27;t hold up too long (maybe 6 months?), but they&#x27;re still the best out there that I&#x27;ve been able to find.</li>
            <li>This is a large cap, much better made than a disposable hotel shower cap and it covers your hair.  </li>
            <li>It is also very effective, it stays on and keeps my hair dry.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soft and nice elastic.  </li>
            <li>Well, the good news It kept the hair dry and fit like a medium sized cap.</li>
            <li>I love the quirky colors :)</li>
            <li>Pattern wears quickly</li>
            <li>I always roll my hair up into a quick bun for cap use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and feel it was worth the money I spent on it.</li>
            <li>I like it very much!</li>
            <li>I have been on the hunt for a great shower cap for a few years now.</li>
            <li>Fits great and not cheap material.</li>
            <li>The material is nice, and the elastic seems like it will last.</li>
            <li>Nice and big!</li>
            <li>This shower cap is sturdy and fun.  </li>
            <li>have to laugh at the &amp;#34;hipster&amp;#34; in the name, but it does its job.</li>
            <li>fun colors</li>
            <li>Finally I decided to buy a nice one</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and big!</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>We laugh when she puts it on, but it works.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s surprising how difficult it can be to find a good shower cap.  </li>
            <li>Fits all right.</li>
            <li>this one is the right size.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to find a replacement right away.</li>
            <li>right off).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, the ink does come right off the wall</li>
            <li>Shower cap does its job - keeps water out, has plenty of room for hair, is cute, and so far hasn&#x27;t smelled funny.</li>
            <li>Most important, my hair stays dry and I don&#x27;t feel frumpy wearing it.</li>
            <li>Nobody is going to look cool and hip in a shower cap, but really, who are you trying to impress?  </li>
            <li>So far the elastic is strong and it has no odor.</li>
            <li>This was a nicely made cap, with a pretty design, plus it covers the hair well, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Product quality is good but the elastic is too tight.  </li>
            <li>:)  Only issue is that the color comes off.  </li>
            <li>My favorite one was actually from the dollar store--terrycloth lined and everything.</li>
            <li>we did not send it back because it would have cost more</li>
            <li>This shower cap it pretty and all</li>
            <li>The elastic doesn&#x27;t leave a mark on my head, and the plastic is heavier than I expected but is still nice and flexible.  </li>
            <li>Very roomy!</li>
            <li>I will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>, it was exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it is NOT terry lined as I had thought.  </li>
            <li>Even though I hang it up to dry immerdiately after every use, there was already so much mold on it (and kind of smelly), that I decided to wash it after 2 months.</li>
            <li>So anyone that wants to keep their hair dry when taking a shower or bath, no matter how long your hair is, it a good cap to get!</li>
            <li>love it, love the durable material, the size is big, so long hair wont have a problem.  </li>
            <li>Good size but not big enough for longer locs</li>
            <li>How many times have I tried to squeeze my long hair into disposable hotel shower caps?</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t know for sure how long  </li>
            <li>(thanks amazon &amp;#34;community&amp;#34;),</li>
            <li>However, they were easy to wash off with some water and soon enough they stopped altogether.</li>
            <li>I would not consider this shower cap to be large by any stretch of the imagination.</li>
            <li>It is a large size cap</li>
            <li>so I can wear it with large clips holding my hair up.</li>
            <li>This is an extra large shower cap that can fit a lot of hair in it.  </li>
            <li>A good shower cap is hard to find, and I think I found one.  </li>
            <li>and it was hard to find a good shower cap to keep the water and moister out when I showered.  </li>
            <li>: it doesn&#x27;t do a great job of keeping your hair dry (your hair gets wet on the edges); the ink comes off!</li>
            <li>And she likes how much room there is for her hair.</li>
            <li>This one is big enough to fit over my head comfortably.</li>
            <li>This is one of the only shower caps that I can wear my hair in any style and it will fit.</li>
            <li>Secondly, it really starts to smell.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant to spend so much</li>
            <li>Been using it for a couple of weeks now, and my hair thanks me every day.</li>
            <li>It is much nicer than trying to deal with one time use shower caps and is comparably priced to the ones I have seen in stores.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t care about the styling (because c&#x27;mon, it&#x27;s something you wear in the SHOWER).  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t say I notice much of a difference in performance.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item last year, so it could fit around the braids I had in at the time.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s really beside the point.</li>
            <li>.. works ok.. but not really what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>I have a big ol&#x27; noggin and lots of hair-and this showercap kept everything inside the cap with a nice seal and also didn&#x27;t become stinky after using it several times.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s long, and this cap more than adequately covers my hair and my hair line without me feeling like I have to constantly shift it to cover whatever side of me is facing the shower head.  </li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s very pleased with ample room for hair, proper elasticity to keep hair dry...</li>
            <li>Very tight but comfortable fit.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair dry and easily folded for travel</li>
            <li>I have long hair and the cap will accept all and securely.  </li>
            <li>Chick\\&quot; is made of a sturdy plastic, is colorful, and is large enough to cover shoulder-length</li>
            <li>Minor annoyance considering I don&#x27;t really care what it looks like when I&#x27;m wearing it :)  Much larger than cheapie shower caps and holds all my hair very well.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s very spacious, which is a great bonus for those with long or/and thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Nice cap but not big enough, looks bigger than it really is.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this item if you have been looking for a sturdy cap.</li>
            <li>it is strong and big enough if your whole hair is braided</li>
            <li>large enough to fit my hair when it&#x27;s up in a bun--which you&#x27;d think would be obvious but nope</li>
            <li>The only think I like about this product is the colorful design.  </li>
            <li>This is nice for us natural chicks who have small afros.</li>
            <li>The vinyl is not stiff, it does not smell when you get it wet, and the elastic is nice and snug so water will not get your hairline wet.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty solid shower cap.</li>
            <li>I just wish the lip that covers the exterior was a little wider as it easily flips under.</li>
            <li>The plastic is not very thick compared to others I have had</li>
            <li>The ink all came off and now I&#x27;m left with a cap that&#x27;s pretty much just white.</li>
            <li>It is large enough for my medium length hair.</li>
            <li>What I do like about this shower cap is that it&#x27;s large enough to hold all my hair (and I have quite a bit).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s large enough to hold all of my hair, even when I through it in curlers.</li>
            <li>My hair would always find a way to fall out of my old cap.</li>
            <li>5 months later, wife still thanks me....got this for her based on reviews</li>
            <li>So far it has held up well</li>
            <li>This designer shower cap does exactly what is supposed to, keeps my hair dry during a shower.</li>
            <li>These are the only types of shower caps that are large enough and tight enough to fit my hair!</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t give it the full 5 stars because it left small bluish stains on my temples during the first couple times</li>
            <li>Great for thick long hair that doesn&#x27;t stay up on any other shower cap</li>
            <li>I like this cap because it&#x27;s big enough that I can have my hair in a bun and still wear bluetooth headphones under the cap comfortably, and when I&#x27;m coming home and showering at 1 in the morning, I wear this cap (actually, I bought a second cap just to leave there) and those headphones so as to not wake anyone up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve searched high and low.</li>
            <li>Covers lots of hair which sometimes isn&#x27;t always covered by traditional shower caps which are a little smaller three more words</li>
            <li>Granted, I know this isn&#x27;t a pricey shower cap, but I still expected a higher gauge vinyl.  </li>
            <li>I have short hair (above the collar), but I wanted a large shower cap so that my hair wouldn&#x27;t be smashed when taking a shower.</li>
            <li>I have waist length dread locks and it was large enough to cover them but not enough elastic in to keep in on my head.</li>
            <li>personally don&#x27;t like shower caps with a fabric liner because I find the fabric wicks up water at the edges, which brings it in close proximity to my hair and makes it wet, which defeats the purpose of the shower cap in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a hard time finding these big ones that don&#x27;t tear easily.</li>
            <li>I like the tight fit on your head so your hair stays dry in the back.  </li>
            <li>Enough space for long hair, my hair is pretty long and fits in it without a problem.</li>
            <li>I needed a shower cap that was a little more heavy duty than the ones you pick up at the dollar store.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t let any water in as it&#x27;s pretty tight around the scalp.</li>
            <li>I like that the elastic is a bit tight at first; it does loosen up over time, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It definitely takes a week or so to break in this cap, during which those points sticking out from the elastic are gonna feel stabby and irritating, but as the cap loosens up, it&#x27;ll get better.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find anything comparable at any major store such as Target, Bed, Bath and Beyond, Kohl&#x27;s or Walmart.  </li>
            <li>The elastic is slightly more tight than I would like, but my head is a little bigger than average, so I can&#x27;t really call it a flaw.</li>
            <li>Tight fit around my head keeps my long hair dry with no problems.</li>
            <li>This is not a  long term shower cap.</li>
            <li>Have had the first one for a few years now.</li>
            <li>no more fading just fun wearing it.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Hippie Chick\\&quot; version I received had only one row of elastic stitching and, if I am not careful and bend over, allows water to enter the back of the shower cap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Roomy enough for long thick hair and the band is comfortable.</li>
            <li>It also developed a mildew smell after a month even though I store it open in a dry place.</li>
            <li>This shower cap not only smashes my hair, it is uncomfortably tight and very scratchy around my face.</li>
            <li>will it be tight enough to really keep everything in place and the water out?</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> but it works great, water resistant, and seals great around the hairline.</li>

            <li> I love this shower cap!</li>
            <li> This is excellent quality and very well priced.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that it doesn&#x27;t smell, and it fits well.  </li>
            <li> these shower caps accommodate nicely.  </li>
            <li> I also like the thickness, nice quality.</li>
            <li> I also liked the funky retro pattern and colors.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I cannot find them in stores and so was thrilled when I found Amazon had them.</li>
            <li> The size is nice but the design eventually comes off.</li>
            <li> Nice fit good quality</li>
            <li> I loved the pattern, as it is easy to find where ever I dropped by accident or on purpose.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s priced reasonably and the quality is very good.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a good fit, there&#x27;s plenty of room.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice shower cap and works and feels much better than those inexpensive ones.</li>
            <li> Great shower cap, fits nice, good quality (not thin and cheap).</li>
            <li> and it all fits under it just fine!</li>
            <li> This product is very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> Nice and roomy for longer hair...and super cute, too!</li>
            <li> It easily comes off, but it kind of freaks me out knowing that the color is leaking onto my head.  </li>
            <li> Its huge!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for more than 6months now...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cute.  </li>
            <li> I look so cute in it when I step to take my showers.</li>
            <li> Since I haven&#x27;t been able to find one since, I&#x27;ve turned to the internet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But this one looked cute and the price was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Again, impossibly cute design.  </li>
            <li> comes in a really cute package.  </li>
            <li> I love the flower pattern of this shower cap.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair mostly dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m glad to have a sturdier one than the hotel disposable versions.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off going to the drug store and buying a pack of Goody shower caps.  </li>
            <li> I love this line because of the size.  </li>
            <li> and so glad I did.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, I should have known better.</li>
            <li> and it has a cute color.</li>
            <li> but I just love it.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> Cute design.  </li>
            <li> love it and will recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this item.</li>
            <li> This is so much better than anything I&#x27;ve ever bought at the drug store.  </li>
            <li> Cute is not the issue here, but functionality.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusion: for this price, you can probably do better.</li>
            <li> Well, kinda stylish...?  </li>
            <li> Has not split or cracked yet, so it seems to be performing well. :)</li>
            <li> I have used the cap more than 10 times and still give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Super cute (a.k.a not &#x27;mom&#x27; looking) and keeps the water out!</li>
            <li> have shoulder length hair and use purple and grey size rollers and it fits perfectly over them.</li>
            <li> The elastic is still strong after many uses, so no water gets in.</li>
            <li> She seems to like it and said it hasn&#x27;t leaked yet, so she is happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> The elastic is great, so far no problems.</li>
            <li> All my hair fits easily in the cap.</li>
            <li> , that won&#x27;t rip apart quickly or easily.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think that would be easy to find but it hasn&#x27;t been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice thick band that keeps all the water out and feels perfect on your head.  </li>
            <li> My cap is still going strong,</li>
            <li> This has a good band and is nice and big</li>
            <li> This is a first to actually own a shower cap and this cap fits well.  </li>
            <li> and she said it worked fine for her.</li>
            <li> Nice, cute, fun, and certainly functional.</li>
            <li> but I see why people with huge hair would.</li>
            <li> I have a huge head and lots of hair.</li>
            <li> The elastic is a comfy fit around my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I love the fun,</li>
            <li> As promised it fit well and kept the water out.</li>
            <li> so I can easily fit all of my hair underneath it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable.</li>
            <li> No problems with the fit at all, it&#x27;s snug in the elastic and roomy elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> It has a secure fit and the construction is sturdy.</li>
            <li> : it doesn&#x27;t smell like vinyl when you take it out of the box; you can fit lots of hair in it</li>
            <li> I like because it is inexpensive and it will fit over my rollers etc and does not have a fabric liner.  </li>
            <li> As far as shower caps go it&#x27;s good quality.</li>
            <li> This is a bouffant style shower cap which is great for people with long hair, hair fits in it comfortably.  </li>
            <li> Love it -- thanks!</li>
            <li> Fun for the shower!</li>
            <li> Funky and fun!  </li>
            <li> Worth the price!</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s large &amp; would be able to fit a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third, as they don&#x27;t hold up too long (maybe 6 months?), but they&#x27;re still the best out there that I&#x27;ve been able to find.</li>
            <li> This is a large cap, much better made than a disposable hotel shower cap and it covers your hair.  </li>
            <li> It is also very effective, it stays on and keeps my hair dry.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soft and nice elastic.  </li>
            <li> Well, the good news It kept the hair dry and fit like a medium sized cap.</li>
            <li> I love the quirky colors :)</li>
            <li> Pattern wears quickly</li>
            <li> I always roll my hair up into a quick bun for cap use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and feel it was worth the money I spent on it.</li>
            <li> I like it very much!</li>
            <li> I have been on the hunt for a great shower cap for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Fits great and not cheap material.</li>
            <li> The material is nice, and the elastic seems like it will last.</li>
            <li> Nice and big!</li>
            <li> This shower cap is sturdy and fun.  </li>
            <li> have to laugh at the &amp;#34;hipster&amp;#34; in the name, but it does its job.</li>
            <li> fun colors</li>
            <li> Finally I decided to buy a nice one</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and big!</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> We laugh when she puts it on, but it works.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s surprising how difficult it can be to find a good shower cap.  </li>
            <li> Fits all right.</li>
            <li> this one is the right size.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to find a replacement right away.</li>
            <li> right off).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, the ink does come right off the wall</li>
            <li> Shower cap does its job - keeps water out, has plenty of room for hair, is cute, and so far hasn&#x27;t smelled funny.</li>
            <li> Most important, my hair stays dry and I don&#x27;t feel frumpy wearing it.</li>
            <li> Nobody is going to look cool and hip in a shower cap, but really, who are you trying to impress?  </li>
            <li> So far the elastic is strong and it has no odor.</li>
            <li> This was a nicely made cap, with a pretty design, plus it covers the hair well, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Product quality is good but the elastic is too tight.  </li>
            <li> :)  Only issue is that the color comes off.  </li>
            <li> My favorite one was actually from the dollar store--terrycloth lined and everything.</li>
            <li> we did not send it back because it would have cost more</li>
            <li> This shower cap it pretty and all</li>
            <li> The elastic doesn&#x27;t leave a mark on my head, and the plastic is heavier than I expected but is still nice and flexible.  </li>
            <li> Very roomy!</li>
            <li> I will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> , it was exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is NOT terry lined as I had thought.  </li>
            <li> Even though I hang it up to dry immerdiately after every use, there was already so much mold on it (and kind of smelly), that I decided to wash it after 2 months.</li>
            <li> So anyone that wants to keep their hair dry when taking a shower or bath, no matter how long your hair is, it a good cap to get!</li>
            <li> love it, love the durable material, the size is big, so long hair wont have a problem.  </li>
            <li> Good size but not big enough for longer locs</li>
            <li> How many times have I tried to squeeze my long hair into disposable hotel shower caps?</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t know for sure how long  </li>
            <li> (thanks amazon &amp;#34;community&amp;#34;),</li>
            <li> However, they were easy to wash off with some water and soon enough they stopped altogether.</li>
            <li> I would not consider this shower cap to be large by any stretch of the imagination.</li>
            <li> It is a large size cap</li>
            <li> so I can wear it with large clips holding my hair up.</li>
            <li> This is an extra large shower cap that can fit a lot of hair in it.  </li>
            <li> A good shower cap is hard to find, and I think I found one.  </li>
            <li> and it was hard to find a good shower cap to keep the water and moister out when I showered.  </li>
            <li> : it doesn&#x27;t do a great job of keeping your hair dry (your hair gets wet on the edges); the ink comes off!</li>
            <li> And she likes how much room there is for her hair.</li>
            <li> This one is big enough to fit over my head comfortably.</li>
            <li> This is one of the only shower caps that I can wear my hair in any style and it will fit.</li>
            <li> Secondly, it really starts to smell.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to spend so much</li>
            <li> Been using it for a couple of weeks now, and my hair thanks me every day.</li>
            <li> It is much nicer than trying to deal with one time use shower caps and is comparably priced to the ones I have seen in stores.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t care about the styling (because c&#x27;mon, it&#x27;s something you wear in the SHOWER).  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t say I notice much of a difference in performance.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item last year, so it could fit around the braids I had in at the time.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s really beside the point.</li>
            <li> .. works ok.. but not really what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I have a big ol&#x27; noggin and lots of hair-and this showercap kept everything inside the cap with a nice seal and also didn&#x27;t become stinky after using it several times.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s long, and this cap more than adequately covers my hair and my hair line without me feeling like I have to constantly shift it to cover whatever side of me is facing the shower head.  </li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s very pleased with ample room for hair, proper elasticity to keep hair dry...</li>
            <li> Very tight but comfortable fit.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair dry and easily folded for travel</li>
            <li> I have long hair and the cap will accept all and securely.  </li>
            <li> Chick\\&quot; is made of a sturdy plastic, is colorful, and is large enough to cover shoulder-length</li>
            <li> Minor annoyance considering I don&#x27;t really care what it looks like when I&#x27;m wearing it :)  Much larger than cheapie shower caps and holds all my hair very well.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s very spacious, which is a great bonus for those with long or/and thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Nice cap but not big enough, looks bigger than it really is.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this item if you have been looking for a sturdy cap.</li>
            <li> it is strong and big enough if your whole hair is braided</li>
            <li> large enough to fit my hair when it&#x27;s up in a bun--which you&#x27;d think would be obvious but nope</li>
            <li> The only think I like about this product is the colorful design.  </li>
            <li> This is nice for us natural chicks who have small afros.</li>
            <li> The vinyl is not stiff, it does not smell when you get it wet, and the elastic is nice and snug so water will not get your hairline wet.  </li>
            <li> This is a pretty solid shower cap.</li>
            <li> I just wish the lip that covers the exterior was a little wider as it easily flips under.</li>
            <li> The plastic is not very thick compared to others I have had</li>
            <li> The ink all came off and now I&#x27;m left with a cap that&#x27;s pretty much just white.</li>
            <li> It is large enough for my medium length hair.</li>
            <li> What I do like about this shower cap is that it&#x27;s large enough to hold all my hair (and I have quite a bit).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s large enough to hold all of my hair, even when I through it in curlers.</li>
            <li> My hair would always find a way to fall out of my old cap.</li>
            <li> 5 months later, wife still thanks me....got this for her based on reviews</li>
            <li> So far it has held up well</li>
            <li> This designer shower cap does exactly what is supposed to, keeps my hair dry during a shower.</li>
            <li> These are the only types of shower caps that are large enough and tight enough to fit my hair!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t give it the full 5 stars because it left small bluish stains on my temples during the first couple times</li>
            <li> Great for thick long hair that doesn&#x27;t stay up on any other shower cap</li>
            <li> I like this cap because it&#x27;s big enough that I can have my hair in a bun and still wear bluetooth headphones under the cap comfortably, and when I&#x27;m coming home and showering at 1 in the morning, I wear this cap (actually, I bought a second cap just to leave there) and those headphones so as to not wake anyone up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve searched high and low.</li>
            <li> Covers lots of hair which sometimes isn&#x27;t always covered by traditional shower caps which are a little smaller three more words</li>
            <li> Granted, I know this isn&#x27;t a pricey shower cap, but I still expected a higher gauge vinyl.  </li>
            <li> I have short hair (above the collar), but I wanted a large shower cap so that my hair wouldn&#x27;t be smashed when taking a shower.</li>
            <li> I have waist length dread locks and it was large enough to cover them but not enough elastic in to keep in on my head.</li>
            <li> personally don&#x27;t like shower caps with a fabric liner because I find the fabric wicks up water at the edges, which brings it in close proximity to my hair and makes it wet, which defeats the purpose of the shower cap in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding these big ones that don&#x27;t tear easily.</li>
            <li> I like the tight fit on your head so your hair stays dry in the back.  </li>
            <li> Enough space for long hair, my hair is pretty long and fits in it without a problem.</li>
            <li> I needed a shower cap that was a little more heavy duty than the ones you pick up at the dollar store.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t let any water in as it&#x27;s pretty tight around the scalp.</li>
            <li> I like that the elastic is a bit tight at first; it does loosen up over time, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It definitely takes a week or so to break in this cap, during which those points sticking out from the elastic are gonna feel stabby and irritating, but as the cap loosens up, it&#x27;ll get better.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find anything comparable at any major store such as Target, Bed, Bath and Beyond, Kohl&#x27;s or Walmart.  </li>
            <li> The elastic is slightly more tight than I would like, but my head is a little bigger than average, so I can&#x27;t really call it a flaw.</li>
            <li> Tight fit around my head keeps my long hair dry with no problems.</li>
            <li> This is not a  long term shower cap.</li>
            <li> Have had the first one for a few years now.</li>
            <li> no more fading just fun wearing it.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Hippie Chick\\&quot; version I received had only one row of elastic stitching and, if I am not careful and bend over, allows water to enter the back of the shower cap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Roomy enough for long thick hair and the band is comfortable.</li>
            <li> It also developed a mildew smell after a month even though I store it open in a dry place.</li>
            <li> This shower cap not only smashes my hair, it is uncomfortably tight and very scratchy around my face.</li>
            <li> will it be tight enough to really keep everything in place and the water out?</li>
            <li> Hard to find these very large size shower caps.  </li>
            <li> I have super thick, long hair and this shower cap fits all of it with room to spare!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent shower cap that will hopefully last me a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It is not big enough, especially for ladies with long hair (even for shoulder length hair).  </li>
            <li> The shower cap opening fits snuggly but not too tight and really does keep your hair dry.  </li>
            <li> I gave it a 4star because I have not had it long enough to see had it stands up after multiple uses.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Hang it up, it dries super, crazy fast.</li>
            <li> They are usually \\&quot;leak-proof\\&quot; for a year and then work reasonably well as a travel shower cap for another year.  </li>
            <li> They last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I guess there&#x27;s no way around this, but I turn my cap inside out - put it outside to dry,</li>
            <li> As expected, big enough to cover everything,</li>
            <li> I have really long hair</li>
            <li> and it hasn&#x27;t stretched out.</li>
            <li> So far held up well after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and this does the job of keeping my hair dry.</li>
            <li> Finally I can take a shower without getting my hair wet!</li>
            <li> I take a shower every morning, but I only wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> This also fits tightly, but not too tightly around the scalp and would be decent for doing conditioning treatments.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I would not want to wear it for very long.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair dry</li>
            <li> these shower caps keep it dry in the shower.</li>
            <li> I still hang it to dry.  </li>
            <li> My hair stays dry in the shower.</li>
            <li> This shower cap stays on my head and keeps my hair dry.  </li>
            <li> My girlfriend likes this because it keeps her hair dry</li>
            <li> so she can go to sleep after showering with dry hair.  </li>
            <li> So I needed a shower cap that could keep my hair dry in the shower.  </li>
            <li> It kept my hair line dry</li>
            <li> My girlfriend likes it... keeps her head dry.  </li>
            <li> If you have a larger head or larger rollers, it may not fit well.  </li>
            <li> It is a single plastic sheet with no inside liner.  </li>
            <li> It is also fairly loose on my head</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair completely dry (if I cover my ears along with the rest of my hair)!</li>
            <li> A must have if you have long, thick or natural hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too tight, and it&#x27;s definitely not too loose.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re tired of your hair getting wet with normal shower caps, look no further than this product!  </li>
            <li> Its also snug enough on my head but not too tight</li>
            <li> I have noticed some of the decorative design wearing off in a few places, but I haven&#x27;t seen where that paint is actually transferring off to.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s intended purpose is, which is to guard my hair in the shower if i don&#x27;t want to wet it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so not in the mood to get it wet and re-dry it all over again.  </li>
            <li> This shower cap bleeds the ink on it when wet.</li>
            <li> It is not the texture I expected.  </li>
            <li> used to use disposable shower caps, but my hair would still get wet at the temple or crown.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t get wet like it use to when I would buy</li>
            <li> I wear this cap when I don&#x27;t want to get my hair wet</li>
            <li> Finally, I found a heavy duty shower cap.</li>
            <li> For reference, my hair is nearly waist length and thick.  </li>
            <li> I even feel a little cuter wearing this than a plain or clear one.  </li>
            <li> and it still doesn&#x27;t smell, have mildew, get loose, or any other</li>
            <li> the product was worth, a very poor purchase</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> fits loosely around the face so water often gets it and gets my hair wet, its not as tight as my previous shower caps.</li>
            <li> And even though I washed it cold and with a mild detergent, the color came of (and on all my clothes).</li>
            <li> I have found large shower caps difficult to find in brick and mortar stores-</li>
            <li> by now those cheapy ones would start breaking down.</li>
            <li> It runs down my face sometimes.</li>
            <li> I try to wipe it down after each use, but sometimes forget.  </li>
            <li> After about a week, the elastic started ripping so there&#x27;s always a piece hanging down.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when I take it off after my shower sometimes I am left with some blue-ish color left on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> However, I can tell this will last me at least a few months, if not</li>
            <li> Like the previous Betty Dain shower caps, the \\&quot;Hippie</li>
            <li> I have had it for about half a year now</li>
            <li> Thinner than I expected, and I&#x27;m not sure if the elastic will hold up.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair, and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s prefect for my long thick hair.</li>
            <li> If you have thick, long hair</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, curly hair</li>
            <li> the headband is tight too.</li>
            <li> I got this for someone who has very long, thick hair</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair dry well in a small shower!</li>
            <li> Also, I think it makes me look tough to because everyone tends to back off when they see me coming.</li>
            <li> It did not fit my wife&#x27;s head and was not made all that well.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Hippie Chick\\&quot; version is no better than average.</li>
            <li> but it was not comfortable</li>
            <li> Yes, my design has faded just a bit after a few months of use.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now).  </li>
            <li> Shower caps are always a nightmare because they never fit and</li>
            <li> Basically, I have long, curly very thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long and very thick hair.</li>
            <li> The bad news, it only took 2 days for the entire design to begin to run off in the shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 2 weeks now, so I&#x27;m placing an order for my usual spa sister cap today and will throw these out.</li>
            <li> Kinda small on my head.</li>
            <li> My head is small</li>
            <li> I can see how it may not fit some people, it is a little tight, but it&#x27;s not too uncomfortable for me.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t tell unless you look for it, so I am not at all disappointed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Prior Betty Dain shower caps had at least two rows of elastic stitching that kept the caps from leaking.  </li>
            <li> I have thick medium length hair and it all fits well in this cap, no problem.</li>
            <li> The material isn&#x27;t as thick as I would like.</li>
            <li> It is made of a thick plastic material all around with elastic at the bottom.</li>
            <li> The elastic is thick and sturdy and fits snugly around my head.</li>
            <li> Ridiculously small to be called XL!</li>
            <li> This one covers my very thick hair, even in a messy bun!</li>
            <li> Can get less expensive.</li>
            <li> This shower cap was not a good purchase.  </li>
            <li> plastic is too stiff, uncomfortable cap</li>
            <li> It smeared, and was very messy and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin but will do the job.</li>
            <li> The stitching is poor quality so unless you know how to sew and like to fix things I would NOT buy this product.</li>
            <li> The plastic is thin.  </li>
            <li> There was no lining, which made it difficult to get on her head.</li>
            <li> For the price, I was not impressed.  </li>
            <li> Not a huge problem but annoying.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I had to toss it out.</li>
            <li> the elastic is always questionable-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a disgusting wet laundry smell.  </li>
            <li> How crazy is that?</li>
            <li> and it still smells so bad.</li>
            <li> Ugly design though.</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst shower caps I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> Terrible materials and the design rubs off.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It definitely takes a week or so to break in this cap, during which those points sticking out from the elastic are gonna feel stabby and irritating, but as the cap loosens up, it&#x27;ll get better. I have noticed some of the decorative design wearing off in a few places, but I haven&#x27;t seen where that paint is actually transferring off to. I like this cap because it&#x27;s big enough that I can have my hair in a bun and still wear bluetooth headphones under the cap comfortably, and when I&#x27;m coming home and showering at 1 in the morning, I wear this cap (actually, I bought a second cap just to leave there) and those headphones so as to not wake anyone up.</li>
            <li> Nice, cute, fun, and certainly functional.</li>
            <li> Nice cap but not big enough, looks bigger than it really is.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for more than 6months now... it is strong and big enough if your whole hair is braided</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous shower caps and they never fully cover my locs. This cap does and I don&#x27;t have to worry about taking it off and finding the back of my hair damp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shower cap.  It does what it&#x27;s intended purpose is, which is to guard my hair in the shower if i don&#x27;t want to wet it.  Unfortunately, when I take it off after my shower sometimes I am left with some blue-ish color left on my forehead.  It easily comes off, but it kind of freaks me out knowing that the color is leaking onto my head.  I hoped it would stop bleeding onto me, but it still does leave some color still.</li>
            <li> My kids have a head full of hair and this works perfectly. It would work for adults too.</li>
            <li> This is an extra large shower cap that can fit a lot of hair in it.  It will definitely protect your hairdo for whatever reason you need protecting.  I do vintage hairstyles and hide them up in a shower cap and shower between moments in my day.  And sometimes it&#x27;s just that my hair is not in need of washing and I&#x27;m so not in the mood to get it wet and re-dry it all over again.  But it&#x27;s a good fit, there&#x27;s plenty of room.  It&#x27;s really cute.  Hang it up, it dries super, crazy fast.</li>
            <li> Big enough for almost any amount of hair!  If you&#x27;re tired of your hair getting wet with normal shower caps, look no further than this product!  Love it -- thanks!</li>
            <li> Fits all right. It is not too thin so doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. I love the quirky colors :)&lt;br /&gt;Great for the price!&lt;br /&gt;Have only used it for 15 days so I cannot comment on it&#x27;s longevity.</li>
            <li> This shower cap bleeds the ink on it when wet. Stained sink.</li>
            <li> I plan to use this shower cap for travel. It&#x27;s thin but will do the job.</li>
            <li> Pattern wears quickly</li>
            <li> This is a nice shower cap and works and feels much better than those inexpensive ones. The elastic is still strong after many uses, so no water gets in.</li>
            <li> big enough to cover my afro.</li>
            <li> I can see how it may not fit some people, it is a little tight, but it&#x27;s not too uncomfortable for me. It&#x27;s a decent shower cap that will hopefully last me a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Works just like you&#x27;d expect lol :)  Only issue is that the color comes off.  Minor annoyance considering I don&#x27;t really care what it looks like when I&#x27;m wearing it :)  Much larger than cheapie shower caps and holds all my hair very well.</li>
            <li> A good shower cap is hard to find, and I think I found one.  The vinyl is not stiff, it does not smell when you get it wet, and the elastic is nice and snug so water will not get your hairline wet.  I would recommend this cap.</li>
            <li> Covers lots of hair which sometimes isn&#x27;t always covered by traditional shower caps which are a little smaller three more words</li>
            <li> This Betty Dain shower cap is the cat&#x27;s meow! I look so cute in it when I step to take my showers. It is also very effective, it stays on and keeps my hair dry. I have had it a couple of months and it is in great shape, by now those cheapy ones would start breaking down. This is excellent quality and very well priced.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife. She loves it. She says it&#x27;s, \\&quot;cute\\&quot; and she likes the plastic it&#x27;s made of. She likes the elastic band and how it feels. And she likes how much room there is for her hair. Basically, she likes it a lot.</li>
            <li> I have been on the hunt for a great shower cap for a few years now. My favorite one was actually from the dollar store--terrycloth lined and everything. Since I haven&#x27;t been able to find one since, I&#x27;ve turned to the internet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve searched high and low. I even considered dropping $30 + shipping for a fancy one I found online. But this one looked cute and the price was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros: Again, impossibly cute design.  Fun for the shower! I have thick medium length hair and it all fits well in this cap, no problem. The elastic is a comfy fit around my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons: The material isn&#x27;t as thick as I would like. Granted, I know this isn&#x27;t a pricey shower cap, but I still expected a higher gauge vinyl.  However, I can tell this will last me at least a few months, if not a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I will probably be back to buy another!</li>
            <li> Bought a couple of these for my girlfriend and it works for her.  The material is nice, and the elastic seems like it will last.</li>
            <li> I have a big head and lots of hair, so I&#x27;m used to using multiple shower caps to do the job, but this one is big enough all by itself.  So far the elastic is strong and it has no odor.</li>
            <li> I guess there&#x27;s no way around this, but I turn my cap inside out - put it outside to dry, etc. and it still smells so bad. The cap works well..but I suggest buying two and interchanging them.</li>
            <li> I have very long and very thick hair. This cap fits me perfectly and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> comes in a really cute package.  Best shower cap I have ever bought.  I have really long hair and it all fits in there.  Its also snug enough on my head but not too tight so I dont end up with indents on my forehead.  The plastic is not very thick compared to others I have had but I have had no problems and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I love the flower pattern of this shower cap. it&#x27;s soft and nice elastic.  This one is big enough to fit over my head comfortably.</li>
            <li> I have used throw away hotel plastic caps for longer than this one held up!  The stitching is poor quality so unless you know how to sew and like to fix things I would NOT buy this product.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly-I have a big ol&#x27; noggin and lots of hair-and this showercap kept everything inside the cap with a nice seal and also didn&#x27;t become stinky after using it several times.</li>
            <li> Good size but not big enough for longer locs</li>
            <li> Finally I can take a shower without getting my hair wet! Very good quality ...</li>
            <li> i got this as a gift for my niece, she has a LOT of hair and she said it worked fine for her.</li>
            <li> The  cap fits well.  The elastic is snug and has kept its shape.  All my hair fits easily in the cap.</li>
            <li> Product not what was stated. It did not fit my wife&#x27;s head and was not made all that well. There was no lining, which made it difficult to get on her head. we did not send it back because it would have cost more the product was worth, a very poor purchase</li>
            <li> Nice and big! Great for thick long hair that doesn&#x27;t stay up on any other shower cap</li>
            <li> This shower cap is sturdy and fun.  It keeps my hair mostly dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad to have a sturdier one than the hotel disposable versions.</li>
            <li> Its huge! Makes me look like the Swedish chef! Also has a fringe that bothers my ears when I wear it. I do not like but I see why people with huge hair would.</li>
            <li> This retro shower cap will be a great stocking stuffer this year!  Funky and fun!  The quality seems to be good for the price paid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that it doesn&#x27;t smell, and it fits well.  I couldn&#x27;t find anything comparable at any major store such as Target, Bed, Bath and Beyond, Kohl&#x27;s or Walmart.  I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> This product is very cheaply made.  The plastic is thin.  For the price, I was not impressed.  You&#x27;re better off going to the drug store and buying a pack of Goody shower caps.  The only think I like about this product is the colorful design.  Other than that, it&#x27;s a bust.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair dry and I love the fun, bright colors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I need another one I will order from you again for sure!</li>
            <li> I like big hair and I can not lie. Basically, I have long, curly very thick hair. This is one of the only shower caps that I can wear my hair in any style and it will fit. This also fits tightly, but not too tightly around the scalp and would be decent for doing conditioning treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to laugh at the &amp;#34;hipster&amp;#34; in the name, but it does its job. I might pick up a second style just for oil or conditioning treatments&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not noticed the print smudging, but I will update this review accordingly if it does.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing Betty Dain shower caps for several years and, when it was time to replace the last purchase, chose to buy Betty Dain&#x27;s \\&quot;Hippie Chick\\&quot; version.  Like the previous Betty Dain shower caps, the \\&quot;Hippie Chick\\&quot; is made of a sturdy plastic, is colorful, and is large enough to cover shoulder-length hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior Betty Dain shower caps had at least two rows of elastic stitching that kept the caps from leaking.  They are usually \\&quot;leak-proof\\&quot; for a year and then work reasonably well as a travel shower cap for another year.  The \\&quot;Hippie Chick\\&quot; version I received had only one row of elastic stitching and, if I am not careful and bend over, allows water to enter the back of the shower cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result of the decline in construction quality, I will probably be looking for another shower cap soon.  The \\&quot;Hippie Chick\\&quot; version is no better than average.</li>
            <li> totally works,  I have found large shower caps difficult to find in brick and mortar stores- this one is the right size.  I only regret I didn&#x27;t order two at the same time.</li>
            <li> Ridiculously small to be called XL!</li>
            <li> This shower cap was not a good purchase.  It is not big enough, especially for ladies with long hair (even for shoulder length hair).  Secondly, it really starts to smell.  It&#x27;s a disgusting wet laundry smell.  I even washed it with soap, but the smell lingers.  I ended up throwing it in the trash after a couple uses.</li>
            <li> I have LOTS of hair. Covers it we&#x27;ll.  I just wish the lip that covers the exterior was a little wider as it easily flips under.</li>
            <li> I love this line because of the size.  I sometime roll my hair and these shower caps accommodate nicely.  fun colors</li>
            <li> I like the tight fit on your head so your hair stays dry in the back.  It is a single plastic sheet with no inside liner.  It keeps my hair dry and easily folded for travel therefore I give it five stars.</li>
            <li> I would not consider this shower cap to be large by any stretch of the imagination. I have short hair (above the collar), but I wanted a large shower cap so that my hair wouldn&#x27;t be smashed when taking a shower. This shower cap not only smashes my hair, it is uncomfortably tight and very scratchy around my face. I used it once and it has been in the drawer ever since.</li>
            <li> It is not the texture I expected.  I thought it would be softer to the touch.  But it is brittle.  It does the job, though.</li>
            <li> As promised it fit well and kept the water out.</li>
            <li> This designer shower cap does exactly what is supposed to, keeps my hair dry during a shower. I&#x27;ve had it a couple weeks and it hasn&#x27;t stretched out.</li>
            <li> This is nice for us natural chicks who have small afros. i used it for my 20 inch marley twist. It helped but I would have preferred bigger</li>
            <li> This is a first to actually own a shower cap and this cap fits well.  I have long hair and the cap will accept all and securely.  So I would definitely recommend this product,</li>
            <li> How many times have I tried to squeeze my long hair into disposable hotel shower caps? Finally I decided to buy a nice one and so glad I did. Tight fit around my head keeps my long hair dry with no problems. I&#x27;ve had it for about 6 months, no wear and tear yet.</li>
            <li> As expected, big enough to cover everything,</li>
            <li> My mom loves this. It is big enough. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> This is not a  long term shower cap. It has already faded just from wearing in the shower. I only washed it by hand once and it started to fade. Also the string sewn in to hold the band in is unraveling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all!  This one covers my very thick hair, even in a messy bun! Doesn&#x27;t let any water in as it&#x27;s pretty tight around the scalp. It&#x27;s nice and big! So far held up well after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> plastic is too stiff, uncomfortable cap</li>
            <li> This shower cap it pretty and all but it hurts to wear. Maybe I just have a big head but it was not comfortable and I would not want to wear it for very long.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 4star because I have not had it long enough to see had it stands up after multiple uses.&lt;br /&gt;I have shoulder length hair and use purple and grey size rollers and it fits perfectly over them.</li>
            <li> This shower cap leaves blue ink wherever It touches the skin around my hairline. It runs down my face sometimes. It&#x27;s been 2 weeks now, so I&#x27;m placing an order for my usual spa sister cap today and will throw these out. It&#x27;s not lined either. You get what you pay for, I should have known better.</li>
            <li> A bit too big for me but it works great, water resistant, and seals great around the hairline. Probably good for someone with a ton of hair. I still like it a lot and it has a cute color.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair completely dry (if I cover my ears along with the rest of my hair)! Also, it&#x27;s very spacious, which is a great bonus for those with long or/and thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;I used to use disposable shower caps, but my hair would still get wet at the temple or crown. This helps me keep my hair straight for a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third, as they don&#x27;t hold up too long (maybe 6 months?), but they&#x27;re still the best out there that I&#x27;ve been able to find. I have long, thick hair, and these shower caps keep it dry in the shower.</li>
            <li> Can get less expensive.</li>
            <li> Nice fit good quality</li>
            <li> I wear it everywhere so nobody knows that I am bald. Also, I think it makes me look tough to because everyone tends to back off when they see me coming. It matches my 3 Wolves T-Shirt perfectly.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mother. She seems to like it and said it hasn&#x27;t leaked yet, so she is happy with it so far. Ugly design though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered two of these and they both work great.  Have had the first one for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I have waist length dread locks and it was large enough to cover them but not enough elastic in to keep in on my head. It also developed a mildew smell after a month even though I store it open in a dry place.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s large &amp; would be able to fit a lot of hair. it will cover everything. the headband is tight too.</li>
            <li> Product quality is good but the elastic is too tight.  Kinda small on my head. I had also purchased the fashionista collection and fits perfect!</li>
            <li> This shower cap is perfect in every way.  I was hesitant to spend so much but I just love it.  I use it every day atleast 5 days a week and it does not smell or get moldy.  I try to wipe it down after each use, but sometimes forget.  I still hang it to dry.  love it, love the durable material, the size is big, so long hair wont have a problem.  Love it</li>
            <li> This replaced, what I realize now was an inferior shower cap. This is what a shower cap should be.   I have very thick, long hair. My hair would always find a way to fall out of my old cap. This one holds it in no matter what! Very tight but comfortable fit.</li>
            <li> This shower cap does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Love it... big enough to cover my back-length big curly hair if piled up on my head.  Cute design.  Translucent vinyl with fabric elastic sewn on the outside.</li>
            <li> Plenty of room and it does keep the water out.</li>
            <li> fits loosely around the face so water often gets it and gets my hair wet, its not as tight as my previous shower caps.</li>
            <li> Nice thick band that keeps all the water out and feels perfect on your head.  I loved the pattern, as it is easy to find where ever I dropped by accident or on purpose.  I will buy another when the need occurs.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I have had it for almost a year now.&lt;br /&gt;though the colour is now faded, it has not gone slack beyond usefulness.&lt;br /&gt;I love it and will recommend it.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a couple of weeks now, and my hair thanks me every day. The elastic is great, so far no problems. My hair stays dry in the shower. Enough space for long hair, my hair is pretty long and fits in it without a problem.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> The design comes off or rubs off on the shower wall. Not a huge problem but annoying. I wouldn&#x27;t buy another.</li>
            <li> This shower cap stays on my head and keeps my hair dry.  The elastic is slightly more tight than I would like, but my head is a little bigger than average, so I can&#x27;t really call it a flaw.</li>
            <li> The item arrived and appeared as it is pictured online. It is a large size cap so I can easily fit all of my hair underneath it. It is much nicer than trying to deal with one time use shower caps and is comparably priced to the ones I have seen in stores. I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable. I have usted just once. I wouldn&#x27;t know for sure how long  Would this last?</li>
            <li> I needed a shower cap that was a little more heavy duty than the ones you pick up at the dollar store.  I really didn&#x27;t care about the styling (because c&#x27;mon, it&#x27;s something you wear in the SHOWER).  I have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s long, and this cap more than adequately covers my hair and my hair line without me feeling like I have to constantly shift it to cover whatever side of me is facing the shower head.  The elastic doesn&#x27;t leave a mark on my head, and the plastic is heavier than I expected but is still nice and flexible.  Would recommend it in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> Love this item. I have both the terry lined and this one and I can&#x27;t say I notice much of a difference in performance. Most important, my hair stays dry and I don&#x27;t feel frumpy wearing it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst shower caps I&#x27;ve ever had.  After about a week, the elastic started ripping so there&#x27;s always a piece hanging down.  I cut it, but it just continues to run.  Also, the ink that makes up the pattern rubs off onto everything.  I&#x27;m going to find a replacement right away.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item last year, so it could fit around the braids I had in at the time. It&#x27;s great and it&#x27;s cute! Simple enough! I still use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s prefect for my long thick hair. My hair doesn&#x27;t get wet like it use to when I would buy grocery store &amp;#34;one size fits all&amp;#34; shower cap.</li>
            <li> Yes, my design has faded just a bit after a few months of use.  You really can&#x27;t tell unless you look for it, so I am not at all disappointed.  I don&#x27;t expect to have the cap forever.  This is so much better than anything I&#x27;ve ever bought at the drug store.  I even feel a little cuter wearing this than a plain or clear one.  For reference, my hair is nearly waist length and thick.  I always roll my hair up into a quick bun for cap use.  No problems with the fit at all, it&#x27;s snug in the elastic and roomy elsewhere.  It is made of a thick plastic material all around with elastic at the bottom. Nothing fancy there, but the design and pattern make it chic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I can&#x27;t wait to have another Amazon order because I want to get one for my mother and sister, plus a back up one for myself. My cap is still going strong, no more fading just fun wearing it. I&#x27;m not embarrassed when my guy sees me in my shower cap anymore.</li>
            <li> Cute is not the issue here, but functionality. And it is indeed functional. It has a secure fit and the construction is sturdy. I&#x27;ve been using mine for over 10 months and it fits as well now as it did the day I received it.</li>
            <li> Best shower cap ever!  Roomy enough for long thick hair and the band is comfortable.</li>
            <li> Great shower cap, fits nice, good quality (not thin and cheap).</li>
            <li> This was a nicely made cap, with a pretty design, plus it covers the hair well, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> If you have thick, long hair then this is the shower cap for you! I sometimes wear this to bed with my leave in conditioner. My hair actually fits in the shower cap with some extra space!</li>
            <li> 5 months later, wife still thanks me....got this for her based on reviews (thanks amazon &amp;#34;community&amp;#34;), and she&#x27;s very pleased with ample room for hair, proper elasticity to keep hair dry...no ink coming off as mentioned in one review</li>
            <li> I take a shower every morning, but I only wash my hair every other day. I wear this cap when I don&#x27;t want to get my hair wet and it works perfectly. I have had it for about half a year now and it still doesn&#x27;t smell, have mildew, get loose, or any other problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t give it the full 5 stars because it left small bluish stains on my temples during the first couple times I used it. However, they were easy to wash off with some water and soon enough they stopped altogether.</li>
            <li> This has a good band and is nice and big so I can wear it with large clips holding my hair up. I also like the thickness, nice quality.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair dry well in a small shower!</li>
            <li> I have super thick, long hair and this shower cap fits all of it with room to spare! Worth the price!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this shower cap and the flower power design shower cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: it doesn&#x27;t smell like vinyl when you take it out of the box; you can fit lots of hair in it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: it doesn&#x27;t do a great job of keeping your hair dry (your hair gets wet on the edges); the ink comes off! (after a while, it rubs off and the design gets smudged. I&#x27;ve even had it come off on the shower wall but you can wipe it right off).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: for this price, you can probably do better.</li>
            <li> Shower cap does its job - keeps water out, has plenty of room for hair, is cute, and so far hasn&#x27;t smelled funny. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have no qualms with this shower cap, which I&#x27;ve been using for several months. The elastic is thick and sturdy and fits snugly around my head. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too tight, and it&#x27;s definitely not too loose. The cap seems quite durable and is not a flimsy material. No mold yet! No complaints.</li>
            <li> I love this shower cap! Well made. Very roomy! I will be buying more in the future. Well worth the money! I have a hard time finding these big ones that don&#x27;t tear easily. Was happy to find this on-line!</li>
            <li> It ripped on third use.  Don&#x27;t know how, I reached for it and the thread was ripping on the elastic band.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it.  Nobody is going to look cool and hip in a shower cap, but really, who are you trying to impress?  This is a large cap, much better made than a disposable hotel shower cap and it covers your hair.  That&#x27;s what I wanted it to do and that&#x27;s what it does.</li>
            <li> Thinner than I expected, and I&#x27;m not sure if the elastic will hold up. If it does hold up, I will buy another. It is large enough for my medium length hair.</li>
            <li> Finally, I found a heavy duty shower cap. I would highly recommend this item if you have been looking for a sturdy cap. I like the pattern too, it was exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter. She loves it.  We laugh when she puts it on, but it works.  A thicker material, that won&#x27;t rip apart quickly or easily.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Fits great and not cheap material.</li>
            <li> Well, the good news It kept the hair dry and fit like a medium sized cap. The bad news, it only took 2 days for the entire design to begin to run off in the shower. It smeared, and was very messy and uncomfortable. Needless to say, I had to toss it out. I could never recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Hahahaa.. Well, kinda stylish...?  My girlfriend likes this because it keeps her hair dry so she can go to sleep after showering with dry hair.  It does its job.  End of story.</li>
            <li> Finally a shower cap that fits my big hair! I also liked the funky retro pattern and colors. Solidly crafted as well.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and this does the job of keeping my hair dry.</li>
            <li> What I do like about this shower cap is that it&#x27;s large enough to hold all my hair (and I have quite a bit). I like that the elastic is a bit tight at first; it does loosen up over time, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do not like at all is the fact the ink on a SHOWER cap is not waterproof! How crazy is that? The ink all came off and now I&#x27;m left with a cap that&#x27;s pretty much just white. Yes, the ink does come right off the wall but that&#x27;s really beside the point. The pattern on a shower cap should also be waterproof.</li>
            <li> These are the only types of shower caps that are large enough and tight enough to fit my hair! Sometimes I cannot find them in stores and so was thrilled when I found Amazon had them. Super cute (a.k.a not &#x27;mom&#x27; looking) and keeps the water out! A must have if you have long, thick or natural hair.</li>
            <li> large enough to fit my hair when it&#x27;s up in a bun--which you&#x27;d think would be obvious but nope</li>
            <li> I got this for someone who has very long, thick hair and it all fits under it just fine! Has not split or cracked yet, so it seems to be performing well. :)</li>
            <li> Nice and roomy for longer hair...and super cute, too!</li>
            <li> This is a bouffant style shower cap which is great for people with long hair, hair fits in it comfortably.  The shower cap opening fits snuggly but not too tight and really does keep your hair dry.  So anyone that wants to keep their hair dry when taking a shower or bath, no matter how long your hair is, it a good cap to get!</li>
            <li> As far as shower caps go it&#x27;s good quality. Thicker vinyl than the ones I&#x27;ve found in stores like walmart or target. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and feel it was worth the money I spent on it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s surprising how difficult it can be to find a good shower cap.  Sometimes, I wear a scarf or rollers or hair clips in my hair to try to maintain my hairstyle while in the shower.  So I needed a shower cap that could keep my hair dry in the shower.  You&#x27;d think that would be easy to find but it hasn&#x27;t been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally don&#x27;t like shower caps with a fabric liner because I find the fabric wicks up water at the edges, which brings it in close proximity to my hair and makes it wet, which defeats the purpose of the shower cap in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shower cap I like because it is inexpensive and it will fit over my rollers etc and does not have a fabric liner.  So far it has held up well (I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now).  I&#x27;m going to order a couple more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it were a bit larger I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.  If you have a larger head or larger rollers, it may not fit well.  My head is small so it works well for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this cap beacuse it said mold resistant. It is NOT. Even though I hang it up to dry immerdiately after every use, there was already so much mold on it (and kind of smelly), that I decided to wash it after 2 months. And even though I washed it cold and with a mild detergent, the color came of (and on all my clothes). Now I have a mainly blank cap that still smells.&lt;br /&gt;Would have been OK if it lastet longer, but for only 2 months I think this is too expensive for this quality.</li>
            <li> The size is nice but the design eventually comes off.</li>
            <li> It is really a big one. I like it very much!</li>
            <li> Hard to find these very large size shower caps.  They last a very long time.</li>
            <li> It works great, but makes my forehead itch.</li>
            <li> I have a huge head and lots of hair. Shower caps are always a nightmare because they never fit and the elastic is always questionable- will it be tight enough to really keep everything in place and the water out? This one is GREAT!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty solid shower cap. It kept my hair line dry and I totally had my head under the shower. I would recommend this product to folks. It&#x27;s priced reasonably and the quality is very good. I have used the cap more than 10 times and still give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Use daily.  Product arrived in timely manner and is just as described.</li>
            <li> Great fit and durable!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought 3 of these now.  They&#x27;re great.  I bought 1 as a gift, 1 for my daughter for when I put her hair in curlers, and 1 for myself.  I have long, thick, curly hair and it was hard to find a good shower cap to keep the water and moister out when I showered.  I straighten and then curl my hair, so I need to have that last for several days as it takes forever to straighten.  This works great!  It&#x27;s large enough to hold all of my hair, even when I through it in curlers.</li>
            <li> I had searched for terry lined shower caps and this item came up.  Unfortunately, it is NOT terry lined as I had thought.  It is also fairly loose on my head.. works ok.. but not really what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend likes it... keeps her head dry.  Does what it&#x27;s intended to do.  I&#x27;d get one myself but my hair is a tad too short to bother!</li>
            <li> What a waist of money.  Terrible materials and the design rubs off.</li>
