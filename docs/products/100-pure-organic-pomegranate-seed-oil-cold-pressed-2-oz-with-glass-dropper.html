            <li>Perfect.  </li>
            <li>This oil was absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li>Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Impressed!</li>
            <li>Really wonderful oil!</li>
            <li>Great product great price!</li>
            <li>Incredible quality.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great under moisturizing eye &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; or around the mouth...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for the skin, and combined with EO&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Great quality, great feel.</li>
            <li>Great service.</li>
            <li>Pomegranate seed oil is great stuff for the skin.  </li>
            <li>Good quality oil, no smell for making face serum which is great.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a pleasant scent, but there was nothing.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no smell to it (versus the pleasantly nutty smell of the oil I&#x27;m used to)</li>
            <li>Good service as well.</li>
            <li>I purchased from Dr Adorable Inc, and I&#x27;m really happy with both the product, the price and the seller.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Will be putting in many preparations and using neat as well!</li>
            <li>smells amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells nice</li>
            <li>Honestly, it seems like this is just mineral oil.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and excellent quality oils.</li>
            <li>SO LIGHT!  :-)  </li>
            <li>Oh my gosh this oil is fabulous!</li>
            <li>But the place I was getting it from wasn&#x27;t the most convenient for me to order from</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using pomegranate seed oil for a few months now for my super-dry face and it works wonderfully - it gives me a nice glow each morning and helps things look smoother.</li>
            <li>And a great carrier oil to use in formulas to apply essential oils to face, neck and chest where heavier oils are just too much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pure</li>
            <li>Smooth on my face after cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Great seller and hoping to purchase again in the future!</li>
            <li>I have found the pomegranate seed oil is best for my skin, as it&#x27;s not too heavy</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t even sure at first if it was oil at all.</li>
            <li>(I think rosehip seed oil or avocado oil might be better for older skin as my mother likes to use them), but still really clean and moisturizing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this after toner and before my night cream or sunscreen, and - though it seems counterintuitive - it helps keep my skin from looking super shiny and oily when I wake up in the morning or throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>arravied very hot.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly leaving the skin soft smooth and supple!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found a new (decently convenient) supplier for the kind of oil I&#x27;m used to</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth purchasing if you having any skin problems.</li>
            <li>, there&#x27;s no color (instead of a nice yellow), and it seems a bit thinner/runnier.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(For comparison, I&#x27;ve included a picture showing the kind of pomegranate seed oil I&#x27;m used to (on the left) versus the one sold here (on the right).</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s the right amont of oily.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li>I will continue to have business with that company and will recommend it to all interested in highest purity oils.</li>
            <li>I am really impressed with this oil, and a little bit really does go a long way.  </li>
            <li>reference, I am in the 18-24 age range, and have combination skin (more on the dry side).  </li>
            <li>This is very high quality.</li>
            <li>use pomegranate oil every day and night, and it has really helped my skin stay acne free and moisturized, especially during the winters.  </li>
            <li>Really like.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t moisturize as deeply as most other oils, lotions or cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product; goes well with my other butters &amp; oils for facial moisturizes and body butters etc.</li>
            <li>seller shipped this very promptly, and I have/would definitely repurchase when I run out.</li>
            <li>While it looks like there is no oil in the little bowl on the right, it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, but difficult to differentiate its effectiveness since I use it with other oils.</li>

            <li> SO LIGHT!  :-)  It&#x27;s a great under moisturizing eye &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; or around the mouth...And a great carrier oil to use in formulas to apply essential oils to face, neck and chest where heavier oils are just too much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pure organic, cold pressed oil in a generous 2 ounce bottle!  It&#x27;s not extended with any cheaper oils either!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on my grandson&#x27;s rash that is on his face.  It seems to be helping quite a bit.  It&#x27;s worth purchasing if you having any skin problems.</li>
            <li> Really like.  Smooth on my face after cleaning.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great product great price!</li>
            <li> I use this as a part of my beauty routine.  It&#x27;s good, but difficult to differentiate its effectiveness since I use it with other oils.</li>
            <li> Incredible quality.  Great seller and hoping to purchase again in the future!</li>

            <li> No where in the description did I see that it was unscented. I was expecting a pleasant scent, but there was nothing. I wasn&#x27;t even sure at first if it was oil at all.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh this oil is fabulous! It absorbs quickly leaving the skin soft smooth and supple! Will be putting in many preparations and using neat as well!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells nice but I have to admit that I don&#x27;t feel moisturized for long. It doesn&#x27;t moisturize as deeply as most other oils, lotions or cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> Perfect.  Great quality, great feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using pomegranate seed oil for a few months now for my super-dry face and it works wonderfully - it gives me a nice glow each morning and helps things look smoother. But the place I was getting it from wasn&#x27;t the most convenient for me to order from so I tried Amazon (since I have Prime) and decided to try this. It was organic and cold pressed, just like what I had been using, so I thought it&#x27;d be basically the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No. Not at all. It&#x27;s so different that I question whether this is actually pomegranate seed oil. There&#x27;s no smell to it (versus the pleasantly nutty smell of the oil I&#x27;m used to), there&#x27;s no color (instead of a nice yellow), and it seems a bit thinner/runnier. Honestly, it seems like this is just mineral oil. Yes, it does moisturize but so does my mineral-oil-based tanning oil. And, like that tanning oil, I&#x27;m not going to use this on my face for fear of breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I have no proof that this is just mineral oil masquerading as a more expensive oil, so I&#x27;ll give this two stars. Instead of &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t like this&amp;#34;, consider that rating an &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t trust this&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve found a new (decently convenient) supplier for the kind of oil I&#x27;m used to and so won&#x27;t be ordering this oil from Amazon again. Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(For comparison, I&#x27;ve included a picture showing the kind of pomegranate seed oil I&#x27;m used to (on the left) versus the one sold here (on the right).

            <li> Highest quality oil. Great service. I will continue to have business with that company and will recommend it to all interested in highest purity oils.</li>
            <li> very fluid. arravied very hot.</li>
            <li> Good quality oil, no smell for making face serum which is great. Good service as well.</li>
            <li> Pomegranate seed oil is great stuff for the skin.  Some oils soak into my dry skin and vanish, but pomegranate leaves a protective shield on the skin that is not greasy. I ordered a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product; goes well with my other butters &amp; oils for facial moisturizes and body butters etc. Shipped promptly and well. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This oil was absolutely wonderful. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Use this to make body lotions and lotion bars. Fast shipping and excellent quality oils. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> smells amazing. And it&#x27;s the right amont of oily. I like to put this on my face at nights. A little drops goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is very high quality.</li>
            <li> Impressed! Used for a multiple remedies.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday with argan oil for my face and my complexion is noticeably brighter. Plus it smells fantastically fruity!</li>
            <li> Really wonderful oil!</li>
            <li> I purchased from Dr Adorable Inc, and I&#x27;m really happy with both the product, the price and the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use pomegranate oil every day and night, and it has really helped my skin stay acne free and moisturized, especially during the winters.

            <li> Like the pomegrante oil!</li>
            <li> This oil had absolutely no scent. Perhaps it was my mistake assuming pomegranate oil would smell as such.</li>
