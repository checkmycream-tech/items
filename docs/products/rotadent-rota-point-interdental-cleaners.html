            <li>I was thrilled to find them here on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommended, but shop around online for a good price.</li>
            <li>My Dentist turned me onto them; and yes, they ARE that good, IMHO.</li>
            <li>they keep your gums in good condition besides getting the residue out from between teeth</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use dental floss so this is a good alternative for me.  </li>

            <li>Keep up the good work!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great picks and nice container box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using these for years, Always get good checkups.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Originally given these by my dentist, I was very happy to find them online.</li>
            <li>Great product shipped quickly!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these for years after a dentist referral, and have been very pleased with them.  </li>
            <li>These picks are perfect and evidently work because the dentist says my gums are in very healthy condition.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I spend $5 or more for a glass of wine at a restaurant and that lasts about 10 minutes!</li>
            <li>Just what the Dentist ordered, I love these things and would continu to buy them again and again and again!</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are effective, durable and pleasant to use, but there is no way I am going to pay the better part of a dollar for a toothpick.</li>
            <li>At .25 cents each, this is a great deal (with free shipping).</li>
            <li>/&gt;it is simply an excellent product at a great price, conveniently located on the shelves of your local AMZN...</li>
            <li>They really are, for me, the best toothpicks.</li>
            <li>I liked them</li>
            <li>They give the gums a gentle massage and are an excellent supplement to flossing and brushing.</li>
            <li>They are most amazing.  </li>
            <li>Flexibility perfect, bendable but not too soft.</li>
            <li>EXCELLENT, FIRST CLASS WAY TO CLEAN YOUR TEETH.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;One more thing.  </li>
            <li>I have bought this product for many years from my dentist.</li>
            <li>I have had better check-ups at the dentist since I&#x27;ve been using them.</li>
            <li>I just love these tooth picks.  </li>
            <li>Since having some implant and crown work I found that food was getting stuck more often.  </li>

            <li>10 times better than any toothpick.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m glad I discovered them here.</li>
            <li>I love these for getting between teeth.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t find a better value than that!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll have healthy gums for life.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t break off like the wood ones and it&#x27;s much better than the floss toothpicks.</li>
            <li>These are so much better than wood.  </li>
            <li>Combined with regular flossing, I&#x27;ve had perfect cleanings / dental checkups since using them.  </li>
            <li>We finally found them and couldn&#x27;t be more happy we did!  </li>
            <li>We ordered the quantity that they had available and now my Father is stocked up as well as me to!</li>
            <li>and he gets better checkups wit these.</li>
            <li>so glad I can pop these in my purse and get food out of my teeth.</li>
            <li>shipping fast and cost was great</li>
            <li>They get better with many uses.  </li>
            <li>Been using these for more than a decade.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;d gone through the supply my dentist gave me and was glad to find them on amazon --</li>
            <li>I was quite pleased to see them on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>My dental hygienist recommended this to me and boy am I glad she did.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Rota-Point toothpicks for many years.</li>
            <li>How many do I have to buy to get a discounted price?</li>
            <li>To me, better than flossing</li>
            <li>Had some many years ago.  </li>
            <li>Found out they are no longer sold in stores and was glad to find them via Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these for years and am so glad to find them again on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Helps stimulate healthy gum area you can not get to with dental floss.</li>
            <li>Better than flossing.</li>
            <li>They never break and I like them better than floss.</li>
            <li>These are so much better, because they can be used with one hand and not two like dental floss.</li>
            <li>and I get more than one use out of them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are better than dental floss for me.</li>
            <li>Very handy if you really need a toothpick.  </li>
            <li>Really love them for help in keeping dental implants clean, and their design works well on all my teeth!</li>
            <li>Cost is higher than they need to be, but they are good.</li>
            <li>These things are both pliable and sturdy so using one for a month or more is easy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Rota-Points for years because they are simply The BEST Inter-Dental Picks available ANYwhere.</li>
            <li>I love these things, works best on my teeth over all the other options.</li>
            <li>THey clean and massage the gum area where it joins the teeth better,  and more easily,  than floss.  </li>
            <li>glad they are atill available.  </li>
            <li>they are more sturdy than the cheap ones you can buy.</li>
            <li>I do like the product, but it was better when my dentist gave it to me at my check up, FREE.</li>
            <li>They easily bend and snap.  </li>
            <li>Use them every day to clean my teeth better than floss which shreds.</li>
            <li>I use these all the time and they are easy to carry with me</li>
            <li>But their greater advantage is they are great for massaging and strengthening your gums while you watch TV, drive, use the computer, or pretty much anywhere you have a free hand while doing something else.</li>
            <li>I have many gaps between my teeth which get full of food.</li>
            <li>I would&#x27;ve given this 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for the cheap case.</li>
            <li>These are great and are not like those wooden telephone pole sticks, which do nothing.</li>
            <li>Love them, and the price is right.</li>
            <li>Do not throw it away after the first use !!  </li>
            <li>My hygienist says now that she can&#x27;t tell if I use floss or not, (hate floss)they clean so well.  </li>
            <li>By far the best way to clean between teeth, short of flossing.  </li>
            <li>Recommended by my dentist to clean the gums area.</li>
            <li>They clean like floss and also give your gums a massage which is important for healthy gums and prevention of bone loss as you get older.  </li>
            <li>These are very durable, and if you keep them in a clean place and wash them off as needed, each one can be used many times over.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, I first got these from my Dentist about ten years ago and have used them ever since.</li>
            <li>A true case of let the buyer beware.&lt;br /&gt;P.S.</li>
            <li>I had an extra box that I had given my Father who loved them, he is 84.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to use with the &amp;#34;square&amp;#34; handle and super fine pointy end and the straight line design.</li>
            <li>Much better product than is found in drug stores and highly recommended by my daughter&#x27;s dentist who gave her a trial supply.</li>
            <li>These work so well to get between teeth and help to keep things clean when you can&#x27;t stop and brush right away.  </li>
            <li>Really  cleans in between the teeth, easy to keep the box in my purse</li>
            <li>Much better than wood toothpicks as they don&#x27;t get soft &amp; fall apart.</li>
            <li>These work great for people who have developed &amp;#34;food traps&amp;#34; and do not like wooden toothpicks.</li>
            <li>These things are perfectly shaped for getting between my teeth, last a long time, and are very reusable.</li>
            <li>She was right.</li>
            <li>used to get these Rotadent Interdental Cleaners free from my dentist but, having quit going to that particular dentist, I knew AMAZON would have them.  </li>
            <li>This product goes a long way and will keep your teeth nice and flossed.</li>
            <li>Love these picks, better than all the other, very durable.</li>
            <li>Far superior to standard toothpicks in terms of cleaning between teeth.</li>
            <li>Seller ships fast and free which is always appreciated.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>They are much better than the wooden toothpicks.</li>
            <li>The first ones I got 4 years ago</li>
            <li>I use to get these free from my old dentist.</li>
            <li>They work better then floss for me as I have larger spaces.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>The receptionist knew exactly what I was talking about and told me the name and where to look.  </li>
            <li>Its exactly what I was looking for for years.</li>
            <li>I should have known to go to Amazon first.  </li>
            <li>In fact, one pick will last for many months (if you don&#x27;t mind reusing them, which I don&#x27;t).  </li>
            <li>Personally I find these better than floss at getting everything out between my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Better than a wooden toothpick that can splinter.  </li>
            <li>First got them from my dentist.</li>
            <li>To my surprise he still had a few left after over 10 years, they are easy to clean and reuse but the rationing of these were amazing.  </li>
            <li>Work much better than floss on my teeth, really get into the deep gum pockets.</li>
            <li>I have used the product for a long time &amp; was glad to find a source.</li>
            <li>Rotadent are strong yet pliable, good for small spaces and bigger gaps.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to use and I especially like the case.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The recommended method of use I was taught is to gently run them along the gum line as well as in between the teeth.</li>
            <li>These worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist is very please.</li>
            <li>I can keep it in my purse or in the car, very convenient.</li>
            <li>absolutely met all my expectations.will order again when needed.</li>
            <li>and they are priced reasonably.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I think the plain old Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks are superior to the Rotadent picks; they are also much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Others I&#x27;ve bought in drugstores are either too soft or not the right size.</li>
            <li>They are better than all of the floss, picks, vibrating toothbrushes and other gizmos combined.  </li>
            <li>Great product for such a small price.</li>
            <li>but they are very versatile, good for bigger spaces and tight spaces.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much better than traditional interdental cleaners or regular toothpicks.  </li>
            <li>These tooth pics are a little bit wide, I prefer the Opalpix brand, they are thinner and more fixable and go easily between the teeth.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The brushpicks, with their little &#x27;brush&#x27; at one end) is better at getting out food stuck between teeth.</li>
            <li>Gets betw teeth easily and the other end is square making it easier to hold.</li>
            <li>I will order more in a few months.</li>
            <li>All of these had major flaws, either to sharp or most are too flimsy and only good for certain spaces and often they would bend or break after one try, especially in tight areas...</li>
            <li>The design makes it easy to get between literally any tooth (large or small).  </li>
            <li>Better than floss, \\&quot;tiny tweeny brushes\\&quot; and all other picks.  </li>
            <li>The Rotadent Rota-Point has a uniquely triangular shape and long narrow tip that fits between teeth to clean out the spaces.  </li>
            <li>I ordered 25 boxes of 30 count directly off the TeethnThings.com site (http://www.teethnthings.com/rotadent-interdental-cleaners-new-30-ct/) for $3.36 per box including shipping.  </li>
            <li>I wash them with baking soda and spray with hydrogen peroxide after each use, and they can be reused dozens of times before the tip starts getting too soft and bent to be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It can still be used after that, but it won&#x27;t go completely through the teeth.</li>
            <li>I am a dental professional and I have found  nothing over the yeats that compares to the rota point for interdental cleaning and tissue massage.</li>
            <li>The dental assistant was surprised when my gums didn&#x27;t bleed when she cleaned my teeth.  </li>
            <li>it as far as I am concerned</li>
            <li>I used to order Pro Picks, but have found (as have many other reviewers) that their product quality has really declined over the past year or so.  </li>
            <li>They can actually be more effective than dental floss for prying out from between the teeth difficult types of food, such as dried fruit, or stringy</li>
            <li>Personally, I cannot live without these.  </li>
            <li>Regular wooden toothpicks don&#x27;t go through the teeth very well, to eliminate food.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They are not available for prime shoppers but shipping has been quick from the seller I used.</li>
            <li>We looked  every where for the exact &amp;#34;picks&amp;#34;, finally visited the same dentist after years of being in a different state and inquired about those picks.  </li>
            <li>To clean them occasionally, use a small jar (like an old medication bottle) and soak them for a day in peroxide.  </li>
            <li>Great toothpick....bad, bad value.</li>
            <li>and apparently they work as well.  </li>
            <li>I have used them for a number of years and they are great, a little on the expensive side, but&lt;br /&gt;worth</li>
            <li>He has a small mouth and his teeth are very tight together, making the use of floss difficult.&lt;br /&gt;These plastic, curved, pointed sticks last through many uses and do the job!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting these ever since I lost my long time dentist, who unexpectedly passed away...</li>
            <li>Love them-only complaint is the price and will look for some that are less pricey.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Highly recommended, but shop around online for a good price.</li>
            <li> My Dentist turned me onto them; and yes, they ARE that good, IMHO.</li>
            <li> they keep your gums in good condition besides getting the residue out from between teeth</li>

            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Originally given these by my dentist, I was very happy to find them online.</li>
            <li> Great product shipped quickly!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years after a dentist referral, and have been very pleased with them.  </li>
            <li> These picks are perfect and evidently work because the dentist says my gums are in very healthy condition.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I spend $5 or more for a glass of wine at a restaurant and that lasts about 10 minutes!</li>
            <li> Just what the Dentist ordered, I love these things and would continu to buy them again and again and again!</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are effective, durable and pleasant to use, but there is no way I am going to pay the better part of a dollar for a toothpick.</li>
            <li> At .25 cents each, this is a great deal (with free shipping).</li>
            <li> /&gt;it is simply an excellent product at a great price, conveniently located on the shelves of your local AMZN...</li>
            <li> They really are, for me, the best toothpicks.</li>
            <li> I liked them</li>
            <li> They give the gums a gentle massage and are an excellent supplement to flossing and brushing.</li>
            <li> They are most amazing.  </li>
            <li> Flexibility perfect, bendable but not too soft.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT, FIRST CLASS WAY TO CLEAN YOUR TEETH.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;One more thing.  </li>
            <li> I have bought this product for many years from my dentist.</li>
            <li> I have had better check-ups at the dentist since I&#x27;ve been using them.</li>
            <li> I just love these tooth picks.  </li>
            <li> Since having some implant and crown work I found that food was getting stuck more often.  </li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 10 times better than any toothpick.</li>
            <li> Love these...</li>
            <li> Just love them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I discovered them here.</li>
            <li> I love these for getting between teeth.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t find a better value than that!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll have healthy gums for life.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t break off like the wood ones and it&#x27;s much better than the floss toothpicks.</li>
            <li> These are so much better than wood.  </li>
            <li> Combined with regular flossing, I&#x27;ve had perfect cleanings / dental checkups since using them.  </li>
            <li> We finally found them and couldn&#x27;t be more happy we did!  </li>
            <li> We ordered the quantity that they had available and now my Father is stocked up as well as me to!</li>
            <li> and he gets better checkups wit these.</li>
            <li> so glad I can pop these in my purse and get food out of my teeth.</li>
            <li> shipping fast and cost was great</li>
            <li> They get better with many uses.  </li>
            <li> Been using these for more than a decade.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;d gone through the supply my dentist gave me and was glad to find them on amazon --</li>
            <li> I was quite pleased to see them on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended this to me and boy am I glad she did.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Rota-Point toothpicks for many years.</li>
            <li> How many do I have to buy to get a discounted price?</li>
            <li> To me, better than flossing</li>
            <li> Had some many years ago.  </li>
            <li> Found out they are no longer sold in stores and was glad to find them via Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years and am so glad to find them again on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Helps stimulate healthy gum area you can not get to with dental floss.</li>
            <li> Better than flossing.</li>
            <li> They never break and I like them better than floss.</li>
            <li> These are so much better, because they can be used with one hand and not two like dental floss.</li>
            <li> and I get more than one use out of them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are better than dental floss for me.</li>
            <li> Very handy if you really need a toothpick.  </li>
            <li> Really love them for help in keeping dental implants clean, and their design works well on all my teeth!</li>
            <li> Cost is higher than they need to be, but they are good.</li>
            <li> These things are both pliable and sturdy so using one for a month or more is easy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rota-Points for years because they are simply The BEST Inter-Dental Picks available ANYwhere.</li>
            <li> I love these things, works best on my teeth over all the other options.</li>
            <li> THey clean and massage the gum area where it joins the teeth better,  and more easily,  than floss.  </li>
            <li> glad they are atill available.  </li>
            <li> they are more sturdy than the cheap ones you can buy.</li>
            <li> I do like the product, but it was better when my dentist gave it to me at my check up, FREE.</li>
            <li> They easily bend and snap.  </li>
            <li> Use them every day to clean my teeth better than floss which shreds.</li>
            <li> I use these all the time and they are easy to carry with me</li>
            <li> But their greater advantage is they are great for massaging and strengthening your gums while you watch TV, drive, use the computer, or pretty much anywhere you have a free hand while doing something else.</li>
            <li> I have many gaps between my teeth which get full of food.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve given this 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for the cheap case.</li>
            <li> These are great and are not like those wooden telephone pole sticks, which do nothing.</li>
            <li> Love them, and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Do not throw it away after the first use !!  </li>
            <li> My hygienist says now that she can&#x27;t tell if I use floss or not, (hate floss)they clean so well.  </li>
            <li> By far the best way to clean between teeth, short of flossing.  </li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist to clean the gums area.</li>
            <li> They clean like floss and also give your gums a massage which is important for healthy gums and prevention of bone loss as you get older.  </li>
            <li> These are very durable, and if you keep them in a clean place and wash them off as needed, each one can be used many times over.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product, I first got these from my Dentist about ten years ago and have used them ever since.</li>
            <li> A true case of let the buyer beware.&lt;br /&gt;P.S.</li>
            <li> I had an extra box that I had given my Father who loved them, he is 84.  </li>
            <li> They are easy to use with the &amp;#34;square&amp;#34; handle and super fine pointy end and the straight line design.</li>
            <li> Much better product than is found in drug stores and highly recommended by my daughter&#x27;s dentist who gave her a trial supply.</li>
            <li> These work so well to get between teeth and help to keep things clean when you can&#x27;t stop and brush right away.  </li>
            <li> Really  cleans in between the teeth, easy to keep the box in my purse</li>
            <li> Much better than wood toothpicks as they don&#x27;t get soft &amp; fall apart.</li>
            <li> These work great for people who have developed &amp;#34;food traps&amp;#34; and do not like wooden toothpicks.</li>
            <li> These things are perfectly shaped for getting between my teeth, last a long time, and are very reusable.</li>
            <li> She was right.</li>
            <li> used to get these Rotadent Interdental Cleaners free from my dentist but, having quit going to that particular dentist, I knew AMAZON would have them.  </li>
            <li> This product goes a long way and will keep your teeth nice and flossed.</li>
            <li> Love these picks, better than all the other, very durable.</li>
            <li> Far superior to standard toothpicks in terms of cleaning between teeth.</li>
            <li> Seller ships fast and free which is always appreciated.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> They are much better than the wooden toothpicks.</li>
            <li> The first ones I got 4 years ago</li>
            <li> I use to get these free from my old dentist.</li>
            <li> They work better then floss for me as I have larger spaces.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The receptionist knew exactly what I was talking about and told me the name and where to look.  </li>
            <li> Its exactly what I was looking for for years.</li>
            <li> I should have known to go to Amazon first.  </li>
            <li> In fact, one pick will last for many months (if you don&#x27;t mind reusing them, which I don&#x27;t).  </li>
            <li> Personally I find these better than floss at getting everything out between my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Better than a wooden toothpick that can splinter.  </li>
            <li> First got them from my dentist.</li>
            <li> To my surprise he still had a few left after over 10 years, they are easy to clean and reuse but the rationing of these were amazing.  </li>
            <li> Work much better than floss on my teeth, really get into the deep gum pockets.</li>
            <li> I have used the product for a long time &amp; was glad to find a source.</li>
            <li> Rotadent are strong yet pliable, good for small spaces and bigger gaps.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re easy to use and I especially like the case.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The recommended method of use I was taught is to gently run them along the gum line as well as in between the teeth.</li>
            <li> These worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist is very please.</li>
            <li> I can keep it in my purse or in the car, very convenient.</li>
            <li> absolutely met all my expectations.will order again when needed.</li>
            <li> and they are priced reasonably.  </li>
            <li> Thank you very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I think the plain old Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks are superior to the Rotadent picks; they are also much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> Others I&#x27;ve bought in drugstores are either too soft or not the right size.</li>
            <li> They are better than all of the floss, picks, vibrating toothbrushes and other gizmos combined.  </li>
            <li> Great product for such a small price.</li>
            <li> but they are very versatile, good for bigger spaces and tight spaces.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much better than traditional interdental cleaners or regular toothpicks.  </li>
            <li> These tooth pics are a little bit wide, I prefer the Opalpix brand, they are thinner and more fixable and go easily between the teeth.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The brushpicks, with their little &#x27;brush&#x27; at one end) is better at getting out food stuck between teeth.</li>
            <li> Gets betw teeth easily and the other end is square making it easier to hold.</li>
            <li> I will order more in a few months.</li>
            <li> All of these had major flaws, either to sharp or most are too flimsy and only good for certain spaces and often they would bend or break after one try, especially in tight areas...</li>
            <li> The design makes it easy to get between literally any tooth (large or small).  </li>
            <li> Better than floss, \\&quot;tiny tweeny brushes\\&quot; and all other picks.  </li>
            <li> The Rotadent Rota-Point has a uniquely triangular shape and long narrow tip that fits between teeth to clean out the spaces.  </li>
            <li> I ordered 25 boxes of 30 count directly off the TeethnThings.com site (http://www.teethnthings.com/rotadent-interdental-cleaners-new-30-ct/) for $3.36 per box including shipping.  </li>
            <li> I wash them with baking soda and spray with hydrogen peroxide after each use, and they can be reused dozens of times before the tip starts getting too soft and bent to be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It can still be used after that, but it won&#x27;t go completely through the teeth.</li>
            <li> I am a dental professional and I have found  nothing over the yeats that compares to the rota point for interdental cleaning and tissue massage.</li>
            <li> The dental assistant was surprised when my gums didn&#x27;t bleed when she cleaned my teeth.  </li>
            <li> it as far as I am concerned</li>
            <li> I used to order Pro Picks, but have found (as have many other reviewers) that their product quality has really declined over the past year or so.  </li>
            <li> They can actually be more effective than dental floss for prying out from between the teeth difficult types of food, such as dried fruit, or stringy</li>
            <li> Personally, I cannot live without these.  </li>
            <li> Regular wooden toothpicks don&#x27;t go through the teeth very well, to eliminate food.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They are not available for prime shoppers but shipping has been quick from the seller I used.</li>
            <li> We looked  every where for the exact &amp;#34;picks&amp;#34;, finally visited the same dentist after years of being in a different state and inquired about those picks.  </li>
            <li> To clean them occasionally, use a small jar (like an old medication bottle) and soak them for a day in peroxide.  </li>
            <li> Great toothpick....bad, bad value.</li>
            <li> and apparently they work as well.  </li>
            <li> I have used them for a number of years and they are great, a little on the expensive side, but&lt;br /&gt;worth</li>
            <li> He has a small mouth and his teeth are very tight together, making the use of floss difficult.&lt;br /&gt;These plastic, curved, pointed sticks last through many uses and do the job!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting these ever since I lost my long time dentist, who unexpectedly passed away...</li>
            <li> Love them-only complaint is the price and will look for some that are less pricey.</li>
            <li> They are just the right size to get hard to remove pieces of food dislodged.</li>
            <li> They are very thin on the end and work as well or better than floss and can be rewashed and reused.</li>
            <li> These last quite a long time and may be used over and over.</li>
            <li> These will last a long time.</li>
            <li> They last a long time too.</li>
            <li> They are hard and are shaped to fit the little triangular space between your teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of soft plastic; narrow at the tip then gradually gets larger.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is you can loose them</li>
            <li> They literally last for years or until you loose them.</li>
            <li> Go to other sites and you can find multiple times the quantity for the same price.  </li>
            <li> These are expensive, but they do not have to be discarded after a single use like a cheap, wooden toothpick.</li>
            <li> One pick lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> work well and each one lasts a long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product gets it all out and lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> It finishes cleaning my teeth where the dental floss failed to clean.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is if you slip and stab your gum with them, That will hurt and possibly make you cry, the point is very sharp!</li>
            <li> One tiny little box...</li>
            <li> even if buying multiple packs of 20 could get a little pricey for plastic picks.</li>
            <li> When I received the order, I found that instead of the packaging I expected, it contained only the little plastic container with 20 piks inside (x4).</li>
            <li> Sounds silly finding complimentary words for a toothpick, but here goes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> wash and reuse a few times and these should last quite awhile.</li>
            <li> A few years ago, our dentist used to give us a box of these following visits.</li>
            <li> Product was not as expected as the toothpicks were flimsy and over priced.</li>
            <li> I might go through one interdental cleaner a month, so I have a supply for several years in this little plastic case, for less than $5.  </li>
            <li> I had some in the past but couldn&#x27;t find them locally.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected!</li>
            <li> NONE OTHER WILL COMPARE.</li>
            <li> Looks expensive but they are NOT expensive.</li>
            <li> They are a little expensive, but compared to the cost of dental work, well worth the ounce of prevention.  </li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t regret it unless you loose them everyday.</li>
            <li> I do not pretend to speak for professionals who recommend other products, but (in my non-dental) capacity as just a user of this product - it has floss, toothpicks, cleaner wrasse and that one girl down the street beat all to heck.</li>
            <li> These are the best.&lt;br /&gt;Sharp thin flexible textured points of nearly indestructible plastic.</li>
            <li> The company had taken the Roto-Point product as it was previously packaged and given out for purchase, and are selling the 120 picks divided into 6.  </li>
            <li> The pick is less flexible....</li>

            <li> This comes out to just a little over 11 cents per pick.  </li>

            <li> i&#x27;d been searching for these nifty little picks</li>
            <li> have tried a few of these things including the Gum Picks,</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been missing these picks since I can no longer get them from my dentist.</li>
            <li> turns out i could have purchased 120 picks from zila for LESS than the 60 i got from dental usa!</li>
            <li> I use one pick for a very long time, until the point becomes weak and I have to trim it.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Thank you.  The perfect product to enhance dental care.</li>
            <li> I have seen others write that these are wonderful, and I am hoping they are.  I used to order Pro Picks, but have found (as have many other reviewers) that their product quality has really declined over the past year or so.  They easily bend and snap.  So, I&#x27;m trying these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing.  I have seen where these cost lots of $$ and I just wanted you to know I ordered 25 boxes of 30 count directly off the TeethnThings.com site (http://www.teethnthings.com/rotadent-interdental-cleaners-new-30-ct/) for $3.36 per box including shipping.  In bulk they were less expensive, and shipping was just $10.  This comes out to just a little over 11 cents per pick.  Just an FYI.</li>
            <li> I read about this type of toothpick years ago in a health newsletter by Dr. David Williams. I have used it ever since. These are expensive, but they do not have to be discarded after a single use like a cheap, wooden toothpick. I wash them with baking soda and spray with hydrogen peroxide after each use, and they can be reused dozens of times before the tip starts getting too soft and bent to be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The recommended method of use I was taught is to gently run them along the gum line as well as in between the teeth. They can actually be more effective than dental floss for prying out from between the teeth difficult types of food, such as dried fruit, or stringy vegetables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended, but shop around online for a good price.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product for many years from my dentist. I paid $5.00 for a package of 120 picks. When I changed dentists, I looked on the internet for the product and found the company offering the product for $8.00. Well I ordered four packages, and didn&#x27;t notice that the product quantity being offered was only 20, not 120.  When I received the order, I found that instead of the packaging I expected, it contained only the little plastic container with 20 piks inside (x4). The company had taken the Roto-Point product as it was previously packaged and given out for purchase, and are selling the 120 picks divided into 6.  I am very unhappy about this and althought I made the mistake of not seeing the reduced quantity, the product is grossly overpriced. A true case of let the buyer beware.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. the Roto-Point interdental cleaners are a very good product - this Company selling them is gouging the consumer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rota-Points for years because they are simply The BEST Inter-Dental Picks available ANYwhere. All other Brands/Types Pale in comparison. My Dentist turned me onto them; and yes, they ARE that good, IMHO.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I first got these from my Dentist about ten years ago and have used them ever since. They stimulate the gums and get all the tiny food particles in between. These last quite a long time and may be used over and over.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  Just like those I got at the dentist office from the dental hygienist.  These are very durable, and if you keep them in a clean place and wash them off as needed, each one can be used many times over.  I might go through one interdental cleaner a month, so I have a supply for several years in this little plastic case, for less than $5.  Far superior to standard toothpicks in terms of cleaning between teeth.</li>
            <li> These are a plastic toothpick. They are much better than the wooden toothpicks. I have had better check-ups at the dentist since I&#x27;ve been using them. They go in a purse or your car for when you are out at a restaurant and you need to get that food particle out from between your teeth. The first ones I got 4 years ago and I was happy to find them again. Great product for such a small price.</li>
            <li> I just love these tooth picks.  I&#x27;ve used them for awhile and keep reordering them.  They&#x27;re perfectly shaped to fit in between my teeth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years after a dentist referral, and have been very pleased with them.  They arrived on time as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for these. They are excellent!  Much better than wood toothpicks as they don&#x27;t get soft &amp; fall apart.</li>
            <li> The Rotadent Rota-Point has a uniquely triangular shape and long narrow tip that fits between teeth to clean out the spaces.  Since having some implant and crown work I found that food was getting stuck more often.  The plastic Rota-Point toothpicks are perfect for cleaning between teeth and you can rinse them off and reuse them.  I find a box can last for several weeks.</li>
            <li> These worked very well for me. I gave them as gifts. I will order more in a few months. You have a great product. thank you. Loreen Carlstedt</li>
            <li> These things are the greatest invention since sliced bread---really! Of course, I use them to pick food particles from my teeth. But their greater advantage is they are great for massaging and strengthening your gums while you watch TV, drive, use the computer, or pretty much anywhere you have a free hand while doing something else. One pick lasts a long time. My dentist says my gums are healthier than he&#x27;s ever seen, and I&#x27;ve been going to him for 38 years!  There are similar products on the market, but they don&#x27;t compare to the Rota-Point.</li>
            <li> Cost is higher than they need to be, but they are good.</li>
            <li> Our dentist gave my sister a supply of these picks to try. She gave me one. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tried to find a supplier and came to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixty cents per molded plastic sliver of a pick after paying ridiculous shipping costs for one ounce of product? You have to be joking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are effective, durable and pleasant to use, but there is no way I am going to pay the better part of a dollar for a toothpick. No way.</li>
            <li> THey clean and massage the gum area where it joins the teeth better,  and more easily,  than floss.  Wear longer.  My dental hygienist is very please.</li>
            <li> The name is the same but the product seems different. The pick is less flexible....Dissapointed :(</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000ET4MTW Rotadent Rota-Point Interdental Cleaners]]&lt;br /&gt;I was introduced to Rotapoint Teeth Cleaners almost 10 years ago.  They are most amazing.  It&#x27;s made of soft plastic; narrow at the tip then gradually gets larger.  The design makes it easy to get between literally any tooth (large or small).  The product comes with a small carrying case so you can keep them in your purse, pant pocket or glove compartment.  10 times better than any toothpick. I keep them with me at all times.</li>
            <li> The best toothpick ever made!  But, there is no way to tell the quantity I was getting with the order.  One tiny little box...The cost per toothpick is obscene.  Go to other sites and you can find multiple times the quantity for the same price.  Great toothpick....bad, bad value.</li>
            <li> great price-  have used these for years  now</li>
            <li> Love these... Just love them</li>
            <li> excellent product, great price. it is so hard to come up with more words, but it has been so unfair to this vendor, I suspect he suffers due to this mandated minimum wage,,, uh, sorry, minimum word count.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is simply an excellent product at a great price, conveniently located on the shelves of your local AMZN... lol</li>
            <li> Sounds silly finding complimentary words for a toothpick, but here goes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to get these Rotadent Interdental Cleaners free from my dentist but, having quit going to that particular dentist, I knew AMAZON would have them.  I ordered 10 boxes and split the order with my friend, who also loves them.  I keep a box in my purse, in my car and several in the kitchen.  They really are, for me, the best toothpicks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these since my dentist started giving them to me 25 years ago.  Flexibility perfect, bendable but not too soft. My hygienist says now that she can&#x27;t tell if I use floss or not, (hate floss)they clean so well.  I can get under my bridge and between even my closest teeth.  I use one for several months, washing them in antibacterial dish soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for the past 20 years. Since they can no longer be purchased from the manufacturer except in bulk or unless you are a dentist I will be purchasing them again and again from Amazon. I&#x27;m glad I discovered them here. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;George Gonzalez</li>
            <li> been using these rota-point picks for over 10 years. they keep your gums in good condition besides getting the residue out from between teeth</li>
            <li> I love these for getting between teeth.  Originally given these by my dentist, I was very happy to find them online.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use dental floss so this is a good alternative for me.  On time delivery.</li>
            <li> Excellent product in all respects.  Much better than traditional interdental cleaners or regular toothpicks.  Also, a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> I had some in the past but couldn&#x27;t find them locally. They&#x27;re easy to use and I especially like the case. I can keep it in my purse or in the car, very convenient.</li>
            <li> I DON&#x27;T see how anyone can complain about the PRICE!!  How is $4.86 too expensive?  Go to any Walgreens and you&#x27;ll be hard pressed to find a pack of dental picks that are any cheaper.  Plus there&#x27;s NO SHIPPING.  These picks last forever.  One pick if you use it every day will last you about a month.  I&#x27;ve gone three years on one box of dental picks.  That&#x27;s a little over a dollar per year.  You can&#x27;t find a better value than that!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use these once a day and you&#x27;ll have healthy gums for life.  They are better than all of the floss, picks, vibrating toothbrushes and other gizmos combined.  My dentist recommended them to me fifteen years ago and I&#x27;ve been using them ever since.</li>
            <li> Ever since my dentist gave me a sample pack, I have used these Rota-Points.  I prefer them over floss and apparently they work as well.  Great product.</li>
            <li> The best toothpick!! It doesn&#x27;t break off like the wood ones and it&#x27;s much better than the floss toothpicks. Fits perfect between your teeth</li>
            <li> Personally, I cannot live without these.  I do not pretend to speak for professionals who recommend other products, but (in my non-dental) capacity as just a user of this product - it has floss, toothpicks, cleaner wrasse and that one girl down the street beat all to heck.</li>
            <li> I think the plain old Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks are superior to the Rotadent picks; they are also much cheaper.  The brushpicks, with their little &#x27;brush&#x27; at one end) is better at getting out food stuck between teeth.</li>
            <li> wash and reuse a few times and these should last quite awhile.</li>
            <li> These are so much better than wood.  Very handy if you really need a toothpick.  Can be cleaned and used again.</li>
            <li> I use to get these free from my old dentist. After moving I could not find them so happy to discover them on Amazon! They are pricey but you can re use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a few of these things including the Gum Picks, Gum Go-Betweens and the worst  for me was the DR&#x27;s Brush picks, I hated those! All of these had major flaws, either to sharp or most are too flimsy and only good for certain spaces and often they would bend or break after one try, especially in tight areas...it is common to go through a bunch of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rotadent are strong yet pliable, good for small spaces and bigger gaps. As I said they can be re used. The only drawback is if you slip and stab your gum with them, That will hurt and possibly make you cry, the point is very sharp! They say you can bend them to get into hard to reach areas, not sure about that but they are very versatile, good for bigger spaces and tight spaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many years ago I had to go to a certain dentist due to insurance and got one of the worst crowns ever...For me these are the best for cleaning that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are not available for prime shoppers but shipping has been quick from the seller I used.</li>
            <li> My hygienist got me to start using these.  By far the best way to clean between teeth, short of flossing.  I use these after almost every meal. Combined with regular flossing, I&#x27;ve had perfect cleanings / dental checkups since using them.  My gums are healthier, breath fresher.  They are a little expensive, but compared to the cost of dental work, well worth the ounce of prevention.  They can be hard to find.  Best to check quantities before buying.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to these by my dentist. They work better then floss for me as I have larger spaces. They clean like floss and also give your gums a massage which is important for healthy gums and prevention of bone loss as you get older.  They are hard and are shaped to fit the little triangular space between your teeth. Others I&#x27;ve bought in drugstores are either too soft or not the right size. These are shaped thinner in the front and gradually thicker in the back as you push them in. Great product.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected!</li>
            <li> My Dentist used to give these Rotadent Cleaners along with the brush and toothpaste at each cleaning, this was over 15 years ago.  They were in a custom logo box with his name printed on it so didn&#x27;t see the brand.  I had an extra box that I had given my Father who loved them, he is 84.  To my surprise he still had a few left after over 10 years, they are easy to clean and reuse but the rationing of these were amazing.  We looked  every where for the exact &amp;#34;picks&amp;#34;, finally visited the same dentist after years of being in a different state and inquired about those picks.  The receptionist knew exactly what I was talking about and told me the name and where to look.  We finally found them and couldn&#x27;t be more happy we did!  We ordered the quantity that they had available and now my Father is stocked up as well as me to!</li>
            <li> Regular wooden toothpicks don&#x27;t go through the teeth very well, to eliminate food.  These Rotadent Rota-Points are excellent for just that.  It&#x27;s like an &amp;#34;itch&amp;#34; you just can&#x27;t reach !!  I have been using them for a few years, ran out, and panicked -- could not find a source to order them from.  So I called the supplier, and they recommended I try &amp;#34;Amazon&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these to anyone.  You use one over and over again.  Do not throw it away after the first use !!  To clean them occasionally, use a small jar (like an old medication bottle) and soak them for a day in peroxide.  I use one pick for a very long time, until the point becomes weak and I have to trim it.  It can still be used after that, but it won&#x27;t go completely through the teeth.</li>
            <li> My dentist used this product as a give away. I liked them so well I found out how to buy them.  I find them durable and immensely preferrable to wood toothpicks.</li>
            <li> Its exactly what I was looking for for years. Use them every day to clean my teeth better than floss which shreds.</li>
            <li> My husband sent me on a search to find these - and he is delighted with them! A dentist in California had given him a similar item, and he had lost track of them.  Couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere - yea Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love these things, works best on my teeth over all the other options. Only thing I didn&#x27;t like wad the shipping, hope they get on the prime soon</li>
            <li> My husbands swears by these.NO more flossing and he gets better checkups wit these. The only thing is you can loose them</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  Seller ships fast and free which is always appreciated.  I had been looing for this product in retail with zero luck.  I should have known to go to Amazon first.  EXCELLENT, FIRST CLASS WAY TO CLEAN YOUR TEETH.  KUDOS TO THE MFGR FOR INVENTING THIS ONE.....NONE OTHER WILL COMPARE.</li>
            <li> I hate wood tooth picks Im so glad I can pop these in my purse and get food out of my teeth. shipping fast and cost was great</li>
            <li> These work great for people who have developed &amp;#34;food traps&amp;#34; and do not like wooden toothpicks.</li>
            <li> absolutely met all my expectations.will order again when needed.</li>
            <li> I am a dental professional and I have found  nothing over the yeats that compares to the rota point for interdental cleaning and tissue massage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these toothpicks for about 10 years.  They are the best.  They get better with many uses.  In fact, one pick will last for many months (if you don&#x27;t mind reusing them, which I don&#x27;t).  At .25 cents each, this is a great deal (with free shipping).</li>
            <li> Much better product than is found in drug stores and highly recommended by my daughter&#x27;s dentist who gave her a trial supply. I &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34; some of the cleaners and have been using them since.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for!!!</li>
            <li> great product but pricey.</li>
            <li> Been using these for more than a decade.  Personally I find these better than floss at getting everything out between my teeth and gums.They are only a bad value for people who feel the need to dispose of them after only one use.  These things are both pliable and sturdy so using one for a month or more is easy.  Do you throw your tooth brush away after every use?</li>
            <li> I cannot use a regular wooden toothpick. It is too thick. These picks are perfect and evidently work because the dentist says my gums are in very healthy condition.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d been searching for these nifty little picks cause they&#x27;re the best. i&#x27;d gone through the supply my dentist gave me and was glad to find them on amazon -- even if buying multiple packs of 20 could get a little pricey for plastic picks. when they arrived, i noticed that they were manufactured by a company called zila. turns out i could have purchased 120 picks from zila for LESS than the 60 i got from dental usa! that&#x27;s not a mark-up, that&#x27;s extortion. got me once...but won&#x27;t get me again.</li>
            <li> A few years ago, our dentist used to give us a box of these following visits. Unfortunately, that practice ended. However, we had some squirrled away. I was quite pleased to see them on Amazon.com. Because they are plastic, one will last for several uses. They give the gums a gentle massage and are an excellent supplement to flossing and brushing. I have a small jaw, and my teeth are crowded together. The Rota-Points help maintain some spacing, which facilitates cleaning.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It finishes cleaning my teeth where the dental floss failed to clean.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I got these from my dentist once years ago, but then could never find them again.  I was thrilled to find them here on Amazon!  These work so well to get between teeth and help to keep things clean when you can&#x27;t stop and brush right away.  I will always want to have some of these on hand.</li>
            <li> GOT THESE FROM MY DENTIST.  HAVE MOVED TO ANOTHER STATE, AND CANT FIND THESE IN ANY STORE.  WORK SO GOOD FOR SPACES BETWEEN TEETH.  MY FAVORIT.</li>
            <li> finally a tooth pick that works</li>
            <li> If you do not like to floss with string then this is what you need.  My dental hygienist recommended this to me and boy am I glad she did.  This product goes a long way and will keep your teeth nice and flossed. I have given some to friends when need of a tooth pick they asked where did I  buy it so that they can get some.  I told them Amazon.</li>
            <li> These are the best you can buy! Love them-only complaint is the price and will look for some that are less pricey. Definitely recommend them, though.</li>
            <li> Great product. Good price.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  Great for when out to dinner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Rota-Point toothpicks for many years. My dentist used to sell them for $1.00/box!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s now retired. How many do I have to buy to get a discounted price? The prices you have listed here are absolutely ridiculous when I know I&#x27;ve gotten them all these years for $1.00 per box..</li>
            <li> Great for getting I between teeth.  To me, better than flossing</li>
            <li> Better than floss, \\&quot;tiny tweeny brushes\\&quot; and all other picks.  Sturdy.  A great addition to \\&quot;oral care regimen\\&quot;! These will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Love these picks, better than all the other, very durable.</li>
            <li> This are the best!  Better than a wooden toothpick that can splinter.  Can be cleaned and reused.  Great for bed bound pts.  Got these for my dad to help with his oral hygiene.  Easier then flossing.</li>
            <li> False advertising. Just got a package, only 20 picks inside. Comes out as 30 cents each instead of 20 cents each. Amazon should change the description,</li>
            <li> Had some many years ago.  Found out they are no longer sold in stores and was glad to find them via Amazon.  They are easy to use with the &amp;#34;square&amp;#34; handle and super fine pointy end and the straight line design.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for years. They are much superior to dental floss. They are especially handy for permanent bridge cleaning.</li>
            <li> Work great!  My dentist used to give them to me.  I have used the product for a long time &amp; was glad to find a source.</li>
            <li> Used to get these from my dentist. Had to find another source, and these worked out great.</li>
            <li> They have ways did a great job on my teeth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting these ever since I lost my long time dentist, who unexpectedly passed away...waiting probably 30 years!</li>
            <li> Really  cleans in between the teeth, easy to keep the box in my purse and they are priced reasonably.  Keep up the good work!!!&lt;br /&gt;Rotadent  Rota-Point Interdental cleaners</li>
            <li> I never go anywhere without one of these. They are very thin on the end and work as well or better than floss and can be rewashed and reused.</li>
            <li> Product was not as expected as the toothpicks were flimsy and over priced. They served a purpose; however, I would not purchase them in the future.</li>
            <li> The best dental cleaner to remove food particles that get stuck between your teeth. They are just the right size to get hard to remove pieces of food dislodged. The dental assistant was surprised when my gums didn&#x27;t bleed when she cleaned my teeth.  I&#x27;ve used these for years and am so glad to find them again on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist to clean the gums area. Helps stimulate healthy gum area you can not get to with dental floss. I have dental implants and these help to reach areas where food can get lodged.</li>
            <li> We are going to use these from now on - work great, even for those of us who cannot floss well between their teeth.</li>
            <li> Great picks and nice container box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super cali fragi listic expi ali do cious!&lt;br /&gt; Thank you very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will recommend.</li>
            <li> He has a small mouth and his teeth are very tight together, making the use of floss difficult.&lt;br /&gt;These plastic, curved, pointed sticks last through many uses and do the job!</li>
            <li> Wonderful! A dental hygienist gave me a sample and recommended the  product. She was right. It has met all expectations.</li>
            <li> These tooth pics are a little bit wide, I prefer the Opalpix brand, they are thinner and more fixable and go easily between the teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been missing these picks since I can no longer get them from my dentist. So I asked what they were called and found them again!Great for keeping everything from between my teeth!</li>
            <li> I have used them for a number of years and they are great, a little on the expensive side, but&lt;br /&gt;worth it as far as I am concerned&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JM-Hernando, MS</li>
            <li> These are great.&lt;br /&gt;They work well and each one lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad they are atill available.  I&#x27;ve been using them for over ten years.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  Love it! My former dentist gave a box of these in the &amp;#34;goodie bag&amp;#34; each time I went in for hygiene. All dentists should follow suit.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for years, Always get good checkups. First got them from my dentist. Better than flossing.</li>
            <li> Great product shipped quickly!! Great purchase!!!</li>
            <li> Best toothpicks ever. Too bad the case breaks and dumps the toothpicks out. I would&#x27;ve given this 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for the cheap case.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful and can be used over and over.</li>
            <li> A great in between meals pick.  I have weird teeth and not matter what I eat something gets stuck.  These are great and are not like those wooden telephone pole sticks, which do nothing.</li>
            <li> I have many gaps between my teeth which get full of food. This product gets it all out and lasts quite a long time. I finally found the product at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am so dissatisfied with this product!!!  I would like to contact the seller.  The edges are so sharp that my dentist told me to discontinue their use and use thin Stimudents!!!  I want my money back on my pay pay account....Please help!</li>
            <li> My dentist in CA used to give them to patients after cleaning. I knew I would like them but haven&#x27;t known where to get. He stopped giving them, and I moved to a different state. Really love them for help in keeping dental implants clean, and their design works well on all my teeth!</li>
            <li> These are the best.&lt;br /&gt;Sharp thin flexible textured points of nearly indestructible plastic. No comparison to inferior wood toothpicks.&lt;br /&gt;COST! Looks expensive but they are NOT expensive. I keep one in the watch pocket of each pair of jeans and one in my wallet. They literally last for years or until you loose them. I spend $5 or more for a glass of wine at a restaurant and that lasts about 10 minutes! Buy them. you won&#x27;t regret it unless you loose them everyday.</li>
            <li> These are the best!  They get into all the nooks and crannys and you can rinse them off and use them again.  They never break and I like them better than floss.</li>
            <li> Just what the Dentist ordered, I love these things and would continu to buy them again and again and again!</li>
            <li> Work much better than floss on my teeth, really get into the deep gum pockets. They last a long time too.</li>
            <li> What can you say about a toothpick?  These things are perfectly shaped for getting between my teeth, last a long time, and are very reusable.</li>
            <li> I have been using this type product for years in place of flossing with dental floss. These are so much better, because they can be used with one hand and not two like dental floss. I keep a package in my car, in my desk, by my bed, in my ditty bag for travel. I use them several times a day and after each meal. Love them, and the price is right. Actually my dentist gives them out after each cleaning, but I stopped using that Dentist and finally found them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have looked for these for quite a while.  they are more sturdy than the cheap ones you can buy.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!</li>
            <li> This product is expensive for what you get.I do like the product, but it was better when my dentist gave it to me at my check up, FREE.</li>
            <li> Good product. Gets betw teeth easily and the other end is square making it easier to hold. Been looking for these for some time ever since I got some from my dentist which were much more expensive. If u use and like tooth picks u&#x27;ll like these. Happy picking.</li>
            <li> these are great for people with permanent retainers or those who don&#x27;t like using floss. highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I use these all the time and they are easy to carry with me and I get more than one use out of them.&lt;br /&gt;They are better than dental floss for me.</li>
            <li> These are great for cleaning between your teeth.</li>
