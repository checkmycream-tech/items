            <li>They are cute</li>
            <li>If you want regular shaped rhinestones, this product is PERFECT for you!!!</li>
            <li>At the salon I&#x27;ve seen the girls press on the top with a needle and bring it over to the nail.  </li>
            <li>I love the package they come in.</li>
            <li>The top of the plastic wheel has one of the slices cut out so that you can spin it around and get to just the color you want.</li>
            <li>of the many different types of rhinestones I have these are 1 of the best.</li>
            <li>better ones</li>
            <li>These little hearts are so cute and perfect for nail designs!</li>
            <li>when i contacted the seller they gave me a full refund</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t count them but each compartment was packed full.  </li>
            <li>These hearts are very cute, but tiny!  </li>
            <li>These hearts are so tiny, there is no way to pick them up with your fingers and be able to place them accurately.</li>
            <li>but this 1 is actually pretty big which makes the price of it amazing.</li>
            <li>Which I really enjoy because its much easy to open and handle.</li>
            <li>The stones are very pretty and vibrant colors!</li>
            <li>Love the different colors.</li>
            <li>many nail art wheels are smaller than the palm of your hand</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a bigger wheel than most of the nail decorations I have.</li>
            <li>Exactly what it claims to be, a nice selection of pretty little heart-shaped rhinestones to embellish your nails.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend these to anyone who likes to do decorate nails.</li>
            <li>I ordered several wheels and they were each in their own plastic bag and rubber banded together in a padded envelope.</li>
            <li>I love hearts and these colors, so I bought these to use as embellishments for my cards that I make and for other paper crafts that I also create.</li>
            <li>I would love some bigger hearts, but these hearts will do as accents to larger rhinestones or as pieces of 3d color on a nail design.</li>
            <li>I love these little hearts.</li>
            <li>The price was good, shipping was slow, overall there was 12 colors.</li>
            <li>They were in small wheels and most of the stones were in the proper section.</li>
            <li>my only complaint is that they lose a bit of their shine once you add a clear top coat to them.</li>
            <li>and they are exactly what was expected.</li>
            <li>I find it hard to find many sets with black in it</li>
            <li>I ordered rhinestone hearts like the picture shows, not flat plastic hearts which is what I received.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I ordered these to bedazzle the back of iPhone cases but they are teeny tiny!! Even pretty small for my finger nails.. Cute, yes.. Just not what I hoped for..</li>
            <li> Has so many, 3000 heart shapes for a Great Price! It came in a perfect size packaging and on time</li>
            <li> i give one star because i, like others got flat little glitter hearts, which was not what was pictured. when i contacted the seller they gave me a full refund but i would have perferred the product that was shown, if you want to take a gamble- go ahead.</li>
            <li> I ordered the hearts and instead got circles. I was disappointed because I really wanted the heart gemstones. Oh well, the ones I got were circles. They are cute but I paid for hearts and I didn&#x27;t get that.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get what I ordered.  I ordered rhinestone hearts like the picture shows, not flat plastic hearts which is what I received.  Hopefully they will still work.</li>
            <li> These rhinestones are great. They are a perfect size and super easy to use. The colors are great. They came a lot faster than expected.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re circles!!!! Not even heart shaped!!! EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!!!  If you want regular shaped rhinestones, this product is PERFECT for you!!! Don&#x27;t buy these if you want heart shaped! You&#x27;ll be very disappointed!</li>
            <li> The case is great, the hearts are so cute and you get so many!  I just can&#x27;t rigure out how to pick them up and put them on.  At the salon I&#x27;ve seen the girls press on the top with a needle and bring it over to the nail.  That didn&#x27;t work with these.  I just ordered some nail art tweezers.  So hope that works.  These hearts are so tiny, there is no way to pick them up with your fingers and be able to place them accurately.</li>
            <li> Great choices and amount! It&#x27;ll be a while before I might need to buy another one. The wheel may get a bit sticky so turn slowly and be patient! Or else you&#x27;ll be spilling the gems!</li>
            <li> These little hearts are so cute and perfect for nail designs! I love the package they come in. The top of the plastic wheel has one of the slices cut out so that you can spin it around and get to just the color you want. The only issue I had was that there are around 300-350 pieces in the two inch container, not even close to 3,000. I&#x27;m not too worried about it because of the price, though.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t count them but each compartment was packed full.  These worked perfect on the nails, colors are vibrant.  They stayed on the nail till I removed them.</li>
            <li> I love hearts and these colors, so I bought these to use as embellishments for my cards that I make and for other paper crafts that I also create.</li>
            <li> They are very cute. Love the different colors. Can&#x27;t wait to use them. Got what I ordered. Will order again in the future.</li>
            <li> These hearts are very cute, but tiny!  I would love some bigger hearts, but these hearts will do as accents to larger rhinestones or as pieces of 3d color on a nail design.</li>
            <li> Exactly what it claims to be, a nice selection of pretty little heart-shaped rhinestones to embellish your nails. Many colors, handy case. I would definitely recommend this but I would also suggest getting the tool made to pick them up because they are TINY!</li>
            <li> excelente producto estoy muy contenta con la compra, la variedad de colores que tiene, el trasportador es muy facil de manejar y el tamaño es adecuado para hacer diseños en las uñas.</li>
            <li> Got it for my girlfriend and she lives it.  Come quickly and was a good product.  She&#x27;d buy it again.  Good selection of bling forn ails.</li>
            <li> The price was good, shipping was slow, overall there was 12 colors. I have to admitt i was expecting the hearts to be jus a little bit bigger; they are tiny.</li>
            <li> Received these rhinestones 5 days after placing order.  They were in small wheels and most of the stones were in the proper section. I ordered several wheels and they were each in their own plastic bag and rubber banded together in a padded envelope. The stones are very pretty and vibrant colors! They stay on well when placed into wet topcoat and do not smear, smudge or get dull when covered with additional topcoat. I don&#x27;t think there are quite as many stones in each wheel as stated, but darn close and still a good value for the price.  Would purchase again when needed.</li>
            <li> Sooo cute!  A good selection of colors.  I would certainly recommend these to anyone who likes to do decorate nails.</li>
            <li> of the many different types of rhinestones I have these are 1 of the best. many nail art wheels are smaller than the palm of your hand but this 1 is actually pretty big which makes the price of it amazing. I find it hard to find many sets with black in it so that is an extra bonus. my only complaint is that they lose a bit of their shine once you add a clear top coat to them.</li>
            <li> I love these little hearts. I got them for both my nails and for my crafting. I plan on getting another wheel to keep one with my beauty and one at my craft desk because I am constantly using them at both. It&#x27;s also a bigger wheel than most of the nail decorations I have. Which I really enjoy because its much easy to open and handle.</li>
            <li> they are very cute rhinestones they work good... just i got about 200 rhinestones and not 3000 i ordered another pack of 2400 n got way bigger n better ones then i did with these...&lt;br /&gt;id recommend them only if they got the order rite!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love arts and crafts and these gems have helped me work on many wonderful works of art and they are exactly what was expected.</li>
