            <li>I love how compact it is.</li>
            <li>so I guess I&#x27;ll have to use the alcohol and dime trick :)</li>
            <li>This eyeshadow is ok...</li>
            <li>Mostly matte.</li>
            <li>I recommend the company find a better way to package the material.</li>
            <li>If this is one of your worries please just go buy the eyeshadow now, because it is the most pigmented I&#x27;ve used in a while.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered this product after seeing some many YouTube makeup videos using it.  </li>
            <li>but I used the alcohol and dime trick and was able to fix them.</li>
            <li>I looove love love the colors</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this but not in love with how it was cared for.</li>
            <li>its ok i do wish the colors were alil more stronger  with more pigment</li>
            <li>I love this palette.  </li>

            <li>So many to use</li>
            <li>and I love how it looks on my eyes.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow didn&#x27;t stick, and most of the colors are matte.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t use these often but its ok</li>
            <li>I was very excited when I found this for 25$, but then I received it and tried to use it...</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful and bright just like I expected them to be.</li>
            <li>and it looked really pretty, blended nicely.</li>
            <li>Its ok the colors stay on with primer not badly cracked</li>
            <li>I am really happy and proud of what I purchased, seriously......</li>
            <li>I recently bought this palette and I love all the bright colors that come in this set.  </li>
            <li>Plus buying from the seller &#x27;Bundle Monster&#x27; was fabulous</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and are comparable to the more famous name cosmetics.</li>
            <li>:) I love this product so far</li>
            <li>The colors are amazing and are very true to the palette, meaning they show up on your skin the same color it is on the palette.</li>
            <li>I love how fast it came to my house.</li>
            <li>it fell apart quickly.</li>
            <li>this is my very first palette</li>
            <li>and save so much space!!</li>
            <li>In my opinion this palette is for beginners, advanced, or just anyone who wants to change up their look a bit.</li>
            <li>There really pigmented and go on smoothly</li>
            <li>broken.i was not to happy with that and a few colors are not well pigmented.</li>
            <li>The packaging was great; the palette came surrounded by bubble wrap and was in an envelope clearly marked as fragile.  </li>
            <li>It is worth it to just buy MAC for colors like this.</li>
            <li>Worth the money...</li>
            <li>(I used my extra $5 for some awesome nail strips in pink leopard print).</li>
            <li>it is worth it...</li>
            <li>For the price, I would say it is about right, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I bought it right before I started cosmetology school</li>
            <li>Arrived with MANY broken eyeshadows, not the best way to open a makeup palette with 120 shades!</li>
            <li>Delivery was very fast.</li>
            <li>I do like the colors and the selection of the colors very much.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure I would of had a blasty blast with these colors if only the darn things would of been up to par.</li>
            <li>I love make-up and having a variety of colors in my collection is key.  </li>
            <li>This palette gives me the shimmer and matte finishes that I need with never ending color combinations making my eye makeup application exciting, fun, and new each time.  </li>
            <li>The colors are awesome, I was super excited to get it, but it was not packaged well, 20 of the shadows were broken, and the latch that holds the case closed was snapped off and laying in the bottom of the box.</li>
            <li>She said it&#x27;s not your high end Channel but certainly much higher quality than off the shelves brand at Walgreen.</li>
            <li>It came wrapped in a whole bunch of bubble wrap with a \\&quot;handle with care\\&quot; package.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re very pigmented.</li>
            <li>The shadows are very creamy and do not fade.</li>
            <li>This is a real deal..</li>
            <li>It shipped fast and</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t move them around too much I don&#x27;t have to worry</li>
            <li>so you buy another oppurtunity in to see your offer thanks</li>
            <li>After many cleanings with a generic head and shoulders shampoo they&#x27;re finally soft.</li>
            <li>all the other ones I saw were $30+ because of shipping and all, but ordering off of amazon gave me free shipping which is always a plus!</li>
            <li>I put some on without any primer and the color was still vibrant and in place for the whole evening.</li>
            <li>I have very yellow undertones and they are true to the color I see in the pan.</li>
            <li>but when I opened the lid more than half of the eye shadows were cracked.</li>
            <li>Even with a cracked chipped box I decided to look at what I thought would of been my awesome eye shadow&#x27;s to only find them broken as well!</li>
            <li>package arrived in perfect condition, nothing broken, I was extremely happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also if you pack it on it looks a little better.</li>
            <li>I always look forward to doing my makeup for some strange reason because I can make a different style each time :)</li>
            <li>There are a few colors I am satisfied with.</li>
            <li>eyeshadow colours should be replaced every few months or so, but there&#x27;s so many I still haven&#x27;t touched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hopefully when I&#x27;m finished with this one I can order a new one</li>
            <li>Compared to other products such as the drugstore varieties, this set has more vibrant colors.  </li>
            <li>none of the shadows were broken for me, so i was very satisfied.</li>
            <li>This is my first big eye shadow palette.</li>
            <li>but I received mine in less than a week and shipping was free.   </li>
            <li>I used a dark purple and then a shimmery blue on top of it under my waterline</li>
            <li>Some could stand to be a little more pigmented but overall</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already fixed them</li>
            <li>&gt; As far as peoples complaints of it not showing up well, please use an eyeshadow primer.</li>
            <li>As far as the brushes go, I believe I&#x27;ve owned them for almost a year now.</li>
            <li>Whether you are going out for a night on the town or simply getting ready for work this product will take you there.</li>
            <li>It arrived completely intact</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s never dark at all!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t played yet, but am excited to explore new colors without spending a small fortune.</li>
            <li>I really like my eyeshadows but when they came there was more than half of them broken that really sucked.</li>
            <li>so I can not compare with other high end brands, but I can say that the colors are very pigmented, they last, and they get the job done!</li>
            <li>I bought this pallet with the brush roll/set that the same company offers.</li>
            <li>None of the shadows were broken and I am extremely pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>BH Cosmetics offers the EXACT SAME palette for $5 less.  </li>

            <li> so you buy another oppurtunity in to see your offer thanks</li>
            <li> After many cleanings with a generic head and shoulders shampoo they&#x27;re finally soft.</li>
            <li> all the other ones I saw were $30+ because of shipping and all, but ordering off of amazon gave me free shipping which is always a plus!</li>
            <li> I put some on without any primer and the color was still vibrant and in place for the whole evening.</li>
            <li> I have very yellow undertones and they are true to the color I see in the pan.</li>
            <li> but when I opened the lid more than half of the eye shadows were cracked.</li>
            <li> Even with a cracked chipped box I decided to look at what I thought would of been my awesome eye shadow&#x27;s to only find them broken as well!</li>
            <li> package arrived in perfect condition, nothing broken, I was extremely happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also if you pack it on it looks a little better.</li>
            <li> I always look forward to doing my makeup for some strange reason because I can make a different style each time :)</li>
            <li> There are a few colors I am satisfied with.</li>
            <li> eyeshadow colours should be replaced every few months or so, but there&#x27;s so many I still haven&#x27;t touched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hopefully when I&#x27;m finished with this one I can order a new one</li>
            <li> Compared to other products such as the drugstore varieties, this set has more vibrant colors.  </li>
            <li> none of the shadows were broken for me, so i was very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is my first big eye shadow palette.</li>
            <li> but I received mine in less than a week and shipping was free.   </li>
            <li> I used a dark purple and then a shimmery blue on top of it under my waterline</li>
            <li> Some could stand to be a little more pigmented but overall</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already fixed them</li>
            <li> &gt; As far as peoples complaints of it not showing up well, please use an eyeshadow primer.</li>
            <li> As far as the brushes go, I believe I&#x27;ve owned them for almost a year now.</li>
            <li> Whether you are going out for a night on the town or simply getting ready for work this product will take you there.</li>
            <li> It arrived completely intact</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s never dark at all!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t played yet, but am excited to explore new colors without spending a small fortune.</li>
            <li> I really like my eyeshadows but when they came there was more than half of them broken that really sucked.</li>
            <li> so I can not compare with other high end brands, but I can say that the colors are very pigmented, they last, and they get the job done!</li>
            <li> I bought this pallet with the brush roll/set that the same company offers.</li>
            <li> None of the shadows were broken and I am extremely pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> BH Cosmetics offers the EXACT SAME palette for $5 less.  </li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend to anyone who wants a ton of eye shadow colors to play around with without for very little money.</li>
            <li> but 7 of the colors were either, cracked or completely shattered and the alcohol dime trick didn&#x27;t work too well, the black case was also cracked.</li>
            <li> I guess it was a bit different for me because no matter what eyeshadow I&#x27;ve used on a client, I&#x27;ve always used a primer for long lasting results, and minimal creasing.</li>
            <li> It took a long time for me to get this.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a larger size with the advertised colors, but I was actually surprise to see how small it was for its price.</li>
            <li> others have lots of color especially the black</li>
            <li> If you have trouble with fallout when using this product, put the product onto an eyeshadow brush and tap the brush a couple times before actually applying the shadow to remove some of the loose powder.</li>
            <li> It came parceled in bubble wrap and was carefully packaged.</li>
            <li> , they shipped way before I expected</li>
            <li> Such as orange and green.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s really going to get irritating.</li>
            <li> absolutely no</li>
            <li> I spent a while using a q-tip to remove the gold from the other colors so they wouldn&#x27;t be there permanently.</li>
            <li> but i re palleted them so other than that</li>
            <li> The pigment is average and there is a lot of fall out.</li>
            <li> and the color doesn&#x27;t come on dark like how i want it too...</li>
            <li> IS NOT WORTH</li>
            <li> it was an alright product although it arrived with one of the black eyeshadows</li>
            <li> In Brazil, this kind of item is very expensive and difficult to find.</li>
            <li> When the package arrived, the pallet was smaller than I thought, and some of the shadows were broken.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is 7 of the colors came broken</li>
            <li> I plan to purchase a few for some gift sfor friends.</li>
            <li> NOT COOL!</li>
            <li> The colors are very pigmented; you do experience a little fallout but not too bad.  </li>
            <li> If you are a teen or need a lot of colors for say a project where you are not wearing it out then maybe, but for daily use this was a bad choice.</li>
            <li> and they were terrible not pigment very light</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not many Shimmers.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> When I received the package, two of the gold colors were broken and spread around on the other colors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very bright unless you use a base/primer.</li>
            <li> BUT HALF OF THEM ARE BROKEN.</li>
            <li> She likes it a lot especially doing all these crazy eye effects.</li>
            <li> the worst part they dont even work the colors look so light when I wear them...</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s bound to be a few broken.</li>
            <li> Two of the colors were broken, but a few videos from youtube showed me how to fix them.</li>
            <li> The ONLY bad thing is that it came with four broken eyeshadows, but out of 120?</li>
            <li> I know some other customers have complained that some of their eye shadows were broken, but I think they just happen to receive a bad set.</li>
            <li> Nothing was broken.</li>
            <li> One arrived cracked but it kept its shape in the pan and hasn&#x27;t broken.</li>
            <li> (therefore I was BROKE) and had a few makeup jobs that I was in desperate need of eyeshadow and spare brushes for.</li>
            <li> Two colors did arrive broken</li>
            <li> When I opened this product almost all the eye-shadows were broken and the powders were everywhere mixing together.  </li>
            <li> Not happy on how I received my product.</li>
            <li> Poor color when I put it on, lots of fallout.  </li>
            <li> When I got these eyeshadows 8 of them were broken...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to pay crazy and outrageous prices, so this palette&#x27;s price was just right for all the colors.</li>
            <li> Then there&#x27;s some weird marbled ones in there.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed to say the least</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed to see about 8 of my colors where broken.</li>
            <li> It came in a box wrapped in bubble wrap, when opened the palettes where covered in plastic but some shadows where still broken :(.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend using ANY type oil on them, because they cling to product like crazy.</li>
            <li> and I was afraid it would take forever to get to me</li>
            <li> I was really sad. :(</li>
            <li> NOT ONE SHADOW WAS BROKEN!!!</li>
            <li> and when I get da color with my brush it looks like ashes like if these stupid eyeshadows were expired or something</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was very pleased with the packaging!! It came parceled in bubble wrap and was carefully packaged. NOT ONE SHADOW WAS BROKEN!!! All of the shadows were in place. I put some on without any primer and the color was still vibrant and in place for the whole evening. Over all GREAT ORDER!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I would of loved the color&#x27;s in this palette but before I could even open it the plastic box that holds the colors BROKE! Even with a cracked chipped box I decided to look at what I thought would of been my awesome eye shadow&#x27;s to only find them broken as well! I was so disappointed to say the least and I&#x27;m sure I would of had a blasty blast with these colors if only the darn things would of been up to par.</li>
            <li> I Love Love LOVE this eyeshadow palette!...this is my very first palette so I can not compare with other high end brands, but I can say that the colors are very pigmented, they last, and they get the job done! I was in search of a palette that I could afford and that would satisfy my want for a 120 palette..all the other ones I saw were $30+ because of shipping and all, but ordering off of amazon gave me free shipping which is always a plus! In my opinion this palette is for beginners, advanced, or just anyone who wants to change up their look a bit. I would totally recommend this product! Plus buying from the seller &#x27;Bundle Monster&#x27; was fabulous, they shipped way before I expected and it was from Hawaii! It came wrapped in a whole bunch of bubble wrap with a \\&quot;handle with care\\&quot; package. Nothing was broken. I am so happy! so you should Buy it too!</li>
            <li> Love the colors! They are very bright and they really show up well on darker skin. I have very yellow undertones and they are true to the color I see in the pan. One arrived cracked but it kept its shape in the pan and hasn&#x27;t broken. For the price and to supplement your eyeshadow collection if you are on a budget it is awesome!</li>
            <li> none of the shadows were broken for me, so i was very satisfied. and its a great price.</li>
            <li> I just got these two days ago, but was out of town so I got to open them yesterday. Delivery was very fast. I haven&#x27;t used any on my eyes yet but tested them and they&#x27;re very pigmented. The colors are amazing and are very true to the palette, meaning they show up on your skin the same color it is on the palette. The ONLY bad thing is that it came with four broken eyeshadows, but out of 120? There&#x27;s bound to be a few broken. I&#x27;ve already fixed them so it&#x27;s okay :) I love this product so far and I can&#x27;t wait to use them!</li>
            <li> I recently bought this palette and I love all the bright colors that come in this set.  The shadows are very creamy and do not fade. Compared to other products such as the drugstore varieties, this set has more vibrant colors.  The packaging was great; the palette came surrounded by bubble wrap and was in an envelope clearly marked as fragile.  None of the shadows were broken and I am extremely pleased with my purchase. If you have trouble with fallout when using this product, put the product onto an eyeshadow brush and tap the brush a couple times before actually applying the shadow to remove some of the loose powder.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girl friend. She likes it a lot especially doing all these crazy eye effects. She said it&#x27;s not your high end Channel but certainly much higher quality than off the shelves brand at Walgreen. As long as she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy.  Certainly it&#x27;s a very good deal for the value.  Hope this help. Cheers!</li>
            <li> This is a real deal.. Great price with excellent quality.. I bought this for my girl friend and she is so happy with it. It replaces all her eye cosmetics make up with just one palette. and save so much space!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item a while ago, i really loved it. The colors are beautiful and bright just like I expected them to be. Great item.</li>
            <li> When the package arrived, the pallet was smaller than I thought, and some of the shadows were broken. I haven&#x27;t played yet, but am excited to explore new colors without spending a small fortune.</li>
            <li> The colors are awesome, I was super excited to get it, but it was not packaged well, 20 of the shadows were broken, and the latch that holds the case closed was snapped off and laying in the bottom of the box. I was really sad. :(</li>
            <li> Very good cost x benefit! My wife just loved. In Brazil, this kind of item is very expensive and difficult to find.</li>
            <li> I am really happy and proud of what I purchased, seriously...... No lies. It came in the mail faster than I thought. I always look forward to doing my makeup for some strange reason because I can make a different style each time :)</li>
            <li> I love how fast it came to my house. I love all the colors in this palette. I love how compact it is. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is 7 of the colors came broken so I guess I&#x27;ll have to use the alcohol and dime trick :)</li>
            <li> This product is a great value. The colors are vibrant and are comparable to the more famous name cosmetics. I plan to purchase a few for some gift sfor friends.</li>
            <li> I recieved this set about 3 days after I bought it. I have been modeling for years and know a lot about make up from various shoots. The pigment is average and there is a lot of fall out. There are a few colors I am satisfied with. I would recommend this to someone that has not used designer make up. It is about the same as store brand. For the price, I would say it is about right, but you get what you pay for. It is worth it to just buy MAC for colors like this. I recommend putting this eyeshadow on before any foundation so that you can whipe off the fall out before you put the rest of your make up on. Also if you pack it on it looks a little better. About 1/3 of the colors are chalky. I would say this is a great buy for ages 13-20.</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow is ok... It&#x27;s not very bright unless you use a base/primer. There&#x27;s not many Shimmers. Mostly matte.Then there&#x27;s some weird marbled ones in there. Such as orange and green. When mixed it looks like baby poop. Worth the money... but i wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> When I received the package, two of the gold colors were broken and spread around on the other colors. I spent a while using a q-tip to remove the gold from the other colors so they wouldn&#x27;t be there permanently. I recommend the company find a better way to package the material.</li>
            <li> I bought this pallet with the brush roll/set that the same company offers. I bought it right before I started cosmetology school (therefore I was BROKE) and had a few makeup jobs that I was in desperate need of eyeshadow and spare brushes for. I was literally praying that these wouldn&#x27;t be the translucent type of eyeshadow that you buy in packs and get jipped on. If this is one of your worries please just go buy the eyeshadow now, because it is the most pigmented I&#x27;ve used in a while.&lt;br /&gt; As far as peoples complaints of it not showing up well, please use an eyeshadow primer. I guess it was a bit different for me because no matter what eyeshadow I&#x27;ve used on a client, I&#x27;ve always used a primer for long lasting results, and minimal creasing. Especially because of all the lights and constant positioning these girls are in, there is bound to be eyelid sweat, as well as natures elements.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve had this pallet for a while now, and granted there are colors I would never use because of the great variety, but they are excellent for underlying tones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As far as the brushes go, I believe I&#x27;ve owned them for almost a year now. After many cleanings with a generic head and shoulders shampoo they&#x27;re finally soft. I don&#x27;t recommend using ANY type oil on them, because they cling to product like crazy. It took about two different washes to get the oils out, but I believe the shedding has stopped a bit, and they&#x27;re finally not itchy when used on the face.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after seeing some many YouTube makeup videos using it.  It is a great value for the price.  The colors are very pigmented; you do experience a little fallout but not too bad.  Two colors did arrive broken but I used the alcohol and dime trick and was able to fix them. Would definitely recommend to anyone who wants a ton of eye shadow colors to play around with without for very little money.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend bought this palette for me because I&#x27;m gonna be starting beauty school and I needed one. It shipped fast and I looove love love the colors BUT HALF OF THEM ARE BROKEN. If I don&#x27;t move them around too much I don&#x27;t have to worry but that&#x27;s really going to get irritating. UGH. I&#x27;m in love with this but not in love with how it was cared for. It could just be the post office people but next time I&#x27;m going to try and buy a palette somewhere else besides online. :/</li>
            <li> The Color selection just looks like a collection of color that no one wanted. When I put any colors it takes forever to show up. It doesn&#x27;t stick either. I put on a bunch and my friend said shortly after in the morning that it doesn&#x27;t look like I have any makeup on at all! I don&#x27;t recommend it at all, it&#x27;s cheap yeah I know but I bought it and I haven&#x27;t put on any cuz it only stays on in like 20 min and it&#x27;s never dark at all!</li>
            <li> When I opened this product almost all the eye-shadows were broken and the powders were everywhere mixing together.  I do not recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> its ok i do wish the colors were alil more stronger  with more pigment an three of my colors did not make it in the mail but i re palleted them so other than that i did like it....</li>
            <li> Everything seemed excellent Lords recommend them to all buyers hope to continue so you buy another oppurtunity in to see your offer thanks</li>
            <li> This item actually looks bigger on the picture than its actual sized. I was expecting a larger size with the advertised colors, but I was actually surprise to see how small it was for its price. My daughter like it though--not me.</li>
            <li> This is why you MUST research your purchases on amazon!  BH Cosmetics offers the EXACT SAME palette for $5 less.  Why spend the extra money on this one when you can purchase the one from BH Cosmetics and use the extra $5 you save on another purchase for yourself? (I used my extra $5 for some awesome nail strips in pink leopard print).</li>
            <li> Arrived with MANY broken eyeshadows, not the best way to open a makeup palette with 120 shades!</li>
            <li> Iam a makeup addict but i dont like spending alot of money on makeup so i think this is a really good buy. great price, lots of colors to choose from, good quality, and great as a gift!!! There really pigmented and go on smoothly they blend nicely and look amazing!!! Dont think twice about buy this cuz its worth it!!!</li>
            <li> I love this palette.  If you like to experiment with color but don&#x27;t want to spend a fortune this is an excellent option.  The colors are gorgeous.  Some could stand to be a little more pigmented but overall this is a good quality palette. The seller ships from Hawaii and I was afraid it would take forever to get to me but I received mine in less than a week and shipping was free.   I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love make-up and having a variety of colors in my collection is key.  This palette gives me the shimmer and matte finishes that I need with never ending color combinations making my eye makeup application exciting, fun, and new each time.  Whether you are going out for a night on the town or simply getting ready for work this product will take you there.</li>
            <li> over all the colors are great and stick well even without eye primer but 7 of the colors were either, cracked or completely shattered and the alcohol dime trick didn&#x27;t work too well, the black case was also cracked.</li>
            <li> The colors are great but when I opened the lid more than half of the eye shadows were cracked. Not happy on how I received my product.</li>
            <li> I received this product in a timely manner and used it the very next day. The color lasted all day and all the colors arrived intact. I know some other customers have complained that some of their eye shadows were broken, but I think they just happen to receive a bad set. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I do like the colors and the selection of the colors very much. They are not as bright as shown in the picture but they&#x27;re still pretty bright and I&#x27;m happy with it. Also the colors mix beautifully. I used a dark purple and then a shimmery blue on top of it under my waterline and it looked really pretty, blended nicely.I do recommend these!:)</li>
            <li> I love it, so many color to choose from and it stays too..it is worth it...my rating says it all...</li>
            <li> Colors are bright and application is smooth!!&lt;br /&gt;It comes neatly packaged to protect from crumbling during shipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it and will definitely buy again!!!</li>
            <li> so glad I bought this I just love the colors. very nice and easy application&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Macro Lens</li>
            <li> it fell apart quickly. Poor color when I put it on, lots of fallout.  If you are a teen or need a lot of colors for say a project where you are not wearing it out then maybe, but for daily use this was a bad choice.</li>
            <li> it was an alright product although it arrived with one of the black eyeshadows broken.i was not to happy with that and a few colors are not well pigmented. others have lots of color especially the black</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to pay crazy and outrageous prices, so this palette&#x27;s price was just right for all the colors. Some colors are very very similar. Two of the colors were broken, but a few videos from youtube showed me how to fix them. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this purchase. It arrived completely intact absolutely no damage!&lt;br /&gt;a must have for the make-up lover</li>
            <li> I was so thrilled when I received this palette. Such beautiful bright colors! So many to use and I love how the colors turn out when i put them on! So glad that I got this!</li>
            <li> I really like my eyeshadows but when they came there was more than half of them broken that really sucked.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t like this 120 it has a expire date which was something i was not expecting and the color doesn&#x27;t come on dark like how i want it too...</li>
            <li> It was good shape and I love how it looks on my eyes. The thing that got me upset was da delivery. It took a long time for me to get this.</li>
            <li> I got the palet tried the colors and they were terrible not pigment very light like you put nothing on at all.</li>
            <li> This is my first big eye shadow palette. The shipping was great but I was disappointed to see about 8 of my colors where broken. It came in a box wrapped in bubble wrap, when opened the palettes where covered in plastic but some shadows where still broken :(. NOT COOL! I haven&#x27;t tried the shadows as yet will create another review on that later. The company shipping needs to look into a way to ship it without the breakage of eye shadows.   MzKandi.</li>
            <li> I was very excited when I found this for 25$, but then I received it and tried to use it...The eyeshadow didn&#x27;t stick, and most of the colors are matte. You will definitely need an eye primer if you want these colors to show up.</li>
            <li> When I got these eyeshadows 8 of them were broken...the worst part they dont even work the colors look so light when I wear them... and when I get da color with my brush it looks like ashes like if these stupid eyeshadows were expired or something....I DON&#x27;T RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO NO ONE...DON&#x27;T BUY IT IS NOT WORTH IT TRUST ME!</li>
            <li> Its ok the colors stay on with primer not badly cracked i don&#x27;t use these often but its ok</li>
            <li> Loves all the colors!</li>
            <li> I bought this a couple years ago and still use it!  I know eyeshadow colours should be replaced every few months or so, but there&#x27;s so many I still haven&#x27;t touched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My package arrived in perfect condition, nothing broken, I was extremely happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colours are SO vibrant, which is perfect for how I wear my makeup.  Hopefully when I&#x27;m finished with this one I can order a new one</li>
            <li> Love it great product I use it every day and really love all the colors that go with my outfits and it stays on all day</li>
