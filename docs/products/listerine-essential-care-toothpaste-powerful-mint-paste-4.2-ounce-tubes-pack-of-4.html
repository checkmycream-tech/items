            <li>That&#x27;s the perfect description of Listerine Toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Best tasting toothpaste I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is the best.....</li>
            <li>Best toothpaste ever.</li>
            <li>This is a very good toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Breath after brushing - great.</li>
            <li>We have great checkups.  </li>
            <li>My wife found it to be a welcome addition to her \\&quot;oral care</li>
            <li>A good product with a great reputation, the Listerine experience is in every tube.  </li>
            <li>But if you are ok with that, this is an excellent toothpaste.</li>
            <li>My grandpa LOVED Listeriine and used it every day and his teeth were really good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It turns out that what tasted good in a mouthwash doesn&#x27;t taste good in a toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>All-in-all a good value and one I&#x27;ll be looking for when I visit the toothpaste aisle.</li>
            <li>I was using Listerine Tothpaste for 3 years and that was so good, had no plaque at all(was not by dentist for cleaning).</li>
            <li>My teeth feel good afterwards, but they did after Colgate and Crest etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Listerine toothpaste does a good job of cleaning your teeth and freshening your breathe, tho</li>
            <li>We both liked  Listerine toothpaste&#x27;s pleasant minty taste.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, way better than the top-line offerings from Crest and Colgate.  </li>
            <li>This has a minty,slightly sweet taste, with a pleasant consistency (no I don&#x27;t eat my toothpaste, but it just feels good and tastes good while in the mouth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Taste - great; easy to clean off the sink - great (don&#x27;t be fooled - some toothpastes are like glue when stuck to the bowl of a sink).</li>
            <li>so you get a nice twofer.</li>
            <li>I have always liked it.  </li>
            <li>more often it tastes so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an Aqua-Fresh kind of person.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how much I liked the way this toothpaste works.  </li>
            <li>If you like Listerine, this toothpaste is honestly a no-brainer.</li>
            <li>you might want to have a defibrillator handy when you try this product.  </li>
            <li>It  effectively combines teeth cleaning and breath freshening into one step, saving time and eliminating one product off the bathroom vanity.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to try this because I do like their mouthwash, which is also effective at freshening your breath.</li>
            <li>The reason for the 4 stars is that it does taste very strongly of Listerine and it is medicinal and kind of grandpa bathroom cabinet&#x27;y.</li>
            <li>minty, but with a very strong aftertaste of clove oil.</li>
            <li>Listerine Tooth Paste has all the necessary ingredients to best oral care by clearing all the germs to keep one very healthy..</li>
            <li>Not the overwhelming minty flavor but refreshing in its own way.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good because you brush your teeth for a full two minutes.  </li>
            <li>Like most toothpastes, if you brush well, it will work just fine!</li>
            <li>The color is not too appealing</li>
            <li>There is probably nothing scientific about that - maybe I watched too many of those scrubbing bubbles commercials as a kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for cavities and gingivitis</li>
            <li>but I did just find out I have some more cavities.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ll keep using this and see if I get any more</li>
            <li>I am very much enjoying it.</li>
            <li>Kids don&#x27;t need more than a teeny dot of toothpaste on their brushes until they know that they shouldn&#x27;t swallow the stuff.</li>
            <li>I used it, it worked well, and that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Paste is okay</li>
            <li>Could find locally so finding it on amazon was wonderful and convenient.</li>
            <li>Seem that the produced had changed the formula of toothpaste to push people to buy that awakwrd maouthwash on which they probably make more money.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s good toothpaste, but is it worth the expense over Crest or Colgate?</li>
            <li>To me this tastes more like Wintergreen, and</li>
            <li>(I would give the gel five stars), but am still quite pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>Cleans your teeth and tastes pretty good.</li>
            <li>I love the strong taste</li>
            <li>This is a good toothpaste, and if you like Listerine you will really like this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>If you like the strong Listerine mouthwash taste and</li>
            <li>Excelent product, I strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The toothpaste isn&#x27;t quite as strong tasting as the mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And the taste is strong -- there is no doubt about that.  </li>
            <li>it tastes fine, and you sure do feel clean.</li>
            <li>Listerine&#x27;s Essential Care Powerful Mint toothpaste leaves your mouth with an excellent clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>This listerine toothpaste is perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>I guess I was hoping that it would be a bit more mild than it</li>
            <li>HUGE warning:  This toothpaste is not for children.  </li>
            <li>but now that I&#x27;ve had a chance to try it for free</li>
            <li>If you like the strong, clean feeling that Listerine mouthwash provides, then this is a toothpaste that you might like.</li>
            <li>This stuff is so great that I only have to brush my teeth once a day and the dentist always compliments my brushing skills!!</li>
            <li>So far, so good...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too early to tell if the toothpaste is good at preventing cavities, but we will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>It tastes flat out great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is super strong and smells just like a bottle of Listerine-</li>
            <li>இ Fuzzy Wuzzy&#x27;s Summary:&lt;br /&gt;ѾѾѾѾѾ Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Something in between and unique.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a fan of Listerine&#x27;s Cool Mint Mouthwash, you&#x27;ll definitely enjoy this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Thymol 0.511%  (phenol desinfectant, unique formula for anti plaque/antigingivitis);   </li>
            <li>and my teeth were amazingly clean.</li>
            <li>I even hit the full 2 minutes on my Oral B toothbrush</li>
            <li>While I cannot scientifically prove to myself the efficacy of its plaque/gingivitis preventative properties, I have always combined my brushing with Listerine and flossing (and, no, I do not believe the old Listerine commercials where it touted Listerine as being as effective as flossing, and I therefore have always used both Listerine and flossing).&lt;br</li>
            <li>that is what I keep getting shipped now and it is nowhere near as effective as this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit&lt;</li>
            <li>The taste is intense, if you like Listerine mouthwash you will love this.   </li>
            <li>The taste of this toothpaste reminds me more of Wintergreen, a flavor I really don&#x27;t care for.  </li>
            <li>My gums and the inside of my mouth were also very clean, and had a minty/astringent feel that lasted for a good half hour</li>
            <li>Seriously, the taste of this very good toothpaste is way too strong for children.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, all in all, the teeth feel clean, the breath smells fresh ....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Eitherway, it&#x27;s a good, solid toothpaste that leaves your mouth fresh.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>The toothpaste tastes pretty good, and once the initial weirdness of the idea of menthol in your mouth wares off</li>
            <li>\\&quot;New look, same great formula\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really, really sure that it can&#x27;t cure SARS, Ebola or the Swine Flu, but it feels strong enough to take care of all those and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listerine</li>
            <li>and if the dentist sees an improvement in my teeth then it will be worth it</li>
            <li>I will stick with my old favorite [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>is that it cleans and leaves your mouth with that listerine breath fresh smell.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I like it - it does freshen breath and keep it fresh for a while.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was fun to try once, but while the Listerine bottle is staying in the bathroom, the tube of Listerine toothbrush won&#x27;t make a repeat appearance.</li>
            <li>We both agreed that, after brushing, our mouths felt fresh.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really mind it and using this toothpaste makes my mouth feel clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>It may have other good things</li>
            <li>If you are accustomed to using an inch long glob of toothpaste to brush your teeth (don&#x27;t the toothpaste companies LOVE YOU!)</li>
            <li>You do, right?    </li>
            <li>I must be doing something right.    </li>
            <li>Firstly you should know this is kind of a pyschadelic blue color coming out of the tube.</li>
            <li>I have always been a Colgate kind of girl but am willing to try this entire tube and perhaps buy another one.  </li>
            <li>I found that it left a very strong aftertaste in my mouth which I did not like.  </li>
            <li>It leaves a fresh clean aftertaste and is not too sweet (unlike most other toothpastes).  </li>
            <li>toothpaste tastes very much like the minty mouthwash:  </li>
            <li>toothpaste does not foam up like my current favorite</li>
            <li>AND you use it first thing in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve rarely paid this much for a tube of toothpaste</li>
            <li>The biggest surprises for me with this toothpaste is how it taste exactly like Listerine mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>First, this is a Listerine product so if you don&#x27;t like the taste of the mouthwash you probably won&#x27;t like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only thing I noticed is that if you brush with it after drinking coffee, you&#x27;ll fill like you have coffee mouth again after awhile (even if you don&#x27;t drink more coffee)</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t get this exact product then go to Drug Supply Store (dot) Com.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been having problems getting this exact paste on here there is another Listerine based paste that doesn&#x27;t have these ingredients:</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a pretty likeable toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Listerine Essential Care toothpaste has that distinct Listerine taste that leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>It only lasted for a minute or so, and after I used the toothpaste more often I really don&#x27;t even notice it anymore.  </li>
            <li>Is it worth the relatively high cost?</li>
            <li>The first time I used this toothpast I was very suprised.  </li>
            <li>Listerine Essential Care Toothpaste leaves your mouth with a clean, fresh feeling that lasts.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that is a requirement but somehow that foaming action makes me feel like my teeth are cleaner LOL.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Listerine was supposed to be so strong that it would whack any germ that dared cross its path when it was on duty.  </li>
            <li>Also, my dear spouse, who is presumably an adult, brushed his teeth for almost three whole seconds, spit out the paste all over the sink, rinsed with many, many glasses of water, and spent a good half hour whining about his \\&quot;burnt up mouth.\\</li>
            <li>However the blue and green mouthwash has still that great formula (did not look the others),</li>
            <li>but it is really strong!&lt;br</li>
            <li>gave this toothpaste three stars out of five because it really can&#x27;t be used by the whole family:  </li>
            <li>with all Listerine products, it has a very medicinal taste and quality to it, but it appears to work wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>may vary\\&quot; depending on how much you like the taste of Listerine.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, all I really care about is fluoride.  </li>
            <li>but I really do like this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>just they have 21% ethyl alcohol what makes them much to hursh, to agresive.</li>
            <li>choice is up to you, but I have to say I really do like this toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this tooth paste since I use Listerine</li>
            <li>She appreciated the possibility of getting the benefit of Listerine mouthwash away from home.  </li>
            <li>Could menthol really fight gingivitis and all of the foul bacteria that I do not want over-growing in my mouth?  </li>
            <li>For some reason, none of the local drug stores carry any Listerine toothpaste in their stores, so I am grateful that Amazon offers so many iterations of this product.</li>
            <li>but it is more intense than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is not the flavor of the original yellow Listerine.   </li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a stinging sensation, most like due to the alcohol contents.  </li>
            <li>Because it tastes and even leaves your mouth feeling just like that particular mouthwash</li>
            <li>If kind of hard to find this product in drugstores.  </li>
            <li>It tastes a lot like the mouthwash and provides similarly long-lasting fresh breath.    </li>
            <li>I have no idea, really, because I use Listerine mouthwash pretty regularly, but I wasn&#x27;t a fan of this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I really like the deep clean, lasting freshness that I get with this product.</li>
            <li>Not numb enough to make you drool or talk funny, but just enough to give it that I just had menthol in my mouth feel.  </li>
            <li>&quot; That loses a couple of stars in my book.th for almost three whole seconds, spit out the paste all over the sink, rinsed with many, many glasses of water, and spent a good half hour whining about his \\&quot;burnt up mouth.\\&quot; That loses a couple of stars in my book.</li>
            <li>It is very different from most other toothpastes.  </li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s a plus if you want an occasional break from the minty-sweet flavor of most other toothpastes, which I do.</li>
            <li>According to the labels, Listerine toothpaste has many times the percentages of active ingredients in the Listerine mouthwash she uses, and three times the percentage of fluoride in her regular toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>or a good thing (less mess?).  </li>
            <li>So if it could would I use a toothpaste with menthol in it even though it seems kind of weird at first?  </li>
            <li>always brush using a Philips Sonicare power toothbrush, and this toothpaste definitely foams up less than most toothpastes.  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t necessarily indicate that it does less of a job cleaning, but, some people like the old foaming action of most toothpastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was going to turn the light off to see if it was glow in the dark!</li>
            <li>Remember the old (now banned)</li>
            <li>Listerine Essential Care leaves your mouth extra fresh feeling and disinfected much in the same way as the mouthwash</li>
            <li>but when my old dentist gave me this and it took some getting used to.</li>
            <li>I plan to use this product in the morning for a kick-start to my day and save my sensitive tooth paste for bedtime use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that it has a nice texture - it&#x27;s not overly grainy or thin.</li>
            <li>However, the fresh feeling you get from brushing with this toothpaste lasts longer than any other toothpaste I can remember.      </li>
            <li>So the combination of new fake toothpaste with mouthwash is not the same as was the good old toothpaste.</li>
            <li>special other than brush regularly.      </li>
            <li>With the vigor of the electric toothbrush, I like the fact that it foams up less than most of the other toothpastes that I use.</li>
            <li>recommend Listerine Essential Care Toothpaste to anyone who wants a clean feeling mouth and also likes or at least tolerates the taste of Listerine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been a big fan of the Listerine mouthwash - it&#x27;s too intense for me to use regularly...</li>
            <li>but, well, Aqua-Fresh is just generally neat looking!    </li>
            <li>B00336EUSQ Crest 3D White Vivid Fluoride Anticavity Toothpaste Radiant Mint Flavor, 5.8-Ounce Carton (Pack of 4)]].</li>
            <li>I have all my teeth, no cavities in years, and no other problems.  </li>
            <li>The taste is certainly different from most other toothpastes: As other reviewers have mentioned, it tastes like Listerine mouthwash.</li>
            <li>It certainly tastes like listerine mouthwash, but not nearly as intense.  </li>
            <li>And the texture is  not a stiff white paste nor is it a gel.  </li>
            <li>I personally will be returning to my old toothpaste which is not so \\&quot;medicine\\&quot; smelling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;According to the packaging, this toothpaste helps prevent cavities, plaque, and gingivitis, much like almost every other toothpaste on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Listerine Tooth Paste has all the necessary ingredients to best oral care by clearing all the germs to keep one very healthy..</li>
            <li> Not the overwhelming minty flavor but refreshing in its own way.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s good because you brush your teeth for a full two minutes.  </li>
            <li> Like most toothpastes, if you brush well, it will work just fine!</li>
            <li> The color is not too appealing</li>
            <li> There is probably nothing scientific about that - maybe I watched too many of those scrubbing bubbles commercials as a kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for cavities and gingivitis</li>
            <li> but I did just find out I have some more cavities.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ll keep using this and see if I get any more</li>
            <li> I am very much enjoying it.</li>
            <li> Kids don&#x27;t need more than a teeny dot of toothpaste on their brushes until they know that they shouldn&#x27;t swallow the stuff.</li>
            <li> I used it, it worked well, and that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Paste is okay</li>
            <li> Could find locally so finding it on amazon was wonderful and convenient.</li>
            <li> Seem that the produced had changed the formula of toothpaste to push people to buy that awakwrd maouthwash on which they probably make more money.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s good toothpaste, but is it worth the expense over Crest or Colgate?</li>
            <li> To me this tastes more like Wintergreen, and</li>
            <li> (I would give the gel five stars), but am still quite pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li> Cleans your teeth and tastes pretty good.</li>
            <li> I love the strong taste</li>
            <li> This is a good toothpaste, and if you like Listerine you will really like this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> If you like the strong Listerine mouthwash taste and</li>
            <li> Excelent product, I strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The toothpaste isn&#x27;t quite as strong tasting as the mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the taste is strong -- there is no doubt about that.  </li>
            <li> it tastes fine, and you sure do feel clean.</li>
            <li> Listerine&#x27;s Essential Care Powerful Mint toothpaste leaves your mouth with an excellent clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> This listerine toothpaste is perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> I guess I was hoping that it would be a bit more mild than it</li>
            <li> HUGE warning:  This toothpaste is not for children.  </li>
            <li> but now that I&#x27;ve had a chance to try it for free</li>
            <li> If you like the strong, clean feeling that Listerine mouthwash provides, then this is a toothpaste that you might like.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so great that I only have to brush my teeth once a day and the dentist always compliments my brushing skills!!</li>
            <li> So far, so good...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early to tell if the toothpaste is good at preventing cavities, but we will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> It tastes flat out great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is super strong and smells just like a bottle of Listerine-</li>
            <li> இ Fuzzy Wuzzy&#x27;s Summary:&lt;br /&gt;ѾѾѾѾѾ Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Something in between and unique.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a fan of Listerine&#x27;s Cool Mint Mouthwash, you&#x27;ll definitely enjoy this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Thymol 0.511%  (phenol desinfectant, unique formula for anti plaque/antigingivitis);   </li>
            <li> and my teeth were amazingly clean.</li>
            <li> I even hit the full 2 minutes on my Oral B toothbrush</li>
            <li> While I cannot scientifically prove to myself the efficacy of its plaque/gingivitis preventative properties, I have always combined my brushing with Listerine and flossing (and, no, I do not believe the old Listerine commercials where it touted Listerine as being as effective as flossing, and I therefore have always used both Listerine and flossing).&lt;br</li>
            <li> that is what I keep getting shipped now and it is nowhere near as effective as this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit&lt;</li>
            <li> The taste is intense, if you like Listerine mouthwash you will love this.   </li>
            <li> The taste of this toothpaste reminds me more of Wintergreen, a flavor I really don&#x27;t care for.  </li>
            <li> My gums and the inside of my mouth were also very clean, and had a minty/astringent feel that lasted for a good half hour</li>
            <li> Seriously, the taste of this very good toothpaste is way too strong for children.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, all in all, the teeth feel clean, the breath smells fresh ....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Eitherway, it&#x27;s a good, solid toothpaste that leaves your mouth fresh.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> The toothpaste tastes pretty good, and once the initial weirdness of the idea of menthol in your mouth wares off</li>
            <li> \\&quot;New look, same great formula\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really, really sure that it can&#x27;t cure SARS, Ebola or the Swine Flu, but it feels strong enough to take care of all those and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listerine</li>
            <li> and if the dentist sees an improvement in my teeth then it will be worth it</li>
            <li> I will stick with my old favorite [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> is that it cleans and leaves your mouth with that listerine breath fresh smell.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I like it - it does freshen breath and keep it fresh for a while.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was fun to try once, but while the Listerine bottle is staying in the bathroom, the tube of Listerine toothbrush won&#x27;t make a repeat appearance.</li>
            <li> We both agreed that, after brushing, our mouths felt fresh.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really mind it and using this toothpaste makes my mouth feel clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> It may have other good things</li>
            <li> If you are accustomed to using an inch long glob of toothpaste to brush your teeth (don&#x27;t the toothpaste companies LOVE YOU!)</li>
            <li> You do, right?    </li>
            <li> I must be doing something right.    </li>
            <li> Firstly you should know this is kind of a pyschadelic blue color coming out of the tube.</li>
            <li> I have always been a Colgate kind of girl but am willing to try this entire tube and perhaps buy another one.  </li>
            <li> I found that it left a very strong aftertaste in my mouth which I did not like.  </li>
            <li> It leaves a fresh clean aftertaste and is not too sweet (unlike most other toothpastes).  </li>
            <li> toothpaste tastes very much like the minty mouthwash:  </li>
            <li> toothpaste does not foam up like my current favorite</li>
            <li> AND you use it first thing in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve rarely paid this much for a tube of toothpaste</li>
            <li> The biggest surprises for me with this toothpaste is how it taste exactly like Listerine mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> First, this is a Listerine product so if you don&#x27;t like the taste of the mouthwash you probably won&#x27;t like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing I noticed is that if you brush with it after drinking coffee, you&#x27;ll fill like you have coffee mouth again after awhile (even if you don&#x27;t drink more coffee)</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t get this exact product then go to Drug Supply Store (dot) Com.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having problems getting this exact paste on here there is another Listerine based paste that doesn&#x27;t have these ingredients:</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a pretty likeable toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Listerine Essential Care toothpaste has that distinct Listerine taste that leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> It only lasted for a minute or so, and after I used the toothpaste more often I really don&#x27;t even notice it anymore.  </li>
            <li> Is it worth the relatively high cost?</li>
            <li> The first time I used this toothpast I was very suprised.  </li>
            <li> Listerine Essential Care Toothpaste leaves your mouth with a clean, fresh feeling that lasts.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that is a requirement but somehow that foaming action makes me feel like my teeth are cleaner LOL.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Listerine was supposed to be so strong that it would whack any germ that dared cross its path when it was on duty.  </li>
            <li> Also, my dear spouse, who is presumably an adult, brushed his teeth for almost three whole seconds, spit out the paste all over the sink, rinsed with many, many glasses of water, and spent a good half hour whining about his \\&quot;burnt up mouth.\\</li>
            <li> However the blue and green mouthwash has still that great formula (did not look the others),</li>
            <li> but it is really strong!&lt;br</li>
            <li> gave this toothpaste three stars out of five because it really can&#x27;t be used by the whole family:  </li>
            <li> with all Listerine products, it has a very medicinal taste and quality to it, but it appears to work wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> may vary\\&quot; depending on how much you like the taste of Listerine.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, all I really care about is fluoride.  </li>
            <li> but I really do like this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> just they have 21% ethyl alcohol what makes them much to hursh, to agresive.</li>
            <li> choice is up to you, but I have to say I really do like this toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this tooth paste since I use Listerine</li>
            <li> She appreciated the possibility of getting the benefit of Listerine mouthwash away from home.  </li>
            <li> Could menthol really fight gingivitis and all of the foul bacteria that I do not want over-growing in my mouth?  </li>
            <li> For some reason, none of the local drug stores carry any Listerine toothpaste in their stores, so I am grateful that Amazon offers so many iterations of this product.</li>
            <li> but it is more intense than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not the flavor of the original yellow Listerine.   </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a stinging sensation, most like due to the alcohol contents.  </li>
            <li> Because it tastes and even leaves your mouth feeling just like that particular mouthwash</li>
            <li> If kind of hard to find this product in drugstores.  </li>
            <li> It tastes a lot like the mouthwash and provides similarly long-lasting fresh breath.    </li>
            <li> I have no idea, really, because I use Listerine mouthwash pretty regularly, but I wasn&#x27;t a fan of this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I really like the deep clean, lasting freshness that I get with this product.</li>
            <li> Not numb enough to make you drool or talk funny, but just enough to give it that I just had menthol in my mouth feel.  </li>
            <li> &quot; That loses a couple of stars in my book.th for almost three whole seconds, spit out the paste all over the sink, rinsed with many, many glasses of water, and spent a good half hour whining about his \\&quot;burnt up mouth.\\&quot; That loses a couple of stars in my book.</li>
            <li> It is very different from most other toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s a plus if you want an occasional break from the minty-sweet flavor of most other toothpastes, which I do.</li>
            <li> According to the labels, Listerine toothpaste has many times the percentages of active ingredients in the Listerine mouthwash she uses, and three times the percentage of fluoride in her regular toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> or a good thing (less mess?).  </li>
            <li> So if it could would I use a toothpaste with menthol in it even though it seems kind of weird at first?  </li>
            <li> always brush using a Philips Sonicare power toothbrush, and this toothpaste definitely foams up less than most toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t necessarily indicate that it does less of a job cleaning, but, some people like the old foaming action of most toothpastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was going to turn the light off to see if it was glow in the dark!</li>
            <li> Remember the old (now banned)</li>
            <li> Listerine Essential Care leaves your mouth extra fresh feeling and disinfected much in the same way as the mouthwash</li>
            <li> but when my old dentist gave me this and it took some getting used to.</li>
            <li> I plan to use this product in the morning for a kick-start to my day and save my sensitive tooth paste for bedtime use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than that it has a nice texture - it&#x27;s not overly grainy or thin.</li>
            <li> However, the fresh feeling you get from brushing with this toothpaste lasts longer than any other toothpaste I can remember.      </li>
            <li> So the combination of new fake toothpaste with mouthwash is not the same as was the good old toothpaste.</li>
            <li> special other than brush regularly.      </li>
            <li> With the vigor of the electric toothbrush, I like the fact that it foams up less than most of the other toothpastes that I use.</li>
            <li> recommend Listerine Essential Care Toothpaste to anyone who wants a clean feeling mouth and also likes or at least tolerates the taste of Listerine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a big fan of the Listerine mouthwash - it&#x27;s too intense for me to use regularly...</li>
            <li> but, well, Aqua-Fresh is just generally neat looking!    </li>
            <li> B00336EUSQ Crest 3D White Vivid Fluoride Anticavity Toothpaste Radiant Mint Flavor, 5.8-Ounce Carton (Pack of 4)]].</li>
            <li> I have all my teeth, no cavities in years, and no other problems.  </li>
            <li> The taste is certainly different from most other toothpastes: As other reviewers have mentioned, it tastes like Listerine mouthwash.</li>
            <li> It certainly tastes like listerine mouthwash, but not nearly as intense.  </li>
            <li> And the texture is  not a stiff white paste nor is it a gel.  </li>
            <li> I personally will be returning to my old toothpaste which is not so \\&quot;medicine\\&quot; smelling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;According to the packaging, this toothpaste helps prevent cavities, plaque, and gingivitis, much like almost every other toothpaste on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate the mouthwash, and after all with that good old Listerine Toothpaste one did not need the mouthwash at all.  </li>
            <li> So, if you have had the dry lips, peeling action going on this past winter, you will certainly feel the burning on the lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I want to pay so much for a toothpaste though.  </li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s all just cleaner, and fresher... and unlike other toothpaste brands I have used in the past, my mouth stays fresh for a long time after brushing.</li>
            <li> , IT IS NOT THE SAME FORMULA, and for what it is it is much to expensive, it is the same as any other cheap tothpaste.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see it being something I&#x27;d want to use long term.</li>
            <li> the other hand, if you don&#x27;t mind the Listerine taste, you&#x27;ll get a lot of the same benefits of using Listerine mouthwash.</li>
            <li> When I brush before I go to bed - I&#x27;ve found that my breath is not as funky and my mouth is not as dry using this brand.</li>
            <li> It has the same &#x27;flavor&#x27; as the mouthwash - but toned down a bit -</li>
            <li> just different than what I&#x27;ve used previously.    </li>
            <li> It tasted like wet soil.  </li>
            <li> The ones where the concerned Mother took one look at the dripping wet family member and said, \\&quot;You get out of those wet clothes.  </li>
            <li> Depending upon your personal preferences, less foaming during brushing may be a bad thing (less refreshing?)</li>
            <li> &quot; She carries toothpaste and a toothbrush with her, but certainly not a bottle of mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> The mouthwash has still the old formula with addition of alcohol which is not good.  </li>
            <li> Fluoride Anticavity Toothpaste, Extreme Herbal Mint, 4.6-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)]].</li>
            <li> The fluoride used in this paste is sodium monofluorophosphate, which the FDA says fight cavities, and it also includes other bacteria fighting ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other toothpastes, and they work,</li>
            <li> , I found the consistency that of any other toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Active ingredients for anti-plaque, anti-gingivitis make up 2%..</li>
            <li> But once you&#x27;ve started using it, it&#x27;s hard to go back to other brands - they seem like they&#x27;re for kids.</li>
            <li> I asked a family member to try this toothpaste, and the reaction was that there was no foaming like the average toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> However, my dentist seems to complain less about my teeth since I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste, so it works for me.</li>
            <li> less mint</li>
            <li> So I ordered and got that new FAKE Listerine  which is in any drugstore.</li>
            <li> When I first saw this product, Listerine Essential Care Toothpaste, I was unsure that it would work and doubtful</li>
            <li> Have been since I was a little kid.</li>
            <li> Yes, this toothpaste does taste somewhat like the mouthwash, and since I&#x27;m not a fan, it did take me a few days to get use to it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t kill all those germs that could give you a cold or the flu, but it sure smelled, tasted and felt as if it could.  </li>
            <li> but this is pretty bad.</li>
            <li> If you put a dab of this stuff on junior&#x27;s little toothbrush, you won&#x27;t get him to brush again until he&#x27;s fifty!</li>
            <li> just know you are getting fairly small sized tubes.</li>
            <li> I find it hard to \\&quot;evaluate\\</li>
            <li> But we have a hard time finding this toothpaste in retail pharmacies or grocery stores.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make an awful lot of foam, but it does get your teeth clean:  </li>
            <li> It still has some serious punch for a toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, they captured that alcohol/mint flavor</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hardly been a scientific test!    </li>
            <li> But the taste is pretty nasty</li>
            <li> Tough to say.</li>
            <li> It has menthol in it and it made my mouth feel a little numb.  </li>
            <li> As others have observed, the toothpaste itself is somewhat thin.</li>
            <li> My dentist looks in my mouth with a bored expression.  </li>
            <li> Now I could not find it anymore, just some FAKE Listerine tothpaste</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite expensive...</li>
            <li> The consistency is very thin and has no \\&quot;body\\&quot; to it.</li>
            <li> And the few times that I do, I avoid Listerine because I think it tastes terrible.</li>
            <li> It also tastes rather unpleasant (like Listerine).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very expensive, but in Amazon I found it inmediately.  </li>
            <li> So, this toothpaste isn&#x27;t that bad, if you tolerate Listerine mouthwash</li>
            <li> Bad move.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid using the Listerine at bedtime would keep me awake!!!</li>
            <li> But the worst part is the taste which is wretched.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I admit that I don&#x27;t use mouthwash. And the few times that I do, I avoid Listerine because I think it tastes terrible. Which would make you think that I wouldn&#x27;t like Listerine toothpaste. However, I&#x27;m a big fan - I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for years.     Yes, this toothpaste does taste somewhat like the mouthwash, and since I&#x27;m not a fan, it did take me a few days to get use to it. But once you&#x27;ve started using it, it&#x27;s hard to go back to other brands - they seem like they&#x27;re for kids. This seems to be a toothpaste meant for adults.    Does it work as an anti-plaque, anti-gingivitis toothpaste? Active ingredients for anti-plaque, anti-gingivitis make up 2%.. That would make you think that it&#x27;s a marketing ploy. However, my dentist seems to complain less about my teeth since I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste, so it works for me.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve used listerine before, you&#x27;ll know the flavor.  If you can&#x27;t stand it in liquid form, then you won&#x27;t like the toothpaste either.  I don&#x27;t really mind it and using this toothpaste makes my mouth feel clean and fresh.  I&#x27;m not sure I want to pay so much for a toothpaste though.  I&#x27;m going to give it a chance and if the dentist sees an improvement in my teeth then it will be worth it, otherwise I&#x27;ll go back to something cheaper.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite toothpaste.  If you like the strong Listerine mouthwash taste and \\&quot;burn\\&quot; you will like this stuff.  It is not the flavor of the original yellow Listerine.   As the package states, it is the minty version.  It still has some serious punch for a toothpaste.  It is as if they poured mouthwash it in to a tube.  Your mouth will continue to have the distinctive smell and taste of Listerine for quite some time afterwards.  And just as the mouthwash, there is antiseptic stuff included so you get a nice twofer.</li>
            <li> This is a good toothpaste, and if you like Listerine you will really like this toothpaste.  I am, however, not a big fan of Listerine, but still wanted to try this toothpaste.  I found that it left a very strong aftertaste in my mouth which I did not like.  I will stick with my old favorite [[ASIN:B001F51QE8 Crest Whitening Expressions Fluoride Anticavity Toothpaste, Extreme Herbal Mint, 4.6-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)]].</li>
            <li> I asked a family member to try this toothpaste, and the reaction was that there was no foaming like the average toothpaste.  This doesn&#x27;t necessarily indicate that it does less of a job cleaning, but, some people like the old foaming action of most toothpastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this is that it cleans and leaves your mouth with that listerine breath fresh smell.  Which means, it does the job of two products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a stinging sensation, most like due to the alcohol contents.  So, if you have had the dry lips, peeling action going on this past winter, you will certainly feel the burning on the lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, all in all, the teeth feel clean, the breath smells fresh ....all without the foaming at the mouth thing!!.....Rizzo</li>
            <li> Firstly you should know this is kind of a pyschadelic blue color coming out of the tube. I was going to turn the light off to see if it was glow in the dark! The color is not too appealing but I guess it&#x27;s just toothpaste - color isn&#x27;t that important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for its breath freshening properties those work quite well. My grandpa LOVED Listeriine and used it every day and his teeth were really good. But the smell - ugh - the smell - well you always knew it was grandpa&#x27;s bathroom by the Listerine smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste does not foam up like my current favorite [[ASIN:B00336EUSQ Crest 3D White Vivid Fluoride Anticavity Toothpaste Radiant Mint Flavor, 5.8-Ounce Carton (Pack of 4)]]. I&#x27;m not sure that is a requirement but somehow that foaming action makes me feel like my teeth are cleaner LOL. There is probably nothing scientific about that - maybe I watched too many of those scrubbing bubbles commercials as a kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for cavities and gingivitis I don&#x27;t know yet - I don&#x27;t have gingivitis but I did just find out I have some more cavities. So I&#x27;ll keep using this and see if I get any more and, if I do, I&#x27;ll update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like it - it does freshen breath and keep it fresh for a while. The reason for the 4 stars is that it does taste very strongly of Listerine and it is medicinal and kind of grandpa bathroom cabinet&#x27;y. Yes yes I know it is Listerine but it is really strong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it has a nice texture - it&#x27;s not overly grainy or thin. I like it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, way better than the top-line offerings from Crest and Colgate.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> If kind of hard to find this product in drugstores.  It&#x27;s very expensive, but in Amazon I found it inmediately.  Excelent product, I strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> So, this toothpaste isn&#x27;t that bad, if you tolerate Listerine mouthwash AND you use it first thing in the morning.  I made the critical error of rinsing my mouth with Scope, and then brushing with the Listerine toothpaste a bit later.  Bad move.  It tasted like wet soil.  Now, reversing the order (brush then rinse with mouthwash) it tastes fine, and you sure do feel clean. A good product with a great reputation, the Listerine experience is in every tube.  If you like Listerine, you&#x27;ll like the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve rarely paid this much for a tube of toothpaste but now that I&#x27;ve had a chance to try it for free I think I will buy some.  It is very different from most other toothpastes.  Not the overwhelming minty flavor but refreshing in its own way.  And the texture is  not a stiff white paste nor is it a gel.  Something in between and unique.  I am very much enjoying it.</li>
            <li> If you like the strong, clean feeling that Listerine mouthwash provides, then this is a toothpaste that you might like. It tastes a lot like the mouthwash and provides similarly long-lasting fresh breath.    As others have observed, the toothpaste itself is somewhat thin. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s problematically so...just different than what I&#x27;ve used previously.    I feel ill-equipped to evaluate the quality of the tooth-cleaning that it provides since I can only provide my anecdotal experience. So far, so good...but it&#x27;s hardly been a scientific test!    Is it worth the relatively high cost? Tough to say. Ten bucks a tube is a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> Remember the old (now banned) Listerine commercials?  The ones where the concerned Mother took one look at the dripping wet family member and said, \\&quot;You get out of those wet clothes.  I&#x27;ll go get the Listerine.\\&quot; (If you remember, you&#x27;re probably a fossil like me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listerine was supposed to be so strong that it would whack any germ that dared cross its path when it was on duty.  Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t kill all those germs that could give you a cold or the flu, but it sure smelled, tasted and felt as if it could.  That&#x27;s the perfect description of Listerine Toothpaste. I&#x27;m really, really sure that it can&#x27;t cure SARS, Ebola or the Swine Flu, but it feels strong enough to take care of all those and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listerine toothpaste tastes very much like the minty mouthwash:  minty, but with a very strong aftertaste of clove oil. It doesn&#x27;t make an awful lot of foam, but it does get your teeth clean:  I used a disclosing mouthwash (it has a dye in it that colors the plaque you missed when brushing) afterward and my teeth were amazingly clean. They felt like I had just been to the dental hygienist. My gums and the inside of my mouth were also very clean, and had a minty/astringent feel that lasted for a good half hour afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One HUGE warning:  This toothpaste is not for children.  If you put a dab of this stuff on junior&#x27;s little toothbrush, you won&#x27;t get him to brush again until he&#x27;s fifty! Seriously, the taste of this very good toothpaste is way too strong for children. Kids don&#x27;t need more than a teeny dot of toothpaste on their brushes until they know that they shouldn&#x27;t swallow the stuff. There should be no danger with this stuff - although there&#x27;s probably a kid out there who likes the taste and will make a fool out of me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this toothpaste three stars out of five because it really can&#x27;t be used by the whole family:  kids will likely go on toothbrush strike when you bring this home.  Also, my dear spouse, who is presumably an adult, brushed his teeth for almost three whole seconds, spit out the paste all over the sink, rinsed with many, many glasses of water, and spent a good half hour whining about his \\&quot;burnt up mouth.\\&quot; That loses a couple of stars in my book.th for almost three whole seconds, spit out the paste all over the sink, rinsed with many, many glasses of water, and spent a good half hour whining about his \\&quot;burnt up mouth.\\&quot; That loses a couple of stars in my book.</li>
            <li> Listerine&#x27;s Essential Care Powerful Mint toothpaste leaves your mouth with an excellent clean feeling.  If you&#x27;re a fan of Listerine&#x27;s Cool Mint Mouthwash, you&#x27;ll definitely enjoy this toothpaste.  Why?  Because it tastes and even leaves your mouth feeling just like that particular mouthwash does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the packaging, this toothpaste helps prevent cavities, plaque, and gingivitis, much like almost every other toothpaste on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What sets this toothpaste apart is the cleanliness you&#x27;ll feel after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all Listerine products, it has a very medicinal taste and quality to it, but it appears to work wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend Listerine Essential Care Toothpaste to anyone who wants a clean feeling mouth and also likes or at least tolerates the taste of Listerine.</li>
            <li> Listerine Essential Care toothpaste has that distinct Listerine taste that leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean.  I have always liked it.  The fluoride used in this paste is sodium monofluorophosphate, which the FDA says fight cavities, and it also includes other bacteria fighting ingredients.  Like most toothpastes, if you brush well, it will work just fine!</li>
            <li> This is a very good toothpaste. It tastes flat out great. Best tasting toothpaste I have ever used. I even hit the full 2 minutes on my Oral B toothbrush more often it tastes so good. It also is a time save that it also acts as mouthwash that is spouse approved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to disagree with the reviews that say it taste like Listerine. Not any Listerine I have used. This has a minty,slightly sweet taste, with a pleasant consistency (no I don&#x27;t eat my toothpaste, but it just feels good and tastes good while in the mouth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I do recommend it. However know what you are ordering. The tubes are 4.2 ounces. Check what you currently use. I use an 8 ounce tube so just know you are getting fairly small sized tubes. Bigger than travel size, but not the size you might be expecting. But if you are ok with that, this is an excellent toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Aqua-Fresh kind of person. Have been since I was a little kid. I&#x27;ve used other toothpastes, and they work, but, well, Aqua-Fresh is just generally neat looking!    This toothpaste does not look neat. It also tastes rather unpleasant (like Listerine). But it does seem to get the job done. I used it, it worked well, and that&#x27;s ok. But the taste is pretty nasty and I don&#x27;t see it being something I&#x27;d want to use long term. I guess it&#x27;s a case of \\&quot;your mileage may vary\\&quot; depending on how much you like the taste of Listerine.</li>
            <li> The biggest surprises for me with this toothpaste is how it taste exactly like Listerine mouthwash.  Seriously, they captured that alcohol/mint flavor perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So congratulations to all of the scientific know-how that went into recreating that flavor in a toothpaste form, but...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out that what tasted good in a mouthwash doesn&#x27;t taste good in a toothpaste.  Maybe it is the amount of time the flavor spends in your mouth?  I have no idea, really, because I use Listerine mouthwash pretty regularly, but I wasn&#x27;t a fan of this toothpaste.  Too medicinal tasting, not minty enough...bleach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was fun to try once, but while the Listerine bottle is staying in the bathroom, the tube of Listerine toothbrush won&#x27;t make a repeat appearance.</li>
            <li> இ Fuzzy Wuzzy&#x27;s Summary:&lt;br /&gt;ѾѾѾѾѾ Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you like this toothpaste may well depend upon whether you can stand the taste of Listerine for the sake of its advertised germ-killing hygiene.  While I cannot scientifically prove to myself the efficacy of its plaque/gingivitis preventative properties, I have always combined my brushing with Listerine and flossing (and, no, I do not believe the old Listerine commercials where it touted Listerine as being as effective as flossing, and I therefore have always used both Listerine and flossing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always brush using a Philips Sonicare power toothbrush, and this toothpaste definitely foams up less than most toothpastes.  Depending upon your personal preferences, less foaming during brushing may be a bad thing (less refreshing?) or a good thing (less mess?).  With the vigor of the electric toothbrush, I like the fact that it foams up less than most of the other toothpastes that I use.</li>
            <li> I really like the deep clean, lasting freshness that I get with this product. Minty taste that is not medicinal at all. Paste is okay but I prefer the gel form. Could find locally so finding it on amazon was wonderful and convenient.</li>
            <li> First, this is a Listerine product so if you don&#x27;t like the taste of the mouthwash you probably won&#x27;t like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, if you don&#x27;t mind the Listerine taste, you&#x27;ll get a lot of the same benefits of using Listerine mouthwash. Listerine Essential Care leaves your mouth extra fresh feeling and disinfected much in the same way as the mouthwash does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste isn&#x27;t quite as strong tasting as the mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eitherway, it&#x27;s a good, solid toothpaste that leaves your mouth fresh.</li>
            <li> It has fluoride.  It may have other good things but I&#x27;m not well versed enough in the minutia of toothpaste to tell.    It certainly tastes like listerine mouthwash, but not nearly as intense.  That&#x27;s good because you brush your teeth for a full two minutes.  Don&#x27;t you?  You do, right?    Over the years I&#x27;ve used lots of brands of toothpaste.  Except for the ones that look and/or taste like candy.  Those freak me out a bit - like brushing with a snickers.  Otherwise, all I really care about is fluoride.  I have all my teeth, no cavities in years, and no other problems.  My dentist looks in my mouth with a bored expression.  I must be doing something right.    Anyways, in these days of bottled water a lot of us don&#x27;t get fluoride from our tap water.  Mouthwash and toothpaste take care of that problem.  This listerine toothpaste is perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a big fan of the Listerine mouthwash - it&#x27;s too intense for me to use regularly... but I really do like this toothpaste. It has the same &#x27;flavor&#x27; as the mouthwash - but toned down a bit - this is not the same experience as swishing Listerine in your mouth where you think your tongue is going to dissolve... but it is more intense than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After brushing with Listerine toothpaste, my mouth - my breath - it&#x27;s all just cleaner, and fresher... and unlike other toothpaste brands I have used in the past, my mouth stays fresh for a long time after brushing. When I brush before I go to bed - I&#x27;ve found that my breath is not as funky and my mouth is not as dry using this brand. It&#x27;s not just tooth brushing - it&#x27;s an experience!</li>
            <li> I find it hard to \\&quot;evaluate\\&quot; a tube of toothpaste. Taste - great; easy to clean off the sink - great (don&#x27;t be fooled - some toothpastes are like glue when stuck to the bowl of a sink). Breath after brushing - great. I like the way my teeth feel after cleaning them with this toothpaste.I don&#x27;t know about the long-term effects of the Listerine part - I don&#x27;t have gingivitis, but I suspect that if I keep using this toothpaste, I never will. All-in-all a good value and one I&#x27;ll be looking for when I visit the toothpaste aisle.</li>
            <li> The taste is certainly different from most other toothpastes: As other reviewers have mentioned, it tastes like Listerine mouthwash. And the \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; feeling and aftertaste from this toothpaste is therefore much different as well.  But that&#x27;s a plus if you want an occasional break from the minty-sweet flavor of most other toothpastes, which I do.</li>
            <li> I was using Listerine Tothpaste for 3 years and that was so good, had no plaque at all(was not by dentist for cleaning). That was the one with following formula:   Eucalyptol 0.7%;   Menthol 0.34%,   Methyl  Salicylate 0.4%;   Thymol 0.511%  (phenol desinfectant, unique formula for anti plaque/antigingivitis);   sodium monofluorophosphate 0.76 % (any toothpaste has this).  Now I could not find it anymore, just some FAKE Listerine tothpaste, it has only the sodium mono fluorophosphate 0.76%. The mouthwash has still the old formula with addition of alcohol which is not good.  I hate the mouthwash, and after all with that good old Listerine Toothpaste one did not need the mouthwash at all.  So I ordered and got that new FAKE Listerine  which is in any drugstore. Seem that the produced had changed the formula of toothpaste to push people to buy that awakwrd maouthwash on which they probably make more money.  SHAME ON PRODUCER (Johnson&amp;Jonhnson, Skilman NJ) what they did.  I am a scientist ( PhD chemist) and they can not fool me with that title on box \\&quot;New look, same great formula\\&quot;, IT IS NOT THE SAME FORMULA, and for what it is it is much to expensive, it is the same as any other cheap tothpaste.  However the blue and green mouthwash has still that great formula (did not look the others), just they have 21% ethyl alcohol what makes them much to hursh, to agresive. So the combination of new fake toothpaste with mouthwash is not the same as was the good old toothpaste.</li>
            <li> From my childhood I remember having a Listerine bottle in my bathroom.  I remember trying it and almost gagging from the severity of the taste.  But man that stuff works. But I digress.  When I first saw this product, Listerine Essential Care Toothpaste, I was unsure that it would work and doubtful I could stand the taste.  And the taste is strong -- there is no doubt about that.  However, the fresh feeling you get from brushing with this toothpaste lasts longer than any other toothpaste I can remember.      Blue in color, I found the consistency that of any other toothpaste. That&#x27;s where the similarities end.  Listerine Essential Care Toothpaste leaves your mouth with a clean, fresh feeling that lasts.  You don&#x27;t have to do anything special other than brush regularly.      I have always been a Colgate kind of girl but am willing to try this entire tube and perhaps buy another one.  That&#x27;s how much I liked the way this toothpaste works.  I would definitely buy this product again.    Natalie S. for Amazon Vine</li>
            <li> If you like Listerine, this toothpaste is honestly a no-brainer. I happen to like the taste, since I use their mouthwash, too, but I can understand if others don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) It&#x27;s not gritty tasting.&lt;br /&gt;2.) Because it&#x27;s blue, you can tell if you washed it all out of your sink if your sink is white! :-)&lt;br /&gt;3.) It&#x27;s quite expensive...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good toothpaste, but is it worth the expense over Crest or Colgate? Who knows! My teeth feel good afterwards, but they did after Colgate and Crest etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The choice is up to you, but I have to say I really do like this toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars out of 5.</li>
            <li> Cleans your teeth and tastes pretty good. The only thing I noticed is that if you brush with it after drinking coffee, you&#x27;ll fill like you have coffee mouth again after awhile (even if you don&#x27;t drink more coffee)</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is the best.....We have great checkups.  But we have a hard time finding this toothpaste in retail pharmacies or grocery stores.  Wal-Mart used to carry it.  It is now gone from there shelves too....So I have been buying on line.</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t get this exact product then go to Drug Supply Store (dot) Com. This stuff is so great that I only have to brush my teeth once a day and the dentist always compliments my brushing skills!! IMHO I love the strong taste but when my old dentist gave me this and it took some getting used to. I also use one of those cheapo electric toothbrushes just fyi. I&#x27;ve been having problems getting this exact paste on here there is another Listerine based paste that doesn&#x27;t have these ingredients: [Eucalyptol (0.738%) (Antiplaque/antigingivitis), Menthol (0.340%), Methyl Salicylate (0.480%), Thymol (0.511%)] and that is what I keep getting shipped now and it is nowhere near as effective as this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit&lt;br /&gt;It may not be listed as \\&quot;active\\&quot; ingredients but you can sill get this with the above things listed in the product ingredents.</li>
            <li> If you are accustomed to using an inch long glob of toothpaste to brush your teeth (don&#x27;t the toothpaste companies LOVE YOU!) you might want to have a defibrillator handy when you try this product.  The taste is intense, if you like Listerine mouthwash you will love this.   It  effectively combines teeth cleaning and breath freshening into one step, saving time and eliminating one product off the bathroom vanity.  I plan to use this product in the morning for a kick-start to my day and save my sensitive tooth paste for bedtime use.  I&#x27;m afraid using the Listerine at bedtime would keep me awake!!!</li>
            <li> This Listerine toothpaste does a good job of cleaning your teeth and freshening your breathe, tho I would prefer a different flavor.  The taste of this toothpaste reminds me more of Wintergreen, a flavor I really don&#x27;t care for.  To me this tastes more like Wintergreen, and less mint flavored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to try this because I do like their mouthwash, which is also effective at freshening your breath.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this tooth paste since I use Listerine Advance mouth wash on a daily basis but this is pretty bad. The consistency is very thin and has no \\&quot;body\\&quot; to it. I would definitely no consider this a paste even though the box says it is a paste. But the worst part is the taste which is wretched. Something like a rubber tire/plastic-y flavor which took several brushes with my regular tooth paste to get the flavor out.</li>
            <li> There were two of us who tried this Listerine product and found that it worked as described.&lt;br /&gt;It is super strong and smells just like a bottle of Listerine-what a shock....I guess I was hoping that it would be a bit more mild than it is.&lt;br /&gt;The smell seems to permiate the house when it is used.  So I suppose it it air freshener along with the tooth paste/mouth wash.&lt;br /&gt;When your breath needs a lot of freshening, this is the product for you!  I personally will be returning to my old toothpaste which is not so \\&quot;medicine\\&quot; smelling.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both used Listerine Essential Care toothpaste, since we are long-time users of Listerine mouthwash.  She&#x27;s a Colgate toothpaste user.  I use Aim.  We both liked  Listerine toothpaste&#x27;s pleasant minty taste.  My wife found it to be a welcome addition to her \\&quot;oral care arsenal.\\&quot; She carries toothpaste and a toothbrush with her, but certainly not a bottle of mouthwash.  She appreciated the possibility of getting the benefit of Listerine mouthwash away from home.  According to the labels, Listerine toothpaste has many times the percentages of active ingredients in the Listerine mouthwash she uses, and three times the percentage of fluoride in her regular toothpaste.  We both agreed that, after brushing, our mouths felt fresh.  It&#x27;s too early to tell if the toothpaste is good at preventing cavities, but we will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this toothpast I was very suprised.  It has menthol in it and it made my mouth feel a little numb.  Not numb enough to make you drool or talk funny, but just enough to give it that I just had menthol in my mouth feel.  It only lasted for a minute or so, and after I used the toothpaste more often I really don&#x27;t even notice it anymore.  Could menthol really fight gingivitis and all of the foul bacteria that I do not want over-growing in my mouth?  Maybe.  So if it could would I use a toothpaste with menthol in it even though it seems kind of weird at first?  Yea, after trying it- I think so.  The toothpaste tastes pretty good, and once the initial weirdness of the idea of menthol in your mouth wares off it&#x27;s a pretty likeable toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste ever.</li>
            <li> Listerine Tooth Paste has all the necessary ingredients to best oral care by clearing all the germs to keep one very healthy..</li>
            <li> Listerine toothpaste is the only brand I will use.  It leaves a fresh clean aftertaste and is not too sweet (unlike most other toothpastes).  I ordered the paste inadvertently (I would give the gel five stars), but am still quite pleased with the product.  For some reason, none of the local drug stores carry any Listerine toothpaste in their stores, so I am grateful that Amazon offers so many iterations of this product.</li>
            <li> The product sent to me was not the one advertised and did not contain the specific ingredients as advertised.  Bait and switch!</li>
