            <li>This is a great shampoo to make you BALD.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>it would be a great product -</li>
            <li>ALSO, MY HAIR SEEMED TO BE GREASY AT ROOTS OF HAIR, FROM SCALP TO ABOUT 2 INCHES OFF OF MY HEAD, THEN THE REST BECAME STATIC-Y AND FLY AWAY.  </li>
            <li>Smell is great...</li>
            <li>it went badly lol.</li>
            <li>It smells great too.</li>
            <li>I no longer have frizzy fly aways, my hair is manageable, my hair is silky and lightweight.  </li>
            <li>I bought this at a discount store for $5.50 not expecting a great product.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t think it was that great.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love this stuff!!</li>
            <li>I noticed I had a tingling feeling on my scalp (it was very nice)</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing!  </li>
            <li>Nice!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have the greatest smell, and I don&#x27;t see that it works better than any of the lower-priced cleansing conditioners.</li>
            <li>I have used no heat equipment and no product and it looks better now than on my best styled days.</li>
            <li>Smells great and feels good on my scalp.</li>
            <li>to use and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>That is a pleasant change!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so happy I did because it is amazing.</li>
            <li>It does smell good though.</li>
            <li>use 10 pumps on the hair in front of me and work it through really, really good...</li>
            <li>If this had an easier dispensing pump or was available in a tub to scoop out it would be absolutely PERFECT!!</li>
            <li>product was maybe one tenth as good as wen.</li>
            <li>Almost as good as Wen.</li>
            <li>had been looking for something cheaper, affordable, and good for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It smells really good- like</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how good my hair looks this morning.  </li>
            <li>Well, it did smell good.</li>
            <li>so I took a chance on this product because the price was good</li>
            <li>It smells really good and doesn&#x27;t leave a build up on my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as good as the &amp;#34;W&amp;#34; product, but at a more affordable price!</li>
            <li>So many of you said this was a great product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been happy with that regimen but wanted to try products that were more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; and didn&#x27;t strip my hair of oil.</li>
            <li>I love this my hair loves it !</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>My favorite thing about this is that I can use it as a leave in conditioner too!</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This cleansing product I absolutely love!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I like it better than Wen or HairOne!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching it!</li>
            <li>Glad I stocked up!</li>
            <li>The price is amazing for this miracle.</li>
            <li>it was amazing the difference.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, I combine it with</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell, feel, and easiness of this product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It delivers the moisture that any of those \\&quot;Deep\\&quot; or \\&quot;Intensive\\&quot; mostuire and repair masks you see on the haircare aisle, but it cleanses away nicely.</li>
            <li>2.)it is a nice cleansing conditioner that hasn&#x27;t caused me to lose hair or made me feel greasy and gunky up there   </li>
            <li>I decided to see if it was online, and I was thrilled to find it here.  </li>
            <li>This is really some great stuff!!</li>
            <li>This product still seems good, but a bit thinner/less effective than WEN, so I just have to use more product.  </li>
            <li>mi*t)but IS effective.  </li>
            <li>felt compelled to update my review and give this product more stars because  my hair looks good now.</li>
            <li>And I really liked Wen.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled</li>
            <li>and I really liked the way they treat my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>a nice spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So there&#x27;s two nice things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>IT IS VERY EASY TO USE, ALTHOUGH YOU DO HAVE TO USE A LOT OF THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li>As far as the results, I wasn&#x27;t much impressed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too drying, it cleans well, has the perfect consistency and leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>This smells wonderful, cleans my oily hair well, and leaves it feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>It adds a mild tingle and great refreshing smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why I  didn&#x27;t learn about sulfate and paraben free hair cleansers before, but they are absolutely the best!</li>
            <li>I like the consistency of this product better than Wen, it feels like its easier to work into my scalp and more effective at cleansing.</li>
            <li>It advertises Tea Tree and Avocado, and both are close to the top of the list,  </li>
            <li>So pleased, and my wallet is, too :-).</li>
            <li>Great product,  woorks very well.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t go more than 1 day without washing my hair with this product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just an okay product for me.</li>
            <li>There are better cleanser conditioner products out there, This one is okay.</li>
            <li>It was so much better than I imagined, but I still wasn&#x27;t keen on the price.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad that I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>Now, my hair is one of my better assets.</li>
            <li>and them put 1 more pump in and work that</li>
            <li>The more I have been using this the better my hair has been getting.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I tried my friend&#x27;s Wen and it was ok.</li>
            <li>Glad it did :)</li>
            <li>I have finally found the perfect hair care.</li>
            <li>The directions on the bottle say that the more you use the better the product works.</li>
            <li>Hmm - just seems like a way to get you to use up the bottle faster so you can buy more.</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>and i LOVE the scent.</li>
            <li>After reading couples of lovely reviews for this shampoo I ordered it and after using that all of my day I used to collect my hair from bath tub,rug,bathroom floor,towel,bed,cushion etc.etc.etc.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>and I love that feeling.</li>
            <li>This product is just ok.  </li>
            <li>Looks so much more healthier.</li>
            <li>Love this --but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not Wen, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>After my coworker gave me her surplus Wen, I fell in love and had to find a cheaper alternative.</li>
            <li>This one is the perfect middle ground for my hair type: Cleaning, but also moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It works ok</li>
            <li>but WEN is still better...</li>
            <li>My hair looked and felt better doing the co-wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So glad that I discovered this conditioner/cleanser.</li>
            <li>you like Wen, you&#x27;ll love Lisa Rachel&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I love Wen, I like this.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really glad for the price tag.  </li>
            <li>The price is way better than Wen.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love Lisa Rachel.</li>
            <li>I use it as a leave-in conditioner that makes my hair feel thicker and healthy.</li>
            <li>environment as it produces its oils in a more balanced way.</li>
            <li>With this &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; my hair feels better after each use.</li>
            <li>(the water is more to spread it through) as leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t quite as good, but, for the price, I feel it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>I brushed it out the best I could and</li>
            <li>tried using this product so many ways based on the reviews</li>
            <li>this helps! :)</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner combo.</li>
            <li>even as I type this, I still feel the refreshing tingle of the Tea Tree Oil.</li>
            <li>There is now a bald spot on my head and my scalp shows more in the parting of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have stopped using this cleanser and will update on the regrowth of my hair.</li>
            <li>so I figured it was a safe bet.</li>
            <li>Wen worked better.</li>
            <li>how my hair feels after, it cleans better than wen and feels lighter</li>
            <li>Love this for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love how my hair feels and behaves using this product.</li>
            <li>but I like this one for me personally so much better.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>get so many compliments on my hair</li>
            <li>My hair and scalp felt clean but most of all moisturized!</li>
            <li>, I can feel it working!\\&quot; which isn&#x27;t true because if you could feel this working how come effective products without menthol don&#x27;t deliver any sensationswhere you feel it \\&quot;working\\&quot; ?</li>
            <li>Pretty good, but I prefer Hair One products, after trying both.</li>
            <li>It gives me beautiful soft curls (I have wavy frizzy hair) and keeps my hair tamed for days.</li>
            <li>Most of the Wen scents have a mint or menthol undertone - not this strong - so I&#x27;ve been using the Kid&#x27;s Apple, which does not.</li>
            <li>This product was just more easily available, my favorite requires a trip to specialty beauty store or</li>
            <li>not as good as wen, but definitively does the job at a more reasonable price, would def.</li>
            <li>and I use a sulfate free sudsy shampoo once every 2 weeks just to make sure I have no build up</li>
            <li>and I was so happy with how soft it made their hair.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for my natural, wash and go hairstyle.</li>
            <li>I like the cool refreshing feeling it makes on my scalp :)</li>
            <li>Even more amazing was how fast my hair grew in a year (pixie cut to touching my shoulders) and</li>
            <li>so I was looking for something as good that did not cost so much.</li>
            <li>I have used other wen type products but this one is the best.</li>
            <li>Just follow the easy directions and your hair will be softer and easier to manage.  </li>
            <li>, it makes it easy to style</li>
            <li>As good or better than WEN as far as how the product itself works for my hair.  </li>
            <li>The formula is strong but there are some issues I would like to address.</li>
            <li>Instead I&#x27;ve found Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special which works loads better.</li>
            <li>liked this product at first but just changed my rating and am editing my review.</li>
            <li>I have been using this shampoo for over a year now and my hair not only looks beautiful</li>
            <li>It appears as though the majority of people who are reviewing this product have fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I am a caucasian with fine , shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li>I read in description &amp;#34;good for fine hair&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;NOT</li>
            <li>Made my fine hair sooo</li>
            <li>At first, I thought maybe I just wasn&#x27;t use to such awesome shine, but</li>
            <li>Thanks Lisa Rachel for making healthy hair care affordable!</li>
            <li>Works great and makes my scalp feel fresh and my hair is soft!</li>
            <li>I only wash my hair every three days and it looks great.</li>
            <li>Review for Lisa Rachel Sulfate Free Conditioner &amp; Cleanser with Tea Tree Oil &amp; Avocado for Damaged Hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I think I will not get it re-done since this product makes my hair so silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li>After seeing all the hype about lather -free, I decided to give it a try..nothing like all the hype..</li>
            <li>Unless the results you&#x27;re looking for involve the ability to fry an egg in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another big problem I experienced with this product had nothing to do with my hair-</li>
            <li>have AA hair, and this does a great job of actually conditioning the strands and combating dryness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have been washing with sulfate free shampoos for years and washing with conditioner rather than shampoo for over a year.</li>
            <li>the free two day shipping allows me to wait till my bottle runs out then order</li>
            <li>hair looks and feels fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling gorgeous and soft.</li>
            <li>ive tried wen and this product is just as good for about a third the cost, love it</li>
            <li>We have nice hair... soft, shiny, manageable and healthy.</li>
            <li>I had to use 2-3xs as much!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s very important to thoroughly saturate and rub your scalp and rinse your hair with water first</li>
            <li>I love the fact that the ingredients are much more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; than the ones in the shampoo and conditioner I normally use and it doesn&#x27;t have any sulfates.</li>
            <li>I have used many a cleansing conditioners/ co washes and this is comparable to a lot of the higher end ones.</li>
            <li>The first day I used the product, my hair seemed ok.</li>
            <li>I am in love and will be ordering more of this 10 dollar fix instead of my old 65 dollar shampoo and 30 conditioner!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I was using the correct amount before so my hair wasn&#x27;t getting clean.</li>
            <li>Also, my hair felt surprisingly clean when I was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels &amp; smells clean too.</li>
            <li>I felt really clean and it refreshed my scalp.</li>
            <li>When I rinse the conditioning cleanser out of my hair, it feels tangled and matted (but clean).  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this miracle product! :)</li>
            <li>The conditioner contains sweet almond oil, Avocado oil, Aloe Leaf Juice, Hydrolized Wheat Protein, and Tea Tree oil.  </li>
            <li>None of the claims they made turned out to be true.</li>
            <li>(sweet almond</li>
            <li>Honestly, it leaves my hair softer than Wen - wow.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to read the instructions on the label and it kind of suggests to use</li>
            <li>/&gt; If your hair is very course then would work okay.</li>
            <li>This product did help with my scalp irritation, but that&#x27;s probably the only good thing I can say about it....</li>
            <li>So this has definitely given me a great boost in making my hair a little bit more healthy!</li>
            <li>I saw this at Ross and quickly searched reviews online before buying.</li>
            <li>Feels fresh and clean.also make sure u rinse it out very well at the scalp.</li>
            <li>But, I do wash with a mild organic shampoo once a week.</li>
            <li>This seems to condition &amp; detangle well, and the smell does fade out quickly.</li>
            <li>I already am familiar with the amazing benefits of tea tree oil and thought I would give this a try since it&#x27;s supposedly similar to Wen.</li>
            <li>I used it today for the first time after using Wen for a while and my hair was not as smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I use this product consistently, although, I use it as a \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot; and still follow up with a light conditioner.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m extremely happy I found a cleansing &amp;conditioning product that doesn&#x27;t contain lavender which I&#x27;m extremely allergic to !</li>
            <li>This product is actually pretty good: I use WEN products for last 10 years but they keep wanting to ship every 2 months which caused me to have like 6 boxes un-used.</li>
            <li>My hair is colored and now cut in a short pixie-style, but I STILL had to use more of this product, than I did, of Wen, when my hair was mid-length!</li>
            <li>so we shall see if it&#x27;s even better which I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised !</li>
            <li>I am ordering in volume next time for sure!</li>
            <li>anyway to sum it up - this one is the best and my hair is processed, blonde and tends to be dry.</li>
            <li>I have really fine hair that was really damaged from over processing</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>here!It&#x27;s definately worth it</li>
            <li>I could feel a nice cooling sensation on my scalp when I let it sit for about 5 minutes and found that the product smelled a bit like menthol or something similar.</li>
            <li>Fortunately the smell, which was light, completely went away when I rinsed my hair.</li>
            <li>Once you get that worked out, though, via trial and error, it does make your hair look nice, and it isn&#x27;t as drying as using a traditional shampoo followed by a conditioner.</li>
            <li>But it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>hair is actually soft afterward too, which is a challenging accomplishment!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>The company is very customer friendly and very willing to help if you have a problem with your order.  </li>
            <li>As I researched more I learned that your hair (natural oils) have to adjust.  </li>
            <li>So there are some good nutrient dense oils, some anti inflamitories, and the wheat protein, and when paired with gentle and nonharmful silicones and petrochemicals, it makes for a creamy and effective cleansing conditioner that doesnt stick to your hair (as long as you only use it 2-4 times a week).</li>
            <li>I felt obliged to post a well-deserved review right away.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Wen in the past and honestly Wen is slightly better but too overpriced.</li>
            <li>Now my hair lies down nice and when I pull it up for work the pony tail even moves freely and the brittle look is gone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You really do have to use a lot of the product, and it doesn&#x27;t make for a quick shower, but I think it is TOTALLY WORTH</li>
            <li>it definitely much better than general shampoo, so I might keep using it when I cant afford wen.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I noticed a difference after the first cleansing and it only got better after each use.</li>
            <li>and I can see great improvement such as I have an easy time getting the snarls out and the frizz is down by 85%</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this product because I wanted something natural and good for my hair.</li>
            <li>my hair is shinier, more manageable and never dry - you know the blondes that look like their hair is straw or hay.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use very much each time, so it lasts a while.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping also.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much Lisa Rachel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;If Dean Wen was the first to create cleansing conditioner my thanks to him, I love Lisa Rachel&#x27;s version and will use for as long it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>This is the first cleansing conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>without the menthol and unecessary fragrance oils/extracts, this would be a stellar cowash/cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li>and honestly it&#x27;s not that great at all.</li>
            <li>Once I did, I was very dissappointed!</li>
            <li>and I won&#x27;t have to EVER worry about running out of the &#x27;real thing&#x27; again!</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about this was how my hair was not already drying in the towel.</li>
            <li>use 10 pumps at the top and back of my hair and work that</li>
            <li>I saw and felt the difference after the first use.</li>
            <li>This is cheaper, more moisturizing and so much better smelling (but not overwhelming like the L&#x27;Oreal product)  </li>
            <li>She told me that she did not like Wen when she first started using it, but gave the product a month to work and found that her hair was softer and shinier than at first.</li>
            <li>I used to have to use many different products to keep the frizzies away</li>
            <li>glad I only paid $11.00.....</li>
            <li>but unfortunately it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>Weird, but great!</li>
            <li>I have purchased it at the only beauty supply that I can find it, but they are always running out and it can take 3-4 weeks or more for them to put it on their shelves.</li>
            <li>I tested on my 4 year old son and his silky smooth hair changed to sticky, no-shine hair in just 2 uses.</li>
            <li>I have used this for the last month and love the way my hair feels after using it.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t it why you&#x27;re trying these products in the first place?</li>
            <li>FIRST OF ALL, IT SMELLS</li>
            <li>The first time I washed my hair with this</li>
            <li>product is actually similar to wen, but wen is much more thicker and richer.</li>
            <li>It did not make my hair light and soft like wen did</li>
            <li>I tried it for the first time</li>
            <li>So, first time I used it, I did minimum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d brush it, and 5 minutes later wouldn&#x27;t be able to run my fingers through my hair.  </li>
            <li>but I love it for mid to ends.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel the tingle when I first put it on my hair</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a cleansing wash</li>
            <li>It is a better price than WEN, but it&#x27;s also a smaller bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll write more after I&#x27;ve used it several times if I notice anything else.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use as much of the product as recommended because I have fine, wavy hair, but I can tell that even in using less product my hair is more moisturized and it has a richer, healthier look to it</li>
            <li>You could hardly see my split ends after using this product, I tried the Wen stuff and wasn&#x27;t impressed especially for the price</li>
            <li>which is naturally curly and somewhat coarse looks AMAZING.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling clean and soft -</li>
            <li>I have relaxed, color treated hair and this product leaves my hair soft, feeling fuller, shiny and clean.</li>
            <li>Wen rinses clean and leaves your hair soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any of the clean soft feeling</li>
            <li>natural curly hair was soft, shiny and the curls were more defined.</li>
            <li>The bottle also says the longer you leave it in, the better the results, so I used it at the very beginning of my shower, and left it in for the duration, so about 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but the experience has been a total success so far :)</li>
            <li>I really want it to be long, healthy, and</li>
            <li>What I love about this product, is after a few minutes in the shower with this on my head my scalp starts to get a cool tingly feeling</li>
            <li>At one point I even used FORTY FIVE pumps because the back of the bottle says \\&quot;the more you use, the better the results!\\&quot; Let me be the first to tell you this is not true.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine textured, long and very straight</li>
            <li>I have very dry hair, and I&#x27;ve always had so many problems.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and packaged well.</li>
            <li>Before Lisa Rachel I could pull my hair out with gently running my hand through it (after conditioners both rinse out and leave-in types).</li>
            <li>You  have to use so much</li>
            <li>Works really well</li>
            <li>and as I was rinsing it came out very well.</li>
            <li>and it comes out really, really nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This really seemed to help with that.</li>
            <li>She said to keep trying it, but I did not want to spend that much money</li>
            <li>This product really delivers.</li>
            <li>Thanks Lisa Rachel who ever you are for making a product that really works and doesn&#x27;t cost and arm and a leg.</li>
            <li>So, I did the same thing with this Lisa Rachel sulfate free shampoo and conditioner for damaged hair</li>
            <li>Thought I would give this a try because it was said that it was WEN-LIKE,and much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper</li>
            <li>I lost so much hair</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t recognized much increased thickness since I started a month ago but the hair loss is all but gone.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this product would really make a difference with my frizzies.  </li>
            <li>FIVE STARS for Irene Gari Lisa Rachel Shampoo for giving us something that really works.</li>
            <li>and the ends felt like they were very stiff.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also really like the addition of tea tree in this.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely prefer the smell of tea tree eo that the label touts</li>
            <li>I like this... just not as much as Wen.</li>
            <li>but I cant say that it helped much.  </li>
            <li>LIKE NOXEMA STRAIGHT FROM THE BOTTLE, BUT DOESN&#x27;T MAKE YOUR HAIR SMELL</li>
            <li>VERY WELL.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to try Wen for years but did not want to spend that much money.  </li>
            <li>I did not expect too much for this product, but I hoped it could be better.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>(fast forward to the bottom for results, this is my background)</li>
            <li>The Price and the Results have me hooked, I really hope I feel this way in a month</li>
            <li>It is truly worth living through a week to two of greasiness to let your hair regain its natural oil balance.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Very nourishing.</li>
            <li>but after seeing so many WEN commercials, I was really curious to try a conditioning cleanser to see if it helped.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, my scalp felt really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was just really, REALLY greasy.  </li>
            <li>It took two bottles before I really noticed the damage repaired.</li>
            <li>With the Wen costing so much money, I decide to give this a try.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like the product.</li>
            <li>As I Am Co-Wash and CHI Silk Treatment; my hair is so much betten than with using shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>I really like this product..</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to pay so much for the Wen products because it just seems like paying for their marketing/ads.</li>
            <li>AND I don&#x27;t really need any styling products, except maybe a bit of styling paste for my bangs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t been this soft since I was in elementary</li>
            <li>The scent is VERY menthol-ish.</li>
            <li>I really like this cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li>Wen is a more complete product in my opinion, one step only</li>
            <li>While looking for something similar, I came across this item and at a MUCH better price point, had no trouble committing.  </li>
            <li>my hair looks like natural healthy blonde hair that does not come with the peroxide damages from processing it.</li>
            <li>I have used several cleansing conditioners and the only kind</li>
            <li>the way, a note on cleansing conditioners: I see a fair amount of negative reviews in which people complain that the conditioner made their hair greasy or made them break out at their hairline -</li>
            <li>Although the smell is nice,  it made my curls extremely limp and my scalp itch.</li>
            <li>healthy hair is heavier than damaged hair and normally takes longer to dry.</li>
            <li>I followed many other uses&#x27; advice and really worked it into my hair in sections while in the shower.</li>
            <li>did experience what some called a &amp;#34;stickiness&amp;#34; to my hair when I first got out of the shower, but it is my belief that this is simply a different texture than regular shampoo users are accustom to, as I was able to comb through my hair much easier than ever before.</li>
            <li>A long-time Wen user, I have converted to this band because it performs just as well for my long, fine, straight hair.  </li>
            <li>The Lisa Rachel avocado tea tree oil conditioner has worked just as well for my hair (long, fine, straight and flyaway) as Wen did.</li>
            <li>Hair One is pretty great though, I have long thick hair that tends to get oily on top and dry on the ends.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited that I can actually comb through my hair again!</li>
            <li>This is a winner and will continue to be part of my normal hair care regimen!</li>
            <li>many other brands of cleansing conditioners I decided to write this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can safely wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li>From my own personal experience and also my daughter&#x27;s, this product has the same qualities which have made other similar conditioning hair cleansers very famous...</li>
            <li>I do have pretty healthy hair because I don&#x27;t color or use heat everyday</li>
            <li>- I have found that this is much thinner than what I am use to but not a bad product - just not the same.</li>
            <li>This is the best non Wen I have tried and I have tried at least a half dozen.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time today and am so pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>but once a month, if that (I usually just let it do it&#x27;s own thing)</li>
            <li>At first I was apprehensive to try this product because Wen didn&#x27;t &#x27;wow&#x27; me.</li>
            <li>This is not a bad &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; but the only similarity to Wen was the manner in application.</li>
            <li>The smell was fine, my hair felt somewhat soft, appeared shiny and sleeker but results only lasted 1 day.</li>
            <li>a bit more weighed down</li>
            <li>but finally cancelled my membership; I thought the product (WEN, that is) was probably better than most traditional shampoo/conditioner combos, but not nearly worth the price.  </li>
            <li>If I shampoo every day or every other day, it gets very brittle, frizzy, straw-like and breaks easily.  </li>
            <li>Tried this sulfate-free hair cleanser in the hopes that it would work the same way as my current favorite version.</li>
            <li>It does take some playing around to find the right amount of &amp;#34;pumps&amp;#34; for your hair type - if you use too much or too little, your hair either doesn&#x27;t feel clean, or feels too greasy.  </li>
            <li>First of all I would like to say that I think this is a good product, definitely better than other expensive shampoos I have used.</li>
            <li>Even with this product being a shampoo and conditioner in one, it&#x27;s still much more expensive than the Garnier products I normally use and the results aren&#x27;t any better.</li>
            <li>I think if you have fine hair that is minimally damaged</li>
            <li>I also like that there are no harsh perfumes that so many other products have.</li>
            <li>It likes to break easily, and my normal regimen includes daily shampoo and condition via Moroccan Oil Volumizing (need to shampoo daily because my hair gets greasy fast), BB Tonic, Moroccan Oil itself, and an Aveda volumizer before drying and sometimes curling.</li>
            <li>and so far no signs of any leftover residue from my asthma medication nor this particular product !</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, thin and damaged, the product made my hair soft and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly, but really malleable- I can do just about anything with it.  </li>
            <li>it smells soooooo much better than the \\&quot;W\\&quot; product, which uses cutesy names for a product that smells like creosote (green tea) or shower disinfectant</li>
            <li>I did not add any of my normal conditioner</li>
            <li>For the amount of product you&#x27;re supposed to use, I would have thought that after a few weeks, my hair might begin to behave better.  </li>
            <li>Because this doesn&#x27;t have sulfates and bubbles, it doesn&#x27;t spread through to the scalp as easily as normal shampoos, so work it in all over till u feel it on ur scalp.</li>
            <li>I normally just use 99 cent Suave shampoo and conditioner, and thought maybe that could be the problem-</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the smell, and my hair just didn&#x27;t feel as smooth as it does when I use my other product.</li>
            <li>In short, this is a cute product in nifty packaging that was pretty much a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li>By the time I was done with this &#x27;experiment,&#x27; I had spent nearly as much as if I&#x27;d just bought Wen, in the first place!</li>
            <li>The product rinses out easily and my hair actually feels soft in the shower like it would with a regular conditioner.  </li>
            <li>My hair used to be so brittle and frizzy-flyaway and require a ton of hairspray just to keep it looking tidy instead of a dull flyaway halo on my head; since switching to cleansing conditioners it is so much healthier and prettier, but I did have to live through a brief period of oiliness and some hairline break outs.</li>
            <li>This product has completely restored my hair!</li>
            <li>ALL natural now!</li>
            <li>My hair felt totally different from the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I bought 2 different Conditioning Cleaners and the other is much better on my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair cannot go that long without washing (smile)</li>
            <li>(in fact, that&#x27;s why I bought this specific product in the first place!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>used Lisa Rachel Conditioner &amp; Cleanser for Damaged Hair last night for the first time.  </li>
            <li>This stuff has left my hair conditioned and shiny like after using a deep conditioner, but also clean like a shampoo....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve cracked the code!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After not having much success the first few times I used this Lisa Rachel conditioner and cleanser, I mentioned it to my mother, who uses Wen.</li>
            <li>Tea Tree and Aloe are anti-inflammotory, but when paired with menthol lose their efficacy as menthol is a skin irritant, you can&#x27;t soothe the scalp properly if it&#x27;s irritated, not to mention that irritation on the scalp or forehead area (where the product can drip down) can lead to breakout because when the skin is irritated it produces more oil as a defense mechanism.    </li>
            <li>I have tried Wen and my hair looked flat and had no body after shampooing the first time, but not the case with this product.</li>
            <li>but with the Lisa Rachel my hair was still wet all the way through on the very first washing.</li>
            <li>so the price point on this is a lot more reasonable than Wen for doing the same thing if not better.</li>
            <li>I used more, I used less, I left it on more, I left it on less...</li>
            <li>(Long, fine colour treated hair that is oily at scalp and dry on ends)&lt;br /&gt;Was looking for a new shampoo alternative</li>
            <li>And, I don&#x27;t have to comb immediately after a shower because my hair retains some natural moisture.  </li>
            <li>I had to get my old Wen pump in there</li>
            <li>Why would I buy Wen when I can spend only $9.95 at my local beauty supply and still have the same fabulous results?</li>
            <li>Though my hair was soft, it wasn&#x27;t as shiny as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>So, for me, the natural aspects don&#x27;t outweigh the negatives.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft</li>
            <li>Plus it smells very organic, like you dropped the essential oils in it yourself.</li>
            <li>Made hair soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>but this is a very close second.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my hair so soft.  </li>
            <li>But, so far, my hair seems to like it.  </li>
            <li>far, I&#x27;m liking this</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>Really, wherever my hair had laid on my back while I waited to rinse the product out, I would wind up with a trail of pus mountains.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair feels so soft.</li>
            <li>Use as directed and your hair will be soooo soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>and this stuff made my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly/wavy and it gets so tangled.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t really seem to cure the problem, only mask the symptoms for a while.</li>
            <li>you might as well go ahead and spend the big bucks on the real thing.</li>
            <li>I found this at Duane Reade near my work and decided to go for it, rather than paying $40 for Wen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you switch to any conditioning cleanser directly from a shampoo/conditioner set with SLS and silicone, there will probably be a transition phase, but I went from sulfate-free shampoos</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was so surprised by this product.  </li>
            <li>Why the adult varieties all contain menthol or mint is beyond me.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and fulfilled.</li>
            <li>you like Wen, \\&quot; because this is definitely a dupe for the Wen Haircare line, except Lisa Rachel is superior because instead of offering a few variations of the same formula with optional fragrances, she offers a variety of formulas that can suit various needs.    </li>
            <li>followed the instructions closely for my first time, and was a little bummed out by having to comb it through because my hair tangles and pulls out easily when wet.</li>
            <li>I love this product, but not for the usual purposes!</li>
            <li>I know everyone&#x27;s hair and scalp are different, but you need to be aware that when you switch to a cleansing conditioner from traditional shampoo, your scalp is accustomed to having the shampoo strip the hair of natural oils, so when you stop using shampoo, your scalp and hair have to regain their natural oil balance and initially will often generate too much oil, hence the greasy hair.</li>
            <li>I am a huge WEN fan and use the cleansing conditioner, among other products, daily.  </li>
            <li>My hair seems to dry faster, and is definitely more manageable and less frizzy.</li>
            <li>Definitely doesn&#x27;t weigh my fairly fine hair down, doesn&#x27;t look greasy and doesn&#x27;t leave any film on the hair or anything.</li>
            <li>This stuff worked the very first time, after that, it weighed down my hair.</li>
            <li>I read that alot of folks have problems with Wen, but I&#x27;ve now tried 3 other copycat products and all fall short of the original.</li>
            <li>If you massage it into your scalp and through the ends well, leaving it on for about 3 minutes, the tea tree has positive effects if you have any dandruff issue or dry frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this AND am going back to hopefully find more!&lt;br /&gt;Side</li>
            <li>I would also agree with some of the other people who say that the clean you get from Wen doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as it does with this one, although I really don&#x27;t have greasy hair that needs to be washed a ton.</li>
            <li>Now with this stuff, I only use the one product (I put a little extra on my hair for straightening it) and it comes out way better.</li>
            <li>I have long (mid back length) blonde, wavy, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other conditioning cleansers that cost a lot less and worked much better.  </li>
            <li>I have VERY curly hair and a scalp that often is dry and has issues.</li>
            <li>I am getting ready to order the one for dry hair</li>
            <li>Not only did my hair seem less tangled, but it was also surprisingly clean.</li>
            <li>The rinse out was easy and different than my typical matte-mess with regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>Normally, I use Garnier&#x27;s Fructis shampoo and conditioner for dry hair or Chi&#x27;s Intense shampoo and conditioner, put AG&#x27;s Set It Straight lotion on my hair and blow dry then flat iron it.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and no longer brittle and dry looking and my fine hair isn&#x27;t heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li>other than having to use so much of it each time I need to wash my hair!</li>
            <li>When I use the Garnier or Chi shampoo and conditioner (that I get at about half the price at TJ Maxx), my hair is super shiny without my having to add a bunch of extra stuff.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I did follow my normal routine and my hair turned out to be very soft and held its shape once flat-ironed and styled.</li>
            <li>the move was dehydrating for my body in general and my hair was suffering.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lisa Rachel left my hair soft, detangled and seemingly stronger.</li>
            <li>This product is runny and oily, and it took forever to rinse completely out, yet the texture of my hair was coarse, even toward the roots.</li>
            <li>Over the past 5 years I&#x27;ve tried many different shampoo and conditioners and a long list of gels and sprays and so on and so on.</li>
            <li>I tried lots of natural and organic shampoos and I find myself going back to this one.</li>
            <li>This product cleans my hair without stripping the natural oils from my hair, I can also use this daily without drying out my hair.</li>
            <li>never expected these results--</li>
            <li>If you pump a soap dispenser into your hand 23 times, that gives you an idea of how much product is MINIMAL.</li>
            <li>used this product until the bottle was empty, which was about 2 whole weeks altogether.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this product once so far, but I will use up the bottle.</li>
            <li>the pump is broken, so I have to unscrew the pump handle and squeeze out the product, then rescrew on the top;</li>
            <li>Normally before I would take it out of the towel it would already be 1/4 of the way dry</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, less frizzy,  moves like normal hair!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried Wen or any of the other conditioning cleansers, so I really can&#x27;t compare this to them.  </li>
            <li>It is much thicker than the other brand and leaves a greasy film on my hair.  </li>
            <li>, then thoroughly massage in the conditioner (no, not for two whole minutes as the bottle says), then let it sit while you do your other shower functions, then massage as you rinse.</li>
            <li>My hair is very long, naturally wavy, and bleached; “fly-away” is a normal state of being, and it almost always requires multiple products and a flat iron to look presentable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It such a difference even my boyfriend has noticed a major change.  </li>
            <li>but I recently began experiencing an increase in split-ends, frizziness, and major scalp irritation.</li>
            <li>while menthol does have its strengths, its not potent enough to help with scalp eczema sores/ scalp irritation except in the aspect that it mildly numbs them.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy how this conditioner isn&#x27;t too heavy and doesn&#x27;t have that &#x27;chemical smell&#x27; of other conditioners.</li>
            <li>The crown of my head was weighed down like I was using too much conditioner</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am African American and have dry hair with super tight curls.</li>
            <li>I wear my hear in a bob and scrunch it, letting it dry naturally</li>
            <li>I have long blonde locks and everyone thinks its my natural color coz</li>
            <li>Also, I am not sure it&#x27;s worth the extra cost.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair never grew more than a few inches past my shoulders and now it is almost reaching my waist.</li>
            <li>I kept seeing the infomercials for WEN like everyone else and finally decided that I would try it, but wasn&#x27;t ready to commit $30 to a conditioner that might make my hair look weighted down and greasy.  </li>
            <li>I then allowed my hair to dry naturally with no product, maybe brushed it twice, and went to bed with it was still damp.  </li>
            <li>The Quick Red Fox Jumped Over The Lazy Brown Dog!</li>
            <li>No tangles after blow drying, and it&#x27;s straight with a little curl under at the bottom.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed out of the shower though was that my hair wasn&#x27;t half dry from the towel.</li>
            <li>I fixed this by trying to keep it loosely clipped, but even then, my neck would break out!</li>
            <li>I feel bad for not liking this product because my boyfriend bought it for me thinking it was going to be as good as WEN</li>

            <li> I bought this at a discount store for $5.50 not expecting a great product.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think it was that great.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> I noticed I had a tingling feeling on my scalp (it was very nice)</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing!  </li>
            <li> Nice!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the greatest smell, and I don&#x27;t see that it works better than any of the lower-priced cleansing conditioners.</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m so happy I did because it is amazing.</li>
            <li> It does smell good though.</li>
            <li> use 10 pumps on the hair in front of me and work it through really, really good...</li>
            <li> If this had an easier dispensing pump or was available in a tub to scoop out it would be absolutely PERFECT!!</li>
            <li> product was maybe one tenth as good as wen.</li>
            <li> Almost as good as Wen.</li>
            <li> had been looking for something cheaper, affordable, and good for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It smells really good- like</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how good my hair looks this morning.  </li>
            <li> Well, it did smell good.</li>
            <li> so I took a chance on this product because the price was good</li>
            <li> It smells really good and doesn&#x27;t leave a build up on my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as good as the &amp;#34;W&amp;#34; product, but at a more affordable price!</li>
            <li> So many of you said this was a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been happy with that regimen but wanted to try products that were more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; and didn&#x27;t strip my hair of oil.</li>
            <li> I love this my hair loves it !</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this is that I can use it as a leave in conditioner too!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> This cleansing product I absolutely love!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I like it better than Wen or HairOne!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop touching it!</li>
            <li> Glad I stocked up!</li>
            <li> The price is amazing for this miracle.</li>
            <li> it was amazing the difference.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, I combine it with</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell, feel, and easiness of this product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> It delivers the moisture that any of those \\&quot;Deep\\&quot; or \\&quot;Intensive\\&quot; mostuire and repair masks you see on the haircare aisle, but it cleanses away nicely.</li>
            <li> 2.)it is a nice cleansing conditioner that hasn&#x27;t caused me to lose hair or made me feel greasy and gunky up there   </li>
            <li> I decided to see if it was online, and I was thrilled to find it here.  </li>
            <li> This is really some great stuff!!</li>
            <li> This product still seems good, but a bit thinner/less effective than WEN, so I just have to use more product.  </li>
            <li> mi*t)but IS effective.  </li>
            <li> felt compelled to update my review and give this product more stars because  my hair looks good now.</li>
            <li> And I really liked Wen.  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled</li>
            <li> and I really liked the way they treat my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> a nice spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So there&#x27;s two nice things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> IT IS VERY EASY TO USE, ALTHOUGH YOU DO HAVE TO USE A LOT OF THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li> As far as the results, I wasn&#x27;t much impressed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too drying, it cleans well, has the perfect consistency and leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful, cleans my oily hair well, and leaves it feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> It adds a mild tingle and great refreshing smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I  didn&#x27;t learn about sulfate and paraben free hair cleansers before, but they are absolutely the best!</li>
            <li> I like the consistency of this product better than Wen, it feels like its easier to work into my scalp and more effective at cleansing.</li>
            <li> It advertises Tea Tree and Avocado, and both are close to the top of the list,  </li>
            <li> So pleased, and my wallet is, too :-).</li>
            <li> Great product,  woorks very well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go more than 1 day without washing my hair with this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just an okay product for me.</li>
            <li> There are better cleanser conditioner products out there, This one is okay.</li>
            <li> It was so much better than I imagined, but I still wasn&#x27;t keen on the price.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad that I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> Now, my hair is one of my better assets.</li>
            <li> and them put 1 more pump in and work that</li>
            <li> The more I have been using this the better my hair has been getting.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I tried my friend&#x27;s Wen and it was ok.</li>
            <li> Glad it did :)</li>
            <li> I have finally found the perfect hair care.</li>
            <li> The directions on the bottle say that the more you use the better the product works.</li>
            <li> Hmm - just seems like a way to get you to use up the bottle faster so you can buy more.</li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> and i LOVE the scent.</li>
            <li> After reading couples of lovely reviews for this shampoo I ordered it and after using that all of my day I used to collect my hair from bath tub,rug,bathroom floor,towel,bed,cushion etc.etc.etc.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> and I love that feeling.</li>
            <li> This product is just ok.  </li>
            <li> Looks so much more healthier.</li>
            <li> Love this --but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not Wen, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> After my coworker gave me her surplus Wen, I fell in love and had to find a cheaper alternative.</li>
            <li> This one is the perfect middle ground for my hair type: Cleaning, but also moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It works ok</li>
            <li> but WEN is still better...</li>
            <li> My hair looked and felt better doing the co-wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So glad that I discovered this conditioner/cleanser.</li>
            <li> you like Wen, you&#x27;ll love Lisa Rachel&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I love Wen, I like this.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really glad for the price tag.  </li>
            <li> The price is way better than Wen.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love Lisa Rachel.</li>
            <li> I use it as a leave-in conditioner that makes my hair feel thicker and healthy.</li>
            <li> environment as it produces its oils in a more balanced way.</li>
            <li> With this &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; my hair feels better after each use.</li>
            <li> (the water is more to spread it through) as leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t quite as good, but, for the price, I feel it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> I brushed it out the best I could and</li>
            <li> tried using this product so many ways based on the reviews</li>
            <li> this helps! :)</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner combo.</li>
            <li> even as I type this, I still feel the refreshing tingle of the Tea Tree Oil.</li>
            <li> There is now a bald spot on my head and my scalp shows more in the parting of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have stopped using this cleanser and will update on the regrowth of my hair.</li>
            <li> so I figured it was a safe bet.</li>
            <li> Wen worked better.</li>
            <li> how my hair feels after, it cleans better than wen and feels lighter</li>
            <li> Love this for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love how my hair feels and behaves using this product.</li>
            <li> but I like this one for me personally so much better.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> get so many compliments on my hair</li>
            <li> My hair and scalp felt clean but most of all moisturized!</li>
            <li> , I can feel it working!\\&quot; which isn&#x27;t true because if you could feel this working how come effective products without menthol don&#x27;t deliver any sensationswhere you feel it \\&quot;working\\&quot; ?</li>
            <li> Pretty good, but I prefer Hair One products, after trying both.</li>
            <li> It gives me beautiful soft curls (I have wavy frizzy hair) and keeps my hair tamed for days.</li>
            <li> Most of the Wen scents have a mint or menthol undertone - not this strong - so I&#x27;ve been using the Kid&#x27;s Apple, which does not.</li>
            <li> This product was just more easily available, my favorite requires a trip to specialty beauty store or</li>
            <li> not as good as wen, but definitively does the job at a more reasonable price, would def.</li>
            <li> and I use a sulfate free sudsy shampoo once every 2 weeks just to make sure I have no build up</li>
            <li> and I was so happy with how soft it made their hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for my natural, wash and go hairstyle.</li>
            <li> I like the cool refreshing feeling it makes on my scalp :)</li>
            <li> Even more amazing was how fast my hair grew in a year (pixie cut to touching my shoulders) and</li>
            <li> so I was looking for something as good that did not cost so much.</li>
            <li> I have used other wen type products but this one is the best.</li>
            <li> Just follow the easy directions and your hair will be softer and easier to manage.  </li>
            <li> , it makes it easy to style</li>
            <li> As good or better than WEN as far as how the product itself works for my hair.  </li>
            <li> The formula is strong but there are some issues I would like to address.</li>
            <li> Instead I&#x27;ve found Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special which works loads better.</li>
            <li> liked this product at first but just changed my rating and am editing my review.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for over a year now and my hair not only looks beautiful</li>
            <li> It appears as though the majority of people who are reviewing this product have fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I am a caucasian with fine , shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> I read in description &amp;#34;good for fine hair&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;NOT</li>
            <li> Made my fine hair sooo</li>
            <li> At first, I thought maybe I just wasn&#x27;t use to such awesome shine, but</li>
            <li> Thanks Lisa Rachel for making healthy hair care affordable!</li>
            <li> Works great and makes my scalp feel fresh and my hair is soft!</li>
            <li> I only wash my hair every three days and it looks great.</li>
            <li> Review for Lisa Rachel Sulfate Free Conditioner &amp; Cleanser with Tea Tree Oil &amp; Avocado for Damaged Hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I think I will not get it re-done since this product makes my hair so silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li> After seeing all the hype about lather -free, I decided to give it a try..nothing like all the hype..</li>
            <li> Unless the results you&#x27;re looking for involve the ability to fry an egg in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another big problem I experienced with this product had nothing to do with my hair-</li>
            <li> have AA hair, and this does a great job of actually conditioning the strands and combating dryness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have been washing with sulfate free shampoos for years and washing with conditioner rather than shampoo for over a year.</li>
            <li> the free two day shipping allows me to wait till my bottle runs out then order</li>
            <li> hair looks and feels fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling gorgeous and soft.</li>
            <li> ive tried wen and this product is just as good for about a third the cost, love it</li>
            <li> We have nice hair... soft, shiny, manageable and healthy.</li>
            <li> I had to use 2-3xs as much!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s very important to thoroughly saturate and rub your scalp and rinse your hair with water first</li>
            <li> I love the fact that the ingredients are much more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; than the ones in the shampoo and conditioner I normally use and it doesn&#x27;t have any sulfates.</li>
            <li> I have used many a cleansing conditioners/ co washes and this is comparable to a lot of the higher end ones.</li>
            <li> The first day I used the product, my hair seemed ok.</li>
            <li> I am in love and will be ordering more of this 10 dollar fix instead of my old 65 dollar shampoo and 30 conditioner!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I was using the correct amount before so my hair wasn&#x27;t getting clean.</li>
            <li> Also, my hair felt surprisingly clean when I was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels &amp; smells clean too.</li>
            <li> I felt really clean and it refreshed my scalp.</li>
            <li> When I rinse the conditioning cleanser out of my hair, it feels tangled and matted (but clean).  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this miracle product! :)</li>
            <li> The conditioner contains sweet almond oil, Avocado oil, Aloe Leaf Juice, Hydrolized Wheat Protein, and Tea Tree oil.  </li>
            <li> None of the claims they made turned out to be true.</li>
            <li> (sweet almond</li>
            <li> Honestly, it leaves my hair softer than Wen - wow.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to read the instructions on the label and it kind of suggests to use</li>
            <li> /&gt; If your hair is very course then would work okay.</li>
            <li> This product did help with my scalp irritation, but that&#x27;s probably the only good thing I can say about it....</li>
            <li> So this has definitely given me a great boost in making my hair a little bit more healthy!</li>
            <li> I saw this at Ross and quickly searched reviews online before buying.</li>
            <li> Feels fresh and clean.also make sure u rinse it out very well at the scalp.</li>
            <li> But, I do wash with a mild organic shampoo once a week.</li>
            <li> This seems to condition &amp; detangle well, and the smell does fade out quickly.</li>
            <li> I already am familiar with the amazing benefits of tea tree oil and thought I would give this a try since it&#x27;s supposedly similar to Wen.</li>
            <li> I used it today for the first time after using Wen for a while and my hair was not as smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I use this product consistently, although, I use it as a \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot; and still follow up with a light conditioner.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m extremely happy I found a cleansing &amp;conditioning product that doesn&#x27;t contain lavender which I&#x27;m extremely allergic to !</li>
            <li> This product is actually pretty good: I use WEN products for last 10 years but they keep wanting to ship every 2 months which caused me to have like 6 boxes un-used.</li>
            <li> My hair is colored and now cut in a short pixie-style, but I STILL had to use more of this product, than I did, of Wen, when my hair was mid-length!</li>
            <li> so we shall see if it&#x27;s even better which I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised !</li>
            <li> I am ordering in volume next time for sure!</li>
            <li> anyway to sum it up - this one is the best and my hair is processed, blonde and tends to be dry.</li>
            <li> I have really fine hair that was really damaged from over processing</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> here!It&#x27;s definately worth it</li>
            <li> I could feel a nice cooling sensation on my scalp when I let it sit for about 5 minutes and found that the product smelled a bit like menthol or something similar.</li>
            <li> Fortunately the smell, which was light, completely went away when I rinsed my hair.</li>
            <li> Once you get that worked out, though, via trial and error, it does make your hair look nice, and it isn&#x27;t as drying as using a traditional shampoo followed by a conditioner.</li>
            <li> But it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> hair is actually soft afterward too, which is a challenging accomplishment!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> The company is very customer friendly and very willing to help if you have a problem with your order.  </li>
            <li> As I researched more I learned that your hair (natural oils) have to adjust.  </li>
            <li> So there are some good nutrient dense oils, some anti inflamitories, and the wheat protein, and when paired with gentle and nonharmful silicones and petrochemicals, it makes for a creamy and effective cleansing conditioner that doesnt stick to your hair (as long as you only use it 2-4 times a week).</li>
            <li> I felt obliged to post a well-deserved review right away.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Wen in the past and honestly Wen is slightly better but too overpriced.</li>
            <li> Now my hair lies down nice and when I pull it up for work the pony tail even moves freely and the brittle look is gone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You really do have to use a lot of the product, and it doesn&#x27;t make for a quick shower, but I think it is TOTALLY WORTH</li>
            <li> it definitely much better than general shampoo, so I might keep using it when I cant afford wen.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I noticed a difference after the first cleansing and it only got better after each use.</li>
            <li> and I can see great improvement such as I have an easy time getting the snarls out and the frizz is down by 85%</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product because I wanted something natural and good for my hair.</li>
            <li> my hair is shinier, more manageable and never dry - you know the blondes that look like their hair is straw or hay.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use very much each time, so it lasts a while.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping also.  </li>
            <li> Thank you very much Lisa Rachel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;If Dean Wen was the first to create cleansing conditioner my thanks to him, I love Lisa Rachel&#x27;s version and will use for as long it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> This is the first cleansing conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> without the menthol and unecessary fragrance oils/extracts, this would be a stellar cowash/cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> and honestly it&#x27;s not that great at all.</li>
            <li> Once I did, I was very dissappointed!</li>
            <li> and I won&#x27;t have to EVER worry about running out of the &#x27;real thing&#x27; again!</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this was how my hair was not already drying in the towel.</li>
            <li> use 10 pumps at the top and back of my hair and work that</li>
            <li> I saw and felt the difference after the first use.</li>
            <li> This is cheaper, more moisturizing and so much better smelling (but not overwhelming like the L&#x27;Oreal product)  </li>
            <li> She told me that she did not like Wen when she first started using it, but gave the product a month to work and found that her hair was softer and shinier than at first.</li>
            <li> I used to have to use many different products to keep the frizzies away</li>
            <li> glad I only paid $11.00.....</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> Weird, but great!</li>
            <li> I have purchased it at the only beauty supply that I can find it, but they are always running out and it can take 3-4 weeks or more for them to put it on their shelves.</li>
            <li> I tested on my 4 year old son and his silky smooth hair changed to sticky, no-shine hair in just 2 uses.</li>
            <li> I have used this for the last month and love the way my hair feels after using it.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t it why you&#x27;re trying these products in the first place?</li>
            <li> FIRST OF ALL, IT SMELLS</li>
            <li> The first time I washed my hair with this</li>
            <li> product is actually similar to wen, but wen is much more thicker and richer.</li>
            <li> It did not make my hair light and soft like wen did</li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time</li>
            <li> So, first time I used it, I did minimum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d brush it, and 5 minutes later wouldn&#x27;t be able to run my fingers through my hair.  </li>
            <li> but I love it for mid to ends.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel the tingle when I first put it on my hair</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a cleansing wash</li>
            <li> It is a better price than WEN, but it&#x27;s also a smaller bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll write more after I&#x27;ve used it several times if I notice anything else.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use as much of the product as recommended because I have fine, wavy hair, but I can tell that even in using less product my hair is more moisturized and it has a richer, healthier look to it</li>
            <li> You could hardly see my split ends after using this product, I tried the Wen stuff and wasn&#x27;t impressed especially for the price</li>
            <li> which is naturally curly and somewhat coarse looks AMAZING.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling clean and soft -</li>
            <li> I have relaxed, color treated hair and this product leaves my hair soft, feeling fuller, shiny and clean.</li>
            <li> Wen rinses clean and leaves your hair soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any of the clean soft feeling</li>
            <li> natural curly hair was soft, shiny and the curls were more defined.</li>
            <li> The bottle also says the longer you leave it in, the better the results, so I used it at the very beginning of my shower, and left it in for the duration, so about 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the experience has been a total success so far :)</li>
            <li> I really want it to be long, healthy, and</li>
            <li> What I love about this product, is after a few minutes in the shower with this on my head my scalp starts to get a cool tingly feeling</li>
            <li> At one point I even used FORTY FIVE pumps because the back of the bottle says \\&quot;the more you use, the better the results!\\&quot; Let me be the first to tell you this is not true.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine textured, long and very straight</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair, and I&#x27;ve always had so many problems.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and packaged well.</li>
            <li> Before Lisa Rachel I could pull my hair out with gently running my hand through it (after conditioners both rinse out and leave-in types).</li>
            <li> You  have to use so much</li>
            <li> Works really well</li>
            <li> and as I was rinsing it came out very well.</li>
            <li> and it comes out really, really nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This really seemed to help with that.</li>
            <li> She said to keep trying it, but I did not want to spend that much money</li>
            <li> This product really delivers.</li>
            <li> Thanks Lisa Rachel who ever you are for making a product that really works and doesn&#x27;t cost and arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> So, I did the same thing with this Lisa Rachel sulfate free shampoo and conditioner for damaged hair</li>
            <li> Thought I would give this a try because it was said that it was WEN-LIKE,and much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper</li>
            <li> I lost so much hair</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t recognized much increased thickness since I started a month ago but the hair loss is all but gone.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this product would really make a difference with my frizzies.  </li>
            <li> FIVE STARS for Irene Gari Lisa Rachel Shampoo for giving us something that really works.</li>
            <li> and the ends felt like they were very stiff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also really like the addition of tea tree in this.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely prefer the smell of tea tree eo that the label touts</li>
            <li> I like this... just not as much as Wen.</li>
            <li> but I cant say that it helped much.  </li>
            <li> LIKE NOXEMA STRAIGHT FROM THE BOTTLE, BUT DOESN&#x27;T MAKE YOUR HAIR SMELL</li>
            <li> VERY WELL.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to try Wen for years but did not want to spend that much money.  </li>
            <li> I did not expect too much for this product, but I hoped it could be better.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> (fast forward to the bottom for results, this is my background)</li>
            <li> The Price and the Results have me hooked, I really hope I feel this way in a month</li>
            <li> It is truly worth living through a week to two of greasiness to let your hair regain its natural oil balance.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Very nourishing.</li>
            <li> but after seeing so many WEN commercials, I was really curious to try a conditioning cleanser to see if it helped.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, my scalp felt really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was just really, REALLY greasy.  </li>
            <li> It took two bottles before I really noticed the damage repaired.</li>
            <li> With the Wen costing so much money, I decide to give this a try.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really like the product.</li>
            <li> As I Am Co-Wash and CHI Silk Treatment; my hair is so much betten than with using shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> I really like this product..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to pay so much for the Wen products because it just seems like paying for their marketing/ads.</li>
            <li> AND I don&#x27;t really need any styling products, except maybe a bit of styling paste for my bangs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been this soft since I was in elementary</li>
            <li> The scent is VERY menthol-ish.</li>
            <li> I really like this cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> Wen is a more complete product in my opinion, one step only</li>
            <li> While looking for something similar, I came across this item and at a MUCH better price point, had no trouble committing.  </li>
            <li> my hair looks like natural healthy blonde hair that does not come with the peroxide damages from processing it.</li>
            <li> I have used several cleansing conditioners and the only kind</li>
            <li> the way, a note on cleansing conditioners: I see a fair amount of negative reviews in which people complain that the conditioner made their hair greasy or made them break out at their hairline -</li>
            <li> Although the smell is nice,  it made my curls extremely limp and my scalp itch.</li>
            <li> healthy hair is heavier than damaged hair and normally takes longer to dry.</li>
            <li> I followed many other uses&#x27; advice and really worked it into my hair in sections while in the shower.</li>
            <li> did experience what some called a &amp;#34;stickiness&amp;#34; to my hair when I first got out of the shower, but it is my belief that this is simply a different texture than regular shampoo users are accustom to, as I was able to comb through my hair much easier than ever before.</li>
            <li> A long-time Wen user, I have converted to this band because it performs just as well for my long, fine, straight hair.  </li>
            <li> The Lisa Rachel avocado tea tree oil conditioner has worked just as well for my hair (long, fine, straight and flyaway) as Wen did.</li>
            <li> Hair One is pretty great though, I have long thick hair that tends to get oily on top and dry on the ends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited that I can actually comb through my hair again!</li>
            <li> This is a winner and will continue to be part of my normal hair care regimen!</li>
            <li> many other brands of cleansing conditioners I decided to write this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can safely wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> From my own personal experience and also my daughter&#x27;s, this product has the same qualities which have made other similar conditioning hair cleansers very famous...</li>
            <li> I do have pretty healthy hair because I don&#x27;t color or use heat everyday</li>
            <li> - I have found that this is much thinner than what I am use to but not a bad product - just not the same.</li>
            <li> This is the best non Wen I have tried and I have tried at least a half dozen.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time today and am so pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> but once a month, if that (I usually just let it do it&#x27;s own thing)</li>
            <li> At first I was apprehensive to try this product because Wen didn&#x27;t &#x27;wow&#x27; me.</li>
            <li> This is not a bad &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; but the only similarity to Wen was the manner in application.</li>
            <li> The smell was fine, my hair felt somewhat soft, appeared shiny and sleeker but results only lasted 1 day.</li>
            <li> a bit more weighed down</li>
            <li> but finally cancelled my membership; I thought the product (WEN, that is) was probably better than most traditional shampoo/conditioner combos, but not nearly worth the price.  </li>
            <li> If I shampoo every day or every other day, it gets very brittle, frizzy, straw-like and breaks easily.  </li>
            <li> Tried this sulfate-free hair cleanser in the hopes that it would work the same way as my current favorite version.</li>
            <li> It does take some playing around to find the right amount of &amp;#34;pumps&amp;#34; for your hair type - if you use too much or too little, your hair either doesn&#x27;t feel clean, or feels too greasy.  </li>
            <li> First of all I would like to say that I think this is a good product, definitely better than other expensive shampoos I have used.</li>
            <li> Even with this product being a shampoo and conditioner in one, it&#x27;s still much more expensive than the Garnier products I normally use and the results aren&#x27;t any better.</li>
            <li> I think if you have fine hair that is minimally damaged</li>
            <li> I also like that there are no harsh perfumes that so many other products have.</li>
            <li> It likes to break easily, and my normal regimen includes daily shampoo and condition via Moroccan Oil Volumizing (need to shampoo daily because my hair gets greasy fast), BB Tonic, Moroccan Oil itself, and an Aveda volumizer before drying and sometimes curling.</li>
            <li> and so far no signs of any leftover residue from my asthma medication nor this particular product !</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, thin and damaged, the product made my hair soft and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly, but really malleable- I can do just about anything with it.  </li>
            <li> it smells soooooo much better than the \\&quot;W\\&quot; product, which uses cutesy names for a product that smells like creosote (green tea) or shower disinfectant</li>
            <li> I did not add any of my normal conditioner</li>
            <li> For the amount of product you&#x27;re supposed to use, I would have thought that after a few weeks, my hair might begin to behave better.  </li>
            <li> Because this doesn&#x27;t have sulfates and bubbles, it doesn&#x27;t spread through to the scalp as easily as normal shampoos, so work it in all over till u feel it on ur scalp.</li>
            <li> I normally just use 99 cent Suave shampoo and conditioner, and thought maybe that could be the problem-</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell, and my hair just didn&#x27;t feel as smooth as it does when I use my other product.</li>
            <li> In short, this is a cute product in nifty packaging that was pretty much a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> By the time I was done with this &#x27;experiment,&#x27; I had spent nearly as much as if I&#x27;d just bought Wen, in the first place!</li>
            <li> The product rinses out easily and my hair actually feels soft in the shower like it would with a regular conditioner.  </li>
            <li> My hair used to be so brittle and frizzy-flyaway and require a ton of hairspray just to keep it looking tidy instead of a dull flyaway halo on my head; since switching to cleansing conditioners it is so much healthier and prettier, but I did have to live through a brief period of oiliness and some hairline break outs.</li>
            <li> This product has completely restored my hair!</li>
            <li> ALL natural now!</li>
            <li> My hair felt totally different from the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I bought 2 different Conditioning Cleaners and the other is much better on my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair cannot go that long without washing (smile)</li>
            <li> (in fact, that&#x27;s why I bought this specific product in the first place!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> used Lisa Rachel Conditioner &amp; Cleanser for Damaged Hair last night for the first time.  </li>
            <li> This stuff has left my hair conditioned and shiny like after using a deep conditioner, but also clean like a shampoo....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cracked the code!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After not having much success the first few times I used this Lisa Rachel conditioner and cleanser, I mentioned it to my mother, who uses Wen.</li>
            <li> Tea Tree and Aloe are anti-inflammotory, but when paired with menthol lose their efficacy as menthol is a skin irritant, you can&#x27;t soothe the scalp properly if it&#x27;s irritated, not to mention that irritation on the scalp or forehead area (where the product can drip down) can lead to breakout because when the skin is irritated it produces more oil as a defense mechanism.    </li>
            <li> I have tried Wen and my hair looked flat and had no body after shampooing the first time, but not the case with this product.</li>
            <li> but with the Lisa Rachel my hair was still wet all the way through on the very first washing.</li>
            <li> so the price point on this is a lot more reasonable than Wen for doing the same thing if not better.</li>
            <li> I used more, I used less, I left it on more, I left it on less...</li>
            <li> (Long, fine colour treated hair that is oily at scalp and dry on ends)&lt;br /&gt;Was looking for a new shampoo alternative</li>
            <li> And, I don&#x27;t have to comb immediately after a shower because my hair retains some natural moisture.  </li>
            <li> I had to get my old Wen pump in there</li>
            <li> Why would I buy Wen when I can spend only $9.95 at my local beauty supply and still have the same fabulous results?</li>
            <li> Though my hair was soft, it wasn&#x27;t as shiny as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> So, for me, the natural aspects don&#x27;t outweigh the negatives.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft</li>
            <li> Plus it smells very organic, like you dropped the essential oils in it yourself.</li>
            <li> Made hair soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> but this is a very close second.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my hair so soft.  </li>
            <li> But, so far, my hair seems to like it.  </li>
            <li> far, I&#x27;m liking this</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> Really, wherever my hair had laid on my back while I waited to rinse the product out, I would wind up with a trail of pus mountains.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair feels so soft.</li>
            <li> Use as directed and your hair will be soooo soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> and this stuff made my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly/wavy and it gets so tangled.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really seem to cure the problem, only mask the symptoms for a while.</li>
            <li> you might as well go ahead and spend the big bucks on the real thing.</li>
            <li> I found this at Duane Reade near my work and decided to go for it, rather than paying $40 for Wen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you switch to any conditioning cleanser directly from a shampoo/conditioner set with SLS and silicone, there will probably be a transition phase, but I went from sulfate-free shampoos</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was so surprised by this product.  </li>
            <li> Why the adult varieties all contain menthol or mint is beyond me.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and fulfilled.</li>
            <li> you like Wen, \\&quot; because this is definitely a dupe for the Wen Haircare line, except Lisa Rachel is superior because instead of offering a few variations of the same formula with optional fragrances, she offers a variety of formulas that can suit various needs.    </li>
            <li> followed the instructions closely for my first time, and was a little bummed out by having to comb it through because my hair tangles and pulls out easily when wet.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but not for the usual purposes!</li>
            <li> I know everyone&#x27;s hair and scalp are different, but you need to be aware that when you switch to a cleansing conditioner from traditional shampoo, your scalp is accustomed to having the shampoo strip the hair of natural oils, so when you stop using shampoo, your scalp and hair have to regain their natural oil balance and initially will often generate too much oil, hence the greasy hair.</li>
            <li> I am a huge WEN fan and use the cleansing conditioner, among other products, daily.  </li>
            <li> My hair seems to dry faster, and is definitely more manageable and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> Definitely doesn&#x27;t weigh my fairly fine hair down, doesn&#x27;t look greasy and doesn&#x27;t leave any film on the hair or anything.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked the very first time, after that, it weighed down my hair.</li>
            <li> I read that alot of folks have problems with Wen, but I&#x27;ve now tried 3 other copycat products and all fall short of the original.</li>
            <li> If you massage it into your scalp and through the ends well, leaving it on for about 3 minutes, the tea tree has positive effects if you have any dandruff issue or dry frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this AND am going back to hopefully find more!&lt;br /&gt;Side</li>
            <li> I would also agree with some of the other people who say that the clean you get from Wen doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as it does with this one, although I really don&#x27;t have greasy hair that needs to be washed a ton.</li>
            <li> Now with this stuff, I only use the one product (I put a little extra on my hair for straightening it) and it comes out way better.</li>
            <li> I have long (mid back length) blonde, wavy, fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other conditioning cleansers that cost a lot less and worked much better.  </li>
            <li> I have VERY curly hair and a scalp that often is dry and has issues.</li>
            <li> I am getting ready to order the one for dry hair</li>
            <li> Not only did my hair seem less tangled, but it was also surprisingly clean.</li>
            <li> The rinse out was easy and different than my typical matte-mess with regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> Normally, I use Garnier&#x27;s Fructis shampoo and conditioner for dry hair or Chi&#x27;s Intense shampoo and conditioner, put AG&#x27;s Set It Straight lotion on my hair and blow dry then flat iron it.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and no longer brittle and dry looking and my fine hair isn&#x27;t heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li> other than having to use so much of it each time I need to wash my hair!</li>
            <li> When I use the Garnier or Chi shampoo and conditioner (that I get at about half the price at TJ Maxx), my hair is super shiny without my having to add a bunch of extra stuff.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I did follow my normal routine and my hair turned out to be very soft and held its shape once flat-ironed and styled.</li>
            <li> the move was dehydrating for my body in general and my hair was suffering.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lisa Rachel left my hair soft, detangled and seemingly stronger.</li>
            <li> This product is runny and oily, and it took forever to rinse completely out, yet the texture of my hair was coarse, even toward the roots.</li>
            <li> Over the past 5 years I&#x27;ve tried many different shampoo and conditioners and a long list of gels and sprays and so on and so on.</li>
            <li> I tried lots of natural and organic shampoos and I find myself going back to this one.</li>
            <li> This product cleans my hair without stripping the natural oils from my hair, I can also use this daily without drying out my hair.</li>
            <li> never expected these results--</li>
            <li> If you pump a soap dispenser into your hand 23 times, that gives you an idea of how much product is MINIMAL.</li>
            <li> used this product until the bottle was empty, which was about 2 whole weeks altogether.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once so far, but I will use up the bottle.</li>
            <li> the pump is broken, so I have to unscrew the pump handle and squeeze out the product, then rescrew on the top;</li>
            <li> Normally before I would take it out of the towel it would already be 1/4 of the way dry</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, less frizzy,  moves like normal hair!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried Wen or any of the other conditioning cleansers, so I really can&#x27;t compare this to them.  </li>
            <li> It is much thicker than the other brand and leaves a greasy film on my hair.  </li>
            <li> , then thoroughly massage in the conditioner (no, not for two whole minutes as the bottle says), then let it sit while you do your other shower functions, then massage as you rinse.</li>
            <li> My hair is very long, naturally wavy, and bleached; “fly-away” is a normal state of being, and it almost always requires multiple products and a flat iron to look presentable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It such a difference even my boyfriend has noticed a major change.  </li>
            <li> but I recently began experiencing an increase in split-ends, frizziness, and major scalp irritation.</li>
            <li> while menthol does have its strengths, its not potent enough to help with scalp eczema sores/ scalp irritation except in the aspect that it mildly numbs them.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy how this conditioner isn&#x27;t too heavy and doesn&#x27;t have that &#x27;chemical smell&#x27; of other conditioners.</li>
            <li> The crown of my head was weighed down like I was using too much conditioner</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am African American and have dry hair with super tight curls.</li>
            <li> I wear my hear in a bob and scrunch it, letting it dry naturally</li>
            <li> I have long blonde locks and everyone thinks its my natural color coz</li>
            <li> Also, I am not sure it&#x27;s worth the extra cost.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair never grew more than a few inches past my shoulders and now it is almost reaching my waist.</li>
            <li> I kept seeing the infomercials for WEN like everyone else and finally decided that I would try it, but wasn&#x27;t ready to commit $30 to a conditioner that might make my hair look weighted down and greasy.  </li>
            <li> I then allowed my hair to dry naturally with no product, maybe brushed it twice, and went to bed with it was still damp.  </li>
            <li> The Quick Red Fox Jumped Over The Lazy Brown Dog!</li>
            <li> No tangles after blow drying, and it&#x27;s straight with a little curl under at the bottom.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed out of the shower though was that my hair wasn&#x27;t half dry from the towel.</li>
            <li> I fixed this by trying to keep it loosely clipped, but even then, my neck would break out!</li>
            <li> I feel bad for not liking this product because my boyfriend bought it for me thinking it was going to be as good as WEN</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to be for damaged hair, but my hair is not extremely damaged and it still leaves it feeling dry.  </li>
            <li> Now if you&#x27;ve bought this product, don&#x27;t throw it out just yet, because the menthol is in a rather low concentration so long term damage from irritation is probably not in your future, but I would advise looking for a new co-wash/cleansing conditioner WITHOUT menthol after this one runs empty.</li>
            <li> I used a simple paddle brush and managed to dry it straight in very little time using no other products.</li>
            <li> I just looked unkept, older and maybe a little lazy.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> However along the way I have tried a few sulphate free shampoos, to compare, and they all leave my kinky coils dried out!</li>
            <li> Also, I really don&#x27;t like the feel or smell of the peppermint essential oil that is VERY, VERY heavy in this.  </li>
            <li> This product left my hair feeling dry and greasy(I didn&#x27;t think that was possible).  </li>
            <li> flat out says on the bottle \\&quot;If</li>
            <li> I can only imagine what people with long hair would have to go through.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair flat.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and need a little natural lift but didn&#x27;t get it with this product.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a thorough researcher/ explorer for nontoxic products in every way.. have been using biotin, wen, acv, baby powder, cowashes and cleansing conditioners for my hair lately due to a major move in climates.</li>
            <li> last so long!  </li>
            <li> I really like this instead of using regular shampoo and conditioner, but you can buy it at Ross Dress for less, for about half the price...</li>
            <li> I gave it to several clients with dry, chemically treated hair</li>
            <li> I use it as such on dry hair, and I find my curls come out</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;m really saving any money in the long run...</li>
            <li> My hair ended up in really bad shape after using too many little cheap hair clips,shampoo and conditioner while visiting someone for a few months.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t particularly like using it on my hair, but over the past two years I have used it on skin irritations and rashes.</li>
            <li> I have very dry red hair and this made my hair shiny and bouncy.</li>
            <li> I was a little surprised about the size of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> While I hate the high cost of Wen, this is not as good and certainly not better.  </li>
            <li> After YEARS of attempting to moisturize and condition my way out of dry dry dry hair, this stuff is such a blessing!</li>
            <li> Another note: for my hair at least, even though it is long, I do not need nearly as much as the bottle tells you to use.</li>
            <li> After Lisa Rachel, when my hair dried no hair is falling out or breaking, plus my hair is soft and bouncy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never going back to a regular conditioner if I can help it and will definitely be stocking up with a few bottles of this one.</li>
            <li> As strange as it sounds, I feel like I need to use a conditioner after I use the LR Tea Tree and Avocado Conditioner &amp; Cleanser.  </li>
            <li> As long as they keep using the formula I am a</li>
            <li> took the time to write this long review because I don&#x27;t see a lot of hair types like mine being mentioned on here.</li>
            <li> I have wavy/curly long hair</li>
            <li> I ordered this one for damaged hair because the scents on the others were not clear</li>
            <li> I spread a final pump through the bottom half of my hair last and only partially rinse it</li>
            <li> I was desperate for a product like this after years of having nice long brunette hair, I lost about half my hair after an overload of antibiotics in the hospital.  </li>
            <li> I was converted to cleansing conditioners by Wen, which I love, but I needed something less expensive.</li>
            <li> I know I will never use traditional shampoo again and with this one, it does not leave that greasy residue that other products do.</li>
            <li> I definitely plan to try the other scents, and I have Prime so</li>
            <li> Unlike other similar products, like Wen, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just not formulated for baby-fine, long hair, because even following the directions to the letter, it left my hair oily, limp, and tangled.  </li>
            <li> and i have very long hair</li>
            <li> My hair is neither dry nor oily.  </li>
            <li> a I towel dry my hair</li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry</li>
            <li> Now my hair does not have a \\&quot;film\\&quot; on it after I dry it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t blow dry</li>
            <li> It was actually really dry and would not stay un-knotted.</li>
            <li> I let it air dry and</li>
            <li> My hair is always really dry, even when I use organic shampoo and follow with organic conditioner.</li>
            <li> - instead it was dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> though the direction to use is kinda complicated and takes a big amount and long time to get my hair (short!), and it won&#x27;t rather much.</li>
            <li> It definitely wasn&#x27;t the silky-smoothness you get after rinsing out a conditioner, it was more like how your hair feels after shampooing, so that was a little disappointing, but I shrugged it off because, hey, what the heck do I know about cleansing conditioner?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Wen, for a LONG time, but decided to &#x27;experiment&#x27;, and give this a try, only because the price was SO much less.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it&#x27;s about 5 times more expensive as the products I normally use and my hair looks worse.</li>
            <li> Apply a generous amount, message through your hair and scalp thoroughly, rinse it completely off (which will get rid the dirt and oil build up), then apply a small amount for conditioning.</li>
            <li> cleanse, comb out, let my hair dry and pop on rollers!</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I tried for half an hour to open the pump.</li>
            <li> but it squirts out half air and a tiny bit</li>
            <li> consistency is slightly thicker than what I&#x27;m used to but it mixed well with the WEN (about 3-4 pumps of each).  </li>
            <li> My bf has very dry scalp</li>
            <li> Not suitable for a busy girl like me.</li>
            <li> used this product for 1 week - my hair felt dull, lifeless, and a little more stiff than usual.  </li>
            <li> was equals to about 1/4 of the bottle for a single shampoo!  </li>
            <li> only wish I had found out about this product sooner and will be doing a little &amp;#</li>
            <li> Quack Quack said the little yellow duck!</li>
            <li> but I had always been curious.</li>
            <li> and I would have to wet it with a spray bottle before I could do anything else</li>
            <li> wet my hair thoroughly...</li>
            <li> After that, it became \\&quot;poofy\\&quot; and did not at all look like I had spent tons of time doing</li>
            <li> gave this product only 3 stars for a few reasons:</li>
            <li> I have spent a fortune on hair products in the beauty supply stores and with the cosmeticians.</li>
            <li> not bouncy and absolutely no &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; not much mind</li>
            <li> says you can use this as a leave-in conditioner while wet.  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t see it mentioned anywhere else, but if you use this or any other cleansing conditioner, you shouldn&#x27;t use styling products that have silicone-based ingredients (anything with \\&quot;-one\\&quot; at the end of a word), because it will build up and the cleanser isn&#x27;t harsh enough to strip them out.</li>
            <li> I was shocked to look in the mirror and see the roots of my hair looked dry, and I had frizzy hairs sticking out of the top of my head like a little frizz-forest.</li>
            <li> But, this has shown to improve my scalp and leave my hair feeling less dry.</li>
            <li> have long, thick, a bit curly hair that I blowout daily, despite my hair dressers</li>
            <li> Well, I had high hopes for the Lisa Rachel product, but alas, it is still not Wen.  </li>
            <li> WEN destroyed my hair, as I mentioned after one use my hair was matted, dry, broke like crazy and was so frizzy that even oil based products couldn&#x27;t calm it</li>
            <li> I do wash my hair every other day</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try all of the other scents.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait until the other comes in.</li>
            <li> I now wash my hair every 3 days instead of every day or every other day.</li>
            <li> I did not feel my hair is washed properly, there is no shine at all, it is wavier than usual.</li>
            <li> I  have been using the Wen conditioner and thought I would try this in its place due to price</li>
            <li> I did like Wen, but it is pretty expensive</li>
            <li> I had been using sulfate-free natural shampoos for a while before I heard about co-washing and cleansing conditioners (I grew up in VT where people are afraid of harmful chemicals but never had a lot of exposure to hair routines of African American women).</li>
            <li> My hair is damaged from heat products, as well as four years of keeping it up in a tight, wet bun in the military unless sleeping (been trying to cut and grow healthier hair since getting out, but it&#x27;s still fighting me).</li>
            <li> It cleans my hair, but leaves hair a little dry.</li>
            <li> In a few weeks I will try her Dry Hair version.</li>
            <li> , this might be my imagination, but my hair doesn&#x27;t seem to get as dirty as quickly as it used to.</li>
            <li> I always had to comb and put leave in stuff in IMMEDIATELY after the shower, or it would get dry and stiff.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that is thin but due to the humidity it will frizz</li>
            <li> Ended up buying a conventional shampoo and using this product as a conditioner...</li>
            <li> so I have full body - not like others that leave a residue and leave hair limp and dirty feeling in a day.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend at least trying this.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try WEN because all of my friends adore it, but because I have such thin long hair I have no luck with &#x27;2 in 1&#x27;</li>
            <li> I HAVE THICK, HIGHLIGHTED BLONDE HAIR</li>
            <li> I did apply a few pumps post shower as a leave-in and segment-combed with a wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, curly hair.</li>
            <li> After using the entire bottle and trying (at least half a bottle)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like a watered down version and doesn&#x27;t condition well.</li>
            <li> Frizzies are down and it feels moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Does not weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> It does not weigh my hair down either.</li>
            <li> (EVEN THOUGH I HAD JUST HAD IT TRIMMED AND EXTREMELY THINNED OUT)!  </li>
            <li> I ripped open the package and read the directions, and was a little shocked at how much product you are expected to use for each cleansing- 5-7 pumps to massage into the scalp, 8-10 to massage to the ends, and then another 8-10 pumps to massage all over.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tested other co-washes that have been to harsh or too oily.</li>
            <li> and this was thrown away half used.</li>
            <li> Lisa Rachel is less per</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now on auto-pay, with Wen, and paying less, than buying it, bottle by bottle</li>
            <li> and also I get it for $4.00 less a bottle than what my beauty supply store sells it for.</li>
            <li> It costs less and I like it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t just put it in your hair and rinse half of it off thinking you&#x27;re leaving some in for moisture.</li>
            <li> It held the moisture for half an hour without dripping.</li>
            <li> I used a half pump of the clenaser as a leave in conditioner and</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a blowdryer on it and my drying time was cut in half despite the hair holding moisture.</li>
            <li> Our choice is to pay less without sacrificing quality, and we found the answer with this product.  </li>
            <li> but my hair is dull and doesn&#x27;t hold a curl long.</li>
            <li> only one complaint- wish the pump was wider as it only pumps a thin stream</li>
            <li> I have thick, long, wavy hair (Hispanic), so I thought this would probably not work.</li>
            <li> I usually can go 2-3 days without washing with no problem other than slight oiliness.</li>
            <li> those who complains that it makes your hair heavy and hard to dry...</li>
            <li> Having some little troubles with the WEN, this product has worked like a charm.  </li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t care for the smell either), so I was a little hesitant to try this.</li>
            <li> leaves hair still a little greasy.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE</li>
            <li> and my hair did appear a little shiner</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even get away with every other day because of the excessive shine-goo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have used Wen in the past, but had to discontinue it due to hair loss from heavy buildup.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall not very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> WEN didn&#x27;t rinse out well for me, it left a very thick film on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried the WEN version for damaged hair and WEN dried out and matted my chemically relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll post a followup in a few weeks to let you know how the transition goes</li>
            <li> I use it a few times a week.</li>
            <li> I stepped out and wrapped a towel around my head, dried off, and then took the towel off my head.</li>
            <li> This one is a bit heavy for my roots...</li>
            <li> I have been buying Wen for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and this only last me 3 weeks :(</li>
            <li> The ends aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;showing off&amp;#34; like they normally do after I blow dry, and I am a little merciless with my blowdrying habits because I&#x27;m in a rush.</li>
            <li> I use a little bit of leave-in treatment after my shower, but that is to tame my curls.  </li>
            <li> the size of a dime or less at a time!</li>
            <li> Works as well as Wen, for a lot less!</li>
            <li> What a mess!</li>
            <li> I have extremely long thin hair, but a lot of it, and I use maybe 5 pumps per section.</li>
            <li> I had previously been using Wen for at least 7-8 months and have gone through probably 4 bottles at around $32 each.</li>
            <li> My hair was thin, damaged, and very dry.</li>
            <li> My hair was just not happy with the change and became very dry on the ends.</li>
            <li> And, I usually had to use tons of leave-in treatments (conditioners, silk, etc).  </li>
            <li> However, to me this is not better than Wen.</li>
            <li> JUST PAST MY SHOULDERS.  </li>
            <li> (I USUALLY WASH MY HAIR 2 TIMES PER WEEK, AND DON&#x27;T HAVE THIS PROBLEM).  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;m glad this works for some people, I guess my hair is sticking with the expensive stuff :-(</li>
            <li> it’s not flawless, but under the above conditions it’s ordinarily a nightmare.  </li>
            <li> Give this a try, if shampoo is too harsh for your hair!</li>
            <li> but with an excessive price tag.  </li>
            <li> Before this product, in order to straighten it, I needed tons of product to keep it from frizzing out...and even then, my hair gross and fake.</li>
            <li> So 15 small pumps?  </li>
            <li> IF YOU HAVE LONG HAIR, BE PREPARED TO BUY A BOTTLE AFTER EVERY 5 WASHES, WHICH MAKES THIS EXPENSIVE, AT $10.  </li>
            <li> This time, my hair was dull.</li>
            <li> A FEW TIMES, MY HAIR FELT VERY THICK</li>
            <li> My hair is quite thick (Caucasian female)and is damaged from dying over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Youll see what I mean.</li>
            <li> The results don&#x27;t seem as dramatic after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Very shocked how it went such a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had serious issues with Guthy-Renker, and was looking for an alternative to Wen, and I happened upon this stuff....</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li> The next day my hair was oily, scalp itchy, and very dirty looking.</li>
            <li> The setbacks are that it contains Rosemary oil (for fragrance), Cherry Bark extract (also for fragrance, though it is astringent but that doesn&#x27;t really do anything for hair or scalp) , and worst of all, menthol.</li>
            <li> Alas, this is not what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Before I used this my hair use to look extremely brittle on the ends, I always had to pull it up  because it just looked terrible being down</li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy, not curly, hair (caucasian) that has always been difficult to style without heat.</li>
            <li> MY HAIR FEELS THICK BECAUSE, TO ME, IT FEELS DIRTY.  </li>
            <li> , I was little bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> Needless to say it took me over a year before trying anything even close to WEN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never tried the expensive Wen brand before</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s WAY too expensive.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s way too expensive.  </li>
            <li> I started using this product because Wen is just wicked expensive and was hoping for a replacement.</li>
            <li> ill try it as shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about three weeks, and I&#x27;m not extremely impressed.  </li>
            <li> I found this randomly while browsing through Amazon</li>
            <li> I used to use the expensive infomercial brand</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading all the rave reviews, but I&#x27;m not impressed.  </li>
            <li> but it looks and feels dirty.</li>
            <li> You still have to wash off that dirty</li>
            <li> I think some of my friends think I&#x27;m crazy when I say I stopped using shampoo, but hey, if it works it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> I am sold and suddenly mad at myself for wasting all that time and money on WEN.  </li>
            <li> 2) I seem to be allergic to something in the formulation, as I have been breaking out in bad acne around my hairline.  </li>
            <li> I rinsed it out, I was really disappointed in how knotted my hair seemed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it</li>
            <li> otherwise my scalp becomes insanely itchy and oily, which is abnormal for me.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this my hair loves it !</li>
            <li> I really like this instead of using regular shampoo and conditioner, but you can buy it at Ross Dress for less, for about half the price...</li>
            <li> This is my standby. I have VERY curly hair and a scalp that often is dry and has issues. I use this almost everytime I shower.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! This is the first cleansing conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;m so happy with the results. I had heard about cleansing conditioners like wen but could never afford them. I found this gem at Grocery Outlet for 4.99 and thought I&#x27;d try it out. I was desperate for a product like this after years of having nice long brunette hair, I lost about half my hair after an overload of antibiotics in the hospital.  My hair was thin, damaged, and very dry. This product has completely restored my hair! It such a difference even my boyfriend has noticed a major change.  I highly recommend this miracle product! :)</li>
            <li> I still had to use conditioner afterward,  I went back to Suave shampoo and conditioner and this was thrown away half used.</li>
            <li> Make build up on my scalp</li>
            <li> I have used many a cleansing conditioners/ co washes and this is comparable to a lot of the higher end ones. It delivers the moisture that any of those \\&quot;Deep\\&quot; or \\&quot;Intensive\\&quot; mostuire and repair masks you see on the haircare aisle, but it cleanses away nicely. I like the Lisa Rachel flat out says on the bottle \\&quot;If you like Wen, \\&quot; because this is definitely a dupe for the Wen Haircare line, except Lisa Rachel is superior because instead of offering a few variations of the same formula with optional fragrances, she offers a variety of formulas that can suit various needs.    The formula is strong but there are some issues I would like to address. The conditioner contains sweet almond oil, Avocado oil, Aloe Leaf Juice, Hydrolized Wheat Protein, and Tea Tree oil.  So there are some good nutrient dense oils, some anti inflamitories, and the wheat protein, and when paired with gentle and nonharmful silicones and petrochemicals, it makes for a creamy and effective cleansing conditioner that doesnt stick to your hair (as long as you only use it 2-4 times a week). The setbacks are that it contains Rosemary oil (for fragrance), Cherry Bark extract (also for fragrance, though it is astringent but that doesn&#x27;t really do anything for hair or scalp) , and worst of all, menthol. Menthol is what gives the product that minty smell (hint: menthol comes from mint) , and is a topical analgesic/mild antiseptic ( have you ever used Halls for a sore throat?) while menthol does have its strengths, its not potent enough to help with scalp eczema sores/ scalp irritation except in the aspect that it mildly numbs them. Menthol was probably put into the formula because like a lot of mentholated products (Freemans Mint Julep Face Mask, Baby Lips, Clearasil Cleanser) it delivers the tingling and cooling sensation that makes the customer think \\&quot;Oh, I can feel it working!\\&quot; which isn&#x27;t true because if you could feel this working how come effective products without menthol don&#x27;t deliver any sensationswhere you feel it \\&quot;working\\&quot; ? Tea Tree and Aloe are anti-inflammotory, but when paired with menthol lose their efficacy as menthol is a skin irritant, you can&#x27;t soothe the scalp properly if it&#x27;s irritated, not to mention that irritation on the scalp or forehead area (where the product can drip down) can lead to breakout because when the skin is irritated it produces more oil as a defense mechanism.    Now if you&#x27;ve bought this product, don&#x27;t throw it out just yet, because the menthol is in a rather low concentration so long term damage from irritation is probably not in your future, but I would advise looking for a new co-wash/cleansing conditioner WITHOUT menthol after this one runs empty. I give this four stars because:   1.) It advertises Tea Tree and Avocado, and both are close to the top of the list,  2.)it is a nice cleansing conditioner that hasn&#x27;t caused me to lose hair or made me feel greasy and gunky up there   3.) without the menthol and unecessary fragrance oils/extracts, this would be a stellar cowash/cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> A long-time Wen user, I have converted to this band because it performs just as well for my long, fine, straight hair.  So pleased, and my wallet is, too :-). Great bang for the buck!</li>
            <li> Pretty good, but I prefer Hair One products, after trying both.</li>
            <li> Great product,  woorks very well. Worth the money. Shipping was fast and packaged well.</li>
            <li> I found this stuff by chance in a Ross store and gave it a try.  It&#x27;s amazing!  I decided to see if it was online, and I was thrilled to find it here.  I have very dry hair, and I&#x27;ve always had so many problems.  If I shampoo every day or every other day, it gets very brittle, frizzy, straw-like and breaks easily.  If I shampoo every 3 days, it gets greasy at the roots in between washings.  And, I usually had to use tons of leave-in treatments (conditioners, silk, etc).  I always had to comb and put leave in stuff in IMMEDIATELY after the shower, or it would get dry and stiff.  This stuff is great.  I no longer shampoo at all.  I use this stuff as directed about 3x per week.  My hair is neither dry nor oily.  It&#x27;s manageable, the curls are bouncy, and I just got a compliment on my hair yesterday after I&#x27;d been camping in the mountains 2 days w/out doing anything to it!  I use a little bit of leave-in treatment after my shower, but that is to tame my curls.  I now use the leave-in treatment in place of any type of styling product, not because I can&#x27;t get a comb thru it otherwise.  And, I don&#x27;t have to comb immediately after a shower because my hair retains some natural moisture.  After YEARS of attempting to moisturize and condition my way out of dry dry dry hair, this stuff is such a blessing! I love it!  I can even have highlights in my hair without it turning brittle now.  I plan to use nothing else but this in the future, and to buy my kids the types they need for their hair.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time today and am so pleasantly surprised. I&#x27;d tried the WEN version for damaged hair and WEN dried out and matted my chemically relaxed hair. Needless to say it took me over a year before trying anything even close to WEN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The cost of Lisa Rachel vs. WEN - no competition, I paid $9.99 for a 12 oz. bottle vs. $29 for a 16 oz bottle of WEN from QVC...Lisa Rachel is less per oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. WEN destroyed my hair, as I mentioned after one use my hair was matted, dry, broke like crazy and was so frizzy that even oil based products couldn&#x27;t calm it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. WEN didn&#x27;t rinse out well for me, it left a very thick film on my scalp. Lisa Rachel rinsed clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Lisa Rachel left my hair soft, detangled and seemingly stronger. Before Lisa Rachel I could pull my hair out with gently running my hand through it (after conditioners both rinse out and leave-in types). After Lisa Rachel, when my hair dried no hair is falling out or breaking, plus my hair is soft and bouncy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. WEN will try to sell you additional products, styling cremes, hair oils, conditioning masks and what have you. Following step 3 of Lisa Rachel, 1-3 pumps of product as a leave in conditioner has been enough, no additional products needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Dean Wen was the first to create cleansing conditioner my thanks to him, I love Lisa Rachel&#x27;s version and will use for as long it&#x27;s available. In a few weeks I will try her Dry Hair version.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product because I wanted something natural and good for my hair. I already am familiar with the amazing benefits of tea tree oil and thought I would give this a try since it&#x27;s supposedly similar to Wen. I&#x27;ve used Wen in the past and honestly Wen is slightly better but too overpriced. I&#x27;ve used this product for about 3 weeks and honestly it&#x27;s not that great at all. I can&#x27;t go more than 1 day without washing my hair with this product otherwise my scalp becomes insanely itchy and oily, which is abnormal for me. I usually can go 2-3 days without washing with no problem other than slight oiliness. The first day I used the product, my hair seemed ok. The smell was fine, my hair felt somewhat soft, appeared shiny and sleeker but results only lasted 1 day. The next day my hair was oily, scalp itchy, and very dirty looking. I would not purchase this product again. Instead I&#x27;ve found Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special which works loads better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Wen, for a LONG time, but decided to &#x27;experiment&#x27;, and give this a try, only because the price was SO much less. Once I did, I was very dissappointed! None of the claims they made turned out to be true. My hair is colored and now cut in a short pixie-style, but I STILL had to use more of this product, than I did, of Wen, when my hair was mid-length! This product is runny and oily, and it took forever to rinse completely out, yet the texture of my hair was coarse, even toward the roots. I had to use a conditioner AND a leave-in conditioner, with this product; further negating any claim they have made, stating they are comparable to Wen.  By the time I was done with this &#x27;experiment,&#x27; I had spent nearly as much as if I&#x27;d just bought Wen, in the first place! I&#x27;m now on auto-pay, with Wen, and paying less, than buying it, bottle by bottle here!It&#x27;s definately worth it and I won&#x27;t have to EVER worry about running out of the &#x27;real thing&#x27; again! I&#x27;m DEFINATELY a WEN-GIRL for LIFE!!!</li>
            <li> My hair is brittle from dying it! I really want it to be long, healthy, and ALL natural now! So this has definitely given me a great boost in making my hair a little bit more healthy! My favorite thing about this is that I can use it as a leave in conditioner too! I&#x27;m so excited that I can actually comb through my hair again! Woo hoo!</li>
            <li> Over the past 5 years I&#x27;ve tried many different shampoo and conditioners and a long list of gels and sprays and so on and so on.I have naturally curly hair that is thin but due to the humidity it will frizz and I end up looking like a Q-Tip.I&#x27;ve been using this for 1 month and I can see great improvement such as I have an easy time getting the snarls out and the frizz is down by 85% .I&#x27;m way overdue for a trim so we shall see if it&#x27;s even better which I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised ! I do wash my hair every other day and I use a sulfate free sudsy shampoo once every 2 weeks just to make sure I have no build up and so far no signs of any leftover residue from my asthma medication nor this particular product ! And I&#x27;m extremely happy I found a cleansing &amp;conditioning product that doesn&#x27;t contain lavender which I&#x27;m extremely allergic to !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just an okay product for me. You  have to use so much and my hair is SHORT, so I can only imagine what people with long hair would have to go through. As far as the results, I wasn&#x27;t much impressed. It does smell good though.</li>
            <li> There are better cleanser conditioner products out there, This one is okay. It cleans my hair, but leaves hair a little dry. I found I have to use a leave in conditioner in my hair when using this product.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I tried for half an hour to open the pump. We called amazon and they replaced the pump. Got it open but it squirts out half air and a tiny bit the size of a dime or less at a time! Who has time to pump 20xs in the am? I had to get my old Wen pump in there and now it&#x27;s finally working!!!! OMG!!! Buts it&#x27;s like a watered down version and doesn&#x27;t condition well. I had to use 2-3xs as much!!! Never again!</li>
            <li> I also bought this product at Ross and tried it last night.  My hair is fine, thin and damaged, the product made my hair soft and healthy looking.  I have tried Wen and my hair looked flat and had no body after shampooing the first time, but not the case with this product.</li>
            <li> Tried this sulfate-free hair cleanser in the hopes that it would work the same way as my current favorite version. This product was just more easily available, my favorite requires a trip to specialty beauty store or online purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just didn&#x27;t work for me. I didn&#x27;t like the smell, and my hair just didn&#x27;t feel as smooth as it does when I use my other product. My hair was almost tangled up and started to frizz up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just didn&#x27;t work the best for me.</li>
            <li> First of all I would like to say that I think this is a good product, definitely better than other expensive shampoos I have used. However, to me this is not better than Wen. I used it today for the first time after using Wen for a while and my hair was not as smooth and hydrated. I felt as if I needed to use a conditioner, while with Wen I only have to use one product. Try it, you might like it. I don&#x27;t hate it and I am definitely going to use the two bottles I purchased, but I will have to use a conditioner as well. This product alone just doesn&#x27;t work for me. I ordered the Tea Tea Oil and Avocado. Wen is a more complete product in my opinion, one step only and it smells delicious.</li>
            <li> Nice! Finally, a choice for wen users.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! It leaves my hair feeling gorgeous and soft. I don&#x27;t know why I  didn&#x27;t learn about sulfate and paraben free hair cleansers before, but they are absolutely the best! I never tried the expensive Wen brand before but I had always been curious. One day, I was at my local beauty supply and saw this cleanser on the shelf. I grabbed a bottle out of curiosity and now I am hooked! Why would I buy Wen when I can spend only $9.95 at my local beauty supply and still have the same fabulous results? I can&#x27;t wait to try all of the other scents. This is a winner and will continue to be part of my normal hair care regimen! Thanks Lisa Rachel for making healthy hair care affordable!</li>
            <li> Works really well and now I will only use these types of shampoos!</li>
            <li> I kept seeing the infomercials for WEN like everyone else and finally decided that I would try it, but wasn&#x27;t ready to commit $30 to a conditioner that might make my hair look weighted down and greasy.  So, I decided on getting a travel packet as an add-on item to a Prime order.  It was so much better than I imagined, but I still wasn&#x27;t keen on the price.  While looking for something similar, I came across this item and at a MUCH better price point, had no trouble committing.  I am so glad that I decided to try it.  The product rinses out easily and my hair actually feels soft in the shower like it would with a regular conditioner.  I don&#x27;t use as much of the product as recommended because I have fine, wavy hair, but I can tell that even in using less product my hair is more moisturized and it has a richer, healthier look to it and it&#x27;s only been two weeks that I&#x27;ve been using the product.  I&#x27;m never going back to a regular conditioner if I can help it and will definitely be stocking up with a few bottles of this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this cleansing conditioner after seeing it mentioned on reviews of WEN.  Having some little troubles with the WEN, this product has worked like a charm.  My hair ended up in really bad shape after using too many little cheap hair clips,shampoo and conditioner while visiting someone for a few months. What a mess! Everyone noticed.  I just looked unkept, older and maybe a little lazy.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and has a pleasant scent. Luckily, I noticed a difference after the first cleansing and it only got better after each use. Now, I receive compliments on my hair and I will never be without it!&lt;br /&gt;Do not worry about your hair being oily after your cleansing.  Just follow the easy directions and your hair will be softer and easier to manage.  I only wash my hair every three days and it looks great. I do color my hair and have not seen any fading even though this is not the one designed for color treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;Just cleanse, comb out, let my hair dry and pop on rollers! Now, my hair is one of my better assets. At my age, I will take all of the help I can get!</li>
            <li> Where to start... The first thing I noticed about this was how my hair was not already drying in the towel. Normally before I would take it out of the towel it would already be 1/4 of the way dry and I would have to wet it with a spray bottle before I could do anything else but with the Lisa Rachel my hair was still wet all the way through on the very first washing. As I was washing my hair I noticed I had a tingling feeling on my scalp (it was very nice) and as I was rinsing it came out very well. The way I do it is...&lt;br /&gt;bend over in the shower so my hair is all in front of me... wet my hair thoroughly... use 10 pumps on the hair in front of me and work it through really, really good... use 10 pumps at the top and back of my hair and work that through... then I use 5 pumps on the sides of my head and you guessed it, work that through... then I work with it all and leave it in until I am almost done with my shower then rinse... Once I am out of the shower a I towel dry my hair some and them put 1 more pump in and work that through and I am done. I let my hair air dry and it comes out really, really nice.&lt;br /&gt;Now I am getting ready to order the one for dry hair so I can switch in between them. Can&#x27;t wait until the other comes in. The more I have been using this the better my hair has been getting. I now wash my hair every 3 days instead of every day or every other day. I&#x27;ve only had this for two weeks approx. and I absolutely love this stuff!! Before I used this my hair use to look extremely brittle on the ends, I always had to pull it up  because it just looked terrible being down and when I would move my head my hair moved like it was all fused together. I looked like a puff ball. Now my hair lies down nice and when I pull it up for work the pony tail even moves freely and the brittle look is gone. This is really some great stuff!!</li>
            <li> This stuff does not cleanse, only adds grease to hair, makes it duller and flatter. This stuff worked the very first time, after that, it weighed down my hair. I did not feel my hair is washed properly, there is no shine at all, it is wavier than usual.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I&#x27;ve been a hairdresser for over 20 years and this product amazed me! I gave it to several clients with dry, chemically treated hair and I was so happy with how soft it made their hair. It even helped control their friz. A definite must for those of you out there battling dry,damaged, curly and chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li> I used to use WEN but it&#x27;s WAY too expensive. I&#x27;m very happy I ordered this cleansing conditioner!!! Works great and makes my scalp feel fresh and my hair is soft!</li>
            <li> I saw this at Ross and quickly searched reviews online before buying. So many of you said this was a great product. So for around $5, I thought why not. I have thick, long, wavy hair (Hispanic), so I thought this would probably not work. WRONG! I followed many other uses&#x27; advice and really worked it into my hair in sections while in the shower. I rubbed it thoroughly through my scalp. Not only did my hair seem less tangled, but it was also surprisingly clean. I even tried this product on 2 day hair with hairspray in it. I do have pretty healthy hair because I don&#x27;t color or use heat everyday BUT I still get tangles and frizz. This really seemed to help with that. I would highly recommend this AND am going back to hopefully find more!&lt;br /&gt;Side note- I tried my friend&#x27;s Wen and it was ok. She said to keep trying it, but I did not want to spend that much money so that&#x27;s why this sparked my curiosity at the store. Glad it did :)</li>
            <li> Love it! It gives my had a clean,fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> I have finally found the perfect hair care. The price is amazing for this miracle. I saw and felt the difference after the first use. I will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a potential replacement for WEN, which I have been using for several years. I like WEN but it is a bit pricey so thought I&#x27;d try something else.  This product still seems good, but a bit thinner/less effective than WEN, so I just have to use more product.  Not sure I&#x27;m really saving any money in the long run...</li>
            <li> All my expectations have been meet. This product really delivers. My hair felt totally different from the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;My natural curly hair was soft, shiny and the curls were more defined. Thanks Lisa Rachel who ever you are for making a product that really works and doesn&#x27;t cost and arm and a leg. I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> I have had serious issues with Guthy-Renker, and was looking for an alternative to Wen, and I happened upon this stuff....it smells soooooo much better than the \\&quot;W\\&quot; product, which uses cutesy names for a product that smells like creosote (green tea) or shower disinfectant (sweet almond mi*t)but IS effective.  This is cheaper, more moisturizing and so much better smelling (but not overwhelming like the L&#x27;Oreal product)  Did I say its one third of the cost of the \\&quot;W\\&quot; product??</li>
            <li> Review for Lisa Rachel Sulfate Free Conditioner &amp; Cleanser with Tea Tree Oil &amp; Avocado for Damaged Hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/25/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt compelled to update my review and give this product more stars because  my hair looks good now. I&#x27;ve cracked the code!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After not having much success the first few times I used this Lisa Rachel conditioner and cleanser, I mentioned it to my mother, who uses Wen. She told me that she did not like Wen when she first started using it, but gave the product a month to work and found that her hair was softer and shinier than at first. So, I did the same thing with this Lisa Rachel sulfate free shampoo and conditioner for damaged hair and now I am happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What made the difference - 1) I don&#x27;t think I was using the correct amount before so my hair wasn&#x27;t getting clean. Now my hair does not have a \\&quot;film\\&quot; on it after I dry it. It is bouncy and shiny. Also, my hair holds a curl without needing hairspray. That is a pleasant change!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this might be my imagination, but my hair doesn&#x27;t seem to get as dirty as quickly as it used to. My scalp doesn&#x27;t itch like it used to sometimes and when I do scratch, I don&#x27;t get flakes of skin all over my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars is that it is still much more expensive per ounce  than the shampoo I used to use.&lt;br /&gt;~~~&lt;br /&gt;I liked this product at first but just changed my rating and am editing my review. It leaves my hair feeling clean and soft - but my hair is dull and doesn&#x27;t hold a curl long. Also, I am not sure it&#x27;s worth the extra cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am African American and have dry hair with super tight curls. Normally, I use Garnier&#x27;s Fructis shampoo and conditioner for dry hair or Chi&#x27;s Intense shampoo and conditioner, put AG&#x27;s Set It Straight lotion on my hair and blow dry then flat iron it. I&#x27;ve been happy with that regimen but wanted to try products that were more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; and didn&#x27;t strip my hair of oil. My mother raves about Wen products but I didn&#x27;t want to spend $30 a bottle for it so I searched around, read the reviews, and settled on Lisa Rachel&#x27;s formula for damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions to the letter and found that it worked well for cleaning. I could feel a nice cooling sensation on my scalp when I let it sit for about 5 minutes and found that the product smelled a bit like menthol or something similar. Fortunately the smell, which was light, completely went away when I rinsed my hair. I didn&#x27;t mind that this product did not lather because I knew from the description and reviews that it would not. Also, my hair felt surprisingly clean when I was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is with the conditioning aspect of the Lisa Rachel product. I did not add any of my normal conditioner so I could see how it worked. Other than that, I did follow my normal routine and my hair turned out to be very soft and held its shape once flat-ironed and styled. But - it only held its shape for about two hours. After that, it became \\&quot;poofy\\&quot; and did not at all look like I had spent tons of time doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product only 3 stars for a few reasons: 1) Though my hair was soft, it wasn&#x27;t as shiny as I had hoped. When I use the Garnier or Chi shampoo and conditioner (that I get at about half the price at TJ Maxx), my hair is super shiny without my having to add a bunch of extra stuff. This time, my hair was dull. 2) The directions on the bottle say that the more you use the better the product works. Hmm - just seems like a way to get you to use up the bottle faster so you can buy more. 3) Even with this product being a shampoo and conditioner in one, it&#x27;s still much more expensive than the Garnier products I normally use and the results aren&#x27;t any better. This Lisa Rachel product for damaged hair runs about $1.25 an ounce versus the $0.25 an ounce I pay for Garnier shampoo and conditioner combined (I buy them in bulk at BJ&#x27;s).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So- overall I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. I love the fact that the ingredients are much more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; than the ones in the shampoo and conditioner I normally use and it doesn&#x27;t have any sulfates. On the other hand, it&#x27;s about 5 times more expensive as the products I normally use and my hair looks worse. So, for me, the natural aspects don&#x27;t outweigh the negatives.</li>
            <li> I saw this product at D.D. Discounts and thought I&#x27;d try it.  I wanted to try the Wen brand but it&#x27;s way too expensive.  I have Brazilian Blow Out in my hair and it doesn&#x27;t strip it and I think I will not get it re-done since this product makes my hair so silky and smooth.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 10 days.  OMG!!  My hair is so soft and no longer brittle and dry looking and my fine hair isn&#x27;t heavy or greasy.  I used to have to use many different products to keep the frizzies away and now I don&#x27;t use anything at all.  I am going back to D.D&#x27;s and stock up!!</li>
            <li> Same as the Color Treated version.  Great product.  I began using Wen and tried this last year as a lower cost option.  Honestly, it leaves my hair softer than Wen - wow.  And I really liked Wen.  This is a great product for my natural, wash and go hairstyle.</li>
            <li> love this product. works great does&#x27;t leave hair greasy at all</li>
            <li> After seeing all the hype about lather -free, I decided to give it a try..nothing like all the hype..no shiny silky hair...glad I only paid $11.00.....</li>
            <li> I feel bad for not liking this product because my boyfriend bought it for me thinking it was going to be as good as WEN but unfortunately it&#x27;s not. I have been using WEN for about a year and it is pricey so I was looking for something as good that did not cost so much. Lisa Rachel product makes me feel like I am putting lotion on my hair. I have short hair and need a little natural lift but didn&#x27;t get it with this product. It makes my hair soft yes but it looks and feels dirty. I will definately go back to WEN no matter the cost. I would not recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> It definitely cleanses my hair, almost makes it fuller.</li>
            <li> Thought I would give this a try because it was said that it was WEN-LIKE,and much cheaper. Well I;m sticking with my WEN products.</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen. But i feel this product is comparable. Much cheaper and i LOVE the scent. I would recommend and buy again.</li>
            <li> I lost so much hair you could see parts of my scalp. I haven&#x27;t recognized much increased thickness since I started a month ago but the hair loss is all but gone.</li>
            <li> I  have been using the Wen conditioner and thought I would try this in its place due to price - I have found that this is much thinner than what I am use to but not a bad product - just not the same.</li>
            <li> After reading couples of lovely reviews for this shampoo I ordered it and after using that all of my day I used to collect my hair from bath tub,rug,bathroom floor,towel,bed,cushion etc.etc.etc.&lt;br /&gt;And I immediately stopped using this product. This is a great shampoo to make you BALD.</li>
            <li> I gave up shampoo over a year ago and have been trying different conditioners to cleanse me hair via the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;no shampoo&amp;#34; method. However along the way I have tried a few sulphate free shampoos, to compare, and they all leave my kinky coils dried out! This cleansing product I absolutely love! I&#x27;ve been holding on to the bottle for 6 months hoping to find it again but couldn&#x27;t so I looked online and it&#x27;s here yay! My hair and scalp felt clean but most of all moisturized! Plus it smells very organic, like you dropped the essential oils in it yourself. This is the ONLY &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34;  I would ever use.</li>
            <li> Made hair soft. I think the tea tree irritated my scalp. I have flakey scalp after 2 uses. WEN products never did this</li>
            <li> I was hoping this product would really make a difference with my frizzies.  Instead, I now look like Bozo the Clown, with both frizzies and waves I never had before.  For the amount of product you&#x27;re supposed to use, I would have thought that after a few weeks, my hair might begin to behave better.  In short, this is a cute product in nifty packaging that was pretty much a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 different Conditioning Cleaners and the other is much better on my hair.</li>
            <li> This is not a bad &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; but the only similarity to Wen was the manner in application. I started using this product because Wen is just wicked expensive and was hoping for a replacement. Alas, this is not what I was hoping for. I had just stopped using Wen and switched to this product. My hair was just not happy with the change and became very dry on the ends.</li>
            <li> (Long, fine colour treated hair that is oily at scalp and dry on ends)&lt;br /&gt;Was looking for a new shampoo alternative and I think I&#x27;ve found it! I tried wen once and it left my hair greasy at the scalp and didnt do anything for my ends (I didn&#x27;t care for the smell either), so I was a little hesitant to try this. You do have to use a lot in your hair, think golf ball size. Because this doesn&#x27;t have sulfates and bubbles, it doesn&#x27;t spread through to the scalp as easily as normal shampoos, so work it in all over till u feel it on ur scalp. What I love about this product, is after a few minutes in the shower with this on my head my scalp starts to get a cool tingly feeling (I&#x27;m assuming is the tea tree oil) and I love that feeling. Feels fresh and clean.also make sure u rinse it out very well at the scalp. This stuff has left my hair conditioned and shiny like after using a deep conditioner, but also clean like a shampoo.... Weird, but great! I am in love and will be ordering more of this 10 dollar fix instead of my old 65 dollar shampoo and 30 conditioner! Please do not discontinue this!</li>
            <li> This product is just ok.  Doesn&#x27;t have the greatest smell, and I don&#x27;t see that it works better than any of the lower-priced cleansing conditioners.</li>
            <li> I cannot afford WEN but I can afford this. The tea tree has a wonderful feel and smell. Leaves my hair soft and moisturized. Looks so much more healthier. Only need to was my hair 3 tomes a week now. It&#x27;s a great product. Save the 29.95 a month subscription  with WEN  and get this product instead.</li>
            <li> Love this --but only one complaint- wish the pump was wider as it only pumps a thin stream and i have very long hair so takes some time to get the 3-4 tblsps I like to use. If this had an easier dispensing pump or was available in a tub to scoop out it would be absolutely PERFECT!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for over a year now and my hair not only looks beautiful but it stopped breaking and has grown longer that I have ever had it in my entire life. My hair never grew more than a few inches past my shoulders and now it is almost reaching my waist. who would have thought. I have spent a fortune on hair products in the beauty supply stores and with the cosmeticians. I have used other wen type products but this one is the best. I have purchased it at the only beauty supply that I can find it, but they are always running out and it can take 3-4 weeks or more for them to put it on their shelves. My hair cannot go that long without washing (smile) I have looked for this online before and never found it to my frustration and when I finally did WOW I was thrilled and also I get it for $4.00 less a bottle than what my beauty supply store sells it for. I know I will never use traditional shampoo again and with this one, it does not leave that greasy residue that other products do. No shampoo will ever touch these locks again. FIVE STARS for Irene Gari Lisa Rachel Shampoo for giving us something that really works. FYI - I dont use anything else, no extra conditioners, polishers, nothing...my hair is shinier, more manageable and never dry - you know the blondes that look like their hair is straw or hay. I have long blonde locks and everyone thinks its my natural color coz my hair looks like natural healthy blonde hair that does not come with the peroxide damages from processing it. anyway to sum it up - this one is the best and my hair is processed, blonde and tends to be dry. (for your comparison only) However this one, tea tree oil and avocado - conditions, shines, cleans and rinses well so I have full body - not like others that leave a residue and leave hair limp and dirty feeling in a day. Hope this helps and you wont regret no matter what your hair type is using it. Youll see what I mean. Take care</li>
            <li> It appears as though the majority of people who are reviewing this product have fine hair.  My hair is quite thick (Caucasian female)and is damaged from dying over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product for 1 week - my hair felt dull, lifeless, and a little more stiff than usual.  The crown of my head was weighed down like I was using too much conditioner and the ends felt like they were very stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall not very pleased with this product.  It is not for my hair type at all.  I think if you have fine hair that is minimally damaged it would be a great product - but I would still use a different shampoo on the roots for life.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling sticky and with no shine.  I tested on my 4 year old son and his silky smooth hair changed to sticky, no-shine hair in just 2 uses.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a thorough researcher/ explorer for nontoxic products in every way.. have been using biotin, wen, acv, baby powder, cowashes and cleansing conditioners for my hair lately due to a major move in climates. the move was dehydrating for my body in general and my hair was suffering.&lt;br /&gt;this product was maybe one tenth as good as wen. leaves hair still a little greasy. not bouncy and absolutely no &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;maybe ill try it as shaving cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not Wen, that&#x27;s for sure. I have used several cleansing conditioners and the only kind I like is wen....you get what you pay for I guess.</li>
            <li> After my coworker gave me her surplus Wen, I fell in love and had to find a cheaper alternative. This is it. It&#x27;s not too drying, it cleans well, has the perfect consistency and leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable. I also really like the addition of tea tree in this. It adds a mild tingle and great refreshing smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, thick, a bit curly hair that I blowout daily, despite my hair dressers well meaning advice not to. My hair is also prone to dryness and frizz, probably as the result of my daily blow-dry. I&#x27;ve tested other co-washes that have been to harsh or too oily. This one is the perfect middle ground for my hair type: Cleaning, but also moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I tried lots of natural and organic shampoos and I find myself going back to this one. It gives me beautiful soft curls (I have wavy frizzy hair) and keeps my hair tamed for days. I don&#x27;t need to use conditioner while using this product. I just occasionally use a hair mask for my ends.</li>
            <li> Almost as good as Wen. I&#x27;ve been trying them all. Wen is still the best but this is a very close second.</li>
            <li> This product is actually pretty good: I use WEN products for last 10 years but they keep wanting to ship every 2 months which caused me to have like 6 boxes un-used. So I canceled them. Then I bought LS conditioner. It works ok but WEN is still better...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about three weeks, and I&#x27;m not extremely impressed.  I have medium/fine, short (above the shoulders), color-treated hair.  Before trying this I was doing co-wash with Tigi Self-Absorbed six days a week and shampooing/conditioning (with same conditioner/shampoo) on the seventh day.  My hair looked and felt better doing the co-wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  As strange as it sounds, I feel like I need to use a conditioner after I use the LR Tea Tree and Avocado Conditioner &amp; Cleanser.  It&#x27;s supposed to be for damaged hair, but my hair is not extremely damaged and it still leaves it feeling dry.  Also, I really don&#x27;t like the feel or smell of the peppermint essential oil that is VERY, VERY heavy in this.  Maybe they were going for the &amp;#34;dandruff cleanser/conditioner&amp;#34; and mislabeled it?  I would absolutely prefer the smell of tea tree eo that the label touts (in fact, that&#x27;s why I bought this specific product in the first place!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I haven&#x27;t tried Wen or any of the other conditioning cleansers, so I really can&#x27;t compare this to them.  Just from my experience, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the LR Tea Tree and Avocado Conditioner &amp; Cleanser to others.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my hair so soft.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> This product cleans my hair without stripping the natural oils from my hair, I can also use this daily without drying out my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this for the last month and love the way my hair feels after using it. I have relaxed, color treated hair and this product leaves my hair soft, feeling fuller, shiny and clean. I also like that there are no harsh perfumes that so many other products have. So glad that I discovered this conditioner/cleanser.</li>
            <li> Excellent!!! Dupe for Wen!!</li>
            <li> The label says &amp;#34;if you like Wen, you&#x27;ll love Lisa Rachel&amp;#34;.  This is backwards in my opinion.  I love Wen, I like this.  While I hate the high cost of Wen, this is not as good and certainly not better.  It costs less and I like it less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems a bit too waxy for me.  Wen rinses clean and leaves your hair soft and supple.  This product is a tad bit heavier and leaves it a bit more weighed down; not much mind you, just some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is - I like this... just not as much as Wen.</li>
            <li> I bought this brand along with another brand that wasnt the tea tree oil.  I get scabs on my scalp that wont heal for months and I was hoping this would help.  It is much thicker than the other brand and leaves a greasy film on my hair.  I use this just for my hairline where I tend to break out but I cant say that it helped much.  I wouldnt purchase again.</li>
            <li> I am a huge WEN fan and use the cleansing conditioner, among other products, daily.  I happened to see this product on Amazon and decided to purchase it as not something to try by itself but to mix it with my WEN product to help extend it because WEN, as everybody that uses it knows, it&#x27;s not in-expensive.  I was surprised to read the instructions on the label and it kind of suggests to use was equals to about 1/4 of the bottle for a single shampoo!  Could this be a mis-print?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is slightly thicker than what I&#x27;m used to but it mixed well with the WEN (about 3-4 pumps of each).  Have not tried it by itself...yet.  But, so far, my hair seems to like it.  Frizzies are down and it feels moisturized.  I wear my hear in a bob and scrunch it, letting it dry naturally so I don&#x27;t brush it throughout the day.  Moisturized hair in this style is critical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;m liking this and I&#x27;m really glad for the price tag.  I would definitely recommend at least trying this.</li>
            <li> After using the entire bottle and trying (at least half a bottle) many other brands of cleansing conditioners I decided to write this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot tell the difference between this and Wen. It cleanses and moisturizes my hair perfectly. I have oily hair, it does not make it greasy. My bf has very dry scalp and it keeps the flakes away. The price is way better than Wen. As long as they keep using the formula I am a forever customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who think this product leaves your hair greasy, follow the instructions. Apply a generous amount, message through your hair and scalp thoroughly, rinse it completely off (which will get rid the dirt and oil build up), then apply a small amount for conditioning. Don&#x27;t just put it in your hair and rinse half of it off thinking you&#x27;re leaving some in for moisture. You still have to wash off that dirty hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And those who complains that it makes your hair heavy and hard to dry... healthy hair is heavier than damaged hair and normally takes longer to dry. Isn&#x27;t it why you&#x27;re trying these products in the first place?</li>
            <li> I love it I use itvas my shampoo and my deep conditioner</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO AND WANTED TO USE IT SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE I GAVE MY OPINION, AS I HAVE NEVER USED A PRODUCT THAT DOESN&#x27;T SUDS-UP.  FIRST OF ALL, IT SMELLS LIKE NOXEMA STRAIGHT FROM THE BOTTLE, BUT DOESN&#x27;T MAKE YOUR HAIR SMELL LIKE THAT ONCE IT&#x27;S RINSED OUT,  IT TINGLES A LITTLE, I AM ASSUMING BECAUSE OF THE MENTHOL.  I HAVE THICK, HIGHLIGHTED BLONDE HAIR JUST PAST MY SHOULDERS.  I GET MY HAIR THINNED, SO IT&#x27;S MANAGEABLE AND EASIER TO WORK WITH.  AFTER USING THIS PRODUCT A FEW TIMES, MY HAIR FELT VERY THICK (EVEN THOUGH I HAD JUST HAD IT TRIMMED AND EXTREMELY THINNED OUT)!  I DIDN&#x27;T FEEL LIKE IT CLEANED MY HAIR VERY WELL.  IS STARTED TO SEE SIGNS OF GREASY HAIR THE DAY AFTER I WASHED IT!  (I USUALLY WASH MY HAIR 2 TIMES PER WEEK, AND DON&#x27;T HAVE THIS PROBLEM).  MY HAIR FEELS THICK BECAUSE, TO ME, IT FEELS DIRTY.  IT IS VERY EASY TO USE, ALTHOUGH YOU DO HAVE TO USE A LOT OF THE PRODUCT EACH TIME YOU WASH.  IF YOU HAVE LONG HAIR, BE PREPARED TO BUY A BOTTLE AFTER EVERY 5 WASHES, WHICH MAKES THIS EXPENSIVE, AT $10.  ALSO, MY HAIR SEEMED TO BE GREASY AT ROOTS OF HAIR, FROM SCALP TO ABOUT 2 INCHES OFF OF MY HEAD, THEN THE REST BECAME STATIC-Y AND FLY AWAY.  I WILL NOT BUY THIS AGAIN.</li>
            <li> I love it! Makes my hair so soft. It feels &amp; smells clean too. I like the cool refreshing feeling it makes on my scalp :)</li>
            <li> Smell is great...though the direction to use is kinda complicated and takes a big amount and long time to get my hair (short!), and it won&#x27;t rather much. Not suitable for a busy girl like me. Ended up buying a conventional shampoo and using this product as a conditioner...</li>
            <li> I wanted to try Wen for years but did not want to spend that much money.  I found this at Ross around 10/2011 for $5.00 and have used it until 10/2012.  The first time I washed my hair with this it was amazing the difference. I have very dry red hair and this made my hair shiny and bouncy. Even more amazing was how fast my hair grew in a year (pixie cut to touching my shoulders) and this when I am 49 years old and spent five months on 500 - 1000 calorie diet. I wanted to try Wen so I ordered it about a year later and my hair did appear a little shiner but after about three weeks of use my hair started falling out in hand fulls.  Stopped Wen and now back to this cheaper version.</li>
            <li> I love Lisa Rachel. I use it as a leave-in conditioner that makes my hair feel thicker and healthy. Does not weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> I was a wen user and I really liked the way they treat my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I had been looking for something cheaper, affordable, and good for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;This product is actually similar to wen, but wen is much more thicker and richer. I felt really clean and it refreshed my scalp. This was likely the way wen does. So you apply some amount of this product, wait for  5 minutes, then rinse it out. It did not make my hair light and soft like wen did, I was little bit disappointed. I did not expect too much for this product, but I hoped it could be better.&lt;br /&gt;But it definitely much better than general shampoo, so I might keep using it when I cant afford wen.</li>
            <li> (fast forward to the bottom for results, this is my background) I am a caucasian with fine , shoulder length hair. It likes to break easily, and my normal regimen includes daily shampoo and condition via Moroccan Oil Volumizing (need to shampoo daily because my hair gets greasy fast), BB Tonic, Moroccan Oil itself, and an Aveda volumizer before drying and sometimes curling. This is the only way to keep it nongreasy, volumized and still not look like a viking in the morning for work. I also get Brazilian Blowouts once a year to keep my hair from tangling and kinking. I am one of those people that can&#x27;t stand the feeling of an oily scalp, and the number one way to make me cranky is to force me away from a shower for 48 hours. My hair is damaged from heat products, as well as four years of keeping it up in a tight, wet bun in the military unless sleeping (been trying to cut and grow healthier hair since getting out, but it&#x27;s still fighting me). I am a vegetarian with excellent health habits and drink lots of water, but still my hair is unruly and Expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thought about using Wen- but what&#x27;s the point when the cost equals my existing regimen? So I found Lisa&#x27;s formula and saw the reviews. I tried it for the first time today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions closely for my first time, and was a little bummed out by having to comb it through because my hair tangles and pulls out easily when wet. The first thing I noticed out of the shower though was that my hair wasn&#x27;t half dry from the towel. It held the moisture for half an hour without dripping. This worried me because I was concerned my hair was going to be Really greasy when it dried. I used a half pump of the clenaser as a leave in conditioner and Lisa&#x27;s tonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a blowdryer on it and my drying time was cut in half despite the hair holding moisture. I used a simple paddle brush and managed to dry it straight in very little time using no other products. I stepped in front ofthe mirror and was amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels thicker. It is light/bouncy, but not frizzy. The ends aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;showing off&amp;#34; like they normally do after I blow dry, and I am a little merciless with my blowdrying habits because I&#x27;m in a rush. No tangles after blow drying, and it&#x27;s straight with a little curl under at the bottom. It &#x27;feels&amp;#34; like after I get the ends trimmed- heavier but flexible and it moves easer. I AM IN LOVE.&lt;br /&gt;I never expected these results-- I was planning on staying in the house for the day in case it went badly lol. PS It smells really good- like a nice spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took the time to write this long review because I don&#x27;t see a lot of hair types like mine being mentioned on here. All I know is it has worked for me Day One.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll post a followup in a few weeks to let you know how the transition goes, I know there will be a learning curve dealing with my &amp;#34;new scalp&amp;#34; environment as it produces its oils in a more balanced way. The Price and the Results have me hooked, I really hope I feel this way in a month but the experience has been a total success so far :) Good Luck!!!</li>
            <li> Well, I had high hopes for the Lisa Rachel product, but alas, it is still not Wen.  This product left my hair feeling dry and greasy(I didn&#x27;t think that was possible).  I don&#x27;t have any of the clean soft feeling Wen leaves my hair.  I read that alot of folks have problems with Wen, but I&#x27;ve now tried 3 other copycat products and all fall short of the original. The Lisa Rachel product felt greasy on my hair (vs. \\&quot;creamy\\&quot;) and yet the tips of my hair are like straw. Anyway, I&#x27;m glad this works for some people, I guess my hair is sticking with the expensive stuff :-(</li>
            <li> This is the best non Wen I have tried and I have tried at least a half dozen. I am ordering in volume next time for sure!</li>
            <li> I read in description &amp;#34;good for fine hair&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;NOT SO.  Made my fine hair sooo limp.&lt;br /&gt;Personally this and Wen are nothing but &amp;#34;glorified conditioners&amp;#34;. IMHO&lt;br /&gt; If your hair is very course then would work okay.</li>
            <li> but finally cancelled my membership; I thought the product (WEN, that is) was probably better than most traditional shampoo/conditioner combos, but not nearly worth the price.  My hair is very long, naturally wavy, and bleached; “fly-away” is a normal state of being, and it almost always requires multiple products and a flat iron to look presentable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Lisa Rachel Conditioner &amp; Cleanser for Damaged Hair last night for the first time.  I then allowed my hair to dry naturally with no product, maybe brushed it twice, and went to bed with it was still damp.  I cannot believe how good my hair looks this morning.  Please understand, it’s not flawless, but under the above conditions it’s ordinarily a nightmare.  I felt obliged to post a well-deserved review right away.  I am sold and suddenly mad at myself for wasting all that time and money on WEN.  Nevertheless, I will be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but not for the usual purposes! I didn&#x27;t particularly like using it on my hair, but over the past two years I have used it on skin irritations and rashes. It has healed areas that even prescription products would not help. I will always keep it on hand for that purpose. If you have skin problems, give it a try!!!</li>
            <li> I have used Wen in the past, but had to discontinue it due to hair loss from heavy buildup.  My hair is fine textured, long and very straight and I have tons of it. With this &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; my hair feels better after each use. It does not weigh my hair down either. I can safely wash my hair every other day. This is a winner for me.</li>
            <li> It works well for me .</li>
            <li> I was converted to cleansing conditioners by Wen, which I love, but I needed something less expensive. The Lisa Rachel avocado tea tree oil conditioner has worked just as well for my hair (long, fine, straight and flyaway) as Wen did. I recommend giving it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, a note on cleansing conditioners: I see a fair amount of negative reviews in which people complain that the conditioner made their hair greasy or made them break out at their hairline - I know everyone&#x27;s hair and scalp are different, but you need to be aware that when you switch to a cleansing conditioner from traditional shampoo, your scalp is accustomed to having the shampoo strip the hair of natural oils, so when you stop using shampoo, your scalp and hair have to regain their natural oil balance and initially will often generate too much oil, hence the greasy hair. It is truly worth living through a week to two of greasiness to let your hair regain its natural oil balance. My hair used to be so brittle and frizzy-flyaway and require a ton of hairspray just to keep it looking tidy instead of a dull flyaway halo on my head; since switching to cleansing conditioners it is so much healthier and prettier, but I did have to live through a brief period of oiliness and some hairline break outs. Another note: for my hair at least, even though it is long, I do not need nearly as much as the bottle tells you to use. I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s very important to thoroughly saturate and rub your scalp and rinse your hair with water first, then thoroughly massage in the conditioner (no, not for two whole minutes as the bottle says), then let it sit while you do your other shower functions, then massage as you rinse. I spread a final pump through the bottom half of my hair last and only partially rinse it (the water is more to spread it through) as leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Works as well as Wen, for a lot less!</li>
            <li> Works similarly to the much more expensive Chaz Dean WEN tea tree product.  It isn&#x27;t quite as good, but, for the price, I feel it is worth it.  It does take some playing around to find the right amount of &amp;#34;pumps&amp;#34; for your hair type - if you use too much or too little, your hair either doesn&#x27;t feel clean, or feels too greasy.  Once you get that worked out, though, via trial and error, it does make your hair look nice, and it isn&#x27;t as drying as using a traditional shampoo followed by a conditioner.</li>
            <li> Very nourishing. I use it a few times a week. My hair seems to get use to it, or maybe even gets build up? The results don&#x27;t seem as dramatic after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly, but really malleable- I can do just about anything with it.  I don&#x27;t blow dry but once a month, if that (I usually just let it do it&#x27;s own thing) but I recently began experiencing an increase in split-ends, frizziness, and major scalp irritation. I normally just use 99 cent Suave shampoo and conditioner, and thought maybe that could be the problem- like, maybe after 2 years it declares war on your hair? I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not one to spend money on beauty products, but after seeing so many WEN commercials, I was really curious to try a conditioning cleanser to see if it helped. I recieved an Amazon gift card for Christmas, and didn&#x27;t want to spend the entire thing on a bottle of hair cleaner, so I looked for an inexpensive alternative. I came across this product, and after reading all of the reviews, decided to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as it arrived, I ran upstairs to take a shower. I ripped open the package and read the directions, and was a little shocked at how much product you are expected to use for each cleansing- 5-7 pumps to massage into the scalp, 8-10 to massage to the ends, and then another 8-10 pumps to massage all over. That&#x27;s a minimum of 23 pumps EVERY.TIME. If you pump a soap dispenser into your hand 23 times, that gives you an idea of how much product is MINIMAL. So, first time I used it, I did minimum. The bottle also says the longer you leave it in, the better the results, so I used it at the very beginning of my shower, and left it in for the duration, so about 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I rinsed it out, I was really disappointed in how knotted my hair seemed. It definitely wasn&#x27;t the silky-smoothness you get after rinsing out a conditioner, it was more like how your hair feels after shampooing, so that was a little disappointing, but I shrugged it off because, hey, what the heck do I know about cleansing conditioner? I stepped out and wrapped a towel around my head, dried off, and then took the towel off my head. I was shocked to look in the mirror and see the roots of my hair looked dry, and I had frizzy hairs sticking out of the top of my head like a little frizz-forest. I brushed it out the best I could and blow-dried my hair to see if it looked shinier/healthy/sexier. No. It was actually really dry and would not stay un-knotted. I&#x27;d brush it, and 5 minutes later wouldn&#x27;t be able to run my fingers through my hair.  On the plus side, my scalp felt really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning, I woke up to hair that looked like I&#x27;d slathered it in bacon grease. Because of the nature of my hair, I generally only wash it every 3 days, but using this product, I ended up having to wash it every day. At first, I thought maybe I just wasn&#x27;t use to such awesome shine, but no. It was just really, REALLY greasy.  I couldn&#x27;t even get away with every other day because of the excessive shine-goo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using this product so many ways based on the reviews I read- I used more, I used less, I left it on more, I left it on less... At one point I even used FORTY FIVE pumps because the back of the bottle says \\&quot;the more you use, the better the results!\\&quot; Let me be the first to tell you this is not true. Unless the results you&#x27;re looking for involve the ability to fry an egg in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another big problem I experienced with this product had nothing to do with my hair- it made my back break out!! Really, wherever my hair had laid on my back while I waited to rinse the product out, I would wind up with a trail of pus mountains.  I fixed this by trying to keep it loosely clipped, but even then, my neck would break out! I still have a neck zit I&#x27;m trying to get rid of. It&#x27;s so big, concealer just laughs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product until the bottle was empty, which was about 2 whole weeks altogether. Towards the end, I wound up alternating it with my Suave, just because I couldn&#x27;t stand washing my hair so often.  This product did help with my scalp irritation, but that&#x27;s probably the only good thing I can say about it.... Well, it did smell good. So there&#x27;s two nice things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps! :)</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner combo. It makes my hair feels so soft. It took two bottles before I really noticed the damage repaired. But it was worth the wait. This is the only shampoo I use now.</li>
            <li> I looooove these cream cleansers.  This one is a bit heavy for my roots... Gets greasy on day two...but I love it for mid to ends.  I have long (mid back length) blonde, wavy, fine hair.  It smells great too.</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful, cleans my oily hair well, and leaves it feeling soft.  My two issues:  1) the pump is broken, so I have to unscrew the pump handle and squeeze out the product, then rescrew on the top; 2) I seem to be allergic to something in the formulation, as I have been breaking out in bad acne around my hairline.  But I recommend it to anyone without acne issues!</li>
            <li> I just got this product today and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. I have never used Wen before, so I didn&#x27;t have a preconceived notion for my experience. The only smell that comes through is Tea Tree Oil which I like. I didn&#x27;t feel the tingle when I first put it on my hair but I followed the instructions of massaging it into my scalp and once I added the splash of water, it was an explosion of Tea Tree mint DREAM. I could literally feel the &amp;#34;dirt&amp;#34; and oils melting away. I worked in 7 pumps for step 2 and could tell an immediate difference in the moisture level in my hair. The rinse out was easy and different than my typical matte-mess with regular shampoo. My hair was silky feeling and well...clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did experience what some called a &amp;#34;stickiness&amp;#34; to my hair when I first got out of the shower, but it is my belief that this is simply a different texture than regular shampoo users are accustom to, as I was able to comb through my hair much easier than ever before. No tangles. I did apply a few pumps post shower as a leave-in and segment-combed with a wide tooth comb. I let it air dry and even as I type this, I still feel the refreshing tingle of the Tea Tree Oil. My hair. which is naturally curly and somewhat coarse looks AMAZING. I have used no heat equipment and no product and it looks better now than on my best styled days. The cuticle is sealed and there is NO frizziness at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish I had found out about this product sooner and will be doing a little &amp;#34;show-n-tell&amp;#34; to all my friends. 5 STARS!!!!</li>
            <li> Use as directed and your hair will be soooo soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have been buying Wen for a few years now. With the Wen costing so much money, I decide to give this a try. Im very happy with it. I will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.&lt;br /&gt;I have AA hair, and this does a great job of actually conditioning the strands and combating dryness.&lt;br /&gt;It gives you instructions on how to apply &amp; massage various sections of your hair, but whatever...just slap it on.:)&lt;br /&gt;My hair is actually soft afterward too, which is a challenging accomplishment!&lt;br /&gt;It says you can use this as a leave-in conditioner while wet.  I use it as such on dry hair, and I find my curls come out better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchase mine at Ross.&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck!</li>
            <li> At first I was apprehensive to try this product because Wen didn&#x27;t &#x27;wow&#x27; me. But this product is a staple! It cleanses while moisturizing. It softened me hair and made my scalp tingle. Give this a try, if shampoo is too harsh for your hair!</li>
            <li> I have really fine hair that was really damaged from over processing and this stuff made my hair so soft and shiny. You could hardly see my split ends after using this product, I tried the Wen stuff and wasn&#x27;t impressed especially for the price so I took a chance on this product because the price was good and I&#x27;m so happy I did because it is amazing.</li>
            <li> I used the entire bottle as a cleanser and leave-in conditioner.  There is now a bald spot on my head and my scalp shows more in the parting of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have stopped using this cleanser and will update on the regrowth of my hair.</li>
            <li> I found this randomly while browsing through Amazon and I am so glad I did! I had previously been using Wen for at least 7-8 months and have gone through probably 4 bottles at around $32 each. I have wavy/curly long hair and I have been washing with sulfate free shampoos for years and washing with conditioner rather than shampoo for over a year. I did like Wen, but it is pretty expensive and I was never blown away with it. I ordered this one for damaged hair because the scents on the others were not clear and I know I like tea tree so I figured it was a safe bet. I like the consistency of this product better than Wen, it feels like its easier to work into my scalp and more effective at cleansing. Definitely doesn&#x27;t weigh my fairly fine hair down, doesn&#x27;t look greasy and doesn&#x27;t leave any film on the hair or anything. I would also agree with some of the other people who say that the clean you get from Wen doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as it does with this one, although I really don&#x27;t have greasy hair that needs to be washed a ton. I&#x27;m a college student so the price point on this is a lot more reasonable than Wen for doing the same thing if not better. I definitely plan to try the other scents, and I have Prime so the free two day shipping allows me to wait till my bottle runs out then order and it gets here before I even need to wash my hair again.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair flat.  Wen worked better.</li>
            <li> not as good as wen, but definitively does the job at a more reasonable price, would def. buy again</li>
            <li> I really like the product. I can&#x27;t compare to wen caus I&#x27;ve never used wen. But I like the results</li>
            <li> I really enjoy how this conditioner isn&#x27;t too heavy and doesn&#x27;t have that &#x27;chemical smell&#x27; of other conditioners. I don&#x27;t use very much each time, so it lasts a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d ordered Lisa Rachel but was sent Hair One. Hair One is pretty great though, I have long thick hair that tends to get oily on top and dry on the ends. My hair is naturally curly/wavy and it gets so tangled. This product is amazing, I combine it with As I Am Co-Wash and CHI Silk Treatment; my hair is so much betten than with using shampoo/conditioner. I no longer have frizzy fly aways, my hair is manageable, my hair is silky and lightweight.  This is my first time using a cleansing wash and I no longer have the desire to use shampoo/ conditioner.</li>
            <li> Not at all like WEN. You get what you pay for. Made my head itchy</li>
            <li> ive tried wen and this product is just as good for about a third the cost, love it</li>
            <li> I like the smell and how my hair feels after, it cleans better than wen and feels lighter but you have to leave it enough on your hair, it makes it easy to style</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really seem to cure the problem, only mask the symptoms for a while.</li>
            <li> From my own personal experience and also my daughter&#x27;s, this product has the same qualities which have made other similar conditioning hair cleansers very famous... but with an excessive price tag.  Our choice is to pay less without sacrificing quality, and we found the answer with this product.  Beware, however, not all conditioning hair cleansers are what they claim to be.  This one is the alternative that has worked for both of us.  We have nice hair... soft, shiny, manageable and healthy.</li>
            <li> As good or better than WEN as far as how the product itself works for my hair.  I was a little surprised about the size of the bottle.  It is a better price than WEN, but it&#x27;s also a smaller bottle.</li>
            <li> Tea tree is not for me. Although the smell is nice,  it made my curls extremely limp and my scalp itch.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! My hair is always really dry, even when I use organic shampoo and follow with organic conditioner. But, this has shown to improve my scalp and leave my hair feeling less dry. I use about 4 pumps and my hair is below my shoulders. If you massage it into your scalp and through the ends well, leaving it on for about 3 minutes, the tea tree has positive effects if you have any dandruff issue or dry frizzy hair. Unlike other similar products, like Wen, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily. But, I do wash with a mild organic shampoo once a week.</li>
            <li> Works great! I like it better than Wen or HairOne!</li>
            <li> Love this for my hair.  I feel it works just as well as the &amp;#34;well known name brand&amp;#34;.  The company is very customer friendly and very willing to help if you have a problem with your order.  Very fast shipping also.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really like this product..other than having to use so much of it each time I need to wash my hair! I&#x27;ve been using it as shampoo, conditioner, leave in conditioner, and styling product.  The biggest improvement for me was when I straightened my hair. Before this product, in order to straighten it, I needed tons of product to keep it from frizzing out...and even then, my hair gross and fake. Now with this stuff, I only use the one product (I put a little extra on my hair for straightening it) and it comes out way better. My hair is soft, less frizzy,  moves like normal hair! I can&#x27;t stop touching it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how my hair feels and behaves using this product. I used to use the expensive infomercial brand but I like this one for me personally so much better.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and this only last me 3 weeks :( Smells great and feels good on my scalp. Doesn&#x27;t leave a residue</li>
            <li> A friend told me about Wen, so during my research I found this product.  I gave it a try and found that it left a film on my hair and it dulled the color.  As I researched more I learned that your hair (natural oils) have to adjust.  I use this product consistently, although, I use it as a \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot; and still follow up with a light conditioner.  When I rinse the conditioning cleanser out of my hair, it feels tangled and matted (but clean).  I find just a tad of conditioner from another brand smooths and gives me what I&#x27;m looking for.  I can tell you, I&#x27;ve never ever had a coloring treatment last so long!  And I contribute that to this product.  I overall feel that my hair is healthier.  I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. It is as close to the big name brand as I have found, I have used about 15 different brands. The only thing I do not like is the price, for the size of the bottle you might as well go ahead and spend the big bucks on the real thing.</li>
            <li> I had been using sulfate-free natural shampoos for a while before I heard about co-washing and cleansing conditioners (I grew up in VT where people are afraid of harmful chemicals but never had a lot of exposure to hair routines of African American women). I didn&#x27;t want to pay so much for the Wen products because it just seems like paying for their marketing/ads. I found this at Duane Reade near my work and decided to go for it, rather than paying $40 for Wen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really do have to use a lot of the product, and it doesn&#x27;t make for a quick shower, but I think it is TOTALLY WORTH IT. My hair seems to dry faster, and is definitely more manageable and less frizzy. I have very thick wavy, not curly, hair (caucasian) that has always been difficult to style without heat. Also -- I think because my scalp isn&#x27;t being stripped of oil like with shampoo, and then overcompensating by producing extra oil -- I don&#x27;t need to wash my hair as often. AND I don&#x27;t really need any styling products, except maybe a bit of styling paste for my bangs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get so many compliments on my hair it&#x27;s ridiculous. I think some of my friends think I&#x27;m crazy when I say I stopped using shampoo, but hey, if it works it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you switch to any conditioning cleanser directly from a shampoo/conditioner set with SLS and silicone, there will probably be a transition phase, but I went from sulfate-free shampoos so I didn&#x27;t experience any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I don&#x27;t see it mentioned anywhere else, but if you use this or any other cleansing conditioner, you shouldn&#x27;t use styling products that have silicone-based ingredients (anything with \\&quot;-one\\&quot; at the end of a word), because it will build up and the cleanser isn&#x27;t harsh enough to strip them out.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a discount store for $5.50 not expecting a great product.  I have been wanting to try WEN because all of my friends adore it, but because I have such thin long hair I have no luck with &#x27;2 in 1&#x27; products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so surprised by this product.  I have extremely long thin hair, but a lot of it, and I use maybe 5 pumps per section. So 15 small pumps?  Very shocked how it went such a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks and feels fantastic.  It hasn&#x27;t been this soft since I was in elementary school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell, feel, and easiness of this product is amazing.  I don&#x27;t even follow up with another conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A+++ would buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once so far, but I will use up the bottle. The scent is VERY menthol-ish. I&#x27;ve been a Wen user for several years, thought I&#x27;d try something cheaper. This seems to condition &amp; detangle well, and the smell does fade out quickly. Most of the Wen scents have a mint or menthol undertone - not this strong - so I&#x27;ve been using the Kid&#x27;s Apple, which does not. Why the adult varieties all contain menthol or mint is beyond me. I&#x27;d understand if they were being marketed as dandruff versions. I&#x27;ll write more after I&#x27;ve used it several times if I notice anything else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dude and this stuff is awesome. Leaves my hair soft and fulfilled. Thank you very much Lisa Rachel.</li>
            <li> much smaller bottles, than I imagined- 12 oz. but the product does work and is very similar to the wen products.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think it was that great.</li>
            <li> I really like this cleansing conditioner. It&#x27;s pretty thick and creamy. It smells really good and doesn&#x27;t leave a build up on my hair. I have thick, coarse, curly hair. It&#x27;s just as good as the &amp;#34;W&amp;#34; product, but at a more affordable price!</li>
            <li> Great Product! The Quick Red Fox Jumped Over The Lazy Brown Dog! Quack Quack Quack said the little yellow duck!</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading all the rave reviews, but I&#x27;m not impressed.  Maybe it&#x27;s just not formulated for baby-fine, long hair, because even following the directions to the letter, it left my hair oily, limp, and tangled.  I&#x27;ve tried other conditioning cleansers that cost a lot less and worked much better.  I won&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the name brand stuff and at a fraction of the cost. Loved it! Glad I stocked up!</li>
            <li> DID NOTHING FOR ME I have short hair and I expected it to be soft and shiny - instead it was dry and frizzy. Will not buy again.</li>
