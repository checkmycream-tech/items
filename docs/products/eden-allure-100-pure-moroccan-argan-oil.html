            <li>The makers at Eden Allure are even better!</li>
            <li>and I was in love with it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>The product is amazing.</li>
            <li>really liked the Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>I like more volume, but this kind of cancels that out.</li>
            <li>It is amazing how shiny and healthy my hair looks.</li>
            <li>Great product that actually works at a great price.</li>
            <li>a skin Moisturizer its fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love their soaps too.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the \\&quot;deodorized\\</li>
            <li>I also love that this product has no fragrance-</li>
            <li>Most of the dots on her face were gone.</li>
            <li>We love this product.</li>
            <li>My hair is so, so lustrous and healthy looking now</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it and am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>love this for my skin and hair.</li>
            <li>but it was mostly in makeup.</li>
            <li>3 days after using it, I went to my hair stylist and she asked me what I&#x27;d been using on my hair because it looked and felt SO much better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m glad I bought this product.</li>
            <li>Lots of people love it.</li>
            <li>I like it for my hair, but love it for my skin.</li>
            <li>Argan Oil is very rich in (taken from here):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it is the BEST purchase I had made in a long while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After a day of working in the garden this is a wonderful product to use on rough hands and feet.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it works effectively in cooler weather and absorbs right away onto my skin.</li>
            <li>I received this product very quickly in the mail.</li>
            <li>Everything I&#x27;ve read says that argan is a very light oil that disappears rapidly on skin because it is quickly absorbed and that it isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>My face and body broke out into a huge rash.  </li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d never have smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any of my lines diminish but softening wrinkles is just as important.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that can be used for multiple things.  </li>
            <li>Argon Oil is extremely rare and serves many purposes.</li>
            <li>Also neutralizes free radicals</li>
            <li>Leaves it nice and soft, with a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>Since the majority of reviewers found this product to be almost miraculous, I was really excited about the possibilites of this product for my hair.    </li>
            <li>It is a bit of a splurge, but totally worth it when you see how it transforms your hair!</li>
            <li>The product contains no artificial fragrance which is great for those of us who prefer to stay away from such things.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a great moisturizer for a face that can get as dry as mine</li>
            <li>Compared to other Moroccan oils, this product is very high quality, a great price, and lasts forever!!</li>
            <li>Nothing special about this oil.  </li>
            <li>I graduated from facial application and began to apply this product to my hair with good results.</li>
            <li>Thanks Eden Allure :)</li>
            <li>I purchased this product based on several good reviews (</li>
            <li>Many Thanks.</li>
            <li>The oil does penetrate quickly, but my hair didn&#x27;t feel any softer or smoother.  </li>
            <li>This is the first oil I found that works well on my dry skin and smells great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li>I purchased this product after a few recommendations and I&#x27;m so happy I did.</li>
            <li>Really makes them smooth</li>
            <li>It sinks into my skin rapidly, not leaving the oily residue I&#x27;ve experienced with many facial oils.</li>
            <li>it is practically odorless, which makes it ok to use around my chemically sensitive mother.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine this working very well on course or ethnic hair or on severely damaged hair but for this girl who has straight hair that&#x27;s naturally healthy</li>
            <li>* Phenols: antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, powerful against fungus and bacteria, activates blood circulation and activates Vitamin C</li>
            <li>NOT AT ALL WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li>I love how my skin absorbs it, and it&#x27;s not left all greasy like some other products that claim to be good oils for your skin.</li>
            <li>(I have pimples and blackheads) and I have noticed that I makes my face soft :) I haven&#x27;t really used it on my nails</li>
            <li>I strongly advise you to not waste your money on this overpriced product.  </li>
            <li>but when I mix it with my heavy facial moisurizer (yes to tomatoes)then it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>Later, I applied a small amount, and ran it thoroughly through my hair and experienced much better results.</li>
            <li>This is pure Argan Oil and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I wake up feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>My hair and my skin is really grateful for this!</li>
            <li>It leaves my face looking pretty dewey which I like.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get pretty immediate results on hair.</li>
            <li>This oil is definitely moisturizing and very rich in quality.</li>
            <li>I used biosilk in the past (which is a pretty good product)</li>
            <li>You only need a tiny amount for your hair to               get good results.</li>
            <li>I was really hesitant to try this at first because I was using Vitamin E Oil (brand called Jason)</li>
            <li>It has really soften my skin so much!</li>
            <li>As someone who suffered from acne for many years, the thought of adding even more oil to my face just sounded ridiculous.</li>
            <li>almost felt like I was washing myself with pure oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even noticed a reduction in the appearance of fine lines on my face only after a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Also, one pump is enough to lightly coat the ends of my medium length hair.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable, too.</li>
            <li>This stuff is really</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much improved.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into my skin much quicker than I anticipated.</li>
            <li>Coconut oil is so much cheaper too.</li>
            <li>you know this product really works.</li>
            <li>I asked if what they sell is really argan oil so not receiving an answer makes me wonder if they are really selling argan oil.</li>
            <li>Another thing I really like is that it has no scent and there are no lingering smells.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is so much softer and prettier now!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it on my face</li>
            <li>This works really well.  </li>
            <li>A powerful antioxidant, anti-inflammatory for sensitive skin, UV protection, and aids in cutaneous micro-circulation.</li>
            <li>After a few weeks of consistently using this product on my face, I did notice a healthy glow to my skin.    </li>
            <li>My nail beds also are fantastic and glowy when using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall not an economical hair moisturizer unless you have thin or fine hair.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long, long way and you will be very happy.</li>
            <li>Some may not like that idea, but when you have extremely dry, sensitive skin, it&#x27;s amazing when you find something that cleans you and leaves you feeling fresh instead of dry and flaky.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, and all of my friends have started using it.</li>
            <li>Alot of hype about how great, what a miracle this oil is, but have to say that it is no better than any other carrier type oil: almond, jojoba, sesame etc, so for the price I would save my money.</li>
            <li>I live a  vegan lifestyle, and what attracted me to this product was that it was not made from chemical ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Argan oil is now my new fav moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have SUPER dry skin, and this has helped with dryness A LOT.</li>
            <li>After only the first week of use</li>
            <li>If you are familiar with vitamin E oil, you&#x27;ll notice that it&#x27;s extremely oily and can be used at night.</li>
            <li>You only have to use a little bit as it blends smoothly and covers a large amount of the face...or the area you want covered.</li>
            <li>I put some argan oil in my aveeno clear complexion cream..</li>
            <li>Eden Allure uses a nearly clear bottle.</li>
            <li>but now I depend on this natural oil.</li>
            <li>(yes, I do torture my frizzy hair as I don&#x27;t always like my natural curls) to style my hair.</li>
            <li>My overprocessed, naturally curly (read: frizzy)</li>
            <li>I like that it does not have a scent and is not heavy...</li>
            <li>I purchased this oil directly from Eden Allure (didn&#x27;t know Amazon listed it</li>
            <li>Not greasy or oil and makes your skin feel soft and your hair managable.</li>
            <li>I use argan oil in the morning as a facial moisturizer and it leaves me looking very glowy and radiant.</li>
            <li>Eden Allure specializes in Argan Oil based natural skin care product.</li>
            <li>I feel like those other products make your skin more greasy than anything else, and the amount the skin absorbs is minimal compared to this one.</li>
            <li>(EXTREMLY CURLY)HAIR TYPES VERY LONG, YET SOMEWHAT HEAT DAMAGED &amp; VERY</li>
            <li>A little goes a veeerrry long way...2 drops / barely a pump and my hands - I even have strong nails.  </li>
            <li>I also replaced Eden allure with my regular face moisturizer and my skin is soft and glowy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it 2-3 times a day, and it barely looks like I&#x27;ve used any at all.</li>
            <li>I emailed Eden Allure about the above and have so far received no answer.</li>
            <li>and it really left my hair soft but too oily.</li>
            <li>I can definitely tell how much softer it leaves my hair (my hair is very thin), but I&#x27;m not too sure about how shiny it leaves the hair.</li>
            <li>At first when I read the previous reviews I thought it might work for some skin types.</li>
            <li>Initially, I thought it resembled any other hair serum and would probably only reduce frizziness-I&#x27;m happy to say I was wrong.</li>
            <li>Finally, even when I do have a small breakout it heals quickly.  </li>
            <li>The other thing I have noted is that every other seller uses a dark container because argan is light sensitive and will degrade.</li>
            <li>After it got delivered we are surprised it so small bottle &amp; thought I spent more for less.</li>
            <li>I have rough feet that can sharpen knives and ever since I&#x27;ve been using Eden allure on them after showering, they are soo soft!</li>
            <li>My fine thin hair even shines now.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is tiny 2 oz bottle, I have thick, coarse, African American hair, so I would demolish the bottle as quickly as I got it</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have anything good or bad to say.</li>

            <li> I love how my skin absorbs it, and it&#x27;s not left all greasy like some other products that claim to be good oils for your skin.</li>
            <li> (I have pimples and blackheads) and I have noticed that I makes my face soft :) I haven&#x27;t really used it on my nails</li>
            <li> I strongly advise you to not waste your money on this overpriced product.  </li>
            <li> but when I mix it with my heavy facial moisurizer (yes to tomatoes)then it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Later, I applied a small amount, and ran it thoroughly through my hair and experienced much better results.</li>
            <li> This is pure Argan Oil and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I wake up feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> My hair and my skin is really grateful for this!</li>
            <li> It leaves my face looking pretty dewey which I like.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get pretty immediate results on hair.</li>
            <li> This oil is definitely moisturizing and very rich in quality.</li>
            <li> I used biosilk in the past (which is a pretty good product)</li>
            <li> You only need a tiny amount for your hair to               get good results.</li>
            <li> I was really hesitant to try this at first because I was using Vitamin E Oil (brand called Jason)</li>
            <li> It has really soften my skin so much!</li>
            <li> As someone who suffered from acne for many years, the thought of adding even more oil to my face just sounded ridiculous.</li>
            <li> almost felt like I was washing myself with pure oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even noticed a reduction in the appearance of fine lines on my face only after a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Also, one pump is enough to lightly coat the ends of my medium length hair.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable, too.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much improved.</li>
            <li> It absorbs into my skin much quicker than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> Coconut oil is so much cheaper too.</li>
            <li> you know this product really works.</li>
            <li> I asked if what they sell is really argan oil so not receiving an answer makes me wonder if they are really selling argan oil.</li>
            <li> Another thing I really like is that it has no scent and there are no lingering smells.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is so much softer and prettier now!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it on my face</li>
            <li> This works really well.  </li>
            <li> A powerful antioxidant, anti-inflammatory for sensitive skin, UV protection, and aids in cutaneous micro-circulation.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of consistently using this product on my face, I did notice a healthy glow to my skin.    </li>
            <li> My nail beds also are fantastic and glowy when using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall not an economical hair moisturizer unless you have thin or fine hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long, long way and you will be very happy.</li>
            <li> Some may not like that idea, but when you have extremely dry, sensitive skin, it&#x27;s amazing when you find something that cleans you and leaves you feeling fresh instead of dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, and all of my friends have started using it.</li>
            <li> Alot of hype about how great, what a miracle this oil is, but have to say that it is no better than any other carrier type oil: almond, jojoba, sesame etc, so for the price I would save my money.</li>
            <li> I live a  vegan lifestyle, and what attracted me to this product was that it was not made from chemical ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Argan oil is now my new fav moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have SUPER dry skin, and this has helped with dryness A LOT.</li>
            <li> After only the first week of use</li>
            <li> If you are familiar with vitamin E oil, you&#x27;ll notice that it&#x27;s extremely oily and can be used at night.</li>
            <li> You only have to use a little bit as it blends smoothly and covers a large amount of the face...or the area you want covered.</li>
            <li> I put some argan oil in my aveeno clear complexion cream..</li>
            <li> Eden Allure uses a nearly clear bottle.</li>
            <li> but now I depend on this natural oil.</li>
            <li> (yes, I do torture my frizzy hair as I don&#x27;t always like my natural curls) to style my hair.</li>
            <li> My overprocessed, naturally curly (read: frizzy)</li>
            <li> I like that it does not have a scent and is not heavy...</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil directly from Eden Allure (didn&#x27;t know Amazon listed it</li>
            <li> Not greasy or oil and makes your skin feel soft and your hair managable.</li>
            <li> I use argan oil in the morning as a facial moisturizer and it leaves me looking very glowy and radiant.</li>
            <li> Eden Allure specializes in Argan Oil based natural skin care product.</li>
            <li> I feel like those other products make your skin more greasy than anything else, and the amount the skin absorbs is minimal compared to this one.</li>
            <li> (EXTREMLY CURLY)HAIR TYPES VERY LONG, YET SOMEWHAT HEAT DAMAGED &amp; VERY</li>
            <li> A little goes a veeerrry long way...2 drops / barely a pump and my hands - I even have strong nails.  </li>
            <li> I also replaced Eden allure with my regular face moisturizer and my skin is soft and glowy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it 2-3 times a day, and it barely looks like I&#x27;ve used any at all.</li>
            <li> I emailed Eden Allure about the above and have so far received no answer.</li>
            <li> and it really left my hair soft but too oily.</li>
            <li> I can definitely tell how much softer it leaves my hair (my hair is very thin), but I&#x27;m not too sure about how shiny it leaves the hair.</li>
            <li> At first when I read the previous reviews I thought it might work for some skin types.</li>
            <li> Initially, I thought it resembled any other hair serum and would probably only reduce frizziness-I&#x27;m happy to say I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Finally, even when I do have a small breakout it heals quickly.  </li>
            <li> The other thing I have noted is that every other seller uses a dark container because argan is light sensitive and will degrade.</li>
            <li> After it got delivered we are surprised it so small bottle &amp; thought I spent more for less.</li>
            <li> I have rough feet that can sharpen knives and ever since I&#x27;ve been using Eden allure on them after showering, they are soo soft!</li>
            <li> My fine thin hair even shines now.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is tiny 2 oz bottle, I have thick, coarse, African American hair, so I would demolish the bottle as quickly as I got it</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have anything good or bad to say.</li>
            <li> I noticed how extremely sleek and soft my hair not only looked,but felt!</li>
            <li> I have long fine thin hair</li>
            <li> I had the occasional breakout before, but now due to this product I still have tiny bumps all over my face, lots of whiteheads and an overall red tone that is not going away.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice any difference with wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Purchased this produckt after seeing a few people talk about on you tube and qvc and WOW!</li>
            <li> A dab of this oil really makes my hair shiny, less frizzy without feeling oily and messy.</li>
            <li> My hair is extra thin, and at first I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of it for my hair, for it weighed it down.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about using a oil on my face, but I am glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a product that can help my unmanageable, curly, frizzy and dry hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s as dry after washing as it was before I used the oil.   </li>
            <li> It helped me a lot with dry skin issues.</li>
            <li> I have dry, wavy hair</li>
            <li> I have dry patches of skin that this product softens.</li>
            <li> Eden Allure gives you 2.2 ounces for $30 dollars and it works just as well as the more expensive brand I purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> I honestly expected this Argan Oil to work miracles on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for three months now, and have only used half the bottle.   </li>
            <li> With my naturally oily skin and late life breakouts</li>
            <li> Obviously, their skin is different from mine because, if I try to use it alone, I have to use at least 1.5 squirts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was disppointed, because I saw absolutely no result.</li>
            <li> It was not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> but I killed it when I went blond and back to brunette</li>
            <li> It was thicker on the skin than I expected.   </li>
            <li> I used about less than a 1/4 of the contents so far, because one small pump does wonders.</li>
            <li> It seems to have no positive effect on my hair.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My Overall reasoning for purchasing Eden Allure was for my hair. The bottle is tiny 2 oz bottle, I have thick, coarse, African American hair, so I would demolish the bottle as quickly as I got it If I use on my hair as a regular moisturizer. Its a good moisturizer but there are other hair moisturizers that work as well and half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a skin Moisturizer its fantastic! I have rough feet that can sharpen knives and ever since I&#x27;ve been using Eden allure on them after showering, they are soo soft! I also replaced Eden allure with my regular face moisturizer and my skin is soft and glowy. My nail beds also are fantastic and glowy when using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall not an economical hair moisturizer unless you have thin or fine hair. Awesome for skin tho!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. The oil itself is thick enough so it doesn&#x27;t drip during application. The product contains no artificial fragrance which is great for those of us who prefer to stay away from such things. I began by using the oil on my face at bedtime and within just a week I have seen improvements. I have problem skin and this product has smoothed out my face and lessened my breakouts. I graduated from facial application and began to apply this product to my hair with good results. My hair is smoother and shinier. Also, a little bit goes a long way. One pump is all it takes to cover my face at bedtime. Also, one pump is enough to lightly coat the ends of my medium length hair. The price is reasonable, too. Before discovering Eden Allure, I paid almost $40 for half an ounce of argan oil from another brand. Eden Allure gives you 2.2 ounces for $30 dollars and it works just as well as the more expensive brand I purchased in the past. Great product that actually works at a great price.</li>
            <li> My skin was moisturized for an entire day and I use it on my hair too- makes it shine! I love their soaps too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve friends from Morocco who have raved about Argan oil.  With my naturally oily skin and late life breakouts I thought I&#x27;d never have smooth skin.  Finally, even when I do have a small breakout it heals quickly.  My fine thin hair even shines now.  No more Turkey Neck for me either.   A little goes a veeerrry long way...2 drops / barely a pump and my hands - I even have strong nails.  I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li> ...but you will NOT regret it. As someone who suffered from acne for many years, the thought of adding even more oil to my face just sounded ridiculous. I had seen this product reviewed on YouTube, and since I had a gift certificate to Amazon, figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try it. I am so happy I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product in combination with African Black Soap, and since that time, not only has my acne decreased, but my acne scars as well. My under eye area looks brighter, and the overall feeling of my skin is nicer. I mix it in with my night and day lotions, and that does the trick. I also rub it on my cuticles and my split ends. This stuff is really amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it&#x27;s $30, the bottle will last forever. I&#x27;ve been using it 2-3 times a day, and it barely looks like I&#x27;ve used any at all.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and i have noticed that my hair looks healthier and softer than why it used to be like. I put some argan oil in my aveeno clear complexion cream..(I have pimples and blackheads) and I have noticed that I makes my face soft :) I haven&#x27;t really used it on my nails but I did once nd it made them hard..which for me is good because my nails bend and they chip off. I will continue using this and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I honestly expected this Argan Oil to work miracles on my dry skin. This oil is definitely moisturizing and very rich in quality. After a few weeks of consistently using this product on my face, I did notice a healthy glow to my skin.    Thanks Eden Allure :)</li>
            <li> I strongly advise you to not waste your money on this overpriced product.  I live a  vegan lifestyle, and what attracted me to this product was that it was not made from chemical ingredients.  I began applying this product to my hair, body, and face just like it says you can.  My hair felt like greasy straw-I didn&#x27;t even think that those to feeling could happen at the same time.  My face and body broke out into a huge rash.  I only used this product for three days then immediately discontinued use once I saw the reaction.  It has been over a month now and my face is still in terrible shape.  I had the occasional breakout before, but now due to this product I still have tiny bumps all over my face, lots of whiteheads and an overall red tone that is not going away. It looks like I am a severe acne survivor.  As for my body rash it is almost gone.  I would NEVER recommend this product to anyone, not even my worst enemy. I am truly disappointed, and caution you to use another product.</li>
            <li> I can definitely tell how much softer it leaves my hair (my hair is very thin), but I&#x27;m not too sure about how shiny it leaves the hair. The down side, is that bc my hair is SO THIN, it leaves it with no volume at all (BUT REMEMBER that this product doesn&#x27;t claim to add volume to hair, so that&#x27;s not the product&#x27;s fault). But that&#x27;s bc (again) my hair is VERY thin. I like more volume, but this kind of cancels that out. I must add that I am not using a shampoo/conditioner for volume, so that could have a lot to do with it also. HOWEVER, I DEFINITELY recommend it for the skin. It&#x27;s absolutely great for it. I have SUPER dry skin, and this has helped with dryness A LOT. I love how my skin absorbs it, and it&#x27;s not left all greasy like some other products that claim to be good oils for your skin. I feel like those other products make your skin more greasy than anything else, and the amount the skin absorbs is minimal compared to this one. I LOVE IT FOR MY SKIN! I will definitely purchase it again!</li>
            <li> Since the majority of reviewers found this product to be almost miraculous, I was really excited about the possibilites of this product for my hair.    I am an African American women with shoulder-length, relaxed hair. I was disppointed, because I saw absolutely no result. The oil does penetrate quickly, but my hair didn&#x27;t feel any softer or smoother.  I will stick with jojoba, coconut, or grapeseed oil.        I wasted my money on this one.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a product that can help my unmanageable, curly, frizzy and dry hair. I purchased this product based on several good reviews (someone reviewing keratin and biosilk recommended this oil as well). A dab of this oil really makes my hair shiny, less frizzy without feeling oily and messy. I used biosilk in the past (which is a pretty good product) but now I depend on this natural oil. After each wash I message a dab of oil into my hair and scalp and use the hair dryer, ceramic straightening iron or curling iron (yes, I do torture my frizzy hair as I don&#x27;t always like my natural curls) to style my hair. It is amazing how shiny and healthy my hair looks. I also noticed that the oil softens the skin (on the forehead or face). Sometimes I apply the oil under my eyes or on my forehead at night and in the morning I wake up feeling smooth and soft. I didn&#x27;t see any of my lines diminish but softening wrinkles is just as important.</li>
            <li> The product is amazing. The best way to mosturize the skin. The makers at Eden Allure are even better! Compared to other Moroccan oils, this product is very high quality, a great price, and lasts forever!! Moreover, the customer service at Eden Allure is the best- you can&#x27;t beat it. Seriously, buy this now.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  My overprocessed, naturally curly (read: frizzy) hair has never looked healthier, and there is no greasiness or phoney over-shininess as with silicone serums or some other oils.  I don&#x27;t love the \\&quot;deodorized\\&quot; smell but I added a drop of lavender essential oil and it&#x27;s much improved.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this argan oil, I thoroughly did my research on the product, however, I was very disappointed in the product. I have long fine thin hair and it did nothing to soften or coat my hair. I used it on my forehead creases for 2 weeks before discontinuing due to lack of results.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this oil.  I like that it does not have a scent and is not heavy...aside from that, I&#x27;ve not noticed any miraculous changes anywhere that I&#x27;ve used it and I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now.</li>
            <li> I have achieved healthy-looking non-frizzy hair by rubbing this oil over my hands and cuticles, and then running my hands through my hair. A little of this stuff goes a long way. I also love that this product has no fragrance- it is practically odorless, which makes it ok to use around my chemically sensitive mother. Its a great product. Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Alot of hype about how great, what a miracle this oil is, but have to say that it is no better than any other carrier type oil: almond, jojoba, sesame etc, so for the price I would save my money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizers, but this has to be the best one to date. It absorbs into my skin much quicker than I anticipated. I&#x27;ve been using it for three months now, and have only used half the bottle.   I was a little skeptical about using a oil on my face, but I am glad I tried it. I like it for my hair as well, but have experienced much better results with my skin. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Great Product. At first when I read the previous reviews I thought it might work for some skin types. Just give a try. After it got delivered we are surprised it so small bottle &amp; thought I spent more for less. But I take back my words. My wife started using and applied this oil on her face, with in 2 days we observed great change in her face. Most of the dots on her face were gone. We love this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading about moroccan oil and the added silicones.  This oil is no better than the coconut oil I use weekly to moisturize my hair.  Totally overblown performance.  Coconut oil is so much cheaper too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after a few recommendations and I&#x27;m so happy I did. It is a bit of a splurge, but totally worth it when you see how it transforms your hair! I began using the \\&quot;Eden Allure Morroccan Argan Oil\\&quot; the day after I arrived in the mail. Initially, I thought it resembled any other hair serum and would probably only reduce frizziness-I&#x27;m happy to say I was wrong. After only the first week of use I noticed how extremely sleek and soft my hair not only looked,but felt! By the second week, I was amazed at my hair&#x27;s transformation. My hair is so, so lustrous and healthy looking now(: Coming from someone who has thick, porous hair &amp; continuously colors, flat-irons, etc you know this product really works. I used about less than a 1/4 of the contents so far, because one small pump does wonders. However, as soon as my bottle is finished I&#x27;ll definitely be repurchasing. I even recommend \\&quot;Eden Allure Morroccan Argan Oil\\&quot; to my friends and sisters because it&#x27;s that great l0l</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil directly from Eden Allure (didn&#x27;t know Amazon listed it or I could have saved on postage) and I&#x27;m disappointed. Everything I&#x27;ve read says that argan is a very light oil that disappears rapidly on skin because it is quickly absorbed and that it isn&#x27;t greasy. The oil I&#x27;ve received is decidedly greasy. I ordered 2 bottles, one for another person. She also complains about how greasy it is. Even a drop on my hair (well distributed) makes my hair greasy. It seems to have no positive effect on my hair. If I use it and then wash my hair it&#x27;s as dry after washing as it was before I used the oil.   I emailed Eden Allure about the above and have so far received no answer. I asked if what they sell is really argan oil so not receiving an answer makes me wonder if they are really selling argan oil. The other thing I have noted is that every other seller uses a dark container because argan is light sensitive and will degrade. Eden Allure uses a nearly clear bottle. Because argan is so expensive there are a lot of fakes being sold.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that can be used for multiple things.  Fizz for hair, moisturizing for hands and body.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is a great skin moisturizer.  It helped me a lot with dry skin issues.</li>
            <li> I received this product very quickly in the mail. I&#x27;ve used it and am pleased with it. You only have to use a little bit as it blends smoothly and covers a large amount of the face...or the area you want covered.</li>
            <li> It was not what I expected.  I have dry, wavy hair and it really left my hair soft but too oily.</li>
            <li> Purchased this produckt after seeing a few people talk about on you tube and qvc and WOW! It&#x27;s incredible! love this for my skin and hair. Not greasy or oil and makes your skin feel soft and your hair managable. You don&#x27;t have to use alot a little go a long way! Great product.</li>
            <li> This is the first oil I found that works well on my dry skin and smells great.  I have dry patches of skin that this product softens. I just wish it came in a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> I was really hesitant to try this at first because I was using Vitamin E Oil (brand called Jason) and I was in love with it! But I found it to be extremely greasy and decided to venture into argan oil. I&#x27;ve only seen argan oil advertised at Sephora but it was mostly in makeup. I wanted something nourishing for my face, my hair and my skin. This was what i settled on getting and it is the BEST purchase I had made in a long while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is non greasy. If you are familiar with vitamin E oil, you&#x27;ll notice that it&#x27;s extremely oily and can be used at night. I use argan oil in the morning as a facial moisturizer and it leaves me looking very glowy and radiant. At night, this argan oil acts like a base before I apply my night cream. It has really soften my skin so much! My hair and my skin is really grateful for this! Another thing I really like is that it has no scent and there are no lingering smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it works effectively in cooler weather and absorbs right away onto my skin. I will definitely repurchase when I am close to being done.</li>
            <li> This stuff has been great for my hair. 3 days after using it, I went to my hair stylist and she asked me what I&#x27;d been using on my hair because it looked and felt SO much better. It is so much softer and prettier now!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it on my face and I don&#x27;t have anything good or bad to say. I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice any difference with wrinkles. It leaves my face looking pretty dewey which I like. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a great moisturizer for a face that can get as dry as mine but when I mix it with my heavy facial moisurizer (yes to tomatoes)then it&#x27;s perfect. Some people only use 1/2 a squirt for their face. Obviously, their skin is different from mine because, if I try to use it alone, I have to use at least 1.5 squirts.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m glad I bought this product. You&#x27;ll get pretty immediate results on hair. I can&#x27;t imagine this working very well on course or ethnic hair or on severely damaged hair but for this girl who has straight hair that&#x27;s naturally healthy but I killed it when I went blond and back to brunette, it helps the areas that are still damaged from that.</li>
            <li> This is pure Argan Oil and well worth the price. A little goes a long, long way and you will be very happy. Many Thanks. Nancy B.</li>
            <li> Prompt arrival and correct billing.  Product feels good and has no odor.  Results pending further use.</li>
            <li> I found this product very expensive as a gamble. It was thicker on the skin than I expected.   Lots of people love it. But not me.  I&#x27;d rather have my $50 back and stick to coconut oil on my face or grapeseed oil.  It did nothing for my hair either. (which is why I got it)</li>
            <li> After a day of working in the garden this is a wonderful product to use on rough hands and feet.  Really makes them smooth (has a great smell too!)</li>
            <li> This works really well.  It made my skin smooth and is wonderful for my hair.  I highly recommend it, and all of my friends have started using it.</li>
            <li> Eden Allure specializes in Argan Oil based natural skin care product. Argon Oil is extremely rare and serves many purposes. It has the power to minimize wrinkles and give life back to damaged hair and nails. Some have dubbed Argan Oil as \\&quot;liquid gold\\&quot;. It can only be found in southwestern Morocco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moroccan Argan Oil is very rich in (taken from here):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Vitamin F (omega 6): anti-aging and anti-dryness of skin&lt;br /&gt;* Vitamin E: A powerful antioxidant, anti-inflammatory for sensitive skin, UV protection, and aids in cutaneous micro-circulation. Also neutralizes free radicals&lt;br /&gt;* Phenols: antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, powerful against fungus and bacteria, activates blood circulation and activates Vitamin C&lt;br /&gt;* Triterpens: restructure cells, is anti-inflammatory and slows down cell aging&lt;br /&gt;* Squalene: suggested to prevent against skin cancer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the Argan Oil. I noticed a difference in my skin, hair and nails almost immediately. It is the perfect moisturizer and it&#x27;s great at smoothing things out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another wonderful product from Eden Allure is the Beauty Bar which is available in Grapefruit or Lavender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost felt like I was washing myself with pure oil. Some may not like that idea, but when you have extremely dry, sensitive skin, it&#x27;s amazing when you find something that cleans you and leaves you feeling fresh instead of dry and flaky. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS IN A WORD \\&quot;CRAP\\&quot; DEFINITELY NOT FOR MILANO (CAUCASIAN MOTHER, AFRICAN AMERICAN &amp; CHEROKEE FATHER) (EXTREMLY CURLY)HAIR TYPES VERY LONG, YET SOMEWHAT HEAT DAMAGED &amp; VERY DRY.HOWEVER IT STATES THAT IT IS FOR ALL HAIR TYPES RIGGGGGGHHHHHT... NOT AT ALL WORTH THE MONEY. THE REVIEWS HAD ME FOOLED.PLEASE DON&#x27;T BE A VICTIM!!!!</li>
            <li> Argan oil is now my new fav moisturizer. It sinks into my skin rapidly, not leaving the oily residue I&#x27;ve experienced with many facial oils. Leaves it nice and soft, with a healthy glow. I&#x27;ve even noticed a reduction in the appearance of fine lines on my face only after a couple of weeks. My hair is extra thin, and at first I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of it for my hair, for it weighed it down. Later, I applied a small amount, and ran it thoroughly through my hair and experienced much better results. You only need a tiny amount for your hair to               get good results. I like it for my hair, but love it for my skin.</li>
