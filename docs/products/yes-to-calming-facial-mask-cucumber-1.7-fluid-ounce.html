            <li>It&#x27;s also great that you only have to leave it on five minutes for it to work.  </li>
            <li>I got a free sample of this, and just tried it today.  </li>
            <li>I did a Google search for best facial masks for sensitive skin, and</li>
            <li>And my skin felt so clean</li>
            <li>It gets bright red and blotchy if I use even the most gentle of cleansing and skin care products.  </li>
            <li>When i washed it off, where the face mask was bright red.</li>
            <li>It also makes my skin feel fresh and smooth</li>
            <li>I found this at Marshall&#x27;s, so I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend too much on this.</li>
            <li>It goes on soothingly, that is true.</li>
            <li>i washed it off and my face was bright lobster red and hot for quite some time.  </li>
            <li>It arrive in right time.</li>
            <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty irritated right now.</li>
            <li>It removes dead skin, feels good and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>She told me to use nothing but mild cleanser, pure aloe and gentle moisturizer on my face for a full week.  </li>
            <li>Okay so all of these other reviews are so true!</li>
            <li>Yeah, that&#x27;s exactly how I look right now.</li>
            <li>given that this item had so many bad ones I had to share my experience because I am very happy with this mask!</li>
            <li>I had been out in the sun all day and my face felt very soothed after i tried it!</li>
            <li>I would most likely buy again</li>
            <li>Making an appointment with my dermatologist to make sure this red and sensitivity will go away.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to replace a mask I used before with a natural one without SLS, parabens, etc.</li>
            <li>After using this product as directed, my face was bright red only on the area it was used, it also caused swelling in my face.</li>
            <li>Now 15 minutes later its still bright red and</li>
            <li>For the price (really cheap), this is a great product, but a thick lotion would do the same thing.  </li>
            <li>I have to be honest, after reading all of the other reviews I was absolutely terrified to try this mask.</li>
            <li>Of course everyone is different, but this product is supposed to be natural and good for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>skin felt refreshed afterwards, and very soft.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>My whole face feels like it&#x27;s burning.</li>
            <li>Ugh, I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li>Girfriend says it is quite soothing, and she really like it.  </li>
            <li>I love the wipes but the face mask is definitely not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>honestly im surprised this mask didnt get recalled!!!</li>
            <li>I wash it off--very red skin for 30 seconds then it calmed quickly.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, it gave me a red blotchy face!!!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly warn against using this product.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but</li>
            <li>Normally I research products thoroughly before I use them, but not this time (it figures).  </li>
            <li>It left a distinct red line around my face like you could see EXACTLY where i had put the mask on.</li>
            <li>She asked me if I was using any new products</li>
            <li>After less than 5 minutes on my face this product left me with a bright red chemical burn.</li>
            <li>Ironically, it is the first \\&quot;drugstore\\&quot; beauty product I have purchased in years (bought it on a whim) as I normally buy all of my face products through my local dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>Even softly touching my face with my hand hurts, and it feels so gross and rough.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin that is very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It does make my skin feel very soft once the reaction subsides.</li>
            <li>I used it last night for the first time and it did not burn my skin at all.</li>
            <li>That may be why many other reviewers had red skin afterwards.</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous facial masks, and was excited about this product line.  </li>
            <li>leaves my face feeling refreshed, i actually like this product more than all the other i have used.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the exact opposite of calming!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple to apply, it&#x27;s quick drying, and you only need to wear it for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seems like many or most have a bad allergic reaction to this stuff.  </li>
            <li>and it is all clear now.</li>
            <li>If you need a mask that calms your skin while helping you clear acne, this is it.</li>
            <li>the package said 5 minutes, it was probably on for 7, but hey my skin was really soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and this is marketed specifically to people with sensitive skin, so</li>
            <li>Please do not waste your time and money.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Even though I would NOT characterize my skin as sensitive ...</li>
            <li>and it made my face red, and i dont even have sensitive skin!!</li>
            <li>I followed her directions and my skin cleared up and went back to normal.  </li>
            <li>Only the areas where I had not applied the mask, around my eyes and mouth, looked normal.  </li>
            <li>I put this on one cheek, and before I&#x27;d finished putting it on my other cheek, the first one was burning.  </li>
            <li>There is a clear edge to the rash, it looks like someone used red watercolor paints on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>I bought this face wash at Target and used it for two or three days before noticing today that my skin is feeling bumpy and extra sensitive.</li>
            <li>I tried calling the number on the back of the bottle where I was stuck on hold for nearly 20 mins before I eventually just gave up and ended the call.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been reading reviews and am quite surprised to see that a lot of people are having similar issues.</li>
            <li>its not normal to have this many bad reactions to so many people and the same reaction at that!</li>
            <li>All the while you may wonder if maybe it&#x27;s irritating your skin, then you wash it off and its fine.</li>
            <li>I tried it once and my face was a little red, which didn&#x27;t alarm me too much.</li>

            <li> I tried it once and my face was a little red, which didn&#x27;t alarm me too much.</li>
            <li> One star is too many for the yes products with deceptive marketing strategies, loaded with waste of hard earned money, and us looking in the mirror for results that are not there!</li>
            <li> It should have been recalled long ago, possibly before EVER being put in the market...</li>
            <li> I immediately took a Benedryl and applied pure organic aloe to my face and after about half an hour, my face started to slowly return to normal.  </li>
            <li> She said that when I found the \\&quot;offending product,\\&quot; I would know right away because I would likely have a worse reaction the next time.  </li>
            <li> It makes my face red, dry, and blotchy.</li>
            <li> I was kind of relieved to see that others were having bad reactions to this mask.</li>
            <li> I instantly got a wet washcloth and removed the mask, but it the MAYBE one minute that it was on my face, the damage has been done.</li>
            <li> It was a strange experience, I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> I came to Amazon to see if my reaction was normal, so sad to find out just how normal it is.</li>
            <li> I then use it as a facial, slight burning but some facials do that.</li>
            <li> She then advised me to add my normal face products back in slowly, one at a time, waiting at least 5 days between each product before adding another one back in.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised by the negative reviews</li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t have any regrets.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine how bad this has gone for others who left it on for the full 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> if this is supposed to be all natural something is seriously messed up in it.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little bit does not go a long way.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product at Walgreens the other day.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I read the reviews of this mask AFTER using it for the first time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to any other face mask I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with any other face wash before this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed fewer black heads and pimples since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> Seriously the only product I&#x27;ve ever been allergic to.</li>
            <li> I narrowed it down to this mask and will never use the Yes to products again, although I have used other lines without a problem in the past.  </li>
            <li> A few days after I started using the Yes to Cucumbers</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Threw this out right after i used it, burned badly even after i washed it off</li>
            <li> Little pricey for the small container.</li>
            <li> After leaving it on for 5 minutes and rinsing it off, I was shocked to see my entire face was once again severely red and blotchy.  </li>
            <li> But I was alarmed by what I read, and ran to wash the stuff off after about 7 minutes (at which time it was starting to feel dry, no burning or unpleasant sensation).  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be discouraged by the small jar.</li>
            <li> In addition, products with bentonite should be used no more than once a week.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what is in this, but I would not recommend it to anyone.  </li>
            <li> I guess I learned my lesson the hard way.</li>
            <li> and my skin was not irritated in the least.  </li>
            <li> After applying this stuff, I came here to Amazon to check out the reviews, and saw all the negative comments.&lt;br</li>
            <li> omg seriously.</li>
            <li> not burning or painful, just crazy hot.  </li>
            <li> I have never had a reaction to anything in my life, and was shocked to wake up to a red and swollen face.  </li>
            <li> An ice cold towel seemed to help it a little bit, but we will see what it looks like in a couple hours.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a mask that cleansed and refreshed my skin while not leaving a greasy film behind.</li>
            <li> and I am not happy at all about that.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this mask one bit.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I will NEVER use this product again.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s something about the Cucumber line that causes the uncomfortable reaction.</li>
            <li> WRONG.</li>
            <li> I figured for just a few dollars the worst case scenario would be</li>
            <li> Very disappointed to say the least.</li>
            <li> Just hoping it will not be this bad tomorrow morning.</li>
            <li> and she was shocked by the change in my skin.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This was a horrible experience and I am shocked this made it to store shelves.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m so very disappointed in this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> One star is too many for the yes products with deceptive marketing strategies, loaded with waste of hard earned money, and us looking in the mirror for results that are not there!</li>
            <li> I have to be honest, after reading all of the other reviews I was absolutely terrified to try this mask. I figured for just a few dollars the worst case scenario would be I just throw it out if I don&#x27;t like it and I wouldn&#x27;t have any regrets. I used it last night for the first time and it did not burn my skin at all. In fact, I even accidentally left it on for almost 10 minutes instead of only 5 minutes and it still did not burn me!! My skin was left nice and smooth!! I literally just ordered another jar for my next month subscribe and save delivery haha. At $2.67 and no burns I am one happy cucumber (no pun intended). I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but given that this item had so many bad ones I had to share my experience because I am very happy with this mask!</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with every \\&quot;Say Yes\\&quot; product that I have purchased. This face mask has been a great addition to my night time regime. What I love about this mask is how quick and easy it is. It&#x27;s simple to apply, it&#x27;s quick drying, and you only need to wear it for 5 minutes. Don&#x27;t be discouraged by the small jar. A little goes a long way.  I&#x27;ve also noticed fewer black heads and pimples since I&#x27;ve been using it. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product that does the job. I was looking for a mask that cleansed and refreshed my skin while not leaving a greasy film behind. I recommend using it once a week with weekly face care regiments.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that is very sensitive.  It gets bright red and blotchy if I use even the most gentle of cleansing and skin care products.  I was using Paula&#x27;s Choice Skin Balancing Facial Mask, which is clay and charcoal, but it got to the point that it burned the second it touched my skin.  I did a Google search for best facial masks for sensitive skin, and Yes to Cucumbers was mentioned in an article as very good.  None of the stores in my town sell it, so I had to order it online.  The mask is more like a cream and goes on with no burning and stinging.  It&#x27;s also great that you only have to leave it on five minutes for it to work.  I removed it with a wash cloth and barely warm water and my skin was not irritated in the least.  And my skin felt so clean, I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  I highly recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It clears up any breakout I have. I feel a pimple coming on, I use the mask and in two days its gone. It also makes my skin feel fresh and smooth</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve never had an allergic reaction to a skin product before, but my face was on fire.  not burning or painful, just crazy hot.  i washed it off and my face was bright lobster red and hot for quite some time.  the package said 5 minutes, it was probably on for 7, but hey my skin was really soft.</li>
            <li> A few days after I started using the Yes to Cucumbers Calming Facial Mask, I woke up with a severe blotchy rash on my face.  I went to my aesthetician that morning and she was shocked by the change in my skin.  She asked me if I was using any new products and I told her about this mask.  She told me to use nothing but mild cleanser, pure aloe and gentle moisturizer on my face for a full week.  I followed her directions and my skin cleared up and went back to normal.  She then advised me to add my normal face products back in slowly, one at a time, waiting at least 5 days between each product before adding another one back in.  She said that when I found the \\&quot;offending product,\\&quot; I would know right away because I would likely have a worse reaction the next time.  I did as she suggested, and after I had added all of my former products back in with no further reactions, I once again tried the Yes to Cucumber Calming Facial Mask.  After leaving it on for 5 minutes and rinsing it off, I was shocked to see my entire face was once again severely red and blotchy.  Only the areas where I had not applied the mask, around my eyes and mouth, looked normal.  Well, I found the offending product alright!  I immediately took a Benedryl and applied pure organic aloe to my face and after about half an hour, my face started to slowly return to normal.  Needless to say, I will NEVER use this product again.  Ironically, it is the first \\&quot;drugstore\\&quot; beauty product I have purchased in years (bought it on a whim) as I normally buy all of my face products through my local dermatologist.  I guess I learned my lesson the hard way.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dry my skin out at all and smells awesome. I was scared my face would be blotchy like some of the reviews here mentioned but no problems. I had been out in the sun all day and my face felt very soothed after i tried it! I thought it did a good job as a mask. I would most likely buy again</li>
            <li> After I used it, my face was red and burning, i woke up in the morning and it is all clear now. I don&#x27;t notice any difference in my face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they changed the ingredients in this, but it worked awesomely for me. It contains bentonite, which is a clay that tightens your skin (and absorbs oils), moving your skin around and bringing more blood towards the surface. That may be why many other reviewers had red skin afterwards. In addition, products with bentonite should be used no more than once a week. Any more can stress your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t explain the burning though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin felt refreshed afterwards, and very soft.&lt;br /&gt;Also, Yes To doesn&#x27;t test on animals, which is always nice.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this ZERO stars. I put this on one cheek, and before I&#x27;d finished putting it on my other cheek, the first one was burning.  I instantly got a wet washcloth and removed the mask, but it the MAYBE one minute that it was on my face, the damage has been done. There is a clear edge to the rash, it looks like someone used red watercolor paints on my cheeks. I came to Amazon to see if my reaction was normal, so sad to find out just how normal it is. How is this product even on the market? I have sensitive skin, and this is marketed specifically to people with sensitive skin, so I can&#x27;t imagine how bad this has gone for others who left it on for the full 5 minutes. My whole face feels like it&#x27;s burning. I have a job interview tomorrow, I&#x27;m so very disappointed in this product. It should have been recalled long ago, possibly before EVER being put in the market...</li>
            <li> Okay so all of these other reviews are so true! I didnt purchase this product from amazon, but I did get it from target. Going away on a big trip tomorrow and i figured a face mask would be perfect. This face mask starts to burn ten seconds after you put it on your face. My skin isn&#x27;t that sensative and as soon as i washed it off my face looked and felt like I had sunburn. I was worried about the reaction I had so I ran to the internet to see if anyone else had a similar experience and found all of these reviews. An ice cold towel seemed to help it a little bit, but we will see what it looks like in a couple hours. Mind you, I dont have sensative skin and it still did it to my face.</li>
            <li> My teen daughter will use nothing else.  I found this at a great deal on Amazon and bought 4.  If you need a mask that calms your skin while helping you clear acne, this is it.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Restores an even tone and tightens in 5 minutes!  I&#x27;m really surprised by the negative reviews so felt I needed to show some love to my go to.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews of skin reactions, I tested the product on my inner arm. No problem. I then use it as a facial, slight burning but some facials do that. I wash it off--very red skin for 30 seconds then it calmed quickly. The post-facial dewy-ness lasted 5 minutes, then was replaced by dryness. It was a strange experience, I won&#x27;t be buying again. I&#x27;ll stick to coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Threw this out right after i used it, burned badly even after i washed it off and it made my face red, and i dont even have sensitive skin!!</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous facial masks, and was excited about this product line.  Within minutes of putting it on, my ace was blood red and burning.  I had to repeatedly wash my face and layer Noxema on for the chemical burn.  I am not sure what is in this, but I would not recommend it to anyone.  Two days later and I can still feel a sting in my facial nerves when I put anything else on my face.  This was a horrible experience and I am shocked this made it to store shelves.  Making an appointment with my dermatologist to make sure this red and sensitivity will go away.  This is ending up costing me quite a bit and I am not happy at all about that.  Please do not waste your time and money.</li>
            <li> I was kind of relieved to see that others were having bad reactions to this mask. I picked it up at T.J. Maxx for a good price and was excited to try it as I&#x27;d heard great things about the brand. It makes my face red, dry, and blotchy. It does make my skin feel very soft once the reaction subsides. I have since had a similar reaction to the Yes To Cucumbers moisturizer but have had really great results from both Yes To Blueberries and Tomatoes. I think it&#x27;s something about the Cucumber line that causes the uncomfortable reaction.</li>
            <li> My skin burned and turned red after having this on for about 8 to 10 minutes. It was still burning for about 30 minutes after I washed it off and my skin was red for about 2 hours. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin. I would give it zero stars if I could. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> For the price (really cheap), this is a great product, but a thick lotion would do the same thing.  It&#x27;s very soothing and good for winter skin, but a bit oily, so don&#x27;t use if acne-prone.</li>
            <li> This calming mask works well. It removes dead skin, feels good and dries quickly.  It does not relieve redness or splotchiness like I was hoping. A little bit does not go a long way.  Little pricey for the small container.</li>
            <li> Ugh, I really wanted to like this product. I was excited to replace a mask I used before with a natural one without SLS, parabens, etc. I found this at Marshall&#x27;s, so I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend too much on this. It goes on soothingly, that is true. The cucumber and aloe smell is nice. I tried it once and my face was a little red, which didn&#x27;t alarm me too much. However, the second time I tried it, it looked like I had a sunburn or a chemical burn from this! I couldn&#x27;t believe it! And I only left it on for the instructed 5 minutes. I considered trying it one last time, but I don&#x27;t know if I should risk it since my wedding is soon. Skip this.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at Walgreens the other day. I have always loved cucumber products but have never tried any from this brand before. I&#x27;ve never had any skin reactions before besides to band aids so I thought I would be fine. WRONG. I tried this on my birthday, and after 5 minutes of opening presents, my face was burning. When i washed it off, where the face mask was bright red. It looked like I had a red face mask on. Seriously the only product I&#x27;ve ever been allergic to. BEWAREEE!!!</li>
            <li> It arrive in right time.</li>
            <li> After using this product as directed, my face was bright red only on the area it was used, it also caused swelling in my face. I&#x27;ve thrown it out.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this, and just tried it today.  Normally I research products thoroughly before I use them, but not this time (it figures).  After applying this stuff, I came here to Amazon to check out the reviews, and saw all the negative comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask felt fine going on, and smelled nice .. I had no burning sensation.  But I was alarmed by what I read, and ran to wash the stuff off after about 7 minutes (at which time it was starting to feel dry, no burning or unpleasant sensation).  Sure enough, it gave me a red blotchy face!!!! Even though I would NOT characterize my skin as sensitive ... I use retinol and AHAs without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems like many or most have a bad allergic reaction to this stuff.  I think the company needs to recall &amp;/or reformulate ...</li>
            <li> leaves my face feeling refreshed, i actually like this product more than all the other i have used.  Will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> I bought this a s a gift after I saw it on a TV talk show.  Girfriend says it is quite soothing, and she really like it.  Nice cucumber smell.</li>
            <li> omg seriously. i got this face cream at walgreens on clearance. i should have known better. honestly im surprised this mask didnt get recalled!!! i put it on and not even 5 minutes (the smell was so strong i decided i wanted to take it off, probably about after 3 minutes. as soon as i looked in the mirror after rinsing..RED RED RED BURN!!! It left a distinct red line around my face like you could see EXACTLY where i had put the mask on. Now 15 minutes later its still bright red and im thanking GOD that i am off work tomorrow so no one will see me. if this is supposed to be all natural something is seriously messed up in it. TAKE OUR ADVICE! DONT BUY IT!! its not normal to have this many bad reactions to so many people and the same reaction at that! Please! do yourself a favor and leave it!</li>
            <li> I have never had a reaction to anything in my life, and was shocked to wake up to a red and swollen face.  It feels as if I have a chemical burn.  I narrowed it down to this mask and will never use the Yes to products again, although I have used other lines without a problem in the past.  I would highly warn against using this product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I read the reviews of this mask AFTER using it for the first time. The customer uploaded image showing the woman with a red face? Yeah, that&#x27;s exactly how I look right now. I&#x27;m not happy with this mask one bit. It&#x27;s the exact opposite of calming! The Say Yes line should be ashamed of selling this product. I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to any other face mask I&#x27;ve ever tried and I&#x27;ve used a fair number that make your skin feel tingly. All the while you may wonder if maybe it&#x27;s irritating your skin, then you wash it off and its fine. Not so with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty irritated right now. I&#x27;ve just slathered aloe vera gel all over my face hoping to counteract it. Just hoping it will not be this bad tomorrow morning. If you haven&#x27;t tried this mask yet, don&#x27;t! I threw mine away immediately. Although I&#x27;m thinking I may need to retrieve it just in case this warrants a trip to the dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> I bought this face wash at Target and used it for two or three days before noticing today that my skin is feeling bumpy and extra sensitive. Even softly touching my face with my hand hurts, and it feels so gross and rough. I tried calling the number on the back of the bottle where I was stuck on hold for nearly 20 mins before I eventually just gave up and ended the call. I&#x27;ve been reading reviews and am quite surprised to see that a lot of people are having similar issues. Of course everyone is different, but this product is supposed to be natural and good for sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with any other face wash before this. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> After less than 5 minutes on my face this product left me with a bright red chemical burn. 2 hours later and it&#x27;s obvious that the damage is done and I&#x27;m going to have peeling skin in the morning. Very disappointed to say the least.</li>
            <li> This product turned my face red and burning every spot that I put the mask on. BEWARE!!! Do NOT use this product! I love the wipes but the face mask is definitely not for sensitive skin.</li>
