            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to blend, it doesn&#x27;t crease when used with a good setting powder, and it stays on all day and night!</li>

            <li>Love this item coverage is good</li>
            <li>Nice finish easy to blend great price going to buy more wish</li>
            <li>This powder is a great color on my black and beautiful self!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having issues finding foundations for my oily skin because I&#x27;m a very cheap person (which is why I found this concealer)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect, blends very easily into my skin without leaving that chalky grey look upon application.  </li>
            <li>many blogs recommended me to get.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>love it&lt;</li>
            <li>use it to highlight my undereye it goes on smooth and super easy to blend.</li>
            <li>and this is a full coverage concealer for a cheap price.</li>
            <li>LOVELY full coverage and shipping as fast.</li>
            <li>I would most definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have a caramel skintone and this product and color matches my skin tone very well.</li>
            <li>I wished someone clarified this before raving about this concealer, but later on I found more critical reviews addressing this problem.</li>
            <li>I love the LA Girl Pro Concealer&#x27;s but I picked the wrong color - it may look better once my skin gets darker this summer.</li>
            <li>The only con is that once it dries, it&#x27;s pretty hard to blend, so make sure you begin to blend as soon as it hits your face!</li>
            <li>The coverage is fantastic, and long wearing,  you definitely get a lot of bang for your buck..</li>
            <li>I love using this as an under eye highlight when I want to look a little extra glamorous.</li>
            <li>Color was fine on my medium brown yellow under tone African American skin..</li>
            <li>high quality product for a low price</li>
            <li>Very thick consistency, make sure you take it all off at night as it broke me out from falling asleep in it.</li>
            <li>I was really disappointed because this concealer doesn&#x27;t look good with it applied by itself, so I needed to apply foundation before or after to achieve a decent look.</li>

            <li> I found this a long time ago</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve purchased a long time ago.</li>
            <li> This definitely was not what I expected I would get.</li>
            <li> Bad quality ,wasnt filled up as much as last tube i bought, makeup seemed old and not smooth but</li>
            <li> but it was a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way or else it can get grayish.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Although the voice I selected in this concealer is slightly lighter than my complexion it works well when blended.  </li>
            <li> The stuff comes out looking green.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I am into the hype.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to tell what color a product will be based on an online picture alone, but a lighter color concealer can be used under the eyes.</li>
            <li> I bought five of these and ALL the colors looked the same which was really disappointing.</li>
            <li> Its a tad bit thick, you must apply eye cream before this product or it will crease.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s the shade</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have the money to experiment with expensive oil-free foundations that might not work.</li>
            <li> I think I got a bad batch.</li>

            <li> I just love it thank you!!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way or else it can get grayish. I set it with ben nye topaz powder&#x3D;perfection!!</li>
            <li> Love it ! Doesn&#x27;t crease and last all day</li>
            <li> I know why this stuff is so popular! I love using this as an under eye highlight when I want to look a little extra glamorous. It&#x27;s so easy to blend, it doesn&#x27;t crease when used with a good setting powder, and it stays on all day and night! I just wish it came in larger tubes. The only con is that once it dries, it&#x27;s pretty hard to blend, so make sure you begin to blend as soon as it hits your face! It&#x27;s not oily, won&#x27;t cause you to break out, and you only need to apply it once. The coverage is great! If you&#x27;re thinking about purchasing, you definitely should!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to tell what color a product will be based on an online picture alone, but a lighter color concealer can be used under the eyes. I think I will order a darker color and hope for the best.</li>
            <li> I have a caramel skintone and this product and color matches my skin tone very well. A little bit goes a long way and this is a full coverage concealer for a cheap price. I will definitely be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Loved it ! Nice finish easy to blend great price going to buy more wish I found this a long time ago</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s the shade many blogs recommended me to get. I&#x27;m a NW43 so I chose this toffee color. I was really disappointed because this concealer doesn&#x27;t look good with it applied by itself, so I needed to apply foundation before or after to achieve a decent look. I wished someone clarified this before raving about this concealer, but later on I found more critical reviews addressing this problem. I&#x27;m having issues finding foundations for my oily skin because I&#x27;m a very cheap person (which is why I found this concealer) and I don&#x27;t have the money to experiment with expensive oil-free foundations that might not work. I recommend this concealer if you always wear foundation, but not for those who want a &amp;#34;no makeup&amp;#34; look or don&#x27;t currently using foundations/bb creams.</li>
            <li> The coverage is fantastic, and long wearing,  you definitely get a lot of bang for your buck.. I will be repurchasing another 2 or 3 soon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect, blends very easily into my skin without leaving that chalky grey look upon application.  I can use it under my eyes, brows and for spots and never have to worry about looking like a corpse.</li>
            <li> MUST HAVE&lt;br /&gt;I use it to highlight my undereye it goes on smooth and super easy to blend. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Its a tad bit thick, you must apply eye cream before this product or it will crease. Overall, I would buy another one. for the price you can not beat it. This color is NW40 in Mac</li>
            <li> Although the voice I selected in this concealer is slightly lighter than my complexion it works well when blended.  Happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> I think I got a bad batch. The stuff comes out looking green. Don&#x27;t know what that is about but it was a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> Color was fine on my medium brown yellow under tone African American skin.. Still searching for the perfect shade tho</li>
            <li> Love it. It has the consistency of mac concealer I would most definitely recommend this product. And I will be purchasing again</li>
            <li> Very thick consistency, make sure you take it all off at night as it broke me out from falling asleep in it. Otherwise, great cheap conceal or.</li>
