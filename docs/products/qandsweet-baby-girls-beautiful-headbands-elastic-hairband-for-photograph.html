            <li>Great product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Love these headbands.  </li>
            <li>I love the headbands, BUT they say 9 designs and 10 headbands.  </li>
            <li>i wish there were more colors than just 6 pink but for the price and great quality, i can&#x27;t complain.  </li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve used 1 of 9 brightly colored headbands, and all seem well made.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fit my newborn yet..</li>
            <li>Some of these fit my infant well; some she&#x27;ll have to wear when she&#x27;s three.</li>
            <li>They fit my girl&#x27;s head from about 1.5 mos and still at 3 mos</li>
            <li>Every single headband is beautiful..</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get these</li>
            <li>this is well worth the money!</li>
            <li>The headbands would easily sell for $20 each at a higher end retailer.</li>
            <li>Very cute and good enough quality to wear multiple times.  </li>
            <li>She didn&#x27;t seem to mind though and the indentation faded quickly.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like that one or the yellow bow (its HUGE!), but all the others are lovely.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it will fit better when she is much bigger.</li>
            <li>The rhinestone jeweled accents are so cute and classy.</li>
            <li>Good quality, and only the huge pink one seemed cheap.  </li>
            <li>very much so recommend everyone that I know to Amazon.</li>
            <li>delivery was very fast</li>

            <li>Very cute on my baby, and I like that these are 9 different designs and not just same design with different colors</li>
            <li>I just wish they would have been in more colors instead of different variations of pink ...</li>
            <li>Just got my first &amp; second gr. granddaughters.  </li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised that product came within a week.</li>

            <li> A couple were on the slightly small side (in my opinion) for my 6-month old.</li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t like repeated colors...need it in white, black and purple</li>
            <li> Still wearable but left a slight mark around her head after a few minutes of wearing them.</li>
            <li> If they had another set for black, purple, blue, green, I&#x27;d purchase it!</li>
            <li> Fits my 6 week old without squeezing or irritating her skin.</li>
            <li> I would recommend seller to add or switch out one of the pinks for a salmon or coral, for those customers who are not a huge fan of pink.  </li>
            <li> When I ordered, the delivery date was over a month out, but I was shocked to find them in my mailbox after less than 2 weeks.</li>

            <li> They&#x27;re so beautiful... I love themâ™¡ They took a month to arrive &#x27;FL&#x27;</li>
            <li> Awesome quality and variety at a great price. I absolutely love these. Fits my 6 week old without squeezing or irritating her skin.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love these! Very cute and good enough quality to wear multiple times.  Some of the bands varied a bit in circumference which I liked. A couple were on the slightly small side (in my opinion) for my 6-month old. Still wearable but left a slight mark around her head after a few minutes of wearing them. She didn&#x27;t seem to mind though and the indentation faded quickly. You just might not want to leave them on for long periods of time.  My daughter might outgrow them in a couple months but for now they make for some adorable pictures. We get comments every time she wears them. :)  I just wish we&#x27;d bought them sooner!</li>

            <li> Love love love&lt;br /&gt;little for my newborn tho</li>
            <li> Some are cute but i don&#x27;t like repeated colors...need it in white, black and purple</li>
            <li> Great quality and comfortable on my newborn</li>
            <li> Everyone is well made and soft so it doesn&#x27;t scratch baby.  I had to search around for an assortment of bows that were different and not the same exact bow or flower in 15 colors and this is well worth the money! Bows are just as the picture shows.</li>
            <li> great price and assortment.  Add flare to outfits.</li>
            <li> Beautiful headbands! They don&#x27;t fit my newborn yet..</li>
            <li> Good collection. Workmanship could have been better.</li>
            <li> Good quality nice styles</li>
            <li> falls apart at the glued site</li>
            <li> Beautiful. But not for babies. It has lots of rhinestone decoration that makes me nervous if my baby should decide to pull on it or chew it while I&#x27;m not watching. Like when I&#x27;m driving.&lt;br /&gt;It is a big choking hazard, nor should it be ingested. The prongs can also scratch.&lt;br /&gt;It fits my older daughter who leaves it alone.</li>
            <li> These are adorable! They are too big for a newborns head but you can position it so that you can take a cute picture. In one of the pictures my daughter has the newborn hives. Totally unrelated to the bows. I recommend them because they are as pictured, as described and a great price.</li>
            <li> Very cute on my baby, and I like that these are 9 different designs and not just same design with different colors</li>
            <li> Baby girl looks beautiful. Everybody at church said that she is so cutie with those head bands</li>
            <li> I loved ... my baby five months looks gorgeous all are really very beautiful and delivery was very fast</li>
            <li> Its so cute my baby got lots of a compliment!!</li>
            <li> Some of these fit my infant well; some she&#x27;ll have to wear when she&#x27;s three.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping. Thanks</li>
            <li> I love all the hair bands &amp; they are really good quality elsstic hair bands .</li>
            <li> So very cute great quality and great price</li>
            <li> Very pleased with these!  Good quality, and only the huge pink one seemed cheap.  I didn&#x27;t like that one or the yellow bow (its HUGE!), but all the others are lovely. They fit my girl&#x27;s head from about 1.5 mos and still at 3 mos (her head is 39 c)  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love these headbands! They&#x27;re stunning, the perfect fit, and seem to be good quality  (only got them yesterday). When I ordered, the delivery date was over a month out, but I was shocked to find them in my mailbox after less than 2 weeks. Oh, and you certainly can&#x27;t beat the price.  Can&#x27;t wait to order more!!!</li>
            <li> Love these headbands.  Just got my first &amp; second gr. granddaughters.  Ordering them everywhere.</li>
            <li> looks really great on my neices&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank u</li>
            <li> I love the headbands, BUT they say 9 designs and 10 headbands.  Well I only received 9.  Quality was great though.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors and styles, very good quality, I love them !</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and they&#x27;re all cute and fit perfect!</li>
