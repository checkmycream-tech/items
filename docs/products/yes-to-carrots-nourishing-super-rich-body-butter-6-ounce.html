            <li>Best lotion ever for my sensitive skin on my face!  </li>
            <li>This body butter is one of the best I have used so far.</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell (mild) goes on and not greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich and creamy with a light, pleasant scent and no greasy residue.</li>
            <li>so so in love with this body butter.</li>
            <li>I have eczema that flares up when it comes in contact with many products just meant to soothe the condition.  </li>
            <li>I use it with my toddlers after bath time each night and they love helping me put it on them.</li>
            <li>WHICH MAKES IT BETTER.</li>
            <li>Love the feel, fragrance and effectiveness of this body butter.</li>
            <li>I found the yes to brand while trying to get away from parabens, like many.  </li>
            <li>I like it more than any others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>The lotion in the tubes is even more watery.</li>
            <li>I just love the feel and smell of this cream.  </li>
            <li>It is much more muted.  </li>
            <li>I love the Yes to line of products.  </li>
            <li>I love love this body butter.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li>Very rich and nice light fragrance.</li>
            <li>All I use for my 4 and 6 year old grandchildren, works great for all of us.</li>
            <li>For some people, that might be a good thing, for me; it isn&#x27;t because I really like the smell of this cream.</li>
            <li>Rich but not greasy, very nourishing and feels so good on the skin.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>It is thick and moisturizing but not greasy and penetrates skin nicely to soften -- but my favorite part is the smell, which is a sweet (but not cloying or heavy), light, clean, delightful scent that makes me happy.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m never disappointed.</li>
            <li>Once I&#x27;ve gotten my skin in good shape with it, I don&#x27;t even have to use it daily.  </li>
            <li>The smell is loving and soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad by any means.</li>
            <li>At first, because the packaging and company were different from the original, i didnt give it a fair chance to impress me.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>But by far Yes to carrots super rich body butter is my favorite of all time.  </li>
            <li>Many, many of us can&#x27;t do the lotions/creams with heavy aromas, so I&#x27;m glad this one seems to have none</li>
            <li>This is a great body butter, rich &amp; silky - it moisturizes my sensitive skin beautifully and yet isn&#x27;t ridiculously expensive.  </li>
            <li>First discovered it during my pregnancy, my son is now 3, haven&#x27;t stopped using this product!</li>
            <li>I use it year round with great results.</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin and am allergic to many products but had no irritation from this.</li>
            <li>On a side note, there is an extra rich yes to lotion which sounds like it would be more hydrating, but the body butter is better for me, by far.</li>
            <li>When I first started using the &amp;#34;Yes to&amp;#34; brands I loved them, they made my dry skin silky.</li>
            <li>These are not the real thing!</li>
            <li>So much better than Cetaphil tub cream that I used prior, which I thought worked well.  </li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this product as a gift for my pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this body butter!</li>
            <li>These however are not the real thing.</li>
            <li>I wish there was a larger jar available for purchase though.</li>
            <li>the cream cleanser works really well with that</li>
            <li>and this is so silky feeling, and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I have tried many body butters of various natural brands and this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>It does absolute wonders for rough winter elbows and keeps your feet nice and soft between pedicures.  </li>
            <li>This body butter is not very expensive, but it works very well.  </li>
            <li>The smell and natural ingredients are just right on the money.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li>I bought this new container to replace an old container I had.  </li>
            <li>This is not as moisturizing as a shea or cocoa butter, which I reserve for deep winter use, but works very well otherwise.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is made with 99% natural ingredients and</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and get very itchy when my skin gets dry.</li>
            <li>Thick and smooth but not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>This product left my skin unbelievably soft after just one use!</li>
            <li>I find it very moisturizing and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>During pregnancy I developed a skin sensitivity and the Yes body butters were the only thing that I could use.</li>
            <li>Within a few minutes it&#x27;s fully absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li>Really the only down side is thickness.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive and very dry skin, never had any problems with this product!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, very dry skin.</li>

            <li> I had that container for approximately 2-3 years before I needed to replace it because I had other lotions and creams</li>
            <li> Too watery, too greasy, too smelly, too thin, too thick.  </li>
            <li> The scent is very odd - it smells unpleasant in the jar</li>
            <li> As soon as I used them I felt itchy and uncomfortable, very disappointed.</li>

            <li> I have tried many body butters of various natural brands and this is one of my favorites. It is thick and moisturizing but not greasy and penetrates skin nicely to soften -- but my favorite part is the smell, which is a sweet (but not cloying or heavy), light, clean, delightful scent that makes me happy. This is not as moisturizing as a shea or cocoa butter, which I reserve for deep winter use, but works very well otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and am allergic to many products but had no irritation from this. A favorite!!</li>
            <li> so so so in love with this body butter. I have bought and rebought and just ordered it for the 1st time on Amazon.com. Just magnificent. The smell and natural ingredients are just right on the money. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have eczema that flares up when it comes in contact with many products just meant to soothe the condition.  This body butter is one of the best I have used so far.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! I use it with my toddlers after bath time each night and they love helping me put it on them. It is not greasy, absorbs quickly, and smells great.</li>
            <li> This is the best body butter.  My skin just drinks it in.</li>
            <li> I love this body butter!!!  I have sensitive skin and get very itchy when my skin gets dry. I have been using this body butter for over 3 years and I&#x27;m never disappointed. I use it year round with great results. It has a very nice light scent, is not greasy, and absorbs into the skin well. I highly recommend this body butter!</li>
            <li> I have used Yes To Cucumber for years but prefer this.  Very rich and nice light fragrance.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews! These are not the real thing! During pregnancy I developed a skin sensitivity and the Yes body butters were the only thing that I could use. These however are not the real thing. As soon as I used them I felt itchy and uncomfortable, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like the way it works on my skin.</li>
            <li> The scent is very odd - it smells unpleasant in the jar but once I applied it to my skin, it smells like marshmallows. This product left my skin unbelievably soft after just one use! I wish there was a larger jar available for purchase though.</li>
            <li> REALLY NICE BODY BUTTER, NO PERFUME WHICH MAKES IT BETTER.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff and would buy it in a drum if it was offered that way.</li>
            <li> Love the feel, fragrance and effectiveness of this body butter. Prefer this to higher-end products. All I use for my 4 and 6 year old grandchildren, works great for all of us.</li>
            <li> And a great feature is no smell. Many, many of us can&#x27;t do the lotions/creams with heavy aromas, so I&#x27;m glad this one seems to have none and it is thick enough to provide protection for skin. If you like lightweight lotions, this may not be for you.</li>
            <li> At first, because the packaging and company were different from the original, i didnt give it a fair chance to impress me.&lt;br /&gt;But now i am loving it again.&lt;br /&gt;One of the best out there with no parabens...and a good price.</li>
            <li> I found the yes to brand while trying to get away from parabens, like many.  I have a clarisonic, so the cream cleanser works really well with that and that&#x27;s what started me using this brand.  This body butter is not very expensive, but it works very well.  I like it more than any others I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;too&amp;#34; anything.  Too watery, too greasy, too smelly, too thin, too thick.  It&#x27;s perfect.  Its the only lotion to get rid of my cracked looking skin.  So much better than Cetaphil tub cream that I used prior, which I thought worked well.  Once I&#x27;ve gotten my skin in good shape with it, I don&#x27;t even have to use it daily.  On a side note, there is an extra rich yes to lotion which sounds like it would be more hydrating, but the body butter is better for me, by far.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft! Smells great! I have very sensitive and very dry skin, never had any problems with this product! First discovered it during my pregnancy, my son is now 3, haven&#x27;t stopped using this product! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This is a great body butter, rich &amp; silky - it moisturizes my sensitive skin beautifully and yet isn&#x27;t ridiculously expensive.  I buy it regularly!</li>
            <li> When I first started using the &amp;#34;Yes to&amp;#34; brands I loved them, they made my dry skin silky. But now I can put it on after a shower and my feet will be dry and ashy as if I hadn&#x27;t put on a thing. I only use  it on my hands now.</li>
            <li> This product was not full bodied enough for me so I had to send it back. The smell wasn&#x27;t off-putting.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, very dry skin. This product does not contain alcohol and is the only product I have found to help my dry skin. Helped with dry, red cracked hands during the winter!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this body butter for years. I have very dry skin and this is so silky feeling, and very moisturizing. Yes to Carrots does not test on animals.</li>
            <li> The only reason I keep buying is my son likes it. It watery for body butter. This actually needs to go in their lotion tubes. The lotion in the tubes is even more watery. Not what I expected. It&#x27;s not bad by any means. Pleasant smell (mild) goes on and not greasy. Really the only down side is thickness. It needs to be thicker.</li>
            <li> I just love the feel and smell of this cream.  I find it very moisturizing and long lasting.  I bought this new container to replace an old container I had.  I had that container for approximately 2-3 years before I needed to replace it because I had other lotions and creams I also used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only slightly negative comment about this cream is that the scent of the cream is not as present as it was in the old container.  It is much more muted.  For some people, that might be a good thing, for me; it isn&#x27;t because I really like the smell of this cream.</li>
            <li> I love the Yes to line of products.  But by far Yes to carrots super rich body butter is my favorite of all time.  It does absolute wonders for rough winter elbows and keeps your feet nice and soft between pedicures.
