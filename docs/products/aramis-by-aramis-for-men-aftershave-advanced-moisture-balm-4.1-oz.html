            <li> I could not be happier with this product. The tri-fecta of satisfaction. The product is awesome. The delivery was fast and the price was great. Thanks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to be appreciated with the unusual, comment \\&quot;you smell good\\&quot;.  I enjoy the fresh and good smell that is experienced after the use of Aramis Aftershave Moisture Balm.  Another plus factor is smoother skin texture.</li>
            <li> Great product great price.</li>
            <li> If you want the REAL Aramis Advanced Moisturizing Aftershave, do NOT buy this.  It&#x27;s a cheap imposter.  First, it&#x27;s noticeably thinner and runnier than authentic Aramis moisturizing lotion.  Second, the scent is weaker and does not last very long.  Lastly, it feels different when you rub it on your face.  I believe this is an inexpensive knockoff distributed by Beauty Encounter.  I&#x27;ve been using Aramis Advanced Moisturizing Aftershave for over 25 years and I&#x27;m certain this is a fake.  I hate the fact that authentic Aramis Advanced Moitsturizing Aftershave is so expensive, but it&#x27;s not worth it to save a few bucks for a lousy knockoff.  Be wary!</li>
            <li> Repeat ordered item; I&#x27;ve used it for years.  Best price I could find.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Great smell.  Great price,  Fast delivery.  After all these years, the jar is still glass - not plastic.  Very happy about that.  My husband was most please with this gift.</li>
            <li> Have used Aramis for many years and this ine was as good as the others.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and will continue to use it.  It has a very light, pleasant scent and contains no alcohol to dry the skin.</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years</li>
            <li> Made my husband a very happy man on Father&#x27;s Day!!</li>
            <li> Soothing aftershave balm with great fragrance of Aramis.</li>
            <li> I like the after shave lotion.  But it needs a better means of dispensing. Shaking it out of the jar is wasteful.</li>
            <li> Yes this is what my husband has been using for years none other product</li>
            <li> Bought this because I could no longer find Aramis&#x27; Tuscany.  This is a great substitute -- makes his face feel great after shaving.  A wonderful moisturizer during this particularly harsh winter we are experiencing.</li>
            <li> Nice and refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> I like this aftershave will reorder when needed.</li>
            <li> Classic!  Smells awesome!</li>
