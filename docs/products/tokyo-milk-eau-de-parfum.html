            <li>I get so many complements when I wear it!</li>
            <li>Almost more of an manly aftershave smell ...but for women!</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>It smells amazing</li>
            <li>However, the dry-down is amazing, and that&#x27;s why I bought it.</li>
            <li>Nice for use before bed.</li>
            <li>it smells nice on both sexes.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice to know that ahead of time.  </li>
            <li>Nice staying power.</li>
            <li>Love this perfume and good price, but NO where does it say there&#x27;s NO BOX in the description.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is perfect, bottom of bottle is decently chipped.</li>
            <li>So happy feel so special with this sent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so good that it tests better than Panther&#x27;s Blood because 70% of the time Tainted Love works every time...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for the price and arrived super speedy</li>
            <li>cute name, cute scent!  </li>
            <li>Nice, has more of a musk scent than I would like, but would recommend to others.</li>
            <li>I love vanilla</li>
            <li>I love, love this parfum, so there are no issues there.</li>
            <li>But I prefer a more earthy scent, nothing flowery or fruity.</li>
            <li>I love this scent.</li>
            <li>and I wonder if this product is even authentic.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>This review is for the Everything &amp; Nothing scent, NOT for Tainted Love.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a great everyday scent that lasts nicely, and at a great price.</li>
            <li>Love it but wish the scent didn&#x27;t disappear quite so soon.</li>
            <li>One of my daughters favorite perfumes.  </li>
            <li>He loves the smell too..:)</li>
            <li>This one is just over the top.</li>
            <li>I have a rotation of 3 perfumes but this is honestly my favorite.</li>
            <li>Love the packaging.</li>
            <li>love this</li>
            <li>Cute packaging</li>
            <li>Nothing tainted about how much I love it.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this in an order form Sephora and immediately fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But if you go for the more layered dense musky scents that proceed AND follow you, this might be for you.  </li>
            <li>Lovely scent.</li>
            <li>Was OK package you can smell the products I belive part of the liquid</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume and have been wearing it for years.</li>
            <li>It almost smells like bourbon straight from the bottle (in a good way).</li>
            <li>Once it settles, it goes from sickly sweet to extraordinarily warm and rich.</li>
            <li>I got a free sample of this from Sephora and loved it so much, I bought it here.</li>
            <li>However, it was not as strong as the one that I bought in the store.</li>
            <li>a combination of sweet and sophisticated.</li>
            <li>&amp; it still lingered, very very rich &amp; too musky sweet.  </li>
            <li>I was so pleased with this perfume, I  have been looking for a scent that has a vanilla undertone but not overwhelming and this one is perfect!</li>
            <li>Fair pricing and super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I really think this scent is spectacular for the price, so five stars in that regard</li>
            <li>the most, right?  </li>
            <li>This is NOT the real product!!!  </li>
            <li>Well, the reviews of Tainted Love really sold me, as did all of Tokyo Milk&#x27;s cool packaging--but I should have known better than to purchase perfume online, eh, can&#x27;t return it.  </li>
            <li>did it list that this bottle did not come in original packaging.</li>
            <li>great smell lasts all day long!</li>
            <li>I have asthma &amp; perfumes bother me, but this one is nice and light, natural, sweet &amp; smokey?</li>
            <li>I love it came fast.</li>
            <li>The orange is so sweet and warmed up that it almost doesn&#x27;t smell like orange anymore.</li>
            <li>The bottle is cool.</li>
            <li>A nice soft smell.</li>
            <li>It was unopened and it was totally full.</li>
            <li>did not come in the box, but bottle appears full..</li>
            <li>The package was mailed so quickly.</li>
            <li>I started getting compliments about it the very first time I wore it.</li>
            <li>I bought this at an airport boutique, I get a headache in the perfume shops but this scent is beautiful without being too heavy or floral.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s REALLY sweet, almost cloying and kind of generic.</li>
            <li>Dark and dense with sexy overtones, this is by far my most favorite parfum!</li>
            <li>Sweet orange would most definitely be the primary note, but don&#x27;t let that lead you to believe that this is a citrusy perfume</li>
            <li>It smells delightful and is lasting a long time!</li>
            <li>Very nice smelling, not really sweet, but</li>
            <li>This perfume smells amazing, but it doesn&#x27;t last throughout the day.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll either love this stuff or find it completely &amp;#34;meh.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I have no idea what &#x27;desert moss&#x27; is supposed to smell like, though it certainly sounds poetic and alluring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The tea leaves really come out after several hours of wear, and are a really nice addition, adding to the warmth.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;pressed petals&#x27; note is definitely present when first sprayed, but disappears quickly (a plus in my book, as it helps take the scent from sweet to warm, as described above).</li>
            <li>This has a lovely smell, key tones are vanilla and cedar wood.</li>
            <li>Must be my chemistry, but you&#x27;ll want to try it first.</li>
            <li>First of all DONT buy this from America&#x27;s Beauty Supply.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased this from several stores and it has always been one of my favorite scents.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell, however the spritzer broke on the bottle after only a week.</li>
            <li>If Guerlain&#x27;s Shalimar and Samsara got married and had a kid, it would be this perfume -- sandalwood and vanilla.  </li>
            <li>The scent is softly sandalwood, lightly spicy and the vanilla is a bit musky.</li>
            <li>the authentic perfum only costs another $10, I will not put this on my skin, who knows what&#x27;s in it.</li>
            <li>I would prefer to pay more for a longer lasting perfume.</li>
            <li>I can smell some vanilla, but mostly this... musk, sort of like one of those Egyptian-midnight-death-flower-type mystery essential</li>
            <li>Smells great but has limited projection and lasts a short time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been spraying it in my hair while it&#x27;s still wet to get a great lasting scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even sure that this is the real fragrance because the packaging is so different.</li>
            <li>This stuff can be addictive, so if you like sweet scents buy this NOW!</li>
            <li>It is now one of my new favorites!!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t incredibly striking or complex, though, and it wears off very quickly.</li>
            <li>I have found that Amazon has a much more consistent supply of this than does some other suppliers.</li>
            <li>Tokyo milk let them eat cake,in fact it&#x27;s the saucier,racier older sister!</li>
            <li>and it was much more powerful, I could smell it for a few hours.</li>
            <li>I got it fast and it was well packaged.</li>
            <li>I was very dissappointed in the quality</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this scent (Tainted</li>
            <li>and i am very picky about my scents.</li>
            <li>I know it wasn&#x27;t completely full because I held it up to the light, it had less parfum in it than the bottle I already had.</li>
            <li>thing that surprised me about this fragrance is that I actually don&#x27;t really like it when it is first spritzed on.</li>
            <li>and I much prefer this because it has more sandlewood and less vanilla.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Second time ive recieved a bottle without a box that wasnt full.</li>
            <li>My bottle arrived only 1/2 full and the spray was primed like someone had sprayed it already.  </li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s pretty much the opposite of crisp.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to check out some more of the Tokyomilk Dark line.</li>
            <li>Too strong,too intense,too sweet and with a big conflict of interest going on with the non-harmonious notes that are in the bottle.</li>
            <li>The scent itself is the main selling point of this product.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous scent, weak staying power.</li>
            <li>But it sprays on very light and seems to dissapear within just a few hours.</li>
            <li>Love it better than dead sexy.this scent is slightly sweeter and lasts longer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It reminds me of Juicy couture but a more adult version.. and more expensive smelling.&lt;br /&gt;Moderate</li>
            <li>I started out wearing the Tokyo Milk Dead Sexy</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance so much, only downside is it does not stay on for long.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s complex, but it&#x27;s very strong &amp; musky perfume-y.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend smelling this directly or you might get a fat headache like I did!</li>
            <li>They are brand new and not used.&amp;#34; Completely ignoring 1)the bottle was not in a box 2)</li>
            <li>reason I gave it 4 stars, is because I like VERY STRONG parfume, and this is on the subtle side.</li>
            <li>I love the black glass bottle, just wish they made a bigger size!</li>
            <li>I live in a cold climate, and I LOVE the warm, warm smell of this on my scarf mixing with the chilly air</li>
            <li>Hard to describe, but I love it.</li>
            <li>On me, it goes on &amp;#34;love love love&amp;#34; but quickly spirals down into an oddly one-dimensional sandalwood tobacco smell of total &amp;#34;meh.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>At first it was dark chocolate covered cherries I smelled,then Thierry Mugler&#x27;s Angel (a very hostile fragrance)</li>
            <li>specifically* like something (clearly vanilla, grapefruit, patchouli, or jasmine, etc.), this perfume will probably overwhelm you.  </li>
            <li>Contacted them via email about the issue, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll do anything for me as it&#x27;s marked as not eligible for return.</li>
            <li>The sandalwood is irresistable and the vanilla and white tea really soften it.</li>
            <li>Its got a masculine quality to it while still being feminine.</li>
            <li>But on me -- an alpha-type girl -- it&#x27;s light on &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; and heavy on the &amp;#34;tainted.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, it smells the same as the real thing, and that&#x27;s what matters</li>
            <li>but I had to give it 4 stars overall because the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to have much staying power.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m curious what their other scents are like, tho, because their marketing has its hooks in me :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, I won&#x27;t buy it again, as the bottle runs out very fast due to reapplying.</li>
            <li>The bottle leaked entirely into the bubble wrap and the paint from the bottle was completely melted off.</li>
            <li>, I have this $35 bottle now after all, but on me one quick spray on the wrist intensified to a church-lady level, straight-up thick Perfume Announcement.  </li>

            <li> I love it came fast.</li>
            <li> The orange is so sweet and warmed up that it almost doesn&#x27;t smell like orange anymore.</li>
            <li> The bottle is cool.</li>
            <li> A nice soft smell.</li>
            <li> It was unopened and it was totally full.</li>
            <li> did not come in the box, but bottle appears full..</li>
            <li> The package was mailed so quickly.</li>
            <li> I started getting compliments about it the very first time I wore it.</li>
            <li> I bought this at an airport boutique, I get a headache in the perfume shops but this scent is beautiful without being too heavy or floral.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s REALLY sweet, almost cloying and kind of generic.</li>
            <li> Dark and dense with sexy overtones, this is by far my most favorite parfum!</li>
            <li> Sweet orange would most definitely be the primary note, but don&#x27;t let that lead you to believe that this is a citrusy perfume</li>
            <li> It smells delightful and is lasting a long time!</li>
            <li> Very nice smelling, not really sweet, but</li>
            <li> This perfume smells amazing, but it doesn&#x27;t last throughout the day.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll either love this stuff or find it completely &amp;#34;meh.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I have no idea what &#x27;desert moss&#x27; is supposed to smell like, though it certainly sounds poetic and alluring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The tea leaves really come out after several hours of wear, and are a really nice addition, adding to the warmth.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;pressed petals&#x27; note is definitely present when first sprayed, but disappears quickly (a plus in my book, as it helps take the scent from sweet to warm, as described above).</li>
            <li> This has a lovely smell, key tones are vanilla and cedar wood.</li>
            <li> Must be my chemistry, but you&#x27;ll want to try it first.</li>
            <li> First of all DONT buy this from America&#x27;s Beauty Supply.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this from several stores and it has always been one of my favorite scents.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell, however the spritzer broke on the bottle after only a week.</li>
            <li> If Guerlain&#x27;s Shalimar and Samsara got married and had a kid, it would be this perfume -- sandalwood and vanilla.  </li>
            <li> The scent is softly sandalwood, lightly spicy and the vanilla is a bit musky.</li>
            <li> the authentic perfum only costs another $10, I will not put this on my skin, who knows what&#x27;s in it.</li>
            <li> I would prefer to pay more for a longer lasting perfume.</li>
            <li> I can smell some vanilla, but mostly this... musk, sort of like one of those Egyptian-midnight-death-flower-type mystery essential</li>
            <li> Smells great but has limited projection and lasts a short time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been spraying it in my hair while it&#x27;s still wet to get a great lasting scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even sure that this is the real fragrance because the packaging is so different.</li>
            <li> This stuff can be addictive, so if you like sweet scents buy this NOW!</li>
            <li> It is now one of my new favorites!!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t incredibly striking or complex, though, and it wears off very quickly.</li>
            <li> I have found that Amazon has a much more consistent supply of this than does some other suppliers.</li>
            <li> Tokyo milk let them eat cake,in fact it&#x27;s the saucier,racier older sister!</li>
            <li> and it was much more powerful, I could smell it for a few hours.</li>
            <li> I got it fast and it was well packaged.</li>
            <li> I was very dissappointed in the quality</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this scent (Tainted</li>
            <li> and i am very picky about my scents.</li>
            <li> I know it wasn&#x27;t completely full because I held it up to the light, it had less parfum in it than the bottle I already had.</li>
            <li> thing that surprised me about this fragrance is that I actually don&#x27;t really like it when it is first spritzed on.</li>
            <li> and I much prefer this because it has more sandlewood and less vanilla.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Second time ive recieved a bottle without a box that wasnt full.</li>
            <li> My bottle arrived only 1/2 full and the spray was primed like someone had sprayed it already.  </li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s pretty much the opposite of crisp.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to check out some more of the Tokyomilk Dark line.</li>
            <li> Too strong,too intense,too sweet and with a big conflict of interest going on with the non-harmonious notes that are in the bottle.</li>
            <li> The scent itself is the main selling point of this product.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous scent, weak staying power.</li>
            <li> But it sprays on very light and seems to dissapear within just a few hours.</li>
            <li> Love it better than dead sexy.this scent is slightly sweeter and lasts longer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It reminds me of Juicy couture but a more adult version.. and more expensive smelling.&lt;br /&gt;Moderate</li>
            <li> I started out wearing the Tokyo Milk Dead Sexy</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance so much, only downside is it does not stay on for long.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s complex, but it&#x27;s very strong &amp; musky perfume-y.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend smelling this directly or you might get a fat headache like I did!</li>
            <li> They are brand new and not used.&amp;#34; Completely ignoring 1)the bottle was not in a box 2)</li>
            <li> reason I gave it 4 stars, is because I like VERY STRONG parfume, and this is on the subtle side.</li>
            <li> I love the black glass bottle, just wish they made a bigger size!</li>
            <li> I live in a cold climate, and I LOVE the warm, warm smell of this on my scarf mixing with the chilly air</li>
            <li> Hard to describe, but I love it.</li>
            <li> On me, it goes on &amp;#34;love love love&amp;#34; but quickly spirals down into an oddly one-dimensional sandalwood tobacco smell of total &amp;#34;meh.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> At first it was dark chocolate covered cherries I smelled,then Thierry Mugler&#x27;s Angel (a very hostile fragrance)</li>
            <li> specifically* like something (clearly vanilla, grapefruit, patchouli, or jasmine, etc.), this perfume will probably overwhelm you.  </li>
            <li> Contacted them via email about the issue, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll do anything for me as it&#x27;s marked as not eligible for return.</li>
            <li> The sandalwood is irresistable and the vanilla and white tea really soften it.</li>
            <li> Its got a masculine quality to it while still being feminine.</li>
            <li> But on me -- an alpha-type girl -- it&#x27;s light on &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; and heavy on the &amp;#34;tainted.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, it smells the same as the real thing, and that&#x27;s what matters</li>
            <li> but I had to give it 4 stars overall because the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to have much staying power.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious what their other scents are like, tho, because their marketing has its hooks in me :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, I won&#x27;t buy it again, as the bottle runs out very fast due to reapplying.</li>
            <li> The bottle leaked entirely into the bubble wrap and the paint from the bottle was completely melted off.</li>
            <li> , I have this $35 bottle now after all, but on me one quick spray on the wrist intensified to a church-lady level, straight-up thick Perfume Announcement.  </li>
            <li> I dig it- not too flowery but a little girly, and a nice choice for someone that likes dramatic perfumes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to sweet gourmand scents so this is totally intoxicating for me:</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> And the scent is subtle and pretty.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t part with the smell for that long.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s actually new or not.</li>
            <li> Not only did my bottle arrive unwrapped and not a true Tokyo Milk product, it was also chipped in the upper corner allowing all the perfume to seep out...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a young, clean, or natural scent at all in my opinion, very heavy &amp; contrived.  </li>
            <li> One whiff and I HAD to have it, even though it&#x27;s not the type of scent I normally go for, and the description actually sounds the least &#x27;me&#x27; of all the Tokyomilk Dark</li>
            <li> the packaging in not real and the over all quality of the packaging is something you would expect from a flee market, I wish I would have read all the reviews before I purchased,</li>
            <li> Casual but fun scent.  </li>
            <li> after an hour it turned into plain pipe tobacco and finally chocolate</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have found, I received a damaged bottle with the perfume leaking out of it.</li>
            <li> covered raisins with a sharp punch.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when I realized that this bottle leaks and drips down the side, especially on hot days.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> the bottle was not full.</li>
            <li> It lasts fairly long, but loses strength during the day.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I would probably recommend smelling this before you buy it, if you tend to be picky about perfume - this one may not be for everyone, and the description could possibly be a little bit</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve bought it online, the boutique by me closed that I used to purchase it at, and I&#x27;m beyond disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not only that, the silage is very weak, which makes me suspect it&#x27;s been watered down.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing, I paid full price &amp; nowhere on the sell page</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a complex boquet with dark vanilla bean, sandalwood and orchid notes..</li>
            <li> and I wish I would&#x27;ve listened to past reviews.</li>
            <li> Like it was mixed wrong.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not really sure how to feel about the stated notes for this scent.</li>
            <li> and it is not authentic,</li>
            <li> just sucks</li>
            <li> If I could give this a negative rating I would!</li>
            <li> I am unhappy because the bottle came unwrapped, not in a box &amp; the bottle was not completely full.</li>
            <li> Never been disappointed by Tokyo Dark scents.</li>
            <li> This one from this vendor smelled weird.  </li>
            <li> I am absolutely obsessed with this scent.</li>
            <li> Obsessed with this smell for winter</li>
            <li> THAT was disappointing.  </li>
            <li> This is a FAKE!!!  </li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed!!</li>

            <li> Second time ive recieved a bottle without a box that wasnt full. I feel as if they are sending tester bottles. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Nice, has more of a musk scent than I would like, but would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I love it came fast. Smells so good. I love vanilla has oil feel it stay on all day. So happy feel so special with this sent. 5 stars</li>
            <li> Boy oh boy, does this Tainted Love smell good or what?! It&#x27;s amazing! I&#x27;m addicted to sweet gourmand scents so this is totally intoxicating for me: tasty vanilla bean layered with orchid, white tea and sandalwood...I literally sniff my wrists for hours after applying this. Lasts about 5 hours for me, so I carry the rollerball version (sold separately) in my purse so I can reapply later. I love the black glass bottle, just wish they made a bigger size! This stuff can be addictive, so if you like sweet scents buy this NOW!</li>
            <li> I love, love this parfum, so there are no issues there. I am unhappy because the bottle came unwrapped, not in a box &amp; the bottle was not completely full. I know it wasn&#x27;t completely full because I held it up to the light, it had less parfum in it than the bottle I already had. Very disappointing, I paid full price &amp; nowhere on the sell page did it list that this bottle did not come in original packaging. I sent an email to Discount Beauty Cntr &amp; their response was as follows. &amp;#34;We ship the products the way we receive them from the company. They are brand new and not used.&amp;#34; Completely ignoring 1)the bottle was not in a box 2) the bottle was not full. Will NEVER buy from this company again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t purchase! Smells nothing like the actual product and I wish I would&#x27;ve listened to past reviews. Contacted them via email about the issue, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll do anything for me as it&#x27;s marked as not eligible for return. Extremely disappointed!!</li>
            <li> I love this scent! I realize scents are very personal. But I prefer a more earthy scent, nothing flowery or fruity. This has a lovely smell, key tones are vanilla and cedar wood.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this a while back and finally bought the perfume. I got it fast and it was well packaged. It just smells so good, it&#x27;s worth every penny :D</li>
            <li> The sandalwood is irresistable and the vanilla and white tea really soften it. I tuck the bottle into my purse and spritz it before work or halfway through if I&#x27;m working a double, for a pick-me-up. Always ger complimented on it. And the scent is subtle and pretty.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife. She loves it.</li>
            <li> After great experience with Tokyomilk Honey and the Moon, tried this with a sample and seemed to be quite nice. But it sprays on very light and seems to dissapear within just a few hours. Must be my chemistry, but you&#x27;ll want to try it first.</li>
            <li> First of all DONT buy this from America&#x27;s Beauty Supply.  My bottle arrived only 1/2 full and the spray was primed like someone had sprayed it already.  THAT was disappointing.  Amazon rectified this matter though.  But this review is about the product, not Amazon, nor the fraudulent seller.  I have asthma &amp; perfumes bother me, but this one is nice and light, natural, sweet &amp; smokey? Hard to describe, but I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this scent. It&#x27;s not overpowering even just after sprayed and it&#x27;s not too vanilla-ish either. I started getting compliments about it the very first time I wore it. I started out wearing the Tokyo Milk Dead Sexy and I much prefer this because it has more sandlewood and less vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been spraying it in my hair while it&#x27;s still wet to get a great lasting scent. Spraying it on my pressure points, I&#x27;d say this wouldn&#x27;t make it through like a 12 hour day out of the house.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this from several stores and it has always been one of my favorite scents.  This one from this vendor smelled weird.  Like it was mixed wrong.  Kinda smelled like nail polish remover.  I was very dissappointed in the quality and I wonder if this product is even authentic.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this Eau de Parfum from a makeup supplier and loved it.  My husband also thought that it smelled good.  I have found that Amazon has a much more consistent supply of this than does some other suppliers.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume. Its got a masculine quality to it while still being feminine. It&#x27;s my go to scent.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, however the spritzer broke on the bottle after only a week. I purchased it from Sephora. It smells amazing just sucks i had to shake out of bottle after that.</li>
            <li> Came on time! No issues.</li>
            <li> **This review is for the Everything &amp; Nothing scent, NOT for Tainted Love.** I purchased this based on having smelled it on a scarf that a friend left at my house. One whiff and I HAD to have it, even though it&#x27;s not the type of scent I normally go for, and the description actually sounds the least &#x27;me&#x27; of all the Tokyomilk Dark fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that surprised me about this fragrance is that I actually don&#x27;t really like it when it is first spritzed on. It&#x27;s REALLY sweet, almost cloying and kind of generic. However, the dry-down is amazing, and that&#x27;s why I bought it. Once it settles, it goes from sickly sweet to extraordinarily warm and rich. I live in a cold climate, and I LOVE the warm, warm smell of this on my scarf mixing with the chilly air outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not really sure how to feel about the stated notes for this scent. Sweet orange would most definitely be the primary note, but don&#x27;t let that lead you to believe that this is a citrusy perfume - it&#x27;s pretty much the opposite of crisp. The orange is so sweet and warmed up that it almost doesn&#x27;t smell like orange anymore. Maybe like an orange that&#x27;s been steeping in a bowl of cognac and sugar. The &#x27;pressed petals&#x27; note is definitely present when first sprayed, but disappears quickly (a plus in my book, as it helps take the scent from sweet to warm, as described above). The tea leaves really come out after several hours of wear, and are a really nice addition, adding to the warmth. I have no idea what &#x27;desert moss&#x27; is supposed to smell like, though it certainly sounds poetic and alluring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would probably recommend smelling this before you buy it, if you tend to be picky about perfume - this one may not be for everyone, and the description could possibly be a little bit misleading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great everyday scent that lasts nicely, and at a great price. I can&#x27;t wait to check out some more of the Tokyomilk Dark line.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely obsessed with this scent. The bottle is cool. I just wish it lasted longer than a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> This perfume is different.  I wouldn&#x27;t even know how to describe it, but it has a wonderful scent.  It lasts fairly long, but loses strength during the day.  Very nice smelling, not really sweet, but a combination of sweet and sophisticated.</li>
            <li> If Guerlain&#x27;s Shalimar and Samsara got married and had a kid, it would be this perfume -- sandalwood and vanilla.  You&#x27;ll either love this stuff or find it completely &amp;#34;meh.&amp;#34;  On me, it goes on &amp;#34;love love love&amp;#34; but quickly spirals down into an oddly one-dimensional sandalwood tobacco smell of total &amp;#34;meh.&amp;#34;  I think if I ever smelled this up close on an alpha-type guy, I&#x27;d follow him anywhere.  But on me -- an alpha-type girl -- it&#x27;s light on &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; and heavy on the &amp;#34;tainted.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when I realized that this bottle leaks and drips down the side, especially on hot days. Not only that, the silage is very weak, which makes me suspect it&#x27;s been watered down. I went to Sephora recently to try the one they had in store and it was much more powerful, I could smell it for a few hours. The one I bought disappears in a few minutes no matter how much I spray. Sad because it&#x27;s one of my favorite fragrances of all time, but I would recommend against ordering from this seller. Spend the extra couple dollars and buy it from a trustworthy vendor.</li>
            <li> Smells great but has limited projection and lasts a short time. Nice for use before bed.</li>
            <li> It smells. Wonderful. The scent doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> This is NOT the real product!!!  This is a FAKE!!!  Do NOT BUY!!!  Buyers beware, you can Not return this!!!!  I wish I would&#x27;ve known!!!</li>
            <li> great smell lasts all day long! I think it&#x27;s &amp;#34;female&amp;#34; perfume, but I wear it..........it smells nice on both sexes.</li>
            <li> Love it but wish the scent didn&#x27;t disappear quite so soon. I would rate this as a medium fragrance.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous scent, weak staying power.</li>
            <li> The bottle is not &amp;#34;matte finish&amp;#34; so we knew immediately that it was a knock off.  It would have been nice to know that ahead of time.  Nonetheless, it smells the same as the real thing, and that&#x27;s what matters the most, right?  Next year I will buy from Sophora to know I am getting the &amp;#34;real deal&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> One of my daughters favorite perfumes.  A nice soft smell.</li>
            <li> Someone gave me this scent as a sample.. I loved it and had to get it! My baby daddy uses it as room spray which pisses me off!..I feel like thats disrespectful cause I pay alot for my fragrances and the nerve of that fool to use my spray as a room spray.. I told him to stop and use the airwick..Im going to not get so upset about it and take it as a compliment. He loves the smell too..:)</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Fair pricing and super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I bought this at an airport boutique, I get a headache in the perfume shops but this scent is beautiful without being too heavy or floral. The scent is softly sandalwood, lightly spicy and the vanilla is a bit musky. I love it, and its lasted all day!</li>
            <li> received in good condition.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have found, I received a damaged bottle with the perfume leaking out of it.</li>
            <li> Every time I catch whiff of this perfume it makes my toes curl. It&#x27;s so good that it tests better than Panther&#x27;s Blood because 70% of the time Tainted Love works every time...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Disclaimer: I may, or may not, have been watching Anchorman during this review but my opinion about this perfume wasn&#x27;t tainted in any way)</li>
            <li> Amazing perfume!! Love it! The package was mailed so quickly. It is now one of my new favorites!! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I really think this scent is spectacular for the price, so five stars in that regard but I had to give it 4 stars overall because the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to have much staying power. Perhaps it would last longer in Summer? Either way I would recommend it; just don&#x27;t expect it to last all day.</li>
            <li> It was unopened and it was totally full. However, it was not as strong as the one that I bought in the store. Would probably buy from Sephora again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend smelling this directly or you might get a fat headache like I did! Too strong,too intense,too sweet and with a big conflict of interest going on with the non-harmonious notes that are in the bottle.At first it was dark chocolate covered cherries I smelled,then Thierry Mugler&#x27;s Angel (a very hostile fragrance) after an hour it turned into plain pipe tobacco and finally chocolate covered raisins with a sharp punch.This is vaguely reminiscent of Tokyo milk let them eat cake,in fact it&#x27;s the saucier,racier older sister! But I like let them eat cake.This one is just over the top.Yuck!</li>
            <li> The bottle leaked entirely into the bubble wrap and the paint from the bottle was completely melted off. I&#x27;m not even sure that this is the real fragrance because the packaging is so different.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance so much, only downside is it does not stay on for long.  After a couple hours I have to re apply</li>
            <li> It is so yummy and I get compliments on it. I have a rotation of 3 perfumes but this is honestly my favorite.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 bottles of this and it is not authentic, the packaging in not real and the over all quality of the packaging is something you would expect from a flee market, I wish I would have read all the reviews before I purchased, the authentic perfum only costs another $10, I will not put this on my skin, who knows what&#x27;s in it.</li>
            <li> cute name, cute scent!  Casual but fun scent.  Love the packaging. Arrived promptly and I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my third bottle. love this and it loves me-)</li>
            <li> The scent itself is the main selling point of this product. I dig it- not too flowery but a little girly, and a nice choice for someone that likes dramatic perfumes. It isn&#x27;t incredibly striking or complex, though, and it wears off very quickly. In this respect, you get what you pay for. Cute packaging though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I won&#x27;t buy it again, as the bottle runs out very fast due to reapplying. I would prefer to pay more for a longer lasting perfume.</li>
            <li> Nothing tainted about how much I love it. I have Excess also. Never been disappointed by Tokyo Dark scents. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> absolutely delicious. This is my new favorite perfume. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this in an order form Sephora and immediately fell in love with it. It has the perfect balance of warmth and floral without being too powerful. It&#x27;s the only scent I have tried from this brand, but I am hooked on it!</li>
            <li> It almost smells like bourbon straight from the bottle (in a good way). On my skin, the vanilla opens up a lot, as does the orchid. It&#x27;s a mysterious, sensual fragrance. Nice staying power. One spritz is plenty.</li>
            <li> Well, the reviews of Tainted Love really sold me, as did all of Tokyo Milk&#x27;s cool packaging--but I should have known better than to purchase perfume online, eh, can&#x27;t return it.  Basically, if you&#x27;re like me, &amp; you tend to lean towards scents that smell *specifically* like something (clearly vanilla, grapefruit, patchouli, or jasmine, etc.), this perfume will probably overwhelm you.  It&#x27;s complex, but it&#x27;s very strong &amp; musky perfume-y.  I can smell some vanilla, but mostly this... musk, sort of like one of those Egyptian-midnight-death-flower-type mystery essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try to give it a chance, I have this $35 bottle now after all, but on me one quick spray on the wrist intensified to a church-lady level, straight-up thick Perfume Announcement.  I rinsed it off with soap--&amp; it still lingered, very very rich &amp; too musky sweet.  I can&#x27;t even think of who to give it to...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you go for the more layered dense musky scents that proceed AND follow you, this might be for you.  It&#x27;s not a young, clean, or natural scent at all in my opinion, very heavy &amp; contrived.  I&#x27;m curious what their other scents are like, tho, because their marketing has its hooks in me :)</li>
            <li> I loved it!  My daughters too....</li>
            <li> Fragrance is perfect, bottom of bottle is decently chipped. I&#x27;d send it back but I can&#x27;t part with the smell for that long.</li>
            <li> I love the way this perfume smells! I get so many complements when I wear it! I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume and good price, but NO where does it say there&#x27;s NO BOX in the description. Not sure if it&#x27;s actually new or not. Misleading...</li>
            <li> I was so pleased with this perfume, I  have been looking for a scent that has a vanilla undertone but not overwhelming and this one is perfect! I read the reviews and gave it a shot, so happy. It last all day, I especially like it on my hair.</li>
            <li> Obsessed with this smell for winter</li>
            <li> Love it better than dead sexy.this scent is slightly sweeter and lasts longer. Great for the price and arrived super speedy</li>
            <li> Almost as good as the hand lotion. This perfume smells amazing, but it doesn&#x27;t last throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Lovely scent. Came on time from vendor.</li>
            <li> Perfect scent, made an excellent gift</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this scent (Tainted love)&lt;br /&gt;It has a complex boquet with dark vanilla bean, sandalwood and orchid notes..&lt;br /&gt;It reminds me of Juicy couture but a more adult version.. and more expensive smelling.&lt;br /&gt;Moderate sillage and medium projection.&lt;br /&gt;My go to scent.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think anyone could not like this scent!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(It did not come in the box, but bottle appears full..and it is the legitimate product)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave it 4 stars, is because I like VERY STRONG parfume, and this is on the subtle side.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume!!  Awesome seller.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this from Sephora and loved it so much, I bought it here. It smells delightful and is lasting a long time!</li>
            <li> Great smell...and i am very picky about my scents. Almost more of an manly aftershave smell ...but for women! Love!</li>
            <li> Perfume bottle didn&#x27;t come in box. It was inside some bubble wrap!!! As soon as I opened the box I could smell it bc it&#x27;d been leaking! Smells like a knock off! I&#x27;m so upset!</li>
            <li> Was OK package you can smell the products I belive part of the liquid Was all over the bottle. I love the product.</li>
            <li> Dark and dense with sexy overtones, this is by far my most favorite parfum! I will be using all spring!</li>
            <li> My skin burns when I use this perfume...</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife!</li>
            <li> If I could give this a negative rating I would! I love this perfume and have been wearing it for years. This is the first time I&#x27;ve bought it online, the boutique by me closed that I used to purchase it at, and I&#x27;m beyond disappointed. Not only did my bottle arrive unwrapped and not a true Tokyo Milk product, it was also chipped in the upper corner allowing all the perfume to seep out... I will never buy from this specific dealer again...</li>
