            <li>I bought several and can&#x27;t pick a favorite, each one is beautiful in it&#x27;s own way.</li>

            <li>I loved it so much that my husband has bought me every one like it that he could find here.</li>
            <li>I bought two other styles of these and the gems were perfect.</li>
            <li>Overall nice quality though with bright purple accent stones.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it will break easily.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s strong.</li>
            <li>It is such a beautiful piece.  </li>
            <li>Such Beautiful colors.</li>
            <li>Beautiful clip, kind of heavy</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and could not get it to stay in place</li>
            <li>but mine was fine.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine now.</li>
            <li>and it holds it fine.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty and elegant.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty!</li>
            <li>Unless you have a huge amount of hair</li>
            <li>Cheap &amp; &amp;#34;Very Soft&amp;#34;, metal alloy.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all.....</li>
            <li>Cheap but have to take chance.</li>
            <li>cheap.</li>
            <li>It does not look at all cheap and from a distance</li>
            <li>Light weight clips just don&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much</li>
            <li>I get one of these cheap hair things for my wife every couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>I twist my hair into a bun and secure it with this.  </li>
            <li>THEY WOULD GET FANTASTIC COMPLIMENTS.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe the price was so cheap.  </li>
            <li>There is one stone that isn&#x27;t in place perfectly, but it looks like it shifted from the glue not being dried.</li>
            <li>thought i would have to pay a lot to have these type of hair clips it doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all, nice stones and very antique look, girls you will be complimented.</li>
            <li>Its rich looking and nothing about it looks cheap.</li>
            <li>this is kind a small one, but it is just perfect, very well made.</li>
            <li>heavy made good and very cute</li>
            <li>I originally got this for when I go to conventions, to compliment my loli dresses.</li>
            <li>Just make sure your hair has a way to be secured up in the style first, before adding this decorative clip.</li>
            <li>Excited to wear.</li>
            <li>All in all, well worth the buy!</li>
            <li>They are so detailed and very pretty.</li>
            <li>Stunning, Your hair will look so beautiful with this clip in it and the workmanship would be hard to beat.</li>
            <li>The package came much earlier than anticipated and the clip itself is beautiful and very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I give this item 5 stars because not only is it beautiful but also very sturdy.</li>
            <li>This was a much better and prettier product at a much cheaper price, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>The purple color is true to the picture</li>
            <li>My sister loved this...used it on her belly dancing costume, said it was much larger than stated</li>
            <li>I think it is made from some kind of soft metal or wiring type?</li>
            <li>Delivery took a little long but great product great price.</li>
            <li>but if u do it carefully then its fine...... otherwise its all good</li>
            <li>got a few like this as a gift for my mom and she loved them!</li>
            <li>Depending on your hair type you might be able to secure some styles with it, but generally speaking it&#x27;s not meant to actually secure a style.</li>
            <li>have black hair and it was wonderful to FINALLY have a clip that looks PERFECT on black hair.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and undamaged.</li>
            <li>, it is really pretty and came quickly considering it came from China!</li>
            <li>Beautiful and does not look cheap its very heavy.</li>
            <li>It looks very nice in my hair and it holds my hair without using any other clips when putting in a bun.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty and well made.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty hair clip.  </li>
            <li>This is very pretty</li>
            <li>So, my advice is, put your hair in its style FIRST and secure with discreet bobby pins or hair elastics, and THEN add on this clip as decoration.  </li>
            <li>This style of clip is meant for decoration moreso than function - you should secure your hair style with bobby pins first</li>
            <li>They are very pretty, I get lots of compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li>It is beautiful but mine came with a stone missing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s beautiful,  well made but a bit on the heavy side.</li>
            <li>beautiful, but quite heavy.</li>
            <li>Absolutely georgeous!!  </li>
            <li>This clip is hella pretty!  </li>
            <li>It is bigger than I thought it was going to be and the quality looks better than in the pic!  </li>
            <li>These are so pretty!</li>
            <li>I bought 2 and plan to wear them when I get married in September!</li>
            <li>a lot bigger, stronger, heavier and more beautiful than I expected.  </li>
            <li>very pretty and vintage looking, the color is a nice deep purple with a vintage silver.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s big -- much larger than I had imagined and the quality is very good too. .  </li>
            <li>On the downside, it you have smooth, straight, silky, hair, this WILL NOT work.</li>
            <li>Hardly worth the garbage</li>
            <li>This is something that I think those in the US such as myself have not been used to (most clips you can buy in store in the US are light aluminum and plastic</li>
            <li>This is fancy enough for formal occasions but also looks nice with jeans for a fancier look.  </li>
            <li>It took a while to get, but worth the wait for the price point.</li>
            <li>Takes a while for delivery but well worth the price.</li>
            <li>This hairpiece is well worth the cost</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>so it help being patient because as they come 1 or 2 at a time that I am so busy enjoying the ones I received and forgot about the others.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth the wait.</li>
            <li>It was a lot of fun tracking my package also.  </li>
            <li>and it sure does a good job with her thick head of hair.  </li>
            <li>This is a beautiful hair clip, though the purple stones were much darker than the picture shows - almost black in some cases.  </li>
            <li>The clip part is crooked on the one I received, but other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>Take it from me, it WILL slide right off.</li>
            <li>it just falls right through.  </li>
            <li>The spring mechanism has just the right amount of tension.  </li>
            <li>lovely, made well  shipped quickly even though quite a distance - lots of sparkle and larger than I anticipated</li>
            <li>I liked it but like with the lovely green one it was too much weight to use in my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>What fun it is to add something so pretty to your wardrobe.</li>
            <li>It is nice and big, and seems to be very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered other hair clips from overseas that either come with pieces that have fallen off or get lost in the mail, but I was very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Very pretty, very well put together.</li>
            <li>Very pretty, well made, reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had some bad experiences with cheap hair clips bought here on Amazon (breaking quickly), but THIS one is awesome!</li>
            <li>Certainly well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>This is a really cute hair clip and sufficient quality considering the very low price point.</li>
            <li>So pretty...  </li>
            <li>I think I will buy some more in different colors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll most likely never wear them.  </li>
            <li>It took like 2 weeks to come in because it was coming from China, but that was the only problem :)</li>
            <li>I love it, although it&#x27;s a bit bigger</li>
            <li>This was a beautiful gift however I expected it to be much smaller.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is so pretty.  </li>
            <li>Up close it is pretty.  </li>
            <li>This is so pretty.  </li>
            <li>this is sooo pretty.. and stays in even wimpy hair like mine....</li>
            <li>I have since ordered more in different styles and colors!  </li>
            <li>Its just as pretty in person, if not prettier, as it is pictured, here.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really pretty.</li>
            <li>It is as pretty as the picture.</li>
            <li>A couple times I have pinned the hair with big bobby pins and then put the clip over top of them.</li>
            <li>The stones seem to match the product picture, but the metal is more of a white gold coloring rather than the silver displayed.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>and they THINK I paid a pretty penny for this item.</li>
            <li>It broke the first week my wife used it.</li>
            <li>I got compliments the first time I wore it out.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t send back because the shipping was going to be more them i paid for them</li>
            <li>Just be aware that it ships from China, so it takes a while to get to you from China.</li>
            <li>I am going to re-purpose it as a broach or something, because it is quite pretty.</li>
            <li>So pretty and vintage looking.</li>
            <li>Exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>Mine is exactly as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy material!</li>
            <li>I am going to buy more in different colors.</li>
            <li>Might be great with someone with thick hair.  </li>
            <li>This clip is simply gorgeous, but it is too heavy to wear in my hair.</li>
            <li>Such a lovely hairpin, I will be enjoying this for a long time to come.</li>
            <li>I ordered several clips from the same vendor and they all are a good deal for the money.  </li>
            <li>Adding a few bobby pins makes it even more secure.</li>
            <li>The hair clip is pretty large - check the measurements.  </li>
            <li>she has beautiful long hair, her hair is very thick and this looks lovely in it.</li>
            <li>The old adage about getting what you pay for is so true.</li>
            <li>A little fragile, but beautiful.</li>
            <li>Well made, not flimsy, and beautifully detailed even on the inside and back with a pretty vine pattern.  </li>
            <li>It is quite large (about 3 inches by 1.5 inches)  but does not pull my hair.  </li>
            <li>Well made, certainly heavier than plastic, so</li>
            <li>this clip might be to heave for short or fine hair</li>
            <li>Much prettier than it seems in the picture.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavier than I imagined, but not so much that it pulls on my hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my mom and she absolutely adores it....</li>
            <li>The metal is so soft, it&#x27;s like putty, but it&#x27;s not even worth it to return.</li>
            <li>Looks bulky but arrived fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks  </li>
            <li>but when it came it really upset me.</li>
            <li>will look very vintage.  </li>
            <li>I really like this clip</li>
            <li>Very well made</li>
            <li>this clilp is very beautiful, but extremely heavy, must use in french braid or such hair style to hold in</li>
            <li>Thanks for this product.</li>
            <li>I really do like it.</li>
            <li>but it is very old-fashioned and dated looking.  </li>
            <li>and thank you so much.  </li>
            <li>THANKS FOR PROMPT DELIVERY</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast as described.</li>
            <li>I have thick, coarse, curly hair, so it is ideal for me.  </li>
            <li>They are direct from china, so the shipping is about a month, but for the price I would buy tons more if I had enough places to wear the,  </li>
            <li>Anything vintage looks good, to me at least.</li>
            <li>It is easily opened with one hand, yet is strong enough to hold without slipping.  </li>
            <li>Better than expected!</li>
            <li>I have long hair and it holds it up just fine</li>
            <li>and what a great price, i was a little impatient waiting for it but worth the wait</li>
            <li>It is a bit on the heavy side but that works perfect for my thick hair.  </li>
            <li>I was so surprise of the size the decent sturdiness &amp; the cuteness of this hair clip just what i always wanted.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend ordering one.  </li>
            <li>Works great for wearing hair up, down, or half up/down.</li>
            <li>I love them and they are beautriful, big and bold but not overly heavy for the size.  </li>
            <li>Mine look a little more reddish purple, but that&#x27;s not a problem for me.</li>
            <li>It is a little bigger than I had anticipated but that is a good thing - I find so many hair clips are just too small.</li>
            <li>NEED LIGHT COLORS LIKE BROWN, PINK, TURQOUISE..</li>
            <li>You definitely get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t worth mailing back.</li>
            <li>i bought a few more</li>
            <li>the hair clip is beautiful, only if it wasn&#x27;t broken when I received it.</li>
            <li>, it falls right out of my hair since my hair is short.</li>
            <li>MUCH LARGER, VERY LARGE, EXTREAMLY LARGE.I can not use any of the items from this seller.</li>
            <li>A little larger than I anticipated but still really nice for a bun or updo.</li>
            <li>I need to buy something new in purple to match it to.</li>
            <li>Very nice, a little heavy.</li>
            <li>Not strong enough to hold up its own weight.  </li>
            <li>She sent me a picture of it in the back of&lt;br /&gt;her hair, she has long thick hair, and she had clipped it in, its large and so so pretty !!!!!  </li>
            <li>This got here really early!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really pretty, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>However, this is not distracting since the focus is definitely on the flower design and the pretty purple color of the &amp;#34;stones.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>All jewels were in tact and the details on the back of the clip are just as pretty as the designs on the front.</li>
            <li>where else can you find such a pretty hair pin?</li>
            <li>Even if you can only wear it for a few times, it is good enough.</li>
            <li>The two prongs on the back make it nice for holding hair up in a twist without even needing bobby pins - put one prong in the twist and the other in the pulled back hair</li>
            <li>Too heavy and not so strong.</li>
            <li>and I could see them maybe sliding out of thin or real fine hair.</li>
            <li>Looks fine but is WAY too heavy.</li>
            <li>I expected cute little hair pins and instead these are quite large and gaudy.  </li>
            <li>This item took a little time to arrive because it came straight out of China, but the clip was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Its not extra fine but certainly not</li>
            <li>Vintage indeed, at least vintage looking :)  </li>
            <li>I sent this to my adult daughter in January for her birthday.  </li>
            <li>It looks far classier than the mainstream US clips you find at the pharmacy, grocery store etc.  </li>
            <li>I wear it frequently.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s so classy looking.</li>
            <li>Got that fixed</li>
            <li>Old fashion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a sucker for things like this and this one is just stunning.</li>
            <li>Received them faster than expected, but they would have been worth the wait regardless.  </li>
            <li>Love the different uses and its not too heavy.</li>
            <li>thing to be aware of is that, being made of metal, it&#x27;s pretty heavy.  </li>
            <li>The clip has a bit of weight to it, so it might not work if you have thin, fine or very straight hair.  </li>
            <li>Love it...except for a small piece of the spring that sticks up and pokes me when I squeeze the clip to open it.</li>
            <li>Makes even an old broad like me feel like a princess.</li>
            <li>Her hair is not thick enough to hold it up.  </li>
            <li>The next time I tried to wear it, one of the large metal prongs you squeeze to open the clip just snapped off.</li>
            <li>very lightweight and only holds a tiny amount of hair...if you can get it to clip/stay on</li>
            <li>/&gt;Similar hair clips cost at least ten times more in my area.</li>
            <li>It is very pretty, but too heavy for my hair, it falls.....</li>
            <li>Choose to wear it the same way you&#x27;d choose your other accessories, such fun, and well made!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s something an older, senior woman, who still has long hair, might like.  </li>
            <li>I would advise it for thicker hair or certainly someone with longer hair so that it would not be too weighty on thin, fine, short hair that might be prone to breakage.  </li>
            <li>Was a little bigger than I expected, but its still a cute clip.  </li>
            <li>Instead, I got something which barely stays on my hair.</li>
            <li>I would have sent it back, but China is too far away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only worn it a couple of times so far, but I get compliments on it every time that I do.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, on sheer looks AND durability, this clip far surpasses ANYTHING I could find in stores in the US.  </li>
            <li>The spring could be a little tighter, but this isn&#x27;t a loose fit by any stretch.</li>
            <li>The clip is pretty and is large enough for my thick hair.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping got it a month sooner than expected!</li>
            <li>The clamp is pretty sturdy and tight.</li>
            <li>but this clip would be quite pretty on black, brown or blonde hair.</li>
            <li>be aware, these are metal and quite heavy...</li>
            <li>Pretty but really heavy</li>
            <li>Pretty but too heavy to be worn in the hair.</li>
            <li>This is gorgeous, however it&#x27;s very uncomfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>Pretty, but heavy and big!!!</li>
            <li>Product is large and HEAVY.  </li>

            <li> grand daughter came to visit me and saw it and just had to wear it</li>
            <li> then I thought, which is okay.</li>
            <li> Got so many comments on it</li>
            <li> Probably my fault for not reading the deminsions better.</li>
            <li> and I find this better and cheaper than the ones I had seen.</li>
            <li> and I have had many, many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> how but the mailman, knew and made sure they both got in her box.  </li>
            <li> but it is lovely.  </li>
            <li> I bought more.....  </li>
            <li> Receive many compliments when I wear them.</li>

            <li> A BULK PRICE FOR MANY COLORS...</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this clip.  </li>
            <li> I had lost my purple one, which was my favorite, so I ordered two to replace it.  </li>
            <li> I wish it came in more colors.</li>
            <li> I have had many compliments on it.  </li>
            <li> her favorite color is purple</li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> Love it, although I had to re purpose it</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes a lovely Broach.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this hair clip.  </li>
            <li> but that happens with most of these things.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering more of these to put in my gift closet to be given when the need arises.  </li>
            <li> Or may be a lil more brighter.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very happy with the piece.</li>
            <li> It is lovely.  </li>
            <li> and I was pleased when it arrived.</li>
            <li> I love them..</li>
            <li> The stones are more of an eggplant shade than shown but it&#x27;s still a stunning piece</li>
            <li> But, I&#x27;m really glad I got it.  </li>
            <li> AND THY ARE LOVELY.</li>
            <li> AND I AM PLEASED AND</li>
            <li> The clip that arrived was more &amp;#34;sangria&amp;#34; color than the purple depicted in the product photo, but it&#x27;s stunning nonetheless.</li>
            <li> Clip itself is okay, just not as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely piece</li>
            <li> Glad I got this for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> I love the look of this</li>
            <li> Better than the picture</li>
            <li> I just love my beautiful new hair clip.</li>
            <li> Just received this for a Christmas present from a friend--absolutely love it !!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  an amazing value for what a unique clip it is.</li>
            <li> I bought several and can&#x27;t pick a favorite, each one is beautiful in it&#x27;s own way.</li>
            <li> pretty, good value and easy to wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d feel comfortable wearing this at work, church or something more formal.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really well made, good quality, and looks it too.  </li>
            <li> I loved it so much that my husband has bought me every one like it that he could find here.</li>
            <li> I bought two other styles of these and the gems were perfect.</li>
            <li> Overall nice quality though with bright purple accent stones.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it will break easily.</li>
            <li> strongly recommend this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong.</li>
            <li> It is such a beautiful piece.  </li>
            <li> Such Beautiful colors.</li>
            <li> Beautiful clip, kind of heavy</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and could not get it to stay in place</li>
            <li> but mine was fine.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fine now.</li>
            <li> and it holds it fine.  </li>
            <li> Very pretty and elegant.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pretty!</li>
            <li> Unless you have a huge amount of hair</li>
            <li> Cheap &amp; &amp;#34;Very Soft&amp;#34;, metal alloy.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all.....</li>
            <li> Cheap but have to take chance.</li>
            <li> cheap.</li>
            <li> It does not look at all cheap and from a distance</li>
            <li> Light weight clips just don&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much</li>
            <li> I get one of these cheap hair things for my wife every couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I twist my hair into a bun and secure it with this.  </li>
            <li> THEY WOULD GET FANTASTIC COMPLIMENTS.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the price was so cheap.  </li>
            <li> There is one stone that isn&#x27;t in place perfectly, but it looks like it shifted from the glue not being dried.</li>
            <li> thought i would have to pay a lot to have these type of hair clips it doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all, nice stones and very antique look, girls you will be complimented.</li>
            <li> Its rich looking and nothing about it looks cheap.</li>
            <li> this is kind a small one, but it is just perfect, very well made.</li>
            <li> heavy made good and very cute</li>
            <li> I originally got this for when I go to conventions, to compliment my loli dresses.</li>
            <li> Just make sure your hair has a way to be secured up in the style first, before adding this decorative clip.</li>
            <li> Excited to wear.</li>
            <li> All in all, well worth the buy!</li>
            <li> They are so detailed and very pretty.</li>
            <li> Stunning, Your hair will look so beautiful with this clip in it and the workmanship would be hard to beat.</li>
            <li> The package came much earlier than anticipated and the clip itself is beautiful and very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I give this item 5 stars because not only is it beautiful but also very sturdy.</li>
            <li> This was a much better and prettier product at a much cheaper price, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> The purple color is true to the picture</li>
            <li> My sister loved this...used it on her belly dancing costume, said it was much larger than stated</li>
            <li> I think it is made from some kind of soft metal or wiring type?</li>
            <li> Delivery took a little long but great product great price.</li>
            <li> but if u do it carefully then its fine...... otherwise its all good</li>
            <li> got a few like this as a gift for my mom and she loved them!</li>
            <li> Depending on your hair type you might be able to secure some styles with it, but generally speaking it&#x27;s not meant to actually secure a style.</li>
            <li> have black hair and it was wonderful to FINALLY have a clip that looks PERFECT on black hair.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and undamaged.</li>
            <li> , it is really pretty and came quickly considering it came from China!</li>
            <li> Beautiful and does not look cheap its very heavy.</li>
            <li> It looks very nice in my hair and it holds my hair without using any other clips when putting in a bun.  </li>
            <li> Very pretty and well made.  </li>
            <li> Very pretty hair clip.  </li>
            <li> This is very pretty</li>
            <li> So, my advice is, put your hair in its style FIRST and secure with discreet bobby pins or hair elastics, and THEN add on this clip as decoration.  </li>
            <li> This style of clip is meant for decoration moreso than function - you should secure your hair style with bobby pins first</li>
            <li> They are very pretty, I get lots of compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> It is beautiful but mine came with a stone missing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful,  well made but a bit on the heavy side.</li>
            <li> beautiful, but quite heavy.</li>
            <li> Absolutely georgeous!!  </li>
            <li> This clip is hella pretty!  </li>
            <li> It is bigger than I thought it was going to be and the quality looks better than in the pic!  </li>
            <li> These are so pretty!</li>
            <li> I bought 2 and plan to wear them when I get married in September!</li>
            <li> a lot bigger, stronger, heavier and more beautiful than I expected.  </li>
            <li> very pretty and vintage looking, the color is a nice deep purple with a vintage silver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s big -- much larger than I had imagined and the quality is very good too. .  </li>
            <li> On the downside, it you have smooth, straight, silky, hair, this WILL NOT work.</li>
            <li> Hardly worth the garbage</li>
            <li> This is something that I think those in the US such as myself have not been used to (most clips you can buy in store in the US are light aluminum and plastic</li>
            <li> This is fancy enough for formal occasions but also looks nice with jeans for a fancier look.  </li>
            <li> It took a while to get, but worth the wait for the price point.</li>
            <li> Takes a while for delivery but well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This hairpiece is well worth the cost</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> so it help being patient because as they come 1 or 2 at a time that I am so busy enjoying the ones I received and forgot about the others.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth the wait.</li>
            <li> It was a lot of fun tracking my package also.  </li>
            <li> and it sure does a good job with her thick head of hair.  </li>
            <li> This is a beautiful hair clip, though the purple stones were much darker than the picture shows - almost black in some cases.  </li>
            <li> The clip part is crooked on the one I received, but other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Take it from me, it WILL slide right off.</li>
            <li> it just falls right through.  </li>
            <li> The spring mechanism has just the right amount of tension.  </li>
            <li> lovely, made well  shipped quickly even though quite a distance - lots of sparkle and larger than I anticipated</li>
            <li> I liked it but like with the lovely green one it was too much weight to use in my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> What fun it is to add something so pretty to your wardrobe.</li>
            <li> It is nice and big, and seems to be very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered other hair clips from overseas that either come with pieces that have fallen off or get lost in the mail, but I was very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Very pretty, very well put together.</li>
            <li> Very pretty, well made, reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some bad experiences with cheap hair clips bought here on Amazon (breaking quickly), but THIS one is awesome!</li>
            <li> Certainly well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> This is a really cute hair clip and sufficient quality considering the very low price point.</li>
            <li> So pretty...  </li>
            <li> I think I will buy some more in different colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll most likely never wear them.  </li>
            <li> It took like 2 weeks to come in because it was coming from China, but that was the only problem :)</li>
            <li> I love it, although it&#x27;s a bit bigger</li>
            <li> This was a beautiful gift however I expected it to be much smaller.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is so pretty.  </li>
            <li> Up close it is pretty.  </li>
            <li> This is so pretty.  </li>
            <li> this is sooo pretty.. and stays in even wimpy hair like mine....</li>
            <li> I have since ordered more in different styles and colors!  </li>
            <li> Its just as pretty in person, if not prettier, as it is pictured, here.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really pretty.</li>
            <li> It is as pretty as the picture.</li>
            <li> A couple times I have pinned the hair with big bobby pins and then put the clip over top of them.</li>
            <li> The stones seem to match the product picture, but the metal is more of a white gold coloring rather than the silver displayed.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> and they THINK I paid a pretty penny for this item.</li>
            <li> It broke the first week my wife used it.</li>
            <li> I got compliments the first time I wore it out.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t send back because the shipping was going to be more them i paid for them</li>
            <li> Just be aware that it ships from China, so it takes a while to get to you from China.</li>
            <li> I am going to re-purpose it as a broach or something, because it is quite pretty.</li>
            <li> So pretty and vintage looking.</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> Mine is exactly as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy material!</li>
            <li> I am going to buy more in different colors.</li>
            <li> Might be great with someone with thick hair.  </li>
            <li> This clip is simply gorgeous, but it is too heavy to wear in my hair.</li>
            <li> Such a lovely hairpin, I will be enjoying this for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> I ordered several clips from the same vendor and they all are a good deal for the money.  </li>
            <li> Adding a few bobby pins makes it even more secure.</li>
            <li> The hair clip is pretty large - check the measurements.  </li>
            <li> she has beautiful long hair, her hair is very thick and this looks lovely in it.</li>
            <li> The old adage about getting what you pay for is so true.</li>
            <li> A little fragile, but beautiful.</li>
            <li> Well made, not flimsy, and beautifully detailed even on the inside and back with a pretty vine pattern.  </li>
            <li> It is quite large (about 3 inches by 1.5 inches)  but does not pull my hair.  </li>
            <li> Well made, certainly heavier than plastic, so</li>
            <li> this clip might be to heave for short or fine hair</li>
            <li> Much prettier than it seems in the picture.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavier than I imagined, but not so much that it pulls on my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and she absolutely adores it....</li>
            <li> The metal is so soft, it&#x27;s like putty, but it&#x27;s not even worth it to return.</li>
            <li> Looks bulky but arrived fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks  </li>
            <li> but when it came it really upset me.</li>
            <li> will look very vintage.  </li>
            <li> I really like this clip</li>
            <li> Very well made</li>
            <li> this clilp is very beautiful, but extremely heavy, must use in french braid or such hair style to hold in</li>
            <li> Thanks for this product.</li>
            <li> I really do like it.</li>
            <li> but it is very old-fashioned and dated looking.  </li>
            <li> and thank you so much.  </li>
            <li> THANKS FOR PROMPT DELIVERY</li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> Very well made.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast as described.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, curly hair, so it is ideal for me.  </li>
            <li> They are direct from china, so the shipping is about a month, but for the price I would buy tons more if I had enough places to wear the,  </li>
            <li> Anything vintage looks good, to me at least.</li>
            <li> It is easily opened with one hand, yet is strong enough to hold without slipping.  </li>
            <li> Better than expected!</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it holds it up just fine</li>
            <li> and what a great price, i was a little impatient waiting for it but worth the wait</li>
            <li> It is a bit on the heavy side but that works perfect for my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I was so surprise of the size the decent sturdiness &amp; the cuteness of this hair clip just what i always wanted.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend ordering one.  </li>
            <li> Works great for wearing hair up, down, or half up/down.</li>
            <li> I love them and they are beautriful, big and bold but not overly heavy for the size.  </li>
            <li> Mine look a little more reddish purple, but that&#x27;s not a problem for me.</li>
            <li> It is a little bigger than I had anticipated but that is a good thing - I find so many hair clips are just too small.</li>
            <li> NEED LIGHT COLORS LIKE BROWN, PINK, TURQOUISE..</li>
            <li> You definitely get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t worth mailing back.</li>
            <li> i bought a few more</li>
            <li> the hair clip is beautiful, only if it wasn&#x27;t broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> , it falls right out of my hair since my hair is short.</li>
            <li> MUCH LARGER, VERY LARGE, EXTREAMLY LARGE.I can not use any of the items from this seller.</li>
            <li> A little larger than I anticipated but still really nice for a bun or updo.</li>
            <li> I need to buy something new in purple to match it to.</li>
            <li> Very nice, a little heavy.</li>
            <li> Not strong enough to hold up its own weight.  </li>
            <li> She sent me a picture of it in the back of&lt;br /&gt;her hair, she has long thick hair, and she had clipped it in, its large and so so pretty !!!!!  </li>
            <li> This got here really early!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really pretty, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> However, this is not distracting since the focus is definitely on the flower design and the pretty purple color of the &amp;#34;stones.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> All jewels were in tact and the details on the back of the clip are just as pretty as the designs on the front.</li>
            <li> where else can you find such a pretty hair pin?</li>
            <li> Even if you can only wear it for a few times, it is good enough.</li>
            <li> The two prongs on the back make it nice for holding hair up in a twist without even needing bobby pins - put one prong in the twist and the other in the pulled back hair</li>
            <li> Too heavy and not so strong.</li>
            <li> and I could see them maybe sliding out of thin or real fine hair.</li>
            <li> Looks fine but is WAY too heavy.</li>
            <li> I expected cute little hair pins and instead these are quite large and gaudy.  </li>
            <li> This item took a little time to arrive because it came straight out of China, but the clip was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Its not extra fine but certainly not</li>
            <li> Vintage indeed, at least vintage looking :)  </li>
            <li> I sent this to my adult daughter in January for her birthday.  </li>
            <li> It looks far classier than the mainstream US clips you find at the pharmacy, grocery store etc.  </li>
            <li> I wear it frequently.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s so classy looking.</li>
            <li> Got that fixed</li>
            <li> Old fashion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for things like this and this one is just stunning.</li>
            <li> Received them faster than expected, but they would have been worth the wait regardless.  </li>
            <li> Love the different uses and its not too heavy.</li>
            <li> thing to be aware of is that, being made of metal, it&#x27;s pretty heavy.  </li>
            <li> The clip has a bit of weight to it, so it might not work if you have thin, fine or very straight hair.  </li>
            <li> Love it...except for a small piece of the spring that sticks up and pokes me when I squeeze the clip to open it.</li>
            <li> Makes even an old broad like me feel like a princess.</li>
            <li> Her hair is not thick enough to hold it up.  </li>
            <li> The next time I tried to wear it, one of the large metal prongs you squeeze to open the clip just snapped off.</li>
            <li> very lightweight and only holds a tiny amount of hair...if you can get it to clip/stay on</li>
            <li> /&gt;Similar hair clips cost at least ten times more in my area.</li>
            <li> It is very pretty, but too heavy for my hair, it falls.....</li>
            <li> Choose to wear it the same way you&#x27;d choose your other accessories, such fun, and well made!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s something an older, senior woman, who still has long hair, might like.  </li>
            <li> I would advise it for thicker hair or certainly someone with longer hair so that it would not be too weighty on thin, fine, short hair that might be prone to breakage.  </li>
            <li> Was a little bigger than I expected, but its still a cute clip.  </li>
            <li> Instead, I got something which barely stays on my hair.</li>
            <li> I would have sent it back, but China is too far away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only worn it a couple of times so far, but I get compliments on it every time that I do.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, on sheer looks AND durability, this clip far surpasses ANYTHING I could find in stores in the US.  </li>
            <li> The spring could be a little tighter, but this isn&#x27;t a loose fit by any stretch.</li>
            <li> The clip is pretty and is large enough for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping got it a month sooner than expected!</li>
            <li> The clamp is pretty sturdy and tight.</li>
            <li> but this clip would be quite pretty on black, brown or blonde hair.</li>
            <li> be aware, these are metal and quite heavy...</li>
            <li> Pretty but really heavy</li>
            <li> Pretty but too heavy to be worn in the hair.</li>
            <li> This is gorgeous, however it&#x27;s very uncomfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> Pretty, but heavy and big!!!</li>
            <li> Product is large and HEAVY.  </li>
            <li> I use this either to pull my hair back into a ponytail or twist my hair in back and use the clip to hold it flat against the back of my head.  </li>
            <li> Listing not clear as to color - it said &amp;#34;multicolor&amp;#34; which I believed to refer to the multiple stone colors.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair and this clip holds it up pretty well.</li>
            <li> It is large but holds my short thick hair where it needs to be.</li>
            <li> It is a very sturdy product, and works, especially if you have thick hair.</li>
            <li> I like this, but it is so similar to the other one that I bought that I thought they had sent me two of the same clip.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend purchasing unless you only plan to wear it once and are careful not to break it.</li>
            <li> It was as advertised but took a long time to receive.</li>
            <li> Quality is rough, one side of the hole that holds the pin together is only halfway done.</li>
            <li> The clip is,&lt;br /&gt;I would describe it, like an alligators mouth, no teeth, opening, long prongs.  </li>
            <li> The reason being that if you use this clip as the only thing holding your hair in its style, then the clip will sort of pull and drag on your hair.  </li>
            <li> , I have long hair and wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else to clip my hair up with...</li>
            <li> It came earlier then expected.</li>
            <li> she has long hair  </li>
            <li> some gems may not be aligned properly, and off center of where they&#x27;re supposed to be glued, giving the feeling that they are hand made and whoever was making them was in a rush.</li>
            <li> It is gorgeous, but worthless to me now.</li>
            <li> only the back if u see in the picture when I clip my hair since its split it get caught sometimes in my hair and kinda mess it up my hair</li>
            <li> She said they both were in her mailbox, but one was in a package inside&lt;br /&gt;a package, and the other was in the inner package just laying in her mailbox.  </li>
            <li> i am very gentle and careful with them even the nicest things get broken</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t measure but it was a little bigger</li>
            <li> It looks a little big when I have it in a pony tail.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that falls to the top ridge of my behind.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bigger than I thought and is heavy, which is why I only gave it 4 stars.  </li>
            <li> Anyway I&#x27;ve had a slight problem in getting it to stay in place even with the assistance of bobbies, and several other sorts of hair pins and gels.</li>
            <li> It is badly made and the many lumps and bumps that it had got a hold of my hair</li>
            <li> Not as sturdy as I expected</li>
            <li> Read the dimentions carefully before you buy-as I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> She is only six and has thin hair to the middle of her back.  </li>
            <li> The clips are big and heavy in weight.</li>
            <li> I also received the clip a lot sooner than I had expected, knowing that things shipped from overseas take longer to arrive.</li>
            <li> Since I was buying it as a gift, for someone who loves purple, this was not really acceptable.</li>
            <li> It just keeps slipping off from hair</li>
            <li> Sturdier than I expected.</li>
            <li> Too heavy and big for my hair to support.</li>
            <li> a large Broach due to part of the&lt;br /&gt;clip being broken when I received</li>
            <li> This was not purple, but burgundy with pink crystals, and although it is still pretty, it&#x27;s too heavy and too weak of a spring to stay in my hair.</li>
            <li> I finally did, loosing a small lock of hair.</li>
            <li> I would recommend based on other pieces like this</li>
            <li> IF YOU HAVE OTHER COLORS...</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers said, the stones are a darker colour than shown.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that big deal if the missing stone is one of small one at least it won&#x27;t be obvious.</li>
            <li> But it was not worth the cost to return.</li>
            <li> /&gt;IN A HURRY, DRESSING DOWN OR UP</li>
            <li> I got a few other theses.  </li>
            <li> BLACK..</li>
            <li> I orderd this one and one in black.</li>
            <li> (All too often clips are either too dark and therefore blend with my hair, or too light-colored and look way too stark on my black hair).  </li>
            <li> the clip on the back is not good, they have to come up with something that works.  </li>
            <li> You would need thick long hair to use it as a hair pin.  </li>
            <li> I have long and thick hair</li>
            <li> The clip isn&#x27;t holding hair as tightly because the spikes on the clip are half-cut.</li>
            <li> The purple is very dark and almost looks black.</li>
            <li> , however there are little snags all over the clip itself that catch in my hair when I try to use it and need to be filed off.</li>
            <li> They are a little heavy</li>
            <li> but so heavy</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s way to heavy to hold.</li>
            <li> too heavy</li>
            <li> Only warning if you have thin hair this won&#x27;t stay in but otherwise the clip holds well.</li>
            <li> It takes a few weeks to get here</li>
            <li> I got a few others when I ordered this one..</li>
            <li> Really heavy.  </li>
            <li> I do not have thin hair but these hair clips were heavy and BIG</li>
            <li> was broken when received and took a long time</li>
            <li> However, the metal is thin, and it has some sharp edges, which I could file down with a metal nail file.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and my hair is a little past my waist.</li>
            <li> Obviously, this is not made with expensive metals.  </li>
            <li> daughter got it this past weekend, Feb 8-9, and loves it.  </li>
            <li> This was a small gift for a friend</li>
            <li> I am not sure.</li>
            <li> not sure what I will do with it...</li>
            <li> but OMG it is heavy!  </li>
            <li> The clip is very heavy, but well made.  </li>
            <li> Very heavy.</li>
            <li> Very heavy and stays in my thick hair well and holds it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not the same colour that I requested, I want the purple one, but i received red with a little purple, it&#x27;s disgusting.</li>
            <li> Big disappointment.</li>
            <li> some reviews complained about the color of the crystals being off</li>
            <li> corse ir thick.</li>
            <li> It feels like it can hold a lot of thick hair.</li>
            <li> And my hair isn&#x27;t that thick.  </li>
            <li> They stay in place for me because my chin-length hair is really thick.</li>
            <li> That works for me because I have thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> Is a bit heavy for thin hair.</li>
            <li> Made for the gal with thick hair.</li>
            <li> SERIOUSLY, I WOULD PUT THIS IN MY STORE IF THEY COULD GIVE ME</li>
            <li> however I&#x27;m disappointed because it has  a missing stone in the center.</li>
            <li> and she is hard to please!  </li>
            <li> If u have shorter or thin hair, this product is not a good choice.</li>
            <li> My hair is very, very thick, but it&#x27;s chin length.</li>
            <li> This was broken and unusable when it arrived.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin, so I wish it were a bit lighter.  </li>
            <li> Poor customer relations.</li>
            <li> It arrived broken.</li>
            <li> I cannot use mine because it is broken but leave it on the counter for decoration.</li>
            <li> So doesn&#x27;t work so well with my thin hair.  </li>
            <li> May be difficult to use on thin hair.</li>
            <li> So now this is useless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so angry cause</li>
            <li> However, everything that I saw was way too expensive until I found this vintage hair clip.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong this beauty.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t wanna be mad all day.</li>
            <li> too bad</li>
            <li> Hugely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed with the product.  </li>
            <li> very disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Cheap &amp; &amp;#34;Very Soft&amp;#34;, metal alloy. Not strong enough to hold up its own weight.  I wish that I had Not purchased 3 of these clips!!!</li>
            <li> Not as sturdy as I expected but it is beautiful. I love it and would buy again!</li>
            <li> Sturdy and beautiful.  Love it.  Has an heirloom look.</li>
            <li> very lightweight and only holds a tiny amount of hair...if you can get it to clip/stay on</li>
            <li> very beautiful and good material.I love it!</li>
            <li> The clip is pretty and is large enough for my thick hair. I wore it for my sister&#x27;s wedding. The next time I tried to wear it, one of the large metal prongs you squeeze to open the clip just snapped off. The metal is very cheap and pliable. I would not recommend purchasing unless you only plan to wear it once and are careful not to break it.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and well made.  Certainly well worth the price.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this trinket. Only reason i gave 4 not 5 star is the fact i have medium length, wavey to curly hair. Its not extra fine but certainly not corse ir thick. Anyway I&#x27;ve had a slight problem in getting it to stay in place even with the assistance of bobbies, and several other sorts of hair pins and gels.</li>
            <li> Absolutely georgeous!!  Can&#x27;t wait to wear!!!</li>
            <li> Much prettier than it seems in the picture. On the downside, it you have smooth, straight, silky, hair, this WILL NOT work. Take it from me, it WILL slide right off. You don&#x27;t wanna be mad all day.</li>
            <li> Beautiful clip, kind of heavy so it doesn&#x27;t stay well in thinner hair.</li>
            <li> This hair clip is HUGE, and it weighs a ton!!!, so unless that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> I was expecting something different which would have held my hair. Instead, I got something which barely stays on my hair. Too heavy and not so strong. I cannot use it. It looks good, no doubt about that, but.. unpractical for me. I would have sent it back, but China is too far away.</li>
            <li> This was broken and unusable when it arrived. No instructions on how to return, or even if you could return. Price is cheap and delivery was faster than stated, but none of that does any good if you can&#x27;t use the product.</li>
            <li> Beautiful! I was very happy with the way it was made and how it looked!</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful and more beautiful than described and pictured.  I ordered several clips from the same vendor and they all are a good deal for the money.  Received them faster than expected, but they would have been worth the wait regardless.  Makes an excellent gift and people will think you spent a lot more than you did!</li>
            <li> Very beautiful, but large!  Read the dimentions carefully before you buy-as I didn&#x27;t.  You would need thick long hair to use it as a hair pin.  My daughter said she will use it as a scarf clip instead.&lt;br /&gt;The price is good, delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> This clip is simply gorgeous, but it is too heavy to wear in my hair. So, I wear it clipped onto a jacket.</li>
            <li> Just received this for a Christmas present from a friend--absolutely love it !!!</li>
            <li> they were beautiful i&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> love it, great for the price</li>
            <li> Stunning beautiful! Good quality!</li>
            <li> Lovely Vintage Jewelry Crystal Hair Clips...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sturdy..... however I&#x27;m disappointed because it has  a missing stone in the center. It&#x27;s not that big deal if the missing stone is one of small one at least it won&#x27;t be obvious.</li>
            <li> I love this cute purple for hair clip.... I like this design and it doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all..... everything is good... only the back if u see in the picture when I clip my hair since its split it get caught sometimes in my hair and kinda mess it up my hair but if u do it carefully then its fine...... otherwise its all good</li>
            <li> Very pretty hair clip.  It was as advertised but took a long time to receive.</li>
            <li> Quality is rough, one side of the hole that holds the pin together is only halfway done. Cheap but have to take chance.</li>
            <li> I liked it but like with the lovely green one it was too much weight to use in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It would be nice if size and weight could be added to the sales info.</li>
            <li> VERY sturdy and VERY beautiful!!! I&#x27;ve had some bad experiences with cheap hair clips bought here on Amazon (breaking quickly), but THIS one is awesome!</li>
            <li> Vintage indeed, at least vintage looking :)  This is a really cute hair clip and sufficient quality considering the very low price point.</li>
            <li> So pretty...  be aware, these are metal and quite heavy...</li>
            <li> Good looking but so heavy it just falls right through.  Unless you have a huge amount of hair it&#x27;s way to heavy to hold.</li>
            <li> Does a great job holding all my hair up just like a claw clip would, just this looks classier!</li>
            <li> I just love my beautiful new hair clip. It is well made and is just so cute. I can&#x27;t say enough about it. I can&#x27;t wait to wear it. I need to buy something new in purple to match it to. I think I will buy some more in different colors. What fun it is to add something so pretty to your wardrobe. Thanks.</li>
            <li> This got here really early! It&#x27;s beautiful! &amp; great size!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous, just like the picture.  Well made, not flimsy, and beautifully detailed even on the inside and back with a pretty vine pattern.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Obviously, this is not made with expensive metals.  But for the price, it looks very nice.  It looks more expensive than it is.</li>
            <li> I really love it! its beautiful!!</li>
            <li> Nice touch when getting my hair &amp;#34;up&amp;#34; and out of the way</li>
            <li> Love it Very beautiful</li>
            <li> This is beautiful and the quality is excellent. I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it. I will order from this company again. They deserve 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This clip is great. I&#x27;ve ordered other hair clips from overseas that either come with pieces that have fallen off or get lost in the mail, but I was very satisfied with this purchase. The package came much earlier than anticipated and the clip itself is beautiful and very sturdy. It&#x27;s heavier than I imagined, but not so much that it pulls on my hair. It feels like it can hold a lot of thick hair. My hair is fine, but it still holds perfectly. I&#x27;ve only worn it a couple of times so far, but I get compliments on it every time that I do.  It&#x27;s  an amazing value for what a unique clip it is.</li>
            <li> Very nice and beautiful holds hair in place all day long. Looks expensive and elegant.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and holds my hair great value for the price.</li>
            <li> Love these vintage jewelry.</li>
            <li> Pretty, but heavy and big!!!</li>
            <li> Looks fine but is WAY too heavy. I did not know it was this big, it falls right out of my hair since my hair is short. So now this is useless.</li>
            <li> This was even more beautiful than it was on the website.&lt;br /&gt;My grand daughter came to visit me and saw it and just had to wear it so I did a updo for her and put this in her hair and she said she feels like a princess.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this product. It fits nicely in my hair and doesn&#x27;t cause any problems. I originally got this for when I go to conventions, to compliment my loli dresses. It is a very sturdy product, and works, especially if you have thick hair. If you have thinner hair, however, you may have some problems with it.</li>
            <li> I expected cute little hair pins and instead these are quite large and gaudy.  I&#x27;ll most likely never wear them.  Big disappointment.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely and expensive looking hair ornament.</li>
            <li> I give this item 5 stars because not only is it beautiful but also very sturdy. Very great quality for the price.</li>
            <li> LOVED THOSE CLIPS BEAUTIFUL</li>
            <li> Just to big, items were MUCH LARGER, VERY LARGE, EXTREAMLY LARGE.I can not use any of the items from this seller. I do not have thin hair but these hair clips were heavy and BIG so they pulled my hair out wile they were falling off my head. Color was maroon not purple.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and she absolutely adores it....and she is hard to please!  It is such a beautiful piece.  It took like 2 weeks to come in because it was coming from China, but that was the only problem :)</li>
            <li> cheap. Garbage. Crumbled in my hand-literally!! Couldn&#x27;t even use it. The metal is so soft, it&#x27;s like putty, but it&#x27;s not even worth it to return. Hardly worth the garbage can I threw it in.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter, she loves it. Nice size and shiny!</li>
            <li> Looks bulky but arrived fast.</li>
            <li> This is even more beautiful in person. I love it, although it&#x27;s a bit bigger then I thought, which is okay.</li>
            <li> Beautiful hair clip, the colors are amazing and it looks great. Works great for wearing hair up, down, or half up/down. Love the different uses and its not too heavy.</li>
            <li> This clip was great and pretty. Got so many comments on it and it held my hair in place. Thanks  great buy</li>
            <li> Product is large and HEAVY.  Probably my fault for not reading the deminsions better. If u have shorter or thin hair, this product is not a good choice.</li>
            <li> This was a beautiful gift however I expected it to be much smaller.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful and looks great!  I have compared it with the ones at the stores and I find this better and cheaper than the ones I had seen.</li>
            <li> Item arrived as promised. The clip isn&#x27;t holding hair as tightly because the spikes on the clip are half-cut. Overall nice quality though with bright purple accent stones.</li>
            <li> This piece broke as soon as I touched it ! was it sitting under the sun for years before I saved it ? too bad I loved it on the screen but when it came it really upset me.</li>
            <li> was broken when received and took a long time</li>
            <li> Then it broke after wearing it twice.  And my hair isn&#x27;t that thick.  Hugely disappointed.  It is gorgeous, but worthless to me now.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter she has beautiful long hair, her hair is very thick and this looks lovely in it.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed with the product.  It is badly made and the many lumps and bumps that it had got a hold of my hair and I could not get it off.  I finally did, loosing a small lock of hair. Will never buy form this seller again.</li>
            <li> very pretty and vintage looking, the color is a nice deep purple with a vintage silver. looks nice for any occasion</li>
            <li> This is very pretty and I have had many, many compliments on it. Everyone asks me where I purchase my clips.</li>
            <li> too heavy I have fine hair and could not get it to stay in place but it made a great gift</li>
            <li> The prettiest of my three hair pins. Clips well when I have my hair pinned up.</li>
            <li> LOVELY VINTAGE JEWELRY knew what they were doing when the named this BEAUTIFUL Hair Clip Hairpin. It is sturdily built and is indeed a head turner. I love it.</li>
            <li> I sent this to my adult daughter in January for her birthday.  It took about 6 weeks to arrive which I didn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;plan on, it came from Hong Kong.  I found out all this when I wrote the seller about 2-3 weeks after ordering.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter got it this past weekend, Feb 8-9, and loves it.  She sent me a picture of it in the back of&lt;br /&gt;her hair, she has long thick hair, and she had clipped it in, its large and so so pretty !!!!!  The clip is,&lt;br /&gt;I would describe it, like an alligators mouth, no teeth, opening, long prongs.  She said it stayed put too.&lt;br /&gt;It is so pretty.  I ordered her another one at the same time.  The seller I found out was the same person&lt;br /&gt;under a different &amp;#34;company name&amp;#34;.  She said they both were in her mailbox, but one was in a package inside&lt;br /&gt;a package, and the other was in the inner package just laying in her mailbox.  Both were in very good condtion.&lt;br /&gt;She was puzzled, but very happy with both.  I wonder if the seller mailed them both and one got separated&lt;br /&gt;some how but the mailman, knew and made sure they both got in her box.  Interesting.&lt;br /&gt;Karen</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t know what to expect from something so inexpensive but it is really beautiful.  the quality is remarkable and looks like the picture. some reviews complained about the color of the crystals being off but mine was fine.  one thing though, it is bigger than I thought it would be. not a drawback because it is a festive clip. it was a pleasant surprise. strongly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Love the hair clip! Have had several complements on it.</li>
            <li> It looks detailed and will look great in the sun. I didn&#x27;t measure but it was a little bigger then I had thought it would be. [like I said, I should&#x27;ve measured] but it&#x27;s really pretty, especially for the price. Will make a great gift.</li>
            <li> beautiful... very pretty - shipped in a timely manner... will be wearing this for a wedding... great cost</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so angry cause the it&#x27;s not the same colour that I requested, I want the purple one, but i received red with a little purple, it&#x27;s disgusting.</li>
            <li> The color might be a bit redder purple than what is on your screen but it is lovely.  It does not look at all cheap and from a distance will look very vintage.  Up close it is pretty.  I would recommend based on other pieces like this I have seen or purchased.</li>
            <li> This clip is gorgeous.  It&#x27;s really well made, good quality, and looks it too.  The fact of it being from an overseas seller wasn&#x27;t a problem for me, especially as it arrived well before the stated timeframe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have black hair and it was wonderful to FINALLY have a clip that looks PERFECT on black hair.  (All too often clips are either too dark and therefore blend with my hair, or too light-colored and look way too stark on my black hair).  This clip is truly stunning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to be aware of is that, being made of metal, it&#x27;s pretty heavy.  So, my advice is, put your hair in its style FIRST and secure with discreet bobby pins or hair elastics, and THEN add on this clip as decoration.  The reason being that if you use this clip as the only thing holding your hair in its style, then the clip will sort of pull and drag on your hair.  This is something that I think those in the US such as myself have not been used to (most clips you can buy in store in the US are light aluminum and plastic so you don&#x27;t have that issue).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, on sheer looks AND durability, this clip far surpasses ANYTHING I could find in stores in the US.  This was a much better and prettier product at a much cheaper price, in my opinion.  It looks far classier than the mainstream US clips you find at the pharmacy, grocery store etc.  Just make sure your hair has a way to be secured up in the style first, before adding this decorative clip.</li>
            <li> quality is not that great</li>
            <li> This was not purple, but burgundy with pink crystals, and although it is still pretty, it&#x27;s too heavy and too weak of a spring to stay in my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice piece.  I would recommend it  My hair is thin, so I wish it were a bit lighter.  For thicker hair it is prefect.</li>
            <li> This is so pretty.  Very heavy and stays in my thick hair well and holds it.  Light weight clips just don&#x27;t do the job. This is fancy enough for formal occasions but also looks nice with jeans for a fancier look.  Great value for your $$$</li>
            <li> I really like this clip, however there are little snags all over the clip itself that catch in my hair when I try to use it and need to be filed off.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a hair clip that will look good for my wedding. However, everything that I saw was way too expensive until I found this vintage hair clip.  It looks beautiful and I know is going to look great!</li>
            <li> These are Beautiful hair clips, they are made strong and hold well, I have long hair and wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else to clip my hair up with...Such Beautiful colors. Every where I go strangers stop and ask me, where did you get that hair clip.</li>
            <li> this is sooo pretty.. and stays in even wimpy hair like mine.... I liked it so much I bought more.....  yes I A FASHIONISTA...</li>
            <li> I ordered something entirely different. But it was not worth the cost to return.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Beautiful hair clip of a good weight to hold the hair, I have received a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and elegant.  I wear it frequently.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and well constructed.  I bought several of these in different colors.  Receive many compliments when I wear them.</li>
            <li> This clip is hella pretty!  It is bigger than I thought it was going to be and the quality looks better than in the pic!  I bought it for my mom for Christmas and it looks amazing in her hair.  It took a while to get, but worth the wait for the price point.</li>
            <li> This is so gorgeous. It matches the dress I wanted it t o wear with perfectly.  And it&#x27;s so classy looking.</li>
            <li> It is beautiful but mine came with a stone missing.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite. A great clip that hold well, shipping on time and a most beautiful, colorful design. Much better than the photo. The customer service is greasy. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I ordered 7 of these for the girls in my daughters wedding party!  They are stunning!  I could not be more pleased with the quality and beauty!  I have since ordered more in different styles and colors!  Can&#x27;t wait to receive them.</li>
            <li> Very nice, a little heavy. I get one of these cheap hair things for my wife every couple of weeks. Takes a while for delivery but well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I bought the clip as a gift to be used as a scarf clip with a lavender/purple scarf and it looks beautiful on the recipient.</li>
            <li> Great clip and good price. The purple is very dark and almost looks black.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter.  She is only six and has thin hair to the middle of her back.  Her hair is not thick enough to hold it up.  The clip is very heavy, but well made.  Its just as pretty in person, if not prettier, as it is pictured, here.  I have very thick hair that falls to the top ridge of my behind.  I twist my hair into a bun and secure it with this.  I loved it so much that my husband has bought me every one like it that he could find here.</li>
            <li> I FOUND THIS TO BE GOOD QUALITY, NICE AND LARGE AND VERY BEAUTIFUL. GREAT FOR WHEN YOURE ON THE GO&lt;br /&gt;IN A HURRY, DRESSING DOWN OR UP OR IN BETWEEN, ITS GREAT FOR GIRLS THAT DONT KNOW HOW TO DO THEIR HAIR FANCY, OR HAVE THE TIME, OR ARE TOM BOYS... THEY WOULD GET FANTASTIC COMPLIMENTS. SERIOUSLY, I WOULD PUT THIS IN MY STORE IF THEY COULD GIVE ME A BULK PRICE FOR MANY COLORS... IF I BOUGHT 20... LOVE LOVE LOVE SO IMPRESSED I SENT PICTURES ON MY STORE. I WOULD SELL IF I COULD GET AFFORDABLY IN BULK AT MY STORE, BECAUSE I HAVE TO CHARGE A FEE TO MAKE $ MYSELF AND OVERHEAD COSTS... GOD BLESS AND PROSPERITY SENT YOUR WAY AS I BRAG ON THIS AND WILL BUY ANOTHER IF YOU HAVE OTHER COLORS... NEED LIGHT COLORS LIKE BROWN, PINK, TURQOUISE.. BLACK..</li>
            <li> It was a hit with my sister who loves purple.  Very well made</li>
            <li> The pin itself is very pretty, but the quality is abominable!! I used this one time, it wouldn&#x27;t stay in my hair and broke! It wasn&#x27;t even made metal!  The old adage about getting what you pay for is so true. I should have known better!</li>
            <li> These are so pretty! Makes even an old broad like me feel like a princess.</li>
            <li> You have to see this to appreciate it.  It&#x27;s really pretty.</li>
            <li> Stunning, Your hair will look so beautiful with this clip in it and the workmanship would be hard to beat. You can&#x27;t go wrong this beauty.</li>
            <li> This item took a little time to arrive because it came straight out of China, but the clip was worth the wait. It is as pretty as the picture. The clips are big and heavy in weight. I bought two to clip my hair at the crown of my head.  They stay in place for me because my chin-length hair is really thick. A couple times I have pinned the hair with big bobby pins and then put the clip over top of them.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my daughter inlaw and she loves them. They are beautiful and well made. Delivery took a little long but great product great price.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this clip.  I have it in three different colors.  I had lost my purple one, which was my favorite, so I ordered two to replace it.  I use this either to pull my hair back into a ponytail or twist my hair in back and use the clip to hold it flat against the back of my head.  The spring mechanism has just the right amount of tension.  It is easily opened with one hand, yet is strong enough to hold without slipping.  The clip has a bit of weight to it, so it might not work if you have thin, fine or very straight hair.  I have thick, coarse, curly hair, so it is ideal for me.  I wish it came in more colors.</li>
            <li> Incredible for the price. It is a bit on the heavy side but that works perfect for my thick hair.  Craftsmanship is well done and it looks like an heirloom piece.</li>
            <li> This hairpiece is well worth the cost and I will be buying more for me and the girls at work!</li>
            <li> Very beautiful!  It looks very nice in my hair and it holds my hair without using any other clips when putting in a bun.  I have thick hair and my hair is a little past my waist. I can&#x27;t believe the price was so cheap.  It looks more expensive.  I have had many compliments on it.  It came earlier then expected. I would highly recommend ordering one.  It also makes a great gift.</li>
            <li> Love it...except for a small piece of the spring that sticks up and pokes me when I squeeze the clip to open it. Got that fixed and it&#x27;s fine now.</li>
            <li> Nice hair clip like the size of this one I got I for daughter her favorite color is purple she has long hair  this clip might be to heave for short or fine hair</li>
            <li> This is a gorgeous piece. Well worth the money.  Only warning if you have thin hair this won&#x27;t stay in but otherwise the clip holds well. Love it have ordered two others</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful hair clip, though the purple stones were much darker than the picture shows - almost black in some cases.  It stays in the hair well, but is probably best for someone with thicker hair.  The two prongs on the back make it nice for holding hair up in a twist without even needing bobby pins - put one prong in the twist and the other in the pulled back hair and it holds it fine.  Adding a few bobby pins makes it even more secure. It gives a very elegant look.</li>
            <li> You definitely get your money&#x27;s worth. It&#x27;s beautiful,  well made but a bit on the heavy side. That works for me because I have thick, curly hair. I think it would work for anyone if you put it above a ponytail or bun. This was a great buy, I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> Beautiful. I was amazed by the quality and beauty of this piece. Great for price. Old fashion. Oriental style. Excited to wear. Is a bit heavy for thin hair.</li>
            <li> got a few like this as a gift for my mom and she loved them! this one is very lovely and looks great on her</li>
            <li> Beautiful metal clip with lovely stones. Arrived quickly and undamaged. I would happily order again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similar hair clips cost at least ten times more in my area.</li>
            <li> Love it, although I had to re purpose it&lt;br /&gt;into a large Broach due to part of the&lt;br /&gt;clip being broken when I received it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes a lovely Broach.</li>
            <li> beautiful, but quite heavy.</li>
            <li> I like this, but it is so similar to the other one that I bought that I thought they had sent me two of the same clip. In the picture they look completely different.</li>
            <li> This is very beautiful, however it broke before I took it out of wrapper. I still gave it as a gift, but apologized for breaking it. It was kinda flimsy and this time I did get what I paid for. It wasn&#x27;t worth mailing back.</li>
            <li> This clip is gorgeous! It is big enough that I can put my hair up on my head and use this clip to hold it. I am really happy with it!</li>
            <li> this clilp is very beautiful, but extremely heavy, must use in french braid or such hair style to hold in</li>
            <li> I LOVE this hair clip.  The purple stones are so beautiful. It&#x27;s so well made........and I get many compliments when it&#x27;s in my hair!!!  I have purchased several of this seller&#x27;s hair ornaments/clips!!!</li>
            <li> I have to say that this is a very nice hair clip. The stones seem to match the product picture, but the metal is more of a white gold coloring rather than the silver displayed. It is nice and big, and seems to be very sturdy. I also received the clip a lot sooner than I had expected, knowing that things shipped from overseas take longer to arrive. It only took about 2.5 weeks for me to receive the clip. Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This piece is freaking gorgeous!  I LOVE it!  The hair clip is pretty large - check the measurements.  However, it is so durable, well made, and beautiful.  I bought 2 and plan to wear them when I get married in September!</li>
            <li> Soooooooo beautiful! I gave this as a gift and they THINK I paid a pretty penny for this item. Why tell them different.............Its rich looking and nothing about it looks cheap. Thanks for this product. I really do like it. And so does the person I gave it too.</li>
            <li> I was so surprise of the size the decent sturdiness &amp; the cuteness of this hair clip just what i always wanted. thought i would have to pay a lot to have these type of hair clips it doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all, nice stones and very antique look, girls you will be complimented. i recommend. and what a great price, i was a little impatient waiting for it but worth the wait i bought a few more so it help being patient because as they come 1 or 2 at a time that I am so busy enjoying the ones I received and forgot about the others. i am very gentle and careful with them even the nicest things get broken</li>
            <li> a lot bigger, stronger, heavier and more beautiful than I expected.  I got a few other theses.  They are direct from china, so the shipping is about a month, but for the price I would buy tons more if I had enough places to wear the,  Just beautiful and functional!</li>
            <li> This barrett is prettier than its picture. It&#x27;s built solid. Recommend for thicker hair. Can&#x27;t wait to wear it.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t received it yet. Im sure there very nice.</li>
            <li> pretty, good value and easy to wear.</li>
            <li> I love this! It&#x27;s beautiful!</li>
            <li> this is kind a small one, but it is just perfect, very well made. beautiful.</li>
            <li> its a beautiful item but the clip on the back is not good, they have to come up with something that works.  It broke the first week my wife used it.</li>
            <li> the hair clip is beautiful, only if it wasn&#x27;t broken when I received it. very disappointed. I don&#x27;t recommend ordering it.</li>
            <li> What a lovely surprise!  I didn&#x27;t expect it to be as nice as it is.  It&#x27;s big -- much larger than I had imagined and the quality is very good too. .  I&#x27;d feel comfortable wearing this at work, church or something more formal.  The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about it is it tends to get tangled in my hair but that happens with most of these things.  I&#x27;ll be ordering more of these to put in my gift closet to be given when the need arises.  It takes a few weeks to get here but it&#x27;s worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Pretty but really heavy</li>
            <li> A little fragile, but beautiful.</li>
            <li> week metal, will break in your hands.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and made well</li>
            <li> Very pretty, very well put together.</li>
            <li> Great clip, very pretty.  The clip part is crooked on the one I received, but other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous. I have long hair and it holds it up just fine</li>
            <li> Very stunning and beautiful.</li>
            <li> This piece is well made but it is very old-fashioned and dated looking.  It&#x27;s something an older, senior woman, who still has long hair, might like.  It seems to be in that age category.</li>
            <li> Almost looks the same as in picture. Or may be a lil more brighter. Shines perfectly , looks worth the price. Nice buy!</li>
            <li> heavy made good and very cute</li>
            <li> Gorgeous!!! Better than expected! Great prices and amazing products! Will definitely buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> This is a great clip. It is quite large (about 3 inches by 1.5 inches)  but does not pull my hair.  I got compliments the first time I wore it out. The purple color is true to the picture but I will say the metal color is slightly different in person.  The metal is a brassy silver color.  However, this is not distracting since the focus is definitely on the flower design and the pretty purple color of the &amp;#34;stones.&amp;#34;  Overall, I am very happy with the piece. I have auburn hair but this clip would be quite pretty on black, brown or blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and does not look cheap its very heavy. Fast shipping got it a month sooner than expected!</li>
            <li> It is lovely.  Simple and does the trick.  This was a small gift for a friend and I was pleased when it arrived. It looks exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Was a little bigger than I expected, but its still a cute clip.  It looks a little big when I have it in a pony tail.</li>
            <li> wish I had it to review it</li>
            <li> I get compliments on this clip all the time. I have thick, curly hair and this clip holds it up pretty well. It&#x27;s strong.</li>
            <li> the color wasn&#x27;t as purple as the picture showed, it was really BIG !!! I didn&#x27;t send back because the shipping was going to be more them i paid for them</li>
            <li> These are beautiful hair clips and looked exactly as they are pictured on line.  They came three (3) three weeks ahead of schedule.  I love them and they are beautriful, big and bold but not overly heavy for the size.  I will definitely order from this company in china again.  and thank you so much.  It was a lot of fun tracking my package also.  My clips have been all over the place.</li>
            <li> When I received it... It was,packaged well..  And it&#x27;s beautiful !!!I love them.. I got a few others when I ordered this one.. They are also beautiful</li>
            <li> Beautiful beautiful, will buy again from this co.</li>
            <li> lovely, made well  shipped quickly even though quite a distance - lots of sparkle and larger than I anticipated</li>
            <li> This hair clip is just beautiful! The stones are more of an eggplant shade than shown but it&#x27;s still a stunning piece and I&#x27;m thrilled with it! It is a little bigger than I had anticipated but that is a good thing - I find so many hair clips are just too small. The overall length is about 3.5 inches, and the width of the flower is about 2.5 inches across. This style of clip is meant for decoration moreso than function - you should secure your hair style with bobby pins first then you add the clip as a finishing touch. Depending on your hair type you might be able to secure some styles with it, but generally speaking it&#x27;s not meant to actually secure a style.</li>
            <li> My sister loved this...used it on her belly dancing costume, said it was much larger than stated and she got compliments on it...total bargain and shipped in a timely manner.  Would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> This is beautiful.  It&#x27;s a little bigger than I thought and is heavy, which is why I only gave it 4 stars.  But, I&#x27;m really glad I got it.  Just be aware that it ships from China, so it takes a while to get to you from China.</li>
            <li> It is beautiful and looks of nice quality when in use. It is large but holds my short thick hair where it needs to be. The clamp is pretty sturdy and tight. I don&#x27;t think it will break easily.</li>
            <li> This is gorgeous, however it&#x27;s very uncomfortable to wear. It&#x27;s heavy and no matter how I&#x27;ve positioned it or how much hair I attempt to clip, it pulls and tugs. My hair is very, very thick, but it&#x27;s chin length. Perhaps this would work well if your hair was already secured in an updo. I am going to re-purpose it as a broach or something, because it is quite pretty.</li>
            <li> beautiful, but to clip on my hair.</li>
            <li> I RECIEVED MY HAIR CLIPS TODAY AND THY ARE LOVELY. THANKS FOR PROMPT DELIVERY AND I AM PLEASED AND WOULD ORDER AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Great I love it&lt;br /&gt;For the price it is a great</li>
            <li> Beautiful quality, great craftsmanship. The clip that arrived was more &amp;#34;sangria&amp;#34; color than the purple depicted in the product photo, but it&#x27;s stunning nonetheless. The metal is a sort-of antiqued brass with intricate detailing. The spring could be a little tighter, but this isn&#x27;t a loose fit by any stretch. Note: This is about 3-4&amp;#34; in length.</li>
            <li> So pretty and vintage looking. A little larger than I anticipated but still really nice for a bun or updo. All jewels were in tact and the details on the back of the clip are just as pretty as the designs on the front.</li>
            <li> Listing not clear as to color - it said &amp;#34;multicolor&amp;#34; which I believed to refer to the multiple stone colors. The clip I received was maroon, rather than purple. Since I was buying it as a gift, for someone who loves purple, this was not really acceptable. Others have stated the same thing. I even sent them a picture of what I received and they still insisted it was purple... Poor customer relations. Clip itself is okay, just not as advertised.</li>
            <li> I orderd this one and one in black. They are so detailed and very pretty. They are a little heavy and I could see them maybe sliding out of thin or real fine hair. I have long and thick hair and they work great for me. I will be ordering in more colors when I find them!</li>
            <li> some gems may not be aligned properly, and off center of where they&#x27;re supposed to be glued, giving the feeling that they are hand made and whoever was making them was in a rush. I bought two other styles of these and the gems were perfect.</li>
            <li> Another beautiful hair clip. I bought several and can&#x27;t pick a favorite, each one is beautiful in it&#x27;s own way. It is one heck of a simply beautiful piece of art.</li>
            <li> I love this hairclip, I bought two of them, and they arrived on time, nicely wrapped in bubble wrap so they were undamaged and in perfect condition. They are very pretty, I get lots of compliments when I wear it. Like other reviewers said, the stones are a darker colour than shown. Mine look a little more reddish purple, but that&#x27;s not a problem for me. It&#x27;s beautiful, and great quality for a low price. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Thank you for your prompted service. Such a lovely hairpin, I will be enjoying this for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> It just keeps slipping off from hair</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured. Very heavy.</li>
            <li> I received my clip 2 weeks after I placed the order. Mine is exactly as shown in the picture. Its very beautiful. There is one stone that isn&#x27;t in place perfectly, but it looks like it shifted from the glue not being dried. All in all, well worth the buy! I wish they had this one in more colors!</li>
            <li> This is a lovely piece and I am quite thrilled with the quality and how quickly I received it! Thank-you</li>
            <li> This is really nice. Sturdier than I expected.</li>
            <li> Glad I got this for my daughter.  She has to keep her hair up and it sure does a good job with her thick head of hair.  A good gift.</li>
            <li> Very pretty, well made, reasonably priced. May be difficult to use on thin hair.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and holds my hair all day very securely</li>
            <li> I gave an extra star because the seller promply refunded my money. It arrived broken. It looks really nice for the price. However, the metal is thin, and it has some sharp edges, which I could file down with a metal nail file. I think it is made from some kind of soft metal or wiring type? I am not sure. Again for $2, where else can you find such a pretty hair pin? Even if you can only wear it for a few times, it is good enough. I cannot use mine because it is broken but leave it on the counter for decoration.</li>
            <li> I really like this, it is really pretty and came quickly considering it came from China!</li>
            <li> Too heavy and big for my hair to support.</li>
            <li> It is very pretty, but too heavy for my hair, it falls.....not sure what I will do with it...</li>
            <li> Anything vintage looks good, to me at least. I&#x27;m a sucker for things like this and this one is just stunning. Very very beautiful on my hair. I love it!</li>
            <li> This is so beautiful! Very well made. Very sturdy material! Made for the gal with thick hair. Going to order several others as gifts!</li>
            <li> Arrived fast as described. This is a beautiful hair clip and well made. I am going to buy more in different colors.</li>
            <li> Pretty but too heavy to be worn in the hair.</li>
            <li> I love the look of this but OMG it is heavy!  I can&#x27;t use it to put my hair up but I can put it in after it is up.</li>
            <li> Really heavy.  So doesn&#x27;t work so well with my thin hair.  Might be great with someone with thick hair.  It&#x27;s very pretty!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice piece.  I Think it&#x27;S A Steal. Better than the picture</li>
            <li> This is just a beautiful and unique clip you won&#x27;t see anywhere else at a wonderful price.  If you love your hair, you&#x27;ll appreciate this &amp;#34;hair jewelry&amp;#34;!  Well made, certainly heavier than plastic, so I would advise it for thicker hair or certainly someone with longer hair so that it would not be too weighty on thin, fine, short hair that might be prone to breakage.  Choose to wear it the same way you&#x27;d choose your other accessories, such fun, and well made!  Photos don&#x27;t do it justice, great value for the price.</li>
