            <li>Very nice pre-shave soap, made for a very smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>Nice lather, nice smell, good at prepping my face for a nice shave.</li>
            <li>What it DOES do is clean your face and prepare your beard so that your shaving cream or soap will be more effective; in this regard it is excellent, and you should try it; it lasts forever as well.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells strong but works great.</li>
            <li>I use this before shaving and it is amazing...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll leave your skin and beard nicely hydrated.</li>
            <li>I bought this for a pre-shave warm wash on the recommendation from Sharpologist.</li>
            <li>, well he&#x27;ll have to order his own.</li>
            <li>The scent of the soap is light and refreshing and it makes your beard and skin feel great.  </li>
            <li>The lime fragrance is pleasant and rather unique.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve waited almost a month after purchasing this product to give a good full review.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:</li>
            <li>People love this soap in the shaving community</li>
            <li>I love it and even turned my daughter on to it for shaving her legs.</li>
            <li>Your morning can&#x27;t start any better.</li>
            <li>But I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Well, before I answer that question, let me say that I&#x27;m a handsome man.  </li>
            <li>Think &amp;#34;faint industrial cleanser scent.&amp;#34;  Not terrible....</li>
            <li>How the heck is my wife gonna kiss my handsome pie hole when I&#x27;m all irritated?  </li>
            <li>Better prep equals better results.</li>
            <li>I feel like it does a good job, but it doesn&#x27;t obviously stand out as great.</li>
            <li>a towel will take most of the glyce</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more like Lime Zest than a Lime Juice</li>
            <li>soap seems to work better on a 2-3day beard growth.</li>
            <li>I am grateful for the advice, my shaving has never been better.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll love it....</li>
            <li>This is a glycerin soap, and the scent has a nice, fresh smell.  </li>
            <li>The glycerin definitely adds a nice feel to it &amp; something about the lime is pleasant as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lime juice softens up the hair and makes passes easy.</li>
            <li>to unwrap and has a pleasant Citrus-Zesty aroma (that doesn&#x27;t travel too far.)</li>
            <li>I was very surprised by how much I liked this product and by how much better my shaving results are.</li>
            <li>Really makes things more enjoyable.</li>
            <li>Simply the best in gentle cleansing and softening and lube on the beard</li>
            <li>Overall the smell is good not to strong</li>
            <li>So I went shopping for shaving soap (not too excited about putting ivory on my face).  </li>
            <li>Great fresh smell will definitely wake you up.</li>
            <li>I feel it leaves my beard feeling so clean and groomed.</li>
            <li>most say it doesn&#x27;t linger long which is nice</li>
            <li>Rinse with cool water.  </li>
            <li>I believe this soap does a superior job of softening up the beard prior to shaving.  </li>
            <li>Could easily tell a difference on the first use of this.</li>
            <li>Just keep it in a soap dish, (water will help dissipate it quickly).</li>
            <li>Use warm water and clean fingertips to apply prior to shave routine.  </li>
            <li>I shave in the shower, so I rarely use any lathers, or creams.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s fresh.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I didn&#x27;t notice a real difference between using this soap and a regular &amp;#34;face cleanser&amp;#34; before shaving.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the classic scent, which there is nothing special about.</li>
            <li>I think for the purpose of this soap, there are likely better products on the market.</li>
            <li>I will compare it to the whole foods glycerine soap for a ower price and see if it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Plan to buy a couple more at a time next order.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through most of the different offerings from Musco Real.</li>
            <li>Such a fantastic scent and PRE shave feel, I love this step of my shaving ritual, relaxing and invigorating at the same time.</li>
            <li>Rub it good between your hands, for a small lather, then rub all over your whiskers.</li>
            <li>I have always loved glycerin soaps for a clean feeling with just enough oils so that you don&#x27;t feel dried out or greasy.  </li>
            <li>Make certain to apply moisturizer after shave routine.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for anyone who wants a closer, smoother shave!  </li>
            <li>Real is the real thing.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>In purchasing the Glyce Soap I was searching for a product that softens the whiskers in preparation for a straight razor shave.  </li>
            <li>It really helps soften up the whiskers.  </li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>Shaves much smoother after applying the soap.</li>
            <li>Then Apply Musgo Real Lime Glyce Soap.</li>
            <li>Rub the Musgo Real Lime Glyce Soap into the area(s)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much of a burning sensation when using</li>
            <li>a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is okay but $10 a pop, it is expensive since any glycerine based soap (or not) will clean your face just fine before shaving.</li>
            <li>did I actually get a really comfortable shave, and it was after I stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not completely bashing this product</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this stuff really helps protect my skin from irritation.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using MR GLO (Musgo Real Glyce Lime Oil soap) for several years, as the first step of my shave at the sink, after showering.</li>
            <li>I can wash with the Glyce and get away with it, but if it remains on my face too long then my handsome muggin&#x27; will remain red and stingy for hours to come.  </li>
            <li>After using this for a few shaves I was struck by how much better almost all of my soaps and creams lathered.</li>
            <li>I tried this a couple of times while using a Proraso shave soap, and after not using it for a little while with the same soap, I honestly don&#x27;t see a lot of difference.</li>
            <li>this long pretty much sums up &amp;#34;if</li>
            <li>I use it before shaving with a straight razor to clean and prepare my skin and whiskers as well as to give my skin a little additional lubrication.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a &#x27;slick&#x27; feeling soap that helps my beard stand up, making for a better shave.</li>
            <li>Make a thin lather with a brush or face lather with the soap, and do a quick water splash to rinse it off before starting to lather with your favorite cream or shaving soap.</li>
            <li>it is better in every way (smell, hard water properties, slickness, cleaning capability, etc.).</li>
            <li>Mildly scented soap I use as a pre-shave due to the glycerin content.</li>
            <li>Give it at least a 45sec-1m30sec rub-in for the Lime to work it&#x27;s magic (soften hairs).</li>
            <li>Both of which have the same effect from the PRE-Shave Musgo Real Lime Glyce Soap.</li>
            <li>The Lime smell has completely gone after the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m only really saying that it just doesn&#x27;t work as well as I had thought on my end.</li>
            <li>Wash beard with MR GLO, rinse, and then work up a lather (NOT with MR GLO) and apply it to my wet beard: the first step toward a pleasurable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Soap is almost a hard gummy texture and Visually as you&#x27;d expect from the picture-- a tad more translucent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems ok, but he had an extremely tough beard, and found it somewhat helpful.</li>
            <li>It is not very expensive and last a very long time.  </li>
            <li>(This is namely because your shave soap washed the super slick glyce protection</li>
            <li>My face is really very particular to what I use, and unfortunately this didn&#x27;t make a huge impact.</li>
            <li>I like the soap, not sure if I am lathering the hardsoap right, but I think next time I will buy the soft soap and try it out for comparison.</li>
            <li>This soap is amazing I am using it everyday at least once</li>
            <li>I would not recommend buying too much at once as it tends to dry out if kept too long.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for a long time. People love this soap in the shaving community and I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is okay but $10 a pop, it is expensive since any glycerine based soap (or not) will clean your face just fine before shaving. Not sure what the hype is about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get a Neutrogena glycerine soap for $3 and it is better in every way (smell, hard water properties, slickness, cleaning capability, etc.). I am not soap expert but sorry, this soap is not worth $10.</li>
            <li> Prepares the face for a great shave.</li>
            <li> Shaved for a few weeks without any pre shave soap (only a shower before). Could easily tell a difference on the first use of this. Smoother shave, no nicks, and almost no irritation. Awesome product, will buy again</li>
            <li> The other reviewer made a mistake here; this is not a shaving soap, it&#x27;s a pre-shave soap; that is, you&#x27;re meant to wash your face with it, then rinse, and THEN use a shaving cream or soap. This is not for lathering in a mug. What it DOES do is clean your face and prepare your beard so that your shaving cream or soap will be more effective; in this regard it is excellent, and you should try it; it lasts forever as well.</li>
            <li> I have always loved glycerin soaps for a clean feeling with just enough oils so that you don&#x27;t feel dried out or greasy.  This is one of the best.  I use it before shaving with a straight razor to clean and prepare my skin and whiskers as well as to give my skin a little additional lubrication.  It is by no means an oily soap nor does it leave a greasy residue.  I still use shave oil.  I just notice that my shaves are a little nicer when I don&#x27;t skip this step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice, feels good, and contributes to a great shave.  It is not very expensive and last a very long time.  Musco Real is the real thing.  I love it and even turned my daughter on to it for shaving her legs.</li>
            <li> I use this as a face prep/cleanser for wetshaving.  This is a glycerin soap, and the scent has a nice, fresh smell.  Make a thin lather with a brush or face lather with the soap, and do a quick water splash to rinse it off before starting to lather with your favorite cream or shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Smells and feels great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not lime as the title implies. It&#x27;s the classic scent, which there is nothing special about.</li>
            <li> Great soap to wash your face and beard before shaving. Great fresh smell will definitely wake you up. It&#x27;ll leave your skin and beard nicely hydrated. Rinse and then add some quality shaving soap or cream with a good brush. Your morning can&#x27;t start any better.</li>
            <li> Wish instructions came with product.  I had to go back on line to Amazon to read comments/reviews to see how my husband should use it.&lt;br /&gt;It seems ok, but he had an extremely tough beard, and found it somewhat helpful.</li>
            <li> As noted in another review, this soap is NOT a shaving soap: it won&#x27;t lather, for one thing. It is a PRE-shave soap: wash your beard with this, rinse, then lather up with a shaving soap or a shaving cream or---if you must---squirt some shaving foam out of a can (not recommended: it&#x27;s too dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using MR GLO (Musgo Real Glyce Lime Oil soap) for several years, as the first step of my shave at the sink, after showering. Wash beard with MR GLO, rinse, and then work up a lather (NOT with MR GLO) and apply it to my wet beard: the first step toward a pleasurable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I started using this about a year ago and have been very impressed by the results.  As others have pointed out, it is NOT a shaving soap.  It is designed to be used to wash your face before shaving.  It has glycerin, which makes your face extremely slick and improves the performance of whatever shaving cream or soap you use.  I would highly recommend this for anyone who wants a closer, smoother shave!  Its price is on par with drugstore facial soaps and one bar lasts for 4-6 months.</li>
            <li> I shave in the shower, so I rarely use any lathers, or creams. Just keep it in a soap dish, (water will help dissipate it quickly). Rub it good between your hands, for a small lather, then rub all over your whiskers. Makes that shadow stand up for a good close shave. I&#x27;ve been through most of the different offerings from Musco Real. The lime does have a tendency to burn a little. Especially on your lips. But I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Great soap.....I use this before shaving and it is amazing...I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Irritating?  So why the 3 &amp;#34;stars&amp;#34;?, you may be asking.  Well, before I answer that question, let me say that I&#x27;m a handsome man.  And I take my shaving seriously.  In purchasing the Glyce Soap I was searching for a product that softens the whiskers in preparation for a straight razor shave.  And in that, this soap does the job.  Mind you, it&#x27;s not a shaving soap.  It&#x27;s meant to be used as a wash to prep the beard and face for a shave.  It really helps soften up the whiskers.  BUT, and this is a big BUT, the Glyce has a bit of a janitorial scent.  Think &amp;#34;faint industrial cleanser scent.&amp;#34;  Not terrible....just a tad on the &amp;#34;sanitizer&amp;#34; side.  The real issue for me is that it is irritating to the face.  I can wash with the Glyce and get away with it, but if it remains on my face too long then my handsome muggin&#x27; will remain red and stingy for hours to come.  How the heck is my wife gonna kiss my handsome pie hole when I&#x27;m all irritated?  I think for the purpose of this soap, there are likely better products on the market.</li>
            <li> Best pre-shave soap around.</li>
            <li> Works great as a pre shave.</li>
            <li> This is one of, if not the, finest pre-shave soaps on the market. After using this for a few shaves I was struck by how much better almost all of my soaps and creams lathered. Not to mention the smell, which is like heaven on a beach, and the way it makes your face feel after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife even uses it from time to time as a face wash soap and make up removing soap.</li>
            <li> Such a fantastic scent and PRE shave feel, I love this step of my shaving ritual, relaxing and invigorating at the same time. It&#x27;s a BIG puck and if you are just washing your face, it should last for quite a while. A very enthusiastic 2 thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I didn&#x27;t notice a real difference between using this soap and a regular &amp;#34;face cleanser&amp;#34; before shaving. The soap smelled good though.</li>
            <li> Works really well. I use it in the shower and at the sink. Preps my skin for shaving.</li>
            <li> use it as pre shave soap</li>
            <li> Test the soap on your face before using it to shave. Ended up having a sever allergic reaction to the soap.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised by how much I liked this product and by how much better my shaving results are. It&#x27;s a &#x27;slick&#x27; feeling soap that helps my beard stand up, making for a better shave. I think it also helps because it is a very solid preparation step sine I take several minutes of massaging the lather on my face. Better prep equals better results.</li>
            <li> Mildly scented soap I use as a pre-shave due to the glycerin content. This was recommended by Leisureguy over on /r/Wicked_egde. I don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about this soap and believe it does help the glide on my shaves.</li>
            <li> The soap is great. Shaves much smoother after applying the soap. I will probably buy another after I finish this one, which is likely going to be a while.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s work well and I think it improved my shave. I will compare it to the whole foods glycerine soap for a ower price and see if it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Best soap ever bought</li>
            <li> Great product for cleansing and moisturizing face and beard. Use warm water and clean fingertips to apply prior to shave routine.  Rinse with cool water.  Make certain to apply moisturizer after shave routine.  Note - Not a shave soap, a cleaning soap.&lt;br /&gt;-JJJ</li>
            <li> Started washing my beard with this pre-shave. Really makes things more enjoyable. The lime juice softens up the hair and makes passes easy.</li>
            <li> Great soap to use just before shaving.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice anything incredibly different if I have or haven&#x27;t used this soap before shaving. I feel like it does a good job, but it doesn&#x27;t obviously stand out as great. I plan to get a cheaper glycerin based soap next time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waited almost a month after purchasing this product to give a good full review.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: This is a PRE-shave soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW TO USE: Wash your face. Then Apply Musgo Real Lime Glyce Soap. This is a Glyce Soap so it&#x27;ll leave a slick residue on whatever you apply it to (Thus, I use a washcloth especially for this soap, so my hands don&#x27;t get slick) Rub the Musgo Real Lime Glyce Soap into the area(s) you&#x27;re going to be shaving. Give it at least a 45sec-1m30sec rub-in for the Lime to work it&#x27;s magic (soften hairs). Rinse the lather away but not to vigorously. You want to keep the slick (I don&#x27;t dry the parts I used the soap a towel will take most of the glyce away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPON OPENING:&lt;br /&gt;Dimensions: 2in 3/4ths diameter. 1in 1/4ths deep.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to unwrap and has a pleasant Citrus-Zesty aroma (that doesn&#x27;t travel too far.) *Note it&#x27;s more like Lime Zest than a Lime Juice smell.&lt;br /&gt;The Soap is almost a hard gummy texture and Visually as you&#x27;d expect from the picture-- a tad more translucent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SHAVE:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Proraso&#x27;s soap and Col&#x27;Conks soaps with this. Both of which have the same effect from the PRE-Shave Musgo Real Lime Glyce Soap. The hairs on the 1st pass are a tad noticeably cut easier. Also, the glide from the Glyce gives a noticeable cushion. The 2nd and 3rd pass -- The effect goes back to a standards (no PRE-shave soap applied) feel. The Lime smell has completely gone after the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap seems to work better on a 2-3day beard growth. And not so much on a next day shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION:&lt;br /&gt;If you want to get that 1st pass perfect; this is a PERFECT product to buy. If your technique isn&#x27;t good, this product won&#x27;t help you b/c the 2nd and 3rd passes feel the same as if you didn&#x27;t use this soap (This is namely because your shave soap washed the super slick glyce protection away)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again. I prefer it over the Proraso PRE-shave cream.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it minus 1 star because it was hard to find proper instructions how to use it and the soft soap tends to get slightly deformed by whatever try you have it sitting in.</li>
            <li> Very nice pre-shave soap, made for a very smooth shave.  Overall the smell is good not to strong but you know its there.</li>
            <li> Simply the best in gentle cleansing and softening and lube on the beard the glycerin makes the razor glide without pulls</li>
            <li> Great slippery stuff for a pre shave !!!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this stuff really helps protect my skin from irritation.  I bought this soap after my barber recommended that I use &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; before I shave.  So I went shopping for shaving soap (not too excited about putting ivory on my face).  I am grateful for the advice, my shaving has never been better.  This stuff smells strong but works great.</li>
            <li> I bought this product due to the reviews I received from the wetshaving community and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  The scent of the soap is light and refreshing and it makes your beard and skin feel great.  I try to wash my face with it before every shave and leave a little bit of the soap on my face while I lather to create an extra moisturizing and lubricating surface.</li>
            <li> The lime fragrance is pleasant and rather unique.  I believe this soap does a superior job of softening up the beard prior to shaving.  I would not recommend buying too much at once as it tends to dry out if kept too long.  Order one or two at a time so it&#x27;s fresh.  One of these probably will last me about two months.</li>
            <li> Plan to buy a couple more at a time next order.  This soap is amazing I am using it everyday at least once so I am sadly getting used it to it. I feel it leaves my beard feeling so clean and groomed.</li>
            <li> great for pre shave face wash</li>
            <li> Nice lather, nice smell, good at prepping my face for a nice shave. You have to be careful about storage, or it will turn to jelly (had one and it did that, but my fault). I now keep mine on a wire rack outside shower on shelf, where it can dry properly after use.</li>
            <li> I guess something that&#x27;s been around this long pretty much sums up &amp;#34;if it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it.&amp;#34; This morning I had probably one of the closest shaves I&#x27;ve had prior to this. The glycerin definitely adds a nice feel to it &amp; something about the lime is pleasant as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most say it doesn&#x27;t linger long which is nice &amp; it&#x27;s definitely not over powering. I didn&#x27;t notice much of a burning sensation when using but I do recommend.</li>
            <li> What can I say about this product that hasn&#x27;t been said on every review online? I bought this for a pre-shave warm wash on the recommendation from Sharpologist. It did not disappoint. It&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; lime to the point where it&#x27;s sickening, but just enough to smell nice and where your significant other will notice. Try this with the Lucky Tiger brand for pre-shave wash and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like the soap, not sure if I am lathering the hardsoap right, but I think next time I will buy the soft soap and try it out for comparison.</li>
            <li> This item was ordered for a relative for Christmas, but I think I may keep it for my husband.  It smells great and I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll love it....the relative, well he&#x27;ll have to order his own.</li>
            <li> I tried this a couple of times while using a Proraso shave soap, and after not using it for a little while with the same soap, I honestly don&#x27;t see a lot of difference. In fact, once I just changed to a different brand of blade did I actually get a really comfortable shave, and it was after I stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not completely bashing this product, I&#x27;m only really saying that it just doesn&#x27;t work as well as I had thought on my end. My face is really very particular to what I use, and unfortunately this didn&#x27;t make a huge impact.</li>
