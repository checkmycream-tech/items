            <li> Great product . . . the soap was exactly what I was looking for and leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.  I would recommend purchasing this product!</li>
            <li> smells wonderful...left my skin feeling soft</li>
            <li> I found this soap to be exactly and described, very refreshing, and through pricy worth the cost.  It&#x27;s a new bathing experience, try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bill, Downey, California</li>
            <li> I just started using this soap bar and I love the fragrance and the feel of my skin after using it.  I find it a very good moisturizing soap.  I will definitely re-order several bars of this soap in the near future for myself and as gifts for family.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> love it.The smell is good. My skin glows. Will buy  again.</li>
            <li> love it..smell so good</li>
            <li> Loved this soap through and through definitely going to buy more.</li>
            <li> great after bath feeling. even though I got cheaper options, i will go for this again. it feels truly natural and organic</li>
            <li> Looked like it came out of an anus.</li>
            <li> Great soap, leaves my skin feeling healthy &amp; clear!</li>
            <li> This is a really nice soap!  It leaves my skin soft and clean!  It smells great as well!  Also, it is important to me that it was not tested on animals and has no animal ingredients.  I do recommend this natural soap!</li>
            <li> This is the kind of soap to use if you want a combination honey oatmeal and loofa (sp?) all in one.  The only reason I gave it four stars is that, as the photo implies, it seems that the ingredients are layered and not mixed together for consistency throughout.  Still, it&#x27;s a nice smelling and very scrubby soap.</li>
            <li> Awesome soap! I will be ordering more! Perfect for my skin to feel both moisturized and clean smelling! </li>
            <li> Love this soap bar!!! leave my skin so soft and the smell last long ...even my husband love it...he tried once and kept using it and now I have to get two soap for my next purchase.. I recommended this soap better than the expensive one that&#x27;s only give you a temporary moisturize but this one make a lot of different for your body /hand and  specially for face too.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a mother&#x27;s day gift for my mother and she loved it! The soap smells wonderful and we haven&#x27;t even unwrapped it from the plastic yet! The soap sort of has a more musky, masculine smell to it, so just keep that in mind. The scent is very pleasant while not being overwhelming.</li>
            <li> The soap smells wonderful, but it does not look like the picture. I was terribly disappointed in the appearance of the soap. It looks like any other piece of soap that you can buy at a regular store. I wanted it to look like the picture. The picture shows exquisite swirls and dollops at the top making it look like a wonderful piece of soap; almost like a piece of cake. While I understand that each batch of soap is unique, it seemed as if whomever made this batch did not care about presentation or what the soap ended up looking like. I will not buy from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> I like the honey oatmeal bar. Last just over a week. Feels great and I like the texture and look of the bar. I plan on many reorders.</li>
            <li> Love it.  No after residue.  Smells yummy.</li>
            <li> Smell was good but caused an allergic reaction to my body. Also, the oatmeal scratches sensitive skin. Only used the product for 2 days.</li>
            <li> Gentle soap that is perfect for our skin; pure wonderful product.</li>
