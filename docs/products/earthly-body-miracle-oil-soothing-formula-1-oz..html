            <li>All Natural, this product used twice a day on post surgical scars literally made them disappear!  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t overpowering but definitely lasts long enough for that uplifting, refreshing aroma through the day.</li>

            <li> I absolutely love this product! I use it for almost everything. I originally got this to help with ingrown hairs that I sometimes get from waxing. It not only prevented hair bumps, it also got rid of the scares from prior ones.. So then, I decided to use it on my face as a moisturizer and I hardly ever breakout anymore.. It also keeps my nails from breaking and they are actually growing healthier than when I was going to the nail salon every two weeks. I thought my nails were a hopeless case. Now, I don&#x27;t have to get fake nails for my wedding day.. This is by far, the best product I have ever come across in skin care and no where near as costly. It&#x27;s my all-in-one skin care solution.</li>
            <li> I have been using Miracle Oil to soften a surgical scar.  With regular use, it softens the skin and helps to ease the stretching pain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product at my nail salon for 4 years and it works great!  Helps heal nails and make them much stronger.  I finally ordered two bottles for the house.</li>

I only wish it came in a larger size!</li>

            <li> I had a problem with fleas in my yard (no pets). They were hitching a ride on my ankles into my house and biting me all over!

Major surprise...woke up to almost completely healed ankles! Majority of my bug bites were gone. After using a few days there were completely gone! Miracle indeed.</li>
