            <li>I LOVE IT...</li>
            <li>It has cleared my skin up, it looks radiant and more healthy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products</li>
            <li>I liked the lotion - it was light and moisturized well.</li>
            <li>Better advice</li>
            <li>I personally love Proactive.</li>
            <li>We are pleased with the results - more importantly my granddaughter is pleased.</li>
            <li>Proactive works great for my skin, keeps it perfectly clear</li>
            <li>The product is fine but just beware</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work for me but excellent for my little sister.</li>
            <li>I used proactive before and it works awesome for a few months</li>
            <li>Did what it was suppose to do for the most part,but for the price the amount you receive doesn&#x27;t seem worth the price.</li>
            <li>This product is great as long as you don&#x27;t stop using it.</li>
            <li>and I was excited to get started with the process.  </li>
            <li>This made my  skin  tone 2 shades ligher than what it originally  was.</li>
            <li>Great product, will definitely buy again and reccommend to any one who is looking for such a product good job seller.</li>
            <li>After 1 week of use there was significant improvement.</li>
            <li>I went on a trip for about two days, the product says to clean your face twice a day</li>
            <li>Pouring gasoline on my face would have felt about as good as this stuff and accomplished just as much.</li>
            <li>First off I use proactive daily and it works great.</li>
            <li>For the price I should have just ordered the full size product.</li>
            <li>love proactive works very well</li>
            <li>and I never received the email saying it was cancelled in the first place, and that it was refunded in full, however it was never refunded!</li>
            <li>Works relatively quickly, a day or so, depending on the size of the blemish.  </li>
            <li>ProActive clears up the skin around my lesions and gives me more of a normal looking face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>This product came real  early, and i was  glad  when i got it.</li>
            <li>I have pretty greasy skin and have tried everything from over the counter products to some more expensive skin care products but this would have to be the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>First it was $41!</li>
            <li>My sister said it worked fine, thanks</li>
            <li>I think this product is worth a try.</li>
            <li>It may not work for everyone, but it definitely is worth trying it out.</li>
            <li>Start  using it right away.</li>
            <li>I found that if I used it daily as prescribed it dried out my face so a dab when needed works best for me.</li>
            <li>The product arrived very fast in the mail</li>
            <li>it is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell you whether this product worked or not - I had to stop using it because it bleached my blue towels whenever I wiped my face.  </li>
            <li>I ordered proactiv for the first time coming out of my freshman year in college.</li>
            <li>and I am pleased with the low price as well as the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;What&#x27;s more, apparently the latest research shows that in severe cases of acne there is bacteria under the skin that must be treated by antibiotics and that treating it superficially isn&#x27;t likely to help much.  </li>
            <li>When I first received this I was concerned.  </li>
            <li>We saw results after the first use.  </li>
            <li>Yes my exception of proactiv is exactly what I thought it would be</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li>Gives you clean glowing clear skin from the very 1st time you use it!</li>
            <li>good only for teens with minor problems</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell from the photos but overall the transaction was fine.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Drying out my skin too much.</li>
            <li>She is very happy!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had so much as a blackhead growing up</li>
            <li>After spending hundreds of dollars on prescriptions, Proactive at a reasonable price cleared my son acne</li>
            <li>, it works very well with my skin</li>
            <li>Totally recommend this for a pimple free face .</li>
            <li>very time consuming</li>
            <li>The picture is very deceiving.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I will be buying this product until I die if needed :)</li>
            <li>If you have mild acne, this will work for you, but if you have moderate to severe acne, it&#x27;s not going to do much.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I cant live without this product!</li>
            <li>My main  problem areas are my chin, nose, and forehead.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product a 5 star rating is because without a good moisturizer, it really dried out my face.</li>
            <li>We order this for our daughter after having tried various drugs without success.  </li>
            <li>Our doctor said that what&#x27;s in Proactiv isn&#x27;t really that much different than what&#x27;s in most of the other over the counter products.  </li>
            <li>so this was new to me.  </li>
            <li>But if you have a severe case, it&#x27;s not likely to help very much, and you&#x27;ll probably have to get a prescription for something stronger.</li>
            <li>I have tried it before a long time ago and it seemed to work, but since this time it was expired it was less effective.</li>
            <li>Maybe I read it over in the details but for $41 I expected the full size.</li>
            <li>So now I have a bathroom full of acne medication and an empty wallet....</li>
            <li>Worked well to clear acne.</li>
            <li>Cleared up my skin in no time and keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li>My skin is as clear as it has ever been.</li>
            <li>She had been breaking out, particularly near her hairline.  </li>
            <li>We are on our second month and this stuff works really well.</li>
            <li>so I think i&#x27;m done with this product completely.</li>
            <li>I use it once a day instead of twice daily because it dries my skin too much.</li>
            <li>and her face has cleared up completely.</li>
            <li>...use products with natural based ingredients not man made chemicals like these that you have to continue to use for years so they can keep making money off of you.  </li>
            <li>I tried a natural product and no longer get breakouts.  </li>
            <li>then I spent more money to get other acne medication, and</li>
            <li>He also said that the main reason people who used it showed some improvement is because it motivated people to be regular in their acne hygiene routine - something</li>
            <li>you have a less severe case of acne, then Proactiv might be for you: the main thing is to use it consistently.  </li>
            <li>the only reason I was willing to spend the money is because I didnt want to have to have the hassle of calling in and canceling and forgetting and getting charged extra.</li>
            <li>Her breakouts are not completely gone at this point but much, much improved.</li>
            <li>Other then that the product was just exactly as stated.</li>
            <li>apparently its changed to $45, even less worth it.</li>
            <li>Product worked decently for me, but the price is rather high for such small amount of product.</li>

            <li> Other than that, I will be buying this product until I die if needed :)</li>
            <li> If you have mild acne, this will work for you, but if you have moderate to severe acne, it&#x27;s not going to do much.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I cant live without this product!</li>
            <li> My main  problem areas are my chin, nose, and forehead.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product a 5 star rating is because without a good moisturizer, it really dried out my face.</li>
            <li> We order this for our daughter after having tried various drugs without success.  </li>
            <li> Our doctor said that what&#x27;s in Proactiv isn&#x27;t really that much different than what&#x27;s in most of the other over the counter products.  </li>
            <li> so this was new to me.  </li>
            <li> But if you have a severe case, it&#x27;s not likely to help very much, and you&#x27;ll probably have to get a prescription for something stronger.</li>
            <li> I have tried it before a long time ago and it seemed to work, but since this time it was expired it was less effective.</li>
            <li> Maybe I read it over in the details but for $41 I expected the full size.</li>
            <li> So now I have a bathroom full of acne medication and an empty wallet....</li>
            <li> Worked well to clear acne.</li>
            <li> Cleared up my skin in no time and keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li> My skin is as clear as it has ever been.</li>
            <li> She had been breaking out, particularly near her hairline.  </li>
            <li> We are on our second month and this stuff works really well.</li>
            <li> so I think i&#x27;m done with this product completely.</li>
            <li> I use it once a day instead of twice daily because it dries my skin too much.</li>
            <li> and her face has cleared up completely.</li>
            <li> ...use products with natural based ingredients not man made chemicals like these that you have to continue to use for years so they can keep making money off of you.  </li>
            <li> I tried a natural product and no longer get breakouts.  </li>
            <li> then I spent more money to get other acne medication, and</li>
            <li> He also said that the main reason people who used it showed some improvement is because it motivated people to be regular in their acne hygiene routine - something</li>
            <li> you have a less severe case of acne, then Proactiv might be for you: the main thing is to use it consistently.  </li>
            <li> the only reason I was willing to spend the money is because I didnt want to have to have the hassle of calling in and canceling and forgetting and getting charged extra.</li>
            <li> Her breakouts are not completely gone at this point but much, much improved.</li>
            <li> Other then that the product was just exactly as stated.</li>
            <li> apparently its changed to $45, even less worth it.</li>
            <li> Product worked decently for me, but the price is rather high for such small amount of product.</li>
            <li> The purchase was made for my 14 year old due to having an acne outbreak.  </li>
            <li> After reading other reviews, I was unsure if it would work for my 14 year old son, so I ordered the 30-day supply.</li>
            <li> It cleared up my skin, but left it somewhat dry.  </li>
            <li> Proactive really does work, or at least it works for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is hard to live with a distortion especially one on your face as a woman in todays</li>
            <li> I have been using proactive for a very long time</li>
            <li> But when my mom used it she broke up and it made her face dry.</li>
            <li> The only problem i have with the 30 day kit is that its too small for the prize, those bottles where even smaller than the travel size toiletries you get at the drug store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the pricey side, so I can only afford to give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> My teenaged son has had a bad case of acne for more than a year now.  </li>
            <li> I finally got tired of being on antibiotics and Rx creams to clear up my acne.</li>
            <li> With careful research, we thought we would try this product for my granddaughter&#x27;s face cleansing.  </li>
            <li> however I have a few marks left from it.</li>
            <li> He has been using it for a few weeks now, and not even daily.  </li>
            <li> After using it for several weeks now, we&#x27;ve seen a very slight improvement in our son&#x27;s acne, but nothing</li>
            <li> Other than that it does the job of clearing acne well.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to buy proactiv look at the other options you have from this site.</li>
            <li> i tried to apply my usual facial moisturizer, and my face was on fire...</li>
            <li> NO THANKS!</li>
            <li> I love Proactive, but I was disappointed with this for a number of reasons.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 3 step program and the dark spot refining mask</li>
            <li> Im Looking for the dark spot removal</li>
            <li> cleared my sons skin in less than a week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried more expensive &amp; less expensive products but ALWAYS return to proactiv</li>
            <li> Felt a slight tingling when I used the face wash.</li>
            <li> and she said that the order was cancelled because they couldn&#x27;t &amp;#34;deliver to my address&amp;#34; which is not true</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t clean for 4 \\&quot;cycles\\&quot;, and I broke out like crazy!</li>
            <li> However, there are other alternate products that are sold in stores that work just as well but are less expensive.</li>
            <li> Use this with the green tea moisturizer and you have a winner.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems like nothing we tried worked, so after hearing several friends recommend Proactiv, we decided to take the plunge and buy a 2-month supply, even though it&#x27;s a little expensive.  </li>
            <li> A little slow.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if something else for example</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this twice, didn&#x27;t do anything out of the ordinary to get rid of my acne.</li>
            <li> The bottles are small but It seems to work.</li>
            <li> I usually buy a 30 supply of Proactive from Amazon for $40 or so.</li>
            <li> I just received my 30 day supply and its rediculous how small the quantity is now.</li>
            <li> The cleanser and toner are usually 4oz  each, they are now 2oz.</li>
            <li> The renewing cleanser is usually 4oz, it is now 1oz.</li>
            <li> Is it supposed to be this small?</li>
            <li> I have hormonal acne once a month and small flesh toned bumps on my forehead that just hang out and don&#x27;t go away...</li>
            <li> Not only was it going to take over a month to receive the product the size was a trail size which they failed to print in the decription.</li>
            <li> I had painful under the skin pimples and I was extremely greasy even with regular face faces.</li>
            <li> $30 for 2 ounce cleanser and toner, and 1 oz repairing lotion is a rather steep price for me at least.   </li>
            <li> It just sucks that the price shot up.</li>
            <li> so I just let it go (had the extra money to not get to mad)</li>
            <li> It also was a very small amount of product for the price.  </li>
            <li> My skin is still broken out and it was very harsh.</li>
            <li> but... seriously overpriced.</li>
            <li> My acne was never as bad as it was prior to using this product.  </li>
            <li> The bumps were so bad I called out from work and refused to be seen in public.  </li>
            <li> Then it was very late getting to me, so I messaged the seller</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that expensive, nothing compared to the prescription medications she has been taking.</li>
            <li> the bottles are 2oz was not happy for the price but this skin care regimn is awsome!!</li>
            <li> However we did have bad weather.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice drastic results but it wasn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> For me, piece o&#x27;crap.</li>
            <li> Hate the auto refills</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m sick of it!!!!!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> It broke me out out even worst!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was a rip off!!! The bottles are tiny as if they were testers! Waste of money! Scam!</li>
            <li> The stuff works well for my kids but... seriously overpriced.</li>
            <li> My face always look great</li>
            <li> It helped initial but I think my acne became used to proactive and so after a couple of weeks it wasn&#x27;t responding as well. I&#x27;m not sure if something else for example the blackhead tx might be more along the line of what I need. Thanks</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve had acne for about 8 years and i&#x27;m sick of it!!!!!!!!!!  i started using proactiv and can&#x27;t wait til i see results.</li>
            <li> Proactive really does work, or at least it works for me. The only problem i have with the 30 day kit is that its too small for the prize, those bottles where even smaller than the travel size toiletries you get at the drug store. Other than that it does the job of clearing acne well.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001SA5DZS Proactiv 4 Pc Kit 30 Day Supply]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as a result of my skin condition I wanted something that would stop the blackheads and the whiteheads I was getting on my nose and both cheeks as a result of my illness. I started using ProActive 1 month ago  it is exactly what I needed. I get kenalog 1 cc injections in my face .  ProActive clears up the skin around my lesions and gives me more of a normal looking face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Gunthy Renker for developing this product.  it does work and makes me so very happy at 60.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is hard to live with a distortion especially one on your face as a woman in todays society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be using this until the day I die or they stop making it.</li>
            <li> With careful research, we thought we would try this product for my granddaughter&#x27;s face cleansing.  She had been breaking out, particularly near her hairline.  Proactiv works amazingly well when she conscientiously uses all three products.  Good products.  We are pleased with the results - more importantly my granddaughter is pleased.</li>
            <li> Proactiv is the best skin care line I have ever used. My main  problem areas are my chin, nose, and forehead. With pro activ, these areas aren&#x27;t problematic anymore. This product is definitely a God send, and I will never be without it.</li>
            <li> Proactiv has been great with creating better skin for me. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product a 5 star rating is because without a good moisturizer, it really dried out my face. However, with a good moisturizer this Proactiv is wonderful and I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Ok. It&#x27;s not working the way it use to work on my skin. Drying out my skin too much.</li>
            <li> I must say after using proactive for a week my face has been cleared with acne and i love it!!!!!!! Thank u proactive and amazon!! I want to post a before and after picture but i dont know how.</li>
            <li> My daughter has seen a change in just the first month of using this great product.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell you whether this product worked or not - I had to stop using it because it bleached my blue towels whenever I wiped my face.  Boo.</li>
            <li> This product came real  early, and i was  glad  when i got it. Start  using it right away. Show results in a week time, but  when my  son  use it, work for a while then the  pimples come back. That why i give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> cleared my sons skin in less than a week</li>
            <li> Great product! I have bought for years for my teenage boys.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this twice, didn&#x27;t do anything out of the ordinary to get rid of my acne. Just as good as the drugstore brands. If you have mild acne, this will work for you, but if you have moderate to severe acne, it&#x27;s not going to do much. For me, piece o&#x27;crap.</li>
            <li> The product is great but the price isn&#x27;t. If you&#x27;re going to buy proactiv look at the other options you have from this site.</li>
            <li> I ordered proactiv for the first time coming out of my freshman year in college. I have pretty greasy skin and have tried everything from over the counter products to some more expensive skin care products but this would have to be the best I&#x27;ve tried. I ordered the 3 step program and the dark spot refining mask and I have seen a reduction in my pores/dark marks. My skin is softer and more even just like advertised BUT stopping use is not recommended. I went on a trip for about two days, the product says to clean your face twice a day so I didn&#x27;t clean for 4 \\&quot;cycles\\&quot;, and I broke out like crazy! I had painful under the skin pimples and I was extremely greasy even with regular face faces. This product is great as long as you don&#x27;t stop using it. If you stop using this product, you&#x27;re going to have to deal with some stubborn acne for a while.</li>
            <li> We order this for our daughter after having tried various drugs without success.  We are on our second month and this stuff works really well. She is very happy!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
            <li> most people like this product, it set my face on fire! I used it once, afterwords i tried to apply my usual facial moisturizer, and my face was on fire...</li>
            <li> The product arrived very fast in the mail and I was excited to get started with the process.  Three days into it,  I noticed bumps started to appear all over my face. My acne was never as bad as it was prior to using this product.  I do not recommend this to ANYONE.  The bumps were so bad I called out from work and refused to be seen in public.  It has been three weeks post throwing this stuff in the trash and the bumps went away however I have a few marks left from it.</li>
            <li> As a woman going through &amp;#34;changes&amp;#34; I am developing hormonal acne. I&#x27;ve never had so much as a blackhead growing up so this was new to me.  I tried every home remedy, read countless testimonials, nothing worked EXCEPT pro activ. I don&#x27;t use it all the time, only when I feel a blemish developing or one that snuck up over night. Works relatively quickly, a day or so, depending on the size of the blemish.  I found that if I used it daily as prescribed it dried out my face so a dab when needed works best for me. I&#x27;ve been buying this for about three years now, haven&#x27;t had an issue yet.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s face in looking better and better. Only problem was the shipping. A little slow. However we did have bad weather. So I&#x27;m sure that had something to do with it. Other then that the product was just exactly as stated.</li>
            <li> Worked well to clear acne. Worked much better than expensive prescription medications. After spending hundreds of dollars on prescriptions, Proactive at a reasonable price cleared my son acne</li>
            <li> This product works great. Cleared up my skin in no time and keeps my skin clear. I&#x27;ve tried many over the counter products and nothing works for me better than Proactiv.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. I&#x27;ve tried more expensive &amp; less expensive products but ALWAYS return to proactiv</li>
            <li> The product is fine but just beware this is the mini/travel size. Can&#x27;t tell from the photos but overall the transaction was fine.</li>
            <li> Proactive works great for my skin, keeps it perfectly clear</li>
            <li> The product works as promised.  However, there are other alternate products that are sold in stores that work just as well but are less expensive.</li>
            <li> this product works awesome to get rid of acne is you have problems with acne, and i works, and is easy to use</li>
            <li> Worked great for my pre-teen!</li>
            <li> Great product. Would rather buy from amazon anytime before going through actual company.</li>
            <li> It broke out my face and I felt tightness, itchy and burning.  I had to go to the doctor</li>
            <li> It kind of worked for me, the guy I ordered it from sent me an expired package of Proactiv. I have tried it before a long time ago and it seemed to work, but since this time it was expired it was less effective. so I think i&#x27;m done with this product completely.</li>
            <li> The bottles are small but It seems to work. Ill be ordering more. Im Looking for the dark spot removal</li>
            <li> Best skin care product ever</li>
            <li> Excellent product-will order again</li>
            <li> I would consider this to be a &amp;#34;sample&amp;#34; packet of the product - although that is my fault for not looking at the size. For the price I should have just ordered the full size product. I do like how this product works.</li>
            <li> My skin looks SO MUCH better when I use Proactiv. I am very pleased I started using Proactiv and I am pleased with the low price as well as the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> My teenaged son has had a bad case of acne for more than a year now.  We&#x27;ve tried a variety of different medicines, one of which actually made his acne worse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like nothing we tried worked, so after hearing several friends recommend Proactiv, we decided to take the plunge and buy a 2-month supply, even though it&#x27;s a little expensive.  After using it for several weeks now, we&#x27;ve seen a very slight improvement in our son&#x27;s acne, but nothing major.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We finally got fed up with all of the over the counter stuff and decided to visit our pediatrician.  He told us that our son had 3-4 level acne on the Pillsbury scale which classifies the severity of acne from 1 to 4.  Our doctor said that what&#x27;s in Proactiv isn&#x27;t really that much different than what&#x27;s in most of the other over the counter products.  He also said that the main reason people who used it showed some improvement is because it motivated people to be regular in their acne hygiene routine - something teens are notorious for not being faithful with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s more, apparently the latest research shows that in severe cases of acne there is bacteria under the skin that must be treated by antibiotics and that treating it superficially isn&#x27;t likely to help much.  So now we&#x27;re moving from using Proactiv to using prescription antibiotics and some stronger prescription acne medicines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish us luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a less severe case of acne, then Proactiv might be for you: the main thing is to use it consistently.  But if you have a severe case, it&#x27;s not likely to help very much, and you&#x27;ll probably have to get a prescription for something stronger.</li>
            <li> Just got it today. Hopefully it gets the job done &amp;  takes the pimples away. I&#x27;ll be sure to update you on my progress as a month goes by. Shipped on time. Would buy from this seller again.   So its been about  2 weeks  since I bought  this  product , and I would never  recommend  it if you are a woman  of color . This made my  skin  tone 2 shades ligher than what it originally  was. The skin on my face of course. The  seller was great and everything  came on time, but the product was just not for me.</li>
            <li> Buyer was great. product was great</li>
            <li> Product worked decently for me, but the price is rather high for such small amount of product. $30 for 2 ounce cleanser and toner, and 1 oz repairing lotion is a rather steep price for me at least.   edit: apparently its changed to $45, even less worth it.</li>
            <li> Proactiv cleared my skin in 2 weeks!! I use it once a day instead of twice daily because it dries my skin too much. Other than that, I will be buying this product until I die if needed :)</li>
            <li> My daughter used this for 30 days and did see results. Her breakouts are not completely gone at this point but much, much improved. We re-ordered and are hopeful that another 30 days will bring more improvements. I think this product is worth a try. It&#x27;s not that expensive, nothing compared to the prescription medications she has been taking.</li>
            <li> I have been using proactive for a very long time and I love it, it works very well with my skin I have oily skin and keeps it under control and no breakouts. This is the only product I will use!!!</li>
            <li> Best acne skin care ever created</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE!!! First off I use proactive daily and it works great. I usually buy a 30 supply of Proactive from Amazon for $40 or so. I just received my 30 day supply and its rediculous how small the quantity is now. The cleanser and toner are usually 4oz  each, they are now 2oz. The renewing cleanser is usually 4oz, it is now 1oz. On Amazon their once 30 day supply is now a 60 day supply. So they price has gone up to $60. I use proactiv and will continue too. It just sucks that the price shot up.</li>
            <li> I love it. My skin is as clear as it has ever been. I tried everything, and this is what works for me.</li>
            <li> I would definatly recommend this product to anybody! As popular as they are I see why, It definatly clears up your face and eliminates pimples</li>
            <li> When I first received this I was concerned.  The bottles were much smaller than I anticipated.  The purchase was made for my 14 year old due to having an acne outbreak.  I have to say it was a good purchase.  We saw results after the first use.  He has been using it for a few weeks now, and not even daily.  I have to say his skin looks great.</li>
            <li> the bottles are 2oz was not happy for the price but this skin care regimn is awsome!! DEF BUY again</li>
            <li> My daughter and I cant live without this product! Gives you clean glowing clear skin from the very 1st time you use it!</li>
            <li> Yes my exception of proactiv is exactly what I thought it would be</li>
            <li> Proactive Plus works a lot better!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me but excellent for my little sister.</li>
            <li> My sister said it worked fine, thanks</li>
            <li> Is it supposed to be this small? And i&#x27;t didn&#x27;t even  come in a box.&lt;br /&gt;You can do much better come on</li>
            <li> love proactive works very well</li>
            <li> I have hormonal acne once a month and small flesh toned bumps on my forehead that just hang out and don&#x27;t go away...did nothing for either. Pouring gasoline on my face would have felt about as good as this stuff and accomplished just as much. NO THANKS!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my granddaughter for Xmas, she&#x27;s been using this and her face has cleared up completely. She&#x27;s got her confidence back and she looks amazing. She loves proactive . Totally recommend this for a pimple free face .</li>
            <li> I love Proactive, but I was disappointed with this for a number of reasons. First it was $41! the only reason I was willing to spend the money is because I didnt want to have to have the hassle of calling in and canceling and forgetting and getting charged extra. 2nd it was travel size! Maybe I read it over in the details but for $41 I expected the full size. Then it was very late getting to me, so I messaged the seller and she said that the order was cancelled because they couldn&#x27;t &amp;#34;deliver to my address&amp;#34; which is not true and I never received the email saying it was cancelled in the first place, and that it was refunded in full, however it was never refunded! But I don&#x27;t care for Drama so I just let it go (had the extra money to not get to mad) then I spent more money to get other acne medication, and a couple days later it showed up! So now I have a bathroom full of acne medication and an empty wallet.... I used proactive before and it works awesome for a few months but I have to break from it because it drys you out....but the seller never again</li>
            <li> Yes it meets my expectations great product.</li>
            <li> Works great with on my kid&#x27;s skin!</li>
            <li> Great product, will definitely buy again and reccommend to any one who is looking for such a product good job seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with the kit. Was packaged well and actually had a bonus included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Andrea K.</li>
            <li> I have seen the advertisements for Proactive for years. I have tried everything. Even went to the dermatologist. I finally got tired of being on antibiotics and Rx creams to clear up my acne. Most of it is hormonal now. After using proactive I LOVE IT...I will never settle for anything else. It has cleared my skin up, it looks radiant and more healthy. I even feel like I have a glow. Use this with the green tea moisturizer and you have a winner. I will be purchasing more in the future. This is worth the cost if you want great skin.</li>
            <li> The Proactive is a great product. This review is for the supplier. Not only was it going to take over a month to receive the product the size was a trail size which they failed to print in the decription. Do not buy from this supplier.</li>
            <li> Great price and best place to order so you don&#x27;t automatically get set up with auto shipments from Proactive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products but I always come back to proactiv because it just helps me to maintain my skin.</li>
            <li> Works well but lots of steps...very time consuming</li>
            <li> Did what it was suppose to do for the most part,but for the price the amount you receive doesn&#x27;t seem worth the price.Oj</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and she loves it! And it has her skin looking great!!</li>
            <li> Great size, does a good job at cleansing and helping problem skin.</li>
            <li> It broke me out out even worst!  But although it didn&#x27;t work for me, it may work for others because all skin types are different.</li>
            <li> gift for my daughter, she loves the product!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice drastic results but it wasn&#x27;t bad either. Felt a slight tingling when I used the face wash. I liked the lotion - it was light and moisturized well.</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t work for me. My skin is still broken out and it was very harsh.</li>
            <li> My daughter swears by this product ! She ABSOLUTLEY love it !</li>
            <li> Excellent quality product!</li>
            <li> I thought proactiv worked, although I do not think it is the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; product it claims.  It cleared up my skin, but left it somewhat dry.  It also was a very small amount of product for the price.  I don&#x27;t think I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews, I was unsure if it would work for my 14 year old son, so I ordered the 30-day supply. After 1 week of use there was significant improvement. My son was so happy to find a product that works. It may not work for everyone, but it definitely is worth trying it out. I just ordered the 90-day supply. It&#x27;s a little on the pricey side, so I can only afford to give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Stops working after some years.  does not cure acne/breakouts.  Better advice...use products with natural based ingredients not man made chemicals like these that you have to continue to use for years so they can keep making money off of you.  I&#x27;ve used this product since I was 16, I&#x27;m now 25...and it suddenly stopped working.  I tried a natural product and no longer get breakouts.  ProActiv is a money making scam.  Like I said, only works if you keep on using it!</li>
            <li> Hate the auto refills</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son. Did not work for him</li>
            <li> I just ordered this product.. But I&#x27;ve used it before. I personally love Proactive. But when my mom used it she broke up and it made her face dry. It just all depends on the person. Not the product.</li>
            <li> The picture is very deceiving. The bottles are tiny and there&#x27;s NO way these products will last thirty days!</li>
            <li> good only for teens with minor problems</li>
            <li> My grandson is very happy with this product</li>
