            <li>great product...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just great for hikers, works like a charm.</li>
            <li>I got this, and practiced in the shower like they said, but it worked great from the get-go.</li>
            <li>This will be great for bike week</li>
            <li>I used it 3-4 times on the 13 hour climb, and it was successful each time.</li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable to try out and does not leak at all!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get why there are so many great reviews for this product.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I keep it on the side pocket of my cargo pants to have it handy</li>
            <li>The device does work kind of like a squeegee, but of course, doesn&#x27;t take care of everything.</li>
            <li>It is light-weight, effective and durable.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s genius, it is the best new product since the iphone.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use, just read the instructions and follow it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to help her &amp;#34;pee in the bush.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It works reliably (which is VERY important)</li>
            <li>It is the most liberating tool any woman can have.  </li>
            <li>Much better product, and cheaper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just fabulous!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was pleased with this device.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li>I was home each time I tried it and was able to change clothes/underwear immediately.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried it out before giving it to them.</li>
            <li>I use these devices when I am hiking and love the freedom it gives me.</li>
            <li>and I feel like this product would be more durable.</li>
            <li>Sanitary and safe.</li>
            <li>It made my camping experience so much more enjoyable.</li>
            <li>I could go on forever about how much I love this.</li>
            <li>Better than the freshette, easy to use stows away.  </li>
            <li>This is the most important item in my day pack when I go hiking.  </li>
            <li>Very useful during pregnancy when you have to pee all the time while jogging/power walking (more pressure on the bladder).</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions to scrape off when finished, and was able to clean the device somewhat in the snow afterward.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time at home in the privacy of my own bathroom.</li>
            <li>I stored it on a black pencil case and fits perfect plus it&#x27;s discreet as well.</li>
            <li>This product is so easy to position, use, and clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This will really come in handy on an upcoming hike.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>i explained to my 4 yr old that she shd pee nice and easy</li>
            <li>just practice at home first :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many many many FUD&#x27;s (Female Urinary Devices) and this is my 2nd favorite, and the one I recommend the most because of</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to find in the woods even when it&#x27;s dark.</li>
            <li>just have to unstrap my hip belt, which is exactly why i bought it!</li>
            <li>since tried it 3 times and had a 100% success</li>
            <li>This product was just what I hoped - simple and effective.</li>
            <li>I can only go by what she says, but she makes it sound like it deserves more than 5 stars.</li>
            <li>for my &#x27;favorite&#x27; and other recommendations, see the comments below. :)</li>
            <li>dint manage to get it right</li>
            <li>and she managed to get it right ...</li>
            <li>I figured I shouldn&#x27;t have to practice just to get this thing position in the right spot.</li>
            <li>but I want something that works right out the box and doesn&#x27;t require practice to get it right.</li>
            <li>I would suggest trying it in the shower first, and then standing to pee.</li>
            <li>It was a very well-received gift!</li>
            <li>It works just as described and is nice when you don&#x27;t want to squat and pee when hiking/camping and other outdoor activities.</li>
            <li>I love it and use it now when I just feel like standing up or need to conserve on toilet paper.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a bit large, but I&#x27;d rather have a rigid plastic STP device than a flexible silicone one.</li>
            <li>I can do my business quickly and discreetly with no mess.</li>
            <li>even when you really really really have to go....</li>
            <li>It takes a bit of practice, but it is possibly one of the important invention created for women since the disposable maxipad.  </li>
            <li>Camping and hiking will be so much easier now.</li>
            <li>foolproof, really.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made my potty breaks while backpacking a much shorter affair.  </li>
            <li>Also wish it came with a really sturdy bag instead of a flimsy one.  </li>
            <li>It is also REALLY helpful for when you are camping and you are the type that likes to stay hydrated</li>
            <li>Even when I really had to go, this device could handle the pressure.</li>
            <li>It was my first technical climb, and my first time using any device of this type.</li>
            <li>I got this mostly for traveling and using in gross public restrooms.</li>
            <li>I fear that the more flexible silicone products might not last long.</li>
            <li>Why not break out your Pstyle and have a juice container or water bottle - something with a decent sized opening handy, kneel down and pee into it and set it out in your vestibule, zip back into your sleeping bag and go right back to sleep!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a little too large to fit in a pocket, but I just carry it in a bag in a backpack or purse.</li>
            <li>Would be good for someone recovering from surgery, who has a hard time getting back up from the potty seat.  </li>
            <li>I kept it in a zippered pouch made of recycled plastic, which kept it clean and away from my other things.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like that it is a bit longer than other models because when using privies on the trail, you aren&#x27;t always standing right over where ya need the flow to go (just being real about it).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The only reason I don&#x27;t give it a 5* rating, is that when you push the top down with your thumbs (remember - gravity is your friend with the flow)</li>
            <li>I love this thing because it&#x27;s a hard plastic and extends pretty far back.  </li>
            <li>Easy to pack in an outside pocket on your pack, or to simply stick in the back pocket of your pants.</li>
            <li>It still works very well, whether you use it directly into nature, or into a bag or bottle in an urban setting.  </li>
            <li>Me and my 4 yr old did mange to use it without any  mishaps .....</li>
            <li>I take it on all-day hikes, and use it overnight in my tent on camping trips with an old plastic bottle I&#x27;ve marked with a skull and crossbones.</li>
            <li>There is no mess because you use the end of the device to &amp;#34;squeegee&amp;#34; any remaining liquid away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of hard to tell in the pictures, but it is about as long as your hand from wrist to fingertips.</li>
            <li>I went straight for the toilet and had no problems at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No longer must we cower in fear of our bare behinds being seen by some passing intruder!  </li>
            <li>I bought this out of sheer frustration after a particularly horrendous camping trip that involved me getting up in the middle of the night to pee</li>
            <li>Simply position the wider end near your urethral opening and let nature run its course.  </li>
            <li>Only complaint is that it is too slippery and can fall out of a pack pocket easy.  </li>
            <li>Also, as the only female in a group of male hikers, it&#x27;s a great help that I can pop behind a tree and go without having to pull my pants down.</li>
            <li>I was able to practice a couple of times before the climb, but on the climb was the first time I had used it outdoors and in a place where I would be unable to clean up if things went wrong.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend a few &amp;#34;dry runs.&amp;#34; Haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With this gizmo, I just discreetly find something to stand behind, and can quickly &amp;#34;do my thing&amp;#34; and get back to work.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and bought this STP device after having been stung multiple times by a hornet while relieving myself outdoors.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never been told mine are any different than other women</li>
            <li> shoes/pant legs and underwear stays dry).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have to pull my pants down, just open the zipper place the pStyle</li>
            <li> I feel less likely to lose it</li>
            <li> This little puppy seems like it will last forever.</li>
            <li> Well let me tell you that this bad boy was more of a miss than a hit.</li>
            <li> This product performs exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li> I sent those back, because if I&#x27;m having trouble getting this thing to do its job without getting wet, I know it would be a disaster for my mom with her</li>
            <li> It does feel weird after a lifetime of conditioning to pee standing up wearing my jeans still pulled up, but I have never so much as gotten a drop on myself.</li>
            <li> If germs are an issue, it can be wiped down with an anti-bacterial wipe and cleaned in soap and water at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> it hurts my thumb pads slightly...</li>
            <li> We woke up half the camp and it was so embarrassing that I swore I was going to figure out a solution.</li>
            <li> frequently - imagine you are in your tent and you need to get up at 2am in the morning and go outside, get dressed, into the cold wilderness where it can be rainy, damp, etc.</li>
            <li> I was one of only two females, so squatting would have been even more awkward and/or inconvenient.</li>
            <li> I take my little daughter camping a lot.</li>
            <li> It is a little awkward, but it certainly does the job.</li>
            <li> No longer are we required to find a hiding place behind the bushes, or feel jealousy toward our male counterparts.  </li>
            <li> No more dropping my pants and squatting.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many many many FUD&#x27;s (Female Urinary Devices) and this is my 2nd favorite, and the one I recommend the most because of it&#x27;s affordable cost.  It works reliably (which is VERY important) even when you really really really have to go.... in the woods, in a public restroom (i.e when dressed in tons of gear you don&#x27;t want to remove), in a parking lot...wherever.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I don&#x27;t give it a 5* rating, is that when you push the top down with your thumbs (remember - gravity is your friend with the flow) it hurts my thumb pads slightly... and, I wish the funnel exit was enclosed as a tube and not open.  It&#x27;s also a little too large to fit in a pocket, but I just carry it in a bag in a backpack or purse. It still works very well, whether you use it directly into nature, or into a bag or bottle in an urban setting.  Cheers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every woman needs an FUD &#x3D; Freedom ☼&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS:  for my &#x27;favorite&#x27; and other recommendations, see the comments below. :)</li>
            <li> Me and my 4 yr old did mange to use it without any  mishaps ..... But that was at home  lets see how it does with layers of clothes ... Any y the ppl who had issues with it overflowing dint manage to get it right is beyond me coz i explained to my 4 yr old that she shd pee nice and easy As vs opening the flood gates and she managed to get it right ...</li>
            <li> As described! Not yet tried.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!! Used for 3 weeks on the AT... great product... just practice at home first :)</li>
            <li> It is the most liberating tool any woman can have.  No longer are we required to find a hiding place behind the bushes, or feel jealousy toward our male counterparts.  No longer must we cower in fear of our bare behinds being seen by some passing intruder!  No longer must one fuss with an uncomfortable costume at a festival, or miserably crouch over a disgusting porta potty!  It takes a bit of practice, but it is possibly one of the important invention created for women since the disposable maxipad.  Hail the inventor!</li>
            <li> This is the most important item in my day pack when I go hiking.  No more dropping my pants and squatting.  I can do my business quickly and discreetly with no mess.</li>
            <li> This product performs exactly as expected.  I use it all the time, even at home, especially in the summer.  Helps to prevent &amp;#34;heat rash&amp;#34;, if you get my drift.  Would be good for someone recovering from surgery, who has a hard time getting back up from the potty seat.  No need to strain those stomach muscles until they are healed.</li>
            <li> I take my little daughter camping a lot. It&#x27;s nice to be able to help her &amp;#34;pee in the bush.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is so awesome!  As soon as it got here I raced to the shower to try it out. It is very comfortable to try out and does not leak at all! Camping and hiking will be so much easier now.</li>
            <li> This is the product you need for those nasty bathrooms, outhouses, or out on the trail.  I love this thing because it&#x27;s a hard plastic and extends pretty far back.  No leakage.  I tried the Freshette with disastrous results, and since bought the pstyle.  Much better product, and cheaper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s foolproof, really.  Just put it in position, close the to body and, let &#x27;er rip!  It&#x27;s made my potty breaks while backpacking a much shorter affair.  No learning curve involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wipe it out or rinse when you&#x27;re done and seal in a ziploc bag.  It can get funky after a day or so if you don&#x27;t get all the residual off of it before stowing.</li>
            <li> I bought this for hiking in 2011. It&#x27;s just great for hikers, works like a charm. I keep it on the side pocket of my cargo pants to have it handy wrapped on a hankie. I don&#x27;t even have to pull my pants down, just open the zipper place the pStyle and I&#x27;m done. Just fabulous! But husband and I travel on the country roads a lot, where there&#x27;s no gas station or bathroom. So I bought another one to keep in the side pocket of the passenger door. I stored it on a black pencil case and fits perfect plus it&#x27;s discreet as well. Mine are orange color. It&#x27;s great to find in the woods even when it&#x27;s dark. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is one of the easiest STP devices I have purchased.  I would suggest trying it in the shower first, and then standing to pee. Simply position the wider end near your urethral opening and let nature run its course.  Remember to shake it off after to remove any excess urine and sterilize it regularly.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with backflow, but have used other STP devices that proved disastrous.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to take on a climb on Mt. Hood. It was my first technical climb, and my first time using any device of this type. I was able to practice a couple of times before the climb, but on the climb was the first time I had used it outdoors and in a place where I would be unable to clean up if things went wrong. I used it 3-4 times on the 13 hour climb, and it was successful each time. Given that there were men climbing ahead, behind, and with me, and because of the frigid temperatures, I was grateful not to have to disrobe to pee, and I didn&#x27;t have any problems with dripping. I followed the instructions to scrape off when finished, and was able to clean the device somewhat in the snow afterward. I kept it in a zippered pouch made of recycled plastic, which kept it clean and away from my other things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased with this device. It is a little awkward, but it certainly does the job.</li>
            <li> A great product! What an invention! No more freezing my butt off during cold weather hiking, no more mess (shoes/pant legs and underwear stays dry). Very easy to use, just read the instructions and follow it. Very useful during pregnancy when you have to pee all the time while jogging/power walking (more pressure on the bladder).</li>
            <li> Excellent product for women hikers / backpackers.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and not more squatting. This is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I consider it a must have.</li>
            <li> I bought this out of sheer frustration after a particularly horrendous camping trip that involved me getting up in the middle of the night to pee and our dog pushing past me to tear out of the tent and chase a raccoon. We woke up half the camp and it was so embarrassing that I swore I was going to figure out a solution. I got this, and practiced in the shower like they said, but it worked great from the get-go. It does feel weird after a lifetime of conditioning to pee standing up wearing my jeans still pulled up, but I have never so much as gotten a drop on myself. I take it on all-day hikes, and use it overnight in my tent on camping trips with an old plastic bottle I&#x27;ve marked with a skull and crossbones. Get this! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get why there are so many great reviews for this product. I got this mostly for traveling and using in gross public restrooms. I decided to try it out before my next trip after reading some of the reviews.  I am so glad that I did. After watching the YouTube video by the company and thoroughly reading the directions, I figured how hard can it be. Well let me tell you that this bad boy was more of a miss than a hit. 7 out of 10 times I got some leakage on my clothes. UNACCEPTABLE!!!!  Good thing I was home each time I tried it and was able to change clothes/underwear immediately. I figured I shouldn&#x27;t have to practice just to get this thing position in the right spot. I had bought several hoping they would work for my family members who would be traveling with me.  I&#x27;m glad I tried it out before giving it to them. I sent those back, because if I&#x27;m having trouble getting this thing to do its job without getting wet, I know it would be a disaster for my mom with her arthritis.&lt;br /&gt;I bought Freshette and it is a no brainer. IT WORKED!!. Yeah, its almost double the price but I want something that works right out the box and doesn&#x27;t require practice to get it right.</li>
            <li> Love it!  It was a very well-received gift!</li>
            <li> Better than the freshette, easy to use stows away.  Only complaint is that it is too slippery and can fall out of a pack pocket easy.  Also wish it came with a really sturdy bag instead of a flimsy one.  I use these devices when I am hiking and love the freedom it gives me.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and bought this STP device after having been stung multiple times by a hornet while relieving myself outdoors. This product is so easy to position, use, and clean. It is a bit large, but I&#x27;d rather have a rigid plastic STP device than a flexible silicone one. I feel less likely to lose it and I feel like this product would be more durable.</li>
            <li> I wanted something to make it easier to pee when I go out to this camping rave tomorrow. It may take a bit of practice, but it does the job!! I love it and use it now when I just feel like standing up or need to conserve on toilet paper.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy.</li>
            <li> This is a game changer. It works just as described and is nice when you don&#x27;t want to squat and pee when hiking/camping and other outdoor activities. It is also REALLY helpful for when you are camping and you are the type that likes to stay hydrated so you pee frequently - imagine you are in your tent and you need to get up at 2am in the morning and go outside, get dressed, into the cold wilderness where it can be rainy, damp, etc. Why not break out your Pstyle and have a juice container or water bottle - something with a decent sized opening handy, kneel down and pee into it and set it out in your vestibule, zip back into your sleeping bag and go right back to sleep!</li>
            <li> Some reviewers have mentioned using this in the shower to try to get the hang of it. I went straight for the toilet and had no problems at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since tried it 3 times and had a 100% success rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will really come in handy on an upcoming hike. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> I purchesed this for a backpacking trip, works perfect!  Easy to clean.  I do not have to take my pack off just have to unstrap my hip belt, which is exactly why i bought it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m out in the field all day. If I had to run inside every time I needed to go, I&#x27;d never get anything done. With this gizmo, I just discreetly find something to stand behind, and can quickly &amp;#34;do my thing&amp;#34; and get back to work. There is no mess because you use the end of the device to &amp;#34;squeegee&amp;#34; any remaining liquid away. If germs are an issue, it can be wiped down with an anti-bacterial wipe and cleaned in soap and water at the end of the day. I&#x27;ve never had even the least problem using it. Can&#x27;t recommend it enough to fellow outdoor working women.</li>
            <li> I wish I bought this last year before my thru hike. It is 100% awesome! Works great! I wish it come with a case.</li>
            <li> You just gotta practice!  This will be great for bike week</li>
            <li> Does the job well with a bit of practice. Sanitary and safe. No more fears of using dirty bathrooms when traveling.</li>
            <li> This product was just what I hoped - simple and effective. I used it for the first time at home in the privacy of my own bathroom. I highly recommend a few &amp;#34;dry runs.&amp;#34; Haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This weekend I took it on a group camping trip. I was one of only two females, so squatting would have been even more awkward and/or inconvenient. This device never leaked. Never. Even when I may have been, shall we say, a bit out of sorts. Even when I really had to go, this device could handle the pressure. I do recommend wearing a panty liner, unless you are using actual TP. The device does work kind of like a squeegee, but of course, doesn&#x27;t take care of everything. I like that it is made of a hard plastic because it is durable. I fear that the more flexible silicone products might not last long. This little puppy seems like it will last forever. After use, I simply shook it off and wrapped it in a handkerchief. I kept in nearby at all times and never once smelled any unpleasant odors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a camper/backpacker, this is, in my opinion, the only device you need. It is light-weight, effective and durable. It made my camping experience so much more enjoyable. It&#x27;s kind of hard to tell in the pictures, but it is about as long as your hand from wrist to fingertips. Easy to pack in an outside pocket on your pack, or to simply stick in the back pocket of your pants. I could go on forever about how much I love this. Happy peeing, ladies!</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t figure it out.  It&#x27;s awkward and you have to push the back end against you so hard to make a seal that it&#x27;s very hard to do.  I&#x27;ve seen a lot of lady parts and I&#x27;ve never been told mine are any different than other women but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.  Pee all over myself no matter what I did.</li>
            <li> Such a simple product, but such a life savor on the trail.  I like that it is a bit longer than other models because when using privies on the trail, you aren&#x27;t always standing right over where ya need the flow to go (just being real about it).  Also, as the only female in a group of male hikers, it&#x27;s a great help that I can pop behind a tree and go without having to pull my pants down.</li>
            <li> This is life changing.  There is no reason to fear public restrooms or being away from restrooms outdoors.  It works, it&#x27;s genius, it is the best new product since the iphone.  Trust me girls, this item will rock your world.</li>
            <li> And she loves it! Uses it all the time, actually. No splashback, no nothing. I can only go by what she says, but she makes it sound like it deserves more than 5 stars.</li>
