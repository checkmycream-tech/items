            <li>It&#x27;s easy and always produces a great color.</li>
            <li>I just throw it away and use my own shampoo.</li>
            <li>I told him the brand home hair color I use, because it is natural, and he said my color looks great!  </li>
            <li>My hair is very light underneath the color though</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years and love it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I love this hair color.  </li>
            <li>and they like it better than my salon color.  </li>
            <li>and I can say I&#x27;m completely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years and love the color, how my hair feels after using the product, the length of time the color stays in my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this pruduct and color for many years.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair color.</li>
            <li>Great color hydrating and gentle</li>
            <li>I love not smelling the strong ammonia</li>
            <li>My hair stylist always asks what I&#x27;m doing to keep it so healthy, because I rarely even need a trim!</li>
            <li>This batch was extra fresh and seemed to the best job yet from my experience.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t smell like chemical, is very mild and easy to apply and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>and I think it may be a fine texture that won&#x27;t hold color</li>
            <li>The conditioner included in the box is fine.</li>
            <li>I waited to post my review until I applied it a second time because I wanted to see how my hair looked and felt after 2 applications, and my hair looks and feels great.  </li>
            <li>Great price compared to local prices!  </li>
            <li>You might want to try one box first to see if it&#x27;s right for you.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love that this product is ammonia free, but I really love that I can color my hair and go out the SAME DAY without that tell-tale lingering ammonia smell of other brands.</li>
            <li>This was my first try with Naturtint, having switched now that Revlon is allowing their products to be tested in China for the China market.</li>
            <li>I also tried another one that was supposed to be filled with natural things and with henna.  </li>
            <li>I decided to switch to this color for exactly that reason.</li>
            <li>My beautician says my hair is in much better condition than it was using my former hair color.  </li>
            <li>Good alternative to all the harsh chemical hair coloring products</li>
            <li>Nice natural hair color that does not dry out my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have been using naturtint, and recently noticed that I had a ton of hair falling out and more irritation than normal.  </li>
            <li>So much so I bought myself a gift along with it.  </li>
            <li>It looks very natural, I really like this color.</li>
            <li>All of these items have highly toxic things in them.  </li>
            <li>This color is easy to use and turns out just like it looks on the box, but for me because I wash my hair every other day</li>
            <li>This was very gentle, did not dry out my hair</li>
            <li>The first application I use the typical hairdresser tools, I use gloves to extend it properly, and I am able to do it myself without problem</li>
            <li>but I could live with that.</li>
            <li>The color is very natural looking.</li>
            <li>I often do not use any on my ends, especially if I&#x27;m re coloring with same color, and my hair has never been this long or this healthy.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive, have auto immune disorders, etc., pass on this.  </li>
            <li>I had friends tell me it looks so natural</li>
            <li>It however is not 100% natural</li>
            <li>It is not harsh so I don&#x27;t worry about coloring my hair every month.</li>
            <li>It is all natural and does not look like you have ever dyed your hair.</li>
            <li>This color stays vibrant even with daily sun exposure.</li>
            <li>More disturbed that the Naturtint color didn&#x27;t last, despite only a few washings (with shampoos meant for color-treated hair).</li>
            <li>For sure I don&#x27;t mix it all at the same time, 1 mix half and half, only using the application bottle on the second application.</li>
            <li>Very drying and leaves my hair a tangled matted mess.</li>

            <li> I wait until it grows out at least a half an inch which takes about a month and color again.  </li>
            <li> I stay away from color with ammonia, and henna is so hard to use and messy.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wait until you are older and sick</li>
            <li> and it is much less irritating to the skin.</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s not that bad.  </li>
            <li> he said that repeated coverage each month can weaken and cause hair to look frizzy and unhealthy overtime.)</li>

            <li> This is not all &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; at all and still is bad for us.  </li>
            <li> We women have to stop making ourselves sick over trying not to look our age or change our hair color.  </li>
            <li> I used to get my hair colored at the salon, but after sitting with my head burning (something seems very wrong about that!)</li>

            <li> This was my first try with Naturtint, having switched now that Revlon is allowing their products to be tested in China for the China market. Was not impressed with the condition of my hair once it was dyed but I could live with that. More disturbed that the Naturtint color didn&#x27;t last, despite only a few washings (with shampoos meant for color-treated hair). Will be looking for a different cruelty-free hair dye.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and love it.&lt;br /&gt;The color doesn&#x27;t fade and the best part is that&lt;br /&gt;it does not have s.any chemical</li>

            <li> This batch was extra fresh and seemed to the best job yet from my experience.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended! Will always buy this way if possible.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.</li>
            <li> I have been using naturtint, and recently noticed that I had a ton of hair falling out and more irritation than normal.  People here have discussed the PPD.  I am allergic to a lot of things.  This is not all &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; at all and still is bad for us.  If you are sensitive, have auto immune disorders, etc., pass on this.  I would actually recommend passing on all hair color at this point.  I also tried another one that was supposed to be filled with natural things and with henna.  It burned my scalp as well and frizzed up my hair.  All of these items have highly toxic things in them.  I am going gray and going to try to embrace that instead of a clump of hair every time I do my roots.  So far, it&#x27;s not that bad.  It&#x27;s been about 45 days.  I just french brain my hair so it all mixes together until I grow it out.  We women have to stop making ourselves sick over trying not to look our age or change our hair color.  Don&#x27;t wait until you are older and sick like I am to make this decision.  It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> Perfect color, have reordered many times!</li>
            <li> I love this hair color.  I waited to post my review until I applied it a second time because I wanted to see how my hair looked and felt after 2 applications, and my hair looks and feels great.  I had friends tell me it looks so natural and they like it better than my salon color.  I definitely recommend others to give it a try.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, good for my hair and head and good color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product. I have Sjogrens Syndrome so I have to be very careful what I use on my hair and skin. This was very gentle, did not dry out my hair and I love the end result!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product. I have trouble picking up reds with blonde formulas but not with this one. The color is very natural looking. This is the best price I found on it, I buy the 6 pack they offer - great deal. You might want to try one box first to see if it&#x27;s right for you. I love not smelling the strong ammonia and it is much less irritating to the skin. It however is not 100% natural so you may want to research that. I have been dying my hair for 40 years. My hair condition has neither improved or declined with this product.</li>
            <li> Great price compared to local prices!  So much so I bought myself a gift along with it.  As long as you&#x27;re content with sticking with the same color, the packaged deal just makes sense.</li>
            <li> It looks very natural, I really like this color. Also, it doesn&#x27;t smell like chemical, is very mild and easy to apply and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I only use it on my roots, so 1 pack last for 2 applications. For sure I don&#x27;t mix it all at the same time, 1 mix half and half, only using the application bottle on the second application. The first application I use the typical hairdresser tools, I use gloves to extend it properly, and I am able to do it myself without problem&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for almost a year and I can say I&#x27;m completely satisfied with it. Not checking to change anytime soon.</li>
            <li> I love Naturtint! Since using it, I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments on my hair color (even from my hair dresser!). I used to get my hair colored at the salon, but after sitting with my head burning (something seems very wrong about that!) and all the money spent, I started doing my color touchups myself at home. I told him the brand home hair color I use, because it is natural, and he said my color looks great!  (His only advice was just to only color the roots each month - and not do the last 5 min suggestion to spread to rest of the hair- he said that repeated coverage each month can weaken and cause hair to look frizzy and unhealthy overtime.) I love that this product is ammonia free, but I really love that I can color my hair and go out the SAME DAY without that tell-tale lingering ammonia smell of other brands. Great color! Great coverage! Great smell! Love it!!</li>
            <li> A color in between a yellow and an ash blonde--nice and subtle.  I decided to switch to this color for exactly that reason.</li>
            <li> Nice natural hair color that does not dry out my hair.  I stay away from color with ammonia, and henna is so hard to use and messy.  This color is easy to use and turns out just like it looks on the box, but for me because I wash my hair every other day it fades to a lighter blond within a couple of weeks.  My hair is very light underneath the color though and I think it may be a fine texture that won&#x27;t hold color that well anymore.  I wait until it grows out at least a half an inch which takes about a month and color again.  It is not harsh so I don&#x27;t worry about coloring my hair every month.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and love the color, how my hair feels after using the product, the length of time the color stays in my hair.</li>
            <li> Great product, lightens without peroxide</li>
            <li> I color my hair with Naturtint about every 8-9 weeks following the roots touch-up instructions. It&#x27;s easy and always produces a great color. I&#x27;ve never mixed it with other shades. I use the included shampoo and conditioner packet over the 3 days following each coloring. This color stays vibrant even with daily sun exposure.</li>
            <li> Very happy with product.</li>
            <li> Great color. Last longer than store products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this pruduct and color for many years. Great hair color BUT the small packet of shampoo they have been including with it in recent months is is awful. Very drying and leaves my hair a tangled matted mess. I just throw it away and use my own shampoo. The conditioner included in the box is fine.</li>
            <li> I purchase this hair dye for my daughter and myself.  It is all natural and does not look like you have ever dyed your hair. The color is shiney and beautiful.  No damaged hair!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair color. I&#x27;ve been using it for years now, though I will choose between different shades on occasion. I often do not use any on my ends, especially if I&#x27;m re coloring with same color, and my hair has never been this long or this healthy. My hair stylist always asks what I&#x27;m doing to keep it so healthy, because I rarely even need a trim!</li>
            <li> Great color hydrating and gentle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year.  Naturtint is great because it doesn&#x27;t fade.  I color my hair the same week I get my hair cut and the color looks the same the day I recolor it.  It is very gentle on my hair.  My beautician says my hair is in much better condition than it was using my former hair color.  She told me to keep using the Naturtint color because of the way it makes my hair look and feel.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dye!!  I get a tons of compliments on the color, asking where I got it done.  One of the best parts is there is zero smell and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m killing myself with all the chemicals.</li>
