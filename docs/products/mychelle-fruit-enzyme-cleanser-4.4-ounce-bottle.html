            <li>/&gt;Update - October 2012 - still use it... still love it</li>
            <li>This was a fantastic two-pack deal!</li>
            <li>Pleasant mild smell and good foaming action.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, lathers well and leaves my skin squeaky clean - that is, too squeaky clean for my taste.</li>
            <li>I have been hunting down the best cleanser for years now!</li>
            <li>I thought it was a little bit drying for my skin, though she thought it was perfect for her, and prefers the sudsing cleansers, like this one.  </li>
            <li>I rarely get a zit now and my skin looks so much more even toned and smooth.  </li>
            <li>MyChelle Fruit Enzyme Cleanser has controlled the oil on my skin, made it silky smooth and has controlled my breakouts.  </li>
            <li>This product is vegan friendly.</li>
            <li>You can visit the Mychelle website for a list of vegetarian and vegan friendly products.</li>
            <li>skimp on face cleanser and the instrument you use to clean your&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is combination and this does a nice job of clearing the oil in my t-zone without completely stripping the rest of my face.</li>
            <li>I know others of you have had good experiences with the MyChelle line, and this cleanser, but this is my personal review of a product that did not work for me.</li>
            <li>i love it so much</li>
            <li>The 2 pack is a great bargain and much less costly than purchasing in a store.</li>
            <li>and my skin feels so soft and healthy</li>
            <li>I have tried almost every popular facial product advertised and none of them have come close to this..</li>
            <li>really worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I also like the clear complexion cleanser, but it is a tad bit more drying.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is so fresh when i wash my face with it every morning and night before i put my acne cream on.</li>
            <li>The issue I have with this cleanser is the more ingredients you have in something, the more chance for irritation and interference with other products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gentle cleanser, primarily because there are no chemicals, but it really cleans.</li>
            <li>completely removes makeup, even most eye makeup leaving skin literally squeaky clean and really soft.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use very much so these bottles</li>
            <li>It is very gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li>This really isn&#x27;t the product for me, since the alpha hydroxy acid makes my skin burn very easily when exposed to the sun for even a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>and leaves your skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well for a gel cleanser and does not overly-dry the skin.</li>
            <li>Okay so let me start by saying that I am 30 years old, and for the past 4 years my face has suffered greatly with hormonal and stress related acne.</li>
            <li>: Use exactly how much the bottle says...</li>
            <li>I really wanted it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also happen to to think the product is over-priced in that it does not cost the company nearly as much as they charge to make the product.</li>
            <li>I like the way that it refreshes my skin and helps to gently exfoliate it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I will have to stick with a more basic, natural cleanser.</li>
            <li>I appreciate MyChelle is a welcome change from harsh sulfates and other nasties found in so many commercial beauty</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame, because I like the most other things about it.</li>
            <li>This is perfect and doesn&#x27;t make my skin angry!  </li>
            <li>it removes allllll oils ( because my skin is super oily) and make it dewy looking not dry at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different natural facial cleansers and none have really done the trick until now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great alternative for expensive, perfumed cleansers from department stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;little super soft facial brush</li>
            <li>couple tips to new users</li>
            <li>New to it, but have completely converted.  </li>
            <li>My face is clear, looks brighter, and I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin balanced and clear.</li>
            <li>It kind of has a weird old fruit smell and it doesnt really foam up</li>
            <li>I wanted to go the all natural route</li>
            <li>This stuff cleanses without over drying, leaves your skin soft and glowing.</li>
            <li>My skin gets clean without feeling dried out or irritated.</li>
            <li>I think that Mychelle has some decent cleansers and this is definitely one of them.</li>
            <li>Another plus is that one bottle seems to last forever because it takes less than a dime size amount to clean your face.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out too much</li>
            <li>water down the cleanser with water first.</li>
            <li>small amount will be enough to clean your face and throat.</li>

            <li> I have sensitive skin that is acne prone in some areas but dry prone in other areas.</li>
            <li> last s long time!</li>
            <li> Also, my skin tends to be rather sensitive and will get red and splotchy if I use something too harsh.  </li>
            <li> Skin is acidic &amp; needs acidic cleansers so that it won&#x27;t dry out.  </li>
            <li> skin is used to active ingredients such as AHA&#x27;s, and my skin responds well to glycolic and lactic acid for example.</li>
            <li> personally like the feel of the cleanser and the fact that I need so little of it.</li>

            <li> Also, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amt.</li>
            <li> I was using small amounts at night with a very basic moisturizer I have always used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my skin (especially around my nose and cheeks and forehead) is red, bumpy, dry and irritated since using this cleanser.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so I just bought the small one.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s too harsh on my dehydrated combo skin.</li>
            <li> but it has gotten a bit expensive in the last year or so, even with that i still order and continue using it.</li>
            <li> No more.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve hardly put a dent in it.</li>
            <li> I am in my 30&#x27;s and still break out sometimes, but with this cleanser I hardly ever break out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for at least 3 years now and don&#x27;t see myself changing anytime soon.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for over a year. It&#x27;s a gentle cleanser, primarily because there are no chemicals, but it really cleans. I haven&#x27;t had a breakout since I started using this and my skin feels so soft and healthy; I won&#x27;t use anything else. I also signed up for Subscribe &amp; Save, saved 15% and have it automatically delivered every two months. You can sign up on this product page. It&#x27;s genius.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every popular facial product advertised and none of them have come close to this..well maybe caudalie foaming cleanser, but this is way cheaper. Its great! completely removes makeup, even most eye makeup leaving skin literally squeaky clean and really soft. It kind of has a weird old fruit smell and it doesnt really foam up that well but its still good. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> this stuff cleans it off and wakes you up. At a great price too. A little goes a long way. I keep mine in the shower and use it with a&lt;br /&gt;little super soft facial brush ( Mine was from Shiseido) one thing not&lt;br /&gt;to skimp on face cleanser and the instrument you use to clean your&lt;br /&gt;face with. I got a second bottle it&#x27;s that good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cleanser for several years.  It is wonderful for oily or combination skin.  It only takes a small amt. and leaves your skin smooth and soft. The 2 pack is a great bargain and much less costly than purchasing in a store.</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t bother me at all comparing to the result after used.Love it and will order s&#x27;more!</li>
            <li> Okay so let me start by saying that I am 30 years old, and for the past 4 years my face has suffered greatly with hormonal and stress related acne. I have scars to prove it. I have tried everything under the sun to help this issue. I was using ProActive, Nuetrogena, etc.. Everything was too drying, or just didn&#x27;t work! I wanted to go the all natural route so I checked out MyChelle products. I am a faithful costumer now! The fruit enzyme cleanser, and white cranberry cleanser are wonderful. My face is clear, looks brighter, and I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple tips to new users: Use exactly how much the bottle says...a pearl sized amount.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t water down the cleanser with water first. Use a couple pumps of the fruit enzyme mist to suds up. The results are awesome! Make up melts away! I also use the cleansers with my Clarisonic as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and have been changing my makeup rather than my cleanser!  MyChelle Fruit Enzyme Cleanser has controlled the oil on my skin, made it silky smooth and has controlled my breakouts.  I wish that I had this cleanser 10 years ago when my breakouts started!  Great product and really worth the money.</li>
            <li> I think that Mychelle has some decent cleansers and this is definitely one of them. It works pretty well for a gel cleanser and does not overly-dry the skin. My skin is combination and this does a nice job of clearing the oil in my t-zone without completely stripping the rest of my face. A little goes a long way, so I just bought the small one. I&#x27;ve been using it for three months and I&#x27;ve hardly put a dent in it. For the price you can&#x27;t beat it  (although now that I&#x27;ve tried REN&#x27;s Mayblossom cleanser [which is AMAZING for combination skin!] I might just splurge and cough up more to have that instead).</li>
            <li> I appreciate MyChelle is a welcome change from harsh sulfates and other nasties found in so many commercial beauty products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally like the feel of the cleanser and the fact that I need so little of it. Unfortunately my skin (especially around my nose and cheeks and forehead) is red, bumpy, dry and irritated since using this cleanser. I was using small amounts at night with a very basic moisturizer I have always used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is used to active ingredients such as AHA&#x27;s, and my skin responds well to glycolic and lactic acid for example. The issue I have with this cleanser is the more ingredients you have in something, the more chance for irritation and interference with other products. I know others of you have had good experiences with the MyChelle line, and this cleanser, but this is my personal review of a product that did not work for me. I really wanted it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will have to stick with a more basic, natural cleanser. I also happen to to think the product is over-priced in that it does not cost the company nearly as much as they charge to make the product. Although I don&#x27;t mind paying a lot for something that I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps someone else with finicky skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of MyChelle and this cleanser doesn&#x27;t disappoint. Pleasant mild smell and good foaming action. You don&#x27;t need to use very much so these bottles last s long time! Worth every penny. Goes great with the fruit enzyme mist.</li>
            <li> My mom loves the fruit enzyme cleanser.  I tried this one and thought it was okay.  I thought it was a little bit drying for my skin, though she thought it was perfect for her, and prefers the sudsing cleansers, like this one.  I prefer the cream cleansers, and went back to using the pumpkin cream cleanser, which my skin prefers.  So it&#x27;s a good product, just not the one I prefer.</li>
            <li> Love this line.  New to it, but have completely converted.  I even have my husband using the mens stuff.  Great price here.  Love that it has no chemicals and will not pollute my body or the world.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a couple of years now and the more I use it the better my skin looks!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic cleanser that smells great. I have sensitive skin that is acne prone in some areas but dry prone in other areas. My skin gets clean without feeling dried out or irritated. My husband also likes to use this cleanser. Another plus is that one bottle seems to last forever because it takes less than a dime size amount to clean your face. This product is vegan friendly. You can visit the Mychelle website for a list of vegetarian and vegan friendly products.</li>
            <li> This really isn&#x27;t the product for me, since the alpha hydroxy acid makes my skin burn very easily when exposed to the sun for even a short amount of time. It&#x27;s a shame, because I like the most other things about it. It is expensive.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser. I use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small amount will be enough to clean your face and throat. It is very gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different natural facial cleansers and none have really done the trick until now. I am in my 30&#x27;s and still break out sometimes, but with this cleanser I hardly ever break out. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out too much and it&#x27;s not oily at all. It keeps my skin balanced and clear. I also like the clear complexion cleanser, but it is a tad bit more drying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. Glad to have found it here for a great price.  The 2 pack is nice.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is so fresh when i wash my face with it every morning and night before i put my acne cream on. it removes allllll oils ( because my skin is super oily) and make it dewy looking not dry at all. i love it so much but it has gotten a bit expensive in the last year or so, even with that i still order and continue using it. i recommended to mostly oily skin people based on my results.</li>
            <li> Skin is acidic &amp; needs acidic cleansers so that it won&#x27;t dry out.  This cleanser is great for my combo skin, it removes makeup and excess oil and still leaves my skin moisturized.  I&#x27;ve been using it for at least 3 years now and don&#x27;t see myself changing anytime soon.  It&#x27;s a great alternative for expensive, perfumed cleansers from department stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - October 2012 - still use it... still love it</li>
            <li> I like this cleanser and really appreciate the fact that I can use it for removing eye makeup as well without crying in the shower. It smells nice, lathers well and leaves my skin squeaky clean - that is, too squeaky clean for my taste. I know that a lot of girls look for that feeling but I think it&#x27;s too harsh on my dehydrated combo skin. I&#x27;ll go back to a milder cleanser that I can use with my Clarisonic Mia instead of this product which strips my skin of all possible moisture..</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleanser for about a year now.  I LOVE it!  I used to have problems with breakouts and oily skin.  No more.  I rarely get a zit now and my skin looks so much more even toned and smooth.  Also, my skin tends to be rather sensitive and will get red and splotchy if I use something too harsh.  This is perfect and doesn&#x27;t make my skin angry!  It smells great too.  Also, a little goes a long way - one bottle will last me a couple of months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Fruit Enzyme Cleanser for about two years now.  I like the way that it refreshes my skin and helps to gently exfoliate it.  I use it on a daily basis.  This was a fantastic two-pack deal!</li>
            <li> I have been hunting down the best cleanser for years now! This stuff cleanses without over drying, leaves your skin soft and glowing. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do any thing but break me out</li>
            <li> Great cleanser.  Foams nicely,  leaves my face feeling very clean.  Also keeps impurities at bay.  This my go to cleanser.</li>
