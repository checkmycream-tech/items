            <li>You smell fresh... !!!</li>
            <li>What can I say, if you love cologne, and owning a library of mens colognes like I do, then you will love it!</li>
            <li>Great fresh scent, and</li>
            <li>great product fast shipping!</li>
            <li>This is not that girly.&lt;br /&gt;Normal Polo is more onion-like, which is why I don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li>more than 24</li>
            <li>Women seems to love this scent as well.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, Big Pony #1 is the best fragrance in this line.  </li>
            <li>Given the citrus blend of notes, Big Pony #1 is best suited for daytime wear in Spring and Summer.  </li>
            <li>It smells great, but lacks the projection/sillage and longevity to be a major player.  </li>
            <li>I was so pleased with how quickly it shipped and arrived.</li>
            <li>I took him to sephora and we picked up a free sample of this cologne.  </li>
            <li>Just kidding, but it really is a nice smell and it doesn&#x27;t take much for it to do the trick.  </li>
            <li>and I enjoy citrus.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend and he absolutely lived it!!!</li>
            <li>Reminds me of the original polo fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing deal and for a brand new item too.</li>
            <li>Smells clean and sporty.  </li>
            <li>Fresh and light scent.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad thing, though.  </li>
            <li>I am very dissapointed that Amazon is not screening their sellers more adequate to protect their customers.  </li>
            <li>great thing about this particular RL Brand, is that he offer&#x27;s different scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>retail stores have it cheaper buy from them but other than that the cologne is amazing.!</li>
            <li>I enjoy #1 the most of the Big Pony Collection.  </li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite Ralph Lauren cologne.  </li>
            <li>It offers great flexibility/versatility in those months as a safe office wear and that it can be worn to any event in excessive heat temperatures.  </li>
            <li>Find the right one for you (and your budget..</li>
            <li>We are both very picky when it comes to colognes or perfumes and this has become both his and my new favorite.</li>
            <li>Smells AMAZING and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Very clean and fresh scent that works for work and social settings.</li>
            <li>My personal favorite.</li>
            <li>exactly what i paid for</li>
            <li>Exactly what it said.</li>
            <li>I have many of RL&#x27;s signature scents and all of the Big Pony series.  </li>
            <li>A woman that I&#x27;m interested in complimented me while I was wearing it.</li>
            <li>It has such a lovely fresh scent, while still being masculine.</li>
            <li>Distinctive, but not annoying that you can wear it daily in an office environment, and it still works after hours in the clubs.</li>
            <li>The real deal, packaged as one would expect.  </li>
            <li>and when I took out my original and compared the scent it was completely different!</li>
            <li>AND AS IVE SAID I WANT MY FULL REFUND BACK.</li>
            <li>As noted yesterday, I am a true fan of all the Ralph Lauren fragrances - and I do like the Big Pony collection -</li>
            <li>I did not purchase this for myself, but for my high school-aged son.  </li>
            <li>The Pony series are fresh and last throughout my work day.</li>
            <li>ordered as a present, exactly what he wanted.</li>
            <li>Pick up a small bottle and try it, chances are you will love it.</li>
            <li>It is slightly fruity, but clean.  </li>
            <li>is not an \\&quot;old</li>
            <li>I really like this flavor of the Big Pony collection.  </li>
            <li>A check of current on-line prices indicate that Big Pony #1 is a decent fragrance considering the price/value - you can purchase a large bottle for under $50 USD - not too shabby..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful, 1 spray has the power of 2-4 sprays of the other scents in my collection and the smell lasts all day.</li>
            <li>The actual smell is hard to describe (youthful is the word I would use), but when I wear it, women love it and men ask where to buy it.</li>
            <li>Both are in the same family as my other favs (Kenneth Cole Reaction, Essey Miyake Summer, D&amp;G light Blue)</li>
            <li>If you are a novice in the game, pass on BP#1 - there are plenty of citrus based fragrances out there with better performance.  </li>
            <li>After an hour Big Pony #1 sits close to the skin and is barely traceable after four hours of wear.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> If you are looking for me to describe the scent, I will try my best.&lt;br /&gt;This is not an \\&quot;old man\\&quot; scent.  However, it is also not girly in the least.&lt;br /&gt;CK One was a gender neutral scent.  This is not that girly.&lt;br /&gt;Normal Polo is more onion-like, which is why I don&#x27;t buy it.&lt;br /&gt;This is for younger dudes.&lt;br /&gt;I hope that helps.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to smell it, go to a store where they have it!!!</li>
            <li> My husband forgot cologne recently when we went away for the weekend.  I took him to sephora and we picked up a free sample of this cologne.  I ordered it for him the next day. It has such a lovely fresh scent, while still being masculine. We are both very picky when it comes to colognes or perfumes and this has become both his and my new favorite.</li>
            <li> retail stores have it cheaper buy from them but other than that the cologne is amazing.!</li>
            <li> I really like this flavor of the Big Pony collection.  It is slightly fruity, but clean.  Works well with me.</li>
            <li> Great for summer. Very clean and fresh scent that works for work and social settings. Not overpowering which is a plus.</li>
            <li> ordered as a present, exactly what he wanted.</li>
            <li> My personal favorite. Slightly feminine, yet still incredibly masculine. It&#x27;s powerful, 1 spray has the power of 2-4 sprays of the other scents in my collection and the smell lasts all day. The actual smell is hard to describe (youthful is the word I would use), but when I wear it, women love it and men ask where to buy it. Pick up a small bottle and try it, chances are you will love it.</li>
            <li> The same bottle at perfume stores costs almost double the price. This is an amazing deal and for a brand new item too. Great value for the price and product</li>
            <li> Still Great... !!!.... Someone always ask or say &amp;#34;What&#x27;s that you got on?..... You smell fresh... !!!</li>
            <li> I actually believe that the cologne was not prepared by ralph lauren, it&#x27;s pirate. when you first use it you feel the delicious scent, but 1 hour out of home you feel no scent.</li>
            <li> What can I say, if you love cologne, and owning a library of mens colognes like I do, then you will love it!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this purchase.  After opening the so called \\&quot;factory sealed\\&quot; box I immediately noticed the poor graphics of the polo design on the bottle.  Comparing the bottle with the store bought bottle there is an obvious difference in color and design.  What a rip off!!!  I am very dissapointed that Amazon is not screening their sellers more adequate to protect their customers.  I want my money back!!</li>
            <li> A must buy for any guy, age 18-60.&lt;br /&gt;The great thing about this particular RL Brand, is that he offer&#x27;s different scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chose your color and number; and you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he absolutely lived it!!!</li>
            <li> exactly what i paid for</li>

            <li> great product fast shipping!</li>
            <li> The cologne was weak its doesn&#x27;t hold up its seem like its fake I paid alots of money for that</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband. Smells AMAZING and lasts a long time. Love the pony collection!</li>
            <li> I enjoy #1 the most of the Big Pony Collection.  Distinctive, but not annoying that you can wear it daily in an office environment, and it still works after hours in the clubs.</li>
            <li> I am in utter shock! Not.only did.my.polo arrive late I was in shock when I smelled it.Ive had this and have been using it for over a year and when I took out my original and compared the scent it was completely different! U guys gave me a fake one that smelled watered down mixed with some funny chemical.ive never ordered from amazon and this was my first time&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for giving me a horrible experience.AND AS IVE SAID I WANT MY FULL REFUND BACK. YOURE TELLING ME TO SEND IT TO ANOTHER ADDRESS????? YOU GUYS ARE A SCAM!</li>
            <li> The real deal, packaged as one would expect.  Great savings on a genuine product!</li>
            <li> Fresh and light scent.  Reminds me of the original polo fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite Ralph Lauren cologne.  Smells clean and sporty.  Women seems to love this scent as well.  Great price too!</li>
            <li> Exactly what it said. My husband loved it! I also bought a fragrance for my Mom. Won&#x27;t hesitate to do so again in the future!</li>
            <li> The Pony series are fresh and last throughout my work day. I also bought #4 as it is mandarin like and I enjoy citrus. Both are in the same family as my other favs (Kenneth Cole Reaction, Essey Miyake Summer, D&amp;G light Blue)</li>
            <li> Yesterday I wore and wrote a review of Ralph Lauren&#x27;s Big Pony #4.  Next in my rotation is Big Pony #1 (blue bottle).  As noted yesterday, I am a true fan of all the Ralph Lauren fragrances - and I do like the Big Pony collection - I have many of RL&#x27;s signature scents and all of the Big Pony series.  In my opinion, Big Pony #1 is the best fragrance in this line.  It is a simple fragrance with notes of citrus/fruit and &amp;#34;woods&amp;#34;.  From the onset, the citrus takes center stage and any &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; notes are lost early on.  Not a bad thing, though.  The citrus blend is a very pleasant smell and all who like (myself included) citrus fragrances, will love this scent.  The issue or concern is the projection and longevity of the fragrance.  After an hour Big Pony #1 sits close to the skin and is barely traceable after four hours of wear.  I was greatly disappointed..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do admit, however, that I do like the bottle.  Great design and theme.  Given the citrus blend of notes, Big Pony #1 is best suited for daytime wear in Spring and Summer.  It offers great flexibility/versatility in those months as a safe office wear and that it can be worn to any event in excessive heat temperatures.  Should work well in the South Carolina heat and humidity - I can hardly wait..!! A check of current on-line prices indicate that Big Pony #1 is a decent fragrance considering the price/value - you can purchase a large bottle for under $50 USD - not too shabby..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final tally for Ralph Lauren&#x27;s Big Pony #1 is 4 stars out of 5 stars.  It smells great, but lacks the projection/sillage and longevity to be a major player.  For the serious collector, or Ralph Lauren fan, add to your collection.  If you are a novice in the game, pass on BP#1 - there are plenty of citrus based fragrances out there with better performance.  Find the right one for you (and your budget..).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy your day and make it count... Invest your time rather wasting your time...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great cologne. A woman that I&#x27;m interested in complimented me while I was wearing it. If she thinks it smells nice, then I&#x27;m definitely happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great fresh scent, and I was so pleased with how quickly it shipped and arrived.</li>
            <li> Smells just wonderful on my son!!</li>
