            <li>I&#x27;ve already bought two more and also got her the Tea Tree Night Clearing Lotion which is amazing as well as an addition to using this product.</li>
            <li>Great product, it&#x27;s gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s what they do:)  </li>
            <li>I love all BODY SHOP teat tree products.</li>

            <li>I swear by this magical stuff</li>
            <li>Under the make up or on top of your make up, this stuff works like a charm.</li>
            <li>the Body Shop doesn&#x27;t offer a better value for their customers.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is definitely easy to apply and it&#x27;s non-drying and non-irritating.  </li>
            <li>pros is that it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This however convinced me that sometimes stuff really can be magical!</li>
            <li>Fabulous..</li>
            <li>It is very useful to the pores and my skin.</li>
            <li>The first night she used it we saw a huge difference!  </li>
            <li>I just wish they gave you more for the price, and so that it didn&#x27;t run out as fast!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it actually really works.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t get rid of my problem areas in just one night, but over many nights the difference was very noticeable.</li>
            <li>It really works !!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also surprised that it&#x27;s not so effective, because I&#x27;d think the alcohol and willow bark extract (which contains salicylic acid) would be really beneficial.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth it?</li>
            <li>It has a little brush attached to the cap for application which is very handy.  </li>
            <li>Runs out pretty quick.  </li>
            <li>This one I thought would have higher success</li>
            <li>I put this on before I went to bed and woke up with my face looking fresher than usual and feeling great.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Very gentle</li>
            <li>FIrst of all, I never leave reviews for items, so</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll probably finish off the one I have, but then I&#x27;m going back to the Desert Essence roll-on tea tree oil product, which worked better for me.</li>
            <li>Product exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff, just very little of it.</li>
            <li>Not as strong as the traditional tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>This tea tree gel really seems to work to get ride of spot, if you put it on as soon as you feel a blemish coming on.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This product works, it is very compact</li>
            <li>is fast on clearing blemishes</li>
            <li>Thanks again for the fast service for my order.</li>
            <li>I paid $10 dollars for this little lititle thing,kinda like not enough for once.not good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good stuff to control my oil in the face,but it&#x27;s only 1.2ml,so small,I just use a few times</li>
            <li>My husband can&#x27;t live without this for the periodic blemish.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty severe across her entire forehead/temples.  </li>
            <li>This tea tree blemish gel helps clear my skin on my face.  </li>
            <li>I use it, and my young daughter, whose skin is just now breaking out some, uses it.</li>
            <li>Nothing we&#x27;ve tried so far has worked for her.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m surprised this contains alcohol because of how non-drying it is.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Really works for drying up an occasional blemish.</li>
            <li>Her acne spots were less red, and the smaller ones were pretty much gone, the larger ones took more time of course, but they were definitely smaller.  </li>
            <li>Be aware that it is a pretty small tube as well.  </li>
            <li>By the next day I notice a change and it doesn&#x27;t dry out or chap my skin like many other products I have used.</li>
            <li>I got this for my 12 year old daughter who is struggling with teenage acne.  </li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t dry or leave residue, and it at least gives you the satisfying feeling</li>
            <li>It really cuts down healing time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about ten years now, and as long as I put it on right when a blemish starts, that thing is gone in a day or less.</li>

            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s having a huge effect, unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> The only negative about this offering is the cost is double what it is on the Body Shop website!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s to be expected with any acne treatment</li>
            <li> Blemishes are gone or at least majorly reduced in a day.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m wondering whether they have a bigger one because this seems so small.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s such a small amount, for the price, you&#x27;d think this could be included.</li>
            <li> I get monthly (hormonal) breakouts, plus I&#x27;ve been trying some different skincare products lately, and my skin has suffered a bit, so I&#x27;ve had ample chance to test this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I think it prevents a breakout from getting worse if caught early.</li>
            <li> and it always helped blemishes go down.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I didnt like about it is its very small and doesnt have a lot of product in in.  </li>
            <li> However it is quite small and only has a small amount of gel in it.</li>
            <li> Small amount and did not really work</li>
            <li> If you need to use it several times a day then it&#x27;s not a good value for it&#x27;s cost.</li>
            <li> No packaging, no seal, no box, no instructions, precautions, or uses label, so I&#x27;m a little apprehensive to use the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been giving this a try for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> It sometimes takes a few applications but the pimples will go away.</li>
            <li> A little small for the size, also it shows under powder which is a no-no.</li>
            <li> but the quantity is small.</li>
            <li> Not sure how well it works, but hasn&#x27;t caused any problems</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical of beauty product, especially when they deal with acne.</li>
            <li> Expensive and not much worth the price.</li>
            <li> I was told by one of the employees that it was also supposed to help reduce the pain of those big pimples that just make life miserable.</li>
            <li> Expensive?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very small amount for the price, I go through it too quickly, so it&#x27;s very disappointing</li>
            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t have any bad smell to it.  </li>
            <li> But I just don&#x27;t feel like it was really terribly</li>
            <li> This blemish gel stick has saved my skin from really nasty brake outs.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the ONLY pimple remover I use.  Period.  Natural tea tree eliminates the little facial annoyances that sometimes pop up.  I keep it in my car, my backpack and my desk.  I am never without.  Just in case.</li>
            <li> This tea tree gel really seems to work to get ride of spot, if you put it on as soon as you feel a blemish coming on.  I think I need to buy another one to keep in my purse.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product and it gives a nice cooling feeling. I was told by one of the employees that it was also supposed to help reduce the pain of those big pimples that just make life miserable. I can&#x27;t say that it helped with that, and it didn&#x27;t seem to do anything for my acne. However, it doesn&#x27;t dry or leave residue, and it at least gives you the satisfying feeling you have something on-the-go to work with...</li>
            <li> This gel works wonders on blemishes. I use it, and my young daughter, whose skin is just now breaking out some, uses it. We see an amazing difference overnight. The only negative about this offering is the cost is double what it is on the Body Shop website!</li>
            <li> Seems to work pertty good on blemishes.  The only thing that I didnt like about it is its very small and doesnt have a lot of product in in.  Runs out pretty quick.  It has a little brush attached to the cap for application which is very handy.  Good stuff, just very little of it.</li>
            <li> My husband can&#x27;t live without this for the periodic blemish.  He keeps one here and one in his travel kit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best I ever had but works well.</li>
            <li> Just bought this for curiosity...</li>
            <li> It is very useful to the pores and my skin.I like it very much.I like the packaging  as well,it&#x27;s beautiful !</li>
            <li> It feels good. But I&#x27;m wondering whether they have a bigger one because this seems so small. It runs out in a week.</li>
            <li> It really works !! Everyone should try it out ....</li>
            <li> FIrst of all, I never leave reviews for items, so just the fact that I am means this is an awesome product.  I got this for my 12 year old daughter who is struggling with teenage acne.  It is pretty severe across her entire forehead/temples.  Nothing we&#x27;ve tried so far has worked for her.  The first night she used it we saw a huge difference!  Her acne spots were less red, and the smaller ones were pretty much gone, the larger ones took more time of course, but they were definitely smaller.  She has sensitive skin also and this did not irritate it at all, it does cause a little dryness/flaking but that&#x27;s to be expected with any acne treatment, that&#x27;s what they do:)  Be aware that it is a pretty small tube as well.  I&#x27;ve already bought two more and also got her the Tea Tree Night Clearing Lotion which is amazing as well as an addition to using this product.</li>
            <li> Small amount and did not really work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been giving this a try for a few weeks now and I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s having a huge effect, unfortunately.  I get monthly (hormonal) breakouts, plus I&#x27;ve been trying some different skincare products lately, and my skin has suffered a bit, so I&#x27;ve had ample chance to test this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely easy to apply and it&#x27;s non-drying and non-irritating.  You can tell from the scent that it&#x27;s got a lot of tea tree oil.  But I just don&#x27;t feel like it was really terribly effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the ingredients since I didn&#x27;t see them on the product page:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, Alcohol Denat., Glycerin, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Calophyllum Inophyllum Seed Oil, Honey, Tea Tree Leaf Oil, Carbomer, Aminomethyl Propanol, Willow Bark Extract, t-Butyl Alcohol, Limonene, Citral, Lemon Tea Tree Oil, Denatonium Benzoate, Tocopherol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m surprised this contains alcohol because of how non-drying it is.  I&#x27;m also surprised that it&#x27;s not so effective, because I&#x27;d think the alcohol and willow bark extract (which contains salicylic acid) would be really beneficial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably finish off the one I have, but then I&#x27;m going back to the Desert Essence roll-on tea tree oil product, which worked better for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the only thing that works and doesn&#x27;t completely dry out my skin. Blemishes are gone or at least majorly reduced in a day.  I love all BODY SHOP teat tree products.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it actually really works. By the next day I notice a change and it doesn&#x27;t dry out or chap my skin like many other products I have used. I have sensitive skin and this does its job without damaging the rest of my skin.</li>
            <li> Expensive? Yes. Worth it? Oh yeah! I&#x27;ve been using this for about ten years now, and as long as I put it on right when a blemish starts, that thing is gone in a day or less. Amazing stuff!  And this little tube really does last a long time. As in years, depending on your breakout schedule.</li>
            <li> great for blemishes. very tiny product though.</li>
            <li> I do not see any difference even with daily use.  Expensive and not much worth the price.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as the traditional tea tree oil. pros is that it&#x27;s easy to apply. but the quantity is small.</li>
            <li> love this stuff. gets rid of blemishes</li>
            <li> I like it.  It works for me.</li>
            <li> Fabulous.. I love this product.</li>
            <li> A little small for the size, also it shows under powder which is a no-no. I think I&#x27;d rather stick with tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> I swear by this magical stuff</li>
            <li> Product exactly as described.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> No packaging, no seal, no box, no instructions, precautions, or uses label, so I&#x27;m a little apprehensive to use the product. Since it&#x27;s such a small amount, for the price, you&#x27;d think this could be included.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good stuff to control my oil in the face,but it&#x27;s only 1.2ml,so small,I just use a few times</li>
            <li> This product works, it is very compact so you could carry it in your pocket for touch ups. However it is quite small and only has a small amount of gel in it. Consider it for travel and emergencies and it&#x27;s a good value. If you need to use it several times a day then it&#x27;s not a good value for it&#x27;s cost.</li>
            <li> is fast on clearing blemishes</li>
            <li> This is something that everybody &amp;#34;male or female&amp;#34; should have on hand, that is if they get pimples all the sudden. This blemish gel stick has saved my skin from really nasty brake outs. Nip it in the bud before it gets out of hand and causes people to stare at your pimple instead of your eyes. You can put this on any part of your body. Under the make up or on top of your make up, this stuff works like a charm. It sometimes takes a few applications but the pimples will go away. Totally recommended!!! I have 3. 1 with my make up, 1 in my purse and 1 at work in my locker. I am covered &#x3D;-)</li>
            <li> I paid $10 dollars for this little lititle thing,kinda like not enough for once.not good. I just put it in the trash ...😒😒</li>
            <li> Very effective! I use it since years and works magic to my skin!</li>
            <li> This tea tree blemish gel helps clear my skin on my face.  Thanks again for the fast service for my order.</li>
            <li> Really works for drying up an occasional blemish. Very gentle</li>
            <li> Not sure how well it works, but hasn&#x27;t caused any problems</li>
            <li> Came in great condition</li>
            <li> I have used tea tree, oil before and it always helped blemishes go down. This one I thought would have higher success however it dries out my skin and doesn&#x27;t feel like it gets to the heart of the blemish. So basically it dries out the skin but still leaves the pimple underneath I need it too draw the pimple out and not leave red skin . I likely won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical of beauty product, especially when they deal with acne. This however convinced me that sometimes stuff really can be magical! I put this on before I went to bed and woke up with my face looking fresher than usual and feeling great. I used it over places I had acne damage and it seemed to work over night. It didn&#x27;t get rid of my problem areas in just one night, but over many nights the difference was very noticeable. I would definitely buy this product again!</li>
            <li> Great product, it&#x27;s gentle and effective. It really cuts down healing time and I think it prevents a breakout from getting worse if caught early. Also it doesn&#x27;t have any bad smell to it.  I just wish they gave you more for the price, and so that it didn&#x27;t run out as fast! It&#x27;s a very small amount for the price, I go through it too quickly, so it&#x27;s very disappointing the Body Shop doesn&#x27;t offer a better value for their customers.  I had to take off one star for that reason.  If anyone is out there from The Body Shop, please start selling this in larger quantities!</li>
