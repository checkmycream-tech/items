            <li>the best things found and a heaping days worth of goodness.</li>
            <li>The canister of Delicious Greens 8000 (Berry) powder was received right on time.</li>

            <li>It does have a nice hint of berry flavor.</li>
            <li>I really like the ingredients in Delicious Greens.</li>
            <li>I have been using greens 8000 in my smoothies for several years now, great boost of energy and the berry is pleasant tasting!</li>

            <li>Good taste and easy to put in a bottle of water and shake it up and then drink.</li>
            <li>my 10 year old even loves her morning smoothie with delicious greens 8000</li>

            <li>Mixes easily!</li>

            <li>Thanks for the product and keep up the good work!</li>
            <li>The flavor is good  and sweet</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also concluded that VG is one of the most nutritionally dense powders on the market.</li>
            <li>Using this mixing method I&#x27;m able to get a level of sweetness that I like, and get the combined benefits of both powders.  </li>
            <li>Love the taste.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good enough that I am happy to drink it every day.</li>
            <li>increases the growth of cancer cells and mutates healthy cells into cancer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m requesting another order now :-)</li>
            <li>of lead in the body is ok</li>
            <li>Kids love the taste.</li>
            <li>now and think it top notch.</li>
            <li>kids love it.  </li>
            <li>Excellent overall for the price and quality.</li>
            <li>Love the berry taste.</li>
            <li>Since I starting talking Delicious Greens 8000</li>
            <li>Work two jobs like most everyone, but often do not have the time or energy to cook healthy veggies.</li>
            <li>I just feel better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also tastes better.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for more of a fruit or berry taste</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s sweetened with Stevia</li>
            <li>Love that contains organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>This great green powder mixes easily and has a sweet delicious taste.  </li>
            <li>The colors separated some, but texture was consistent and good.</li>
            <li>Perhaps what I like the best about Delicious Greens (DG) is that it&#x27;s sweet enough to mix with other powders and (mostly) mask their flavor if you don&#x27;t like them.</li>
            <li>I mix mine with a little fresh squeezed apple juice and good filtered water and it is delicious!</li>
            <li>The chocolate flavor satisfies my sweet cravings!</li>
            <li>Not bad!</li>
            <li>Great green dring that tastes good and doesn&#x27;t break the bank.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully I&#x27;ll see some good results from a new regimen.</li>
            <li>This is the most delicious green powder I have ever tried!</li>
            <li>It certainly mixes better than most.  </li>
            <li>This product tastes very good and adds a boost to the nutritional value of the fruit smoothies I make for many breakfasts in that it has both green and berry nutrition.</li>
            <li>This product is a fantastic way to get all of the vitamins and nutrients your body needs.</li>
            <li>I am a regular user of Greens and the Berry Flavor is great...</li>
            <li>Good stuff adding the greeens in, and only make it more complete.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried also Amazing Grass Berry, it tastes good on a smoothie but tastes funny when mixed with just water.</li>
            <li>I used to love the berry flavor, but after trying strawberry kiwi, I&#x27;ve got a new favorite.</li>
            <li>See comments re original .</li>
            <li>This is the first &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; supplement I&#x27;ve tried so it could taste better than others.  </li>
            <li>This flavor was a special treat that combined well with my chocolate-flavored protein powder, almond milk, kale, frozen raspberries &amp; chia seeds for an energizing breakfast smoothie.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s on the sweet side...</li>
            <li>Might be good for you, but the flavor is overbearing even when it is mixed.</li>
            <li>of lead in your body, that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not used to the sweet taste of stevia.</li>
            <li>Amazing Grass original, Macro Greens, Amazing Reds, Vitamineral Green, and this product.</li>
            <li>A few shakes in my BlenderBottle (which I also love) and it&#x27;s good to go.</li>
            <li>I found this three years ago researching online for something for my pregnant daughter in law as an alternative to veggies.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite so far</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t understand how so many have stated they have been taking it for years, and everyone is drinking it to add fruits and veggies to the diet, in other words, for health, so what I can&#x27;t understand is why so many people are choosing to ignore that the lead it contains is detrimental to health.</li>
            <li>If nothing else, it may be a good way of introducing someone to green drinks and then a person can more easily transition to something stronger by starting to add another powder gradually.</li>
            <li>If I had any major comment it would be to be provided with a way to order by the case with an even better price.</li>
            <li>Mixes well in cold water and has a delicious and smooth taste.</li>
            <li>Been using this for several years because it&#x27;s the best green drink I&#x27;ve ever found.  </li>
            <li>Frozen fruit in milk makes it quit good, or a light juice and frozen fruit made it thick and creamy.  </li>
            <li>This product is a quick and easy way to get the extra nutrition that I need.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t write reviews about products, but I really want you to know that I have use this product for  couple months and it works great.</li>
            <li>The mocha flavor is absolutely decadent!</li>
            <li>If there&#x27;s a way to purchase bulk at a substantial savings, I&#x27;d be interested.</li>
            <li>I do not think you can get higher quality than this drink</li>
            <li>but this is my second favorite.</li>
            <li>If only she knew that it has so many vegetables that she dislike</li>
            <li>Would love to see this on a bigger container 2 or 3 month supply.</li>
            <li>but I honestly feel like it&#x27;s better in just plain old water.  </li>
            <li>We love this supplement as it provides complete nutrition in an all natural platform.</li>
            <li>VG has a slight bit of sweetness to it, the kind of grassy sweetness you find in wheatgrass juice.</li>
            <li>The berry flavor is great mixed with other juices!</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know if it actually does work, but it is easy to toss in my fruit shakes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend just anything to other people, but I do with this because I know it&#x27;s healthy and is easy to incorporate into one&#x27;s daily regime.</li>
            <li>and this is a very affordable price item</li>
            <li>I found the DG flavor complimented this very well.</li>
            <li>If this mix didn&#x27;t have dangerous aloe vera, it&#x27;d be perfect.</li>
            <li>I drink this at work and can really feel the energy.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t notice that it did anything else.</li>
            <li>Really flavorful.  </li>
            <li>Pretty spendy, especially if you have 3 servings a day, as recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Trader Joes has a VERY comparable product for $19.99 but the taste isn&#x27;t quite as sweet.</li>
            <li>the price is reasonable too.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>haha...</li>
            <li>This product seems to keep me more \\&quot;regular\\&quot; than other products do.</li>
            <li>other products are better</li>
            <li>I have tried other powdered greens and have wished they tasted better.</li>
            <li>The first step to better health according to the book Diabetes without Drugs is to drink a green drink every day for 30 days.</li>
            <li>From my research I&#x27;ve concluded that the better a powder tastes, the less nutritionally dense it is - which leads me to believe that DG is not the strongest nutritionally.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that I have noticed a difference in how I feel both mentally and physically.</li>
            <li>This one tastes quite a bit different and has a red cap, but it is okay.</li>
            <li>It was alright but really looking more for a green product</li>
            <li>We highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended....</li>
            <li>would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know if this is necessary, as this seems pretty packed with nutrients.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definately sweeter than normal flavor.</li>
            <li>Half the price of similar products though, which is nice.</li>
            <li>I tried this product recently for the first time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been drinking something majorly green for years and find it fabulous.</li>
            <li>The previous reviews were true....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to start with half a scoop and work on up to the full one.</li>
            <li>No scientific proof or anything, just a general feeling of wellness.</li>
            <li>It seems to give me a little more energy, but it does take a little getting used to the taste.</li>
            <li>From past experience I knew that green powders can be very strong, so I searched and came upon this brand.</li>

            <li> This is the most delicious green powder I have ever tried!</li>
            <li> It certainly mixes better than most.  </li>
            <li> This product tastes very good and adds a boost to the nutritional value of the fruit smoothies I make for many breakfasts in that it has both green and berry nutrition.</li>
            <li> This product is a fantastic way to get all of the vitamins and nutrients your body needs.</li>
            <li> I am a regular user of Greens and the Berry Flavor is great...</li>
            <li> Good stuff adding the greeens in, and only make it more complete.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried also Amazing Grass Berry, it tastes good on a smoothie but tastes funny when mixed with just water.</li>
            <li> I used to love the berry flavor, but after trying strawberry kiwi, I&#x27;ve got a new favorite.</li>
            <li> See comments re original .</li>
            <li> This is the first &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; supplement I&#x27;ve tried so it could taste better than others.  </li>
            <li> This flavor was a special treat that combined well with my chocolate-flavored protein powder, almond milk, kale, frozen raspberries &amp; chia seeds for an energizing breakfast smoothie.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s on the sweet side...</li>
            <li> Might be good for you, but the flavor is overbearing even when it is mixed.</li>
            <li> of lead in your body, that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not used to the sweet taste of stevia.</li>
            <li> Amazing Grass original, Macro Greens, Amazing Reds, Vitamineral Green, and this product.</li>
            <li> A few shakes in my BlenderBottle (which I also love) and it&#x27;s good to go.</li>
            <li> I found this three years ago researching online for something for my pregnant daughter in law as an alternative to veggies.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite so far</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand how so many have stated they have been taking it for years, and everyone is drinking it to add fruits and veggies to the diet, in other words, for health, so what I can&#x27;t understand is why so many people are choosing to ignore that the lead it contains is detrimental to health.</li>
            <li> If nothing else, it may be a good way of introducing someone to green drinks and then a person can more easily transition to something stronger by starting to add another powder gradually.</li>
            <li> If I had any major comment it would be to be provided with a way to order by the case with an even better price.</li>
            <li> Mixes well in cold water and has a delicious and smooth taste.</li>
            <li> Been using this for several years because it&#x27;s the best green drink I&#x27;ve ever found.  </li>
            <li> Frozen fruit in milk makes it quit good, or a light juice and frozen fruit made it thick and creamy.  </li>
            <li> This product is a quick and easy way to get the extra nutrition that I need.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews about products, but I really want you to know that I have use this product for  couple months and it works great.</li>
            <li> The mocha flavor is absolutely decadent!</li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s a way to purchase bulk at a substantial savings, I&#x27;d be interested.</li>
            <li> I do not think you can get higher quality than this drink</li>
            <li> but this is my second favorite.</li>
            <li> If only she knew that it has so many vegetables that she dislike</li>
            <li> Would love to see this on a bigger container 2 or 3 month supply.</li>
            <li> but I honestly feel like it&#x27;s better in just plain old water.  </li>
            <li> We love this supplement as it provides complete nutrition in an all natural platform.</li>
            <li> VG has a slight bit of sweetness to it, the kind of grassy sweetness you find in wheatgrass juice.</li>
            <li> The berry flavor is great mixed with other juices!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know if it actually does work, but it is easy to toss in my fruit shakes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend just anything to other people, but I do with this because I know it&#x27;s healthy and is easy to incorporate into one&#x27;s daily regime.</li>
            <li> and this is a very affordable price item</li>
            <li> I found the DG flavor complimented this very well.</li>
            <li> If this mix didn&#x27;t have dangerous aloe vera, it&#x27;d be perfect.</li>
            <li> I drink this at work and can really feel the energy.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice that it did anything else.</li>
            <li> Really flavorful.  </li>
            <li> Pretty spendy, especially if you have 3 servings a day, as recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Trader Joes has a VERY comparable product for $19.99 but the taste isn&#x27;t quite as sweet.</li>
            <li> the price is reasonable too.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> haha...</li>
            <li> This product seems to keep me more \\&quot;regular\\&quot; than other products do.</li>
            <li> other products are better</li>
            <li> I have tried other powdered greens and have wished they tasted better.</li>
            <li> The first step to better health according to the book Diabetes without Drugs is to drink a green drink every day for 30 days.</li>
            <li> From my research I&#x27;ve concluded that the better a powder tastes, the less nutritionally dense it is - which leads me to believe that DG is not the strongest nutritionally.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that I have noticed a difference in how I feel both mentally and physically.</li>
            <li> This one tastes quite a bit different and has a red cap, but it is okay.</li>
            <li> It was alright but really looking more for a green product</li>
            <li> We highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommended....</li>
            <li> would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know if this is necessary, as this seems pretty packed with nutrients.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definately sweeter than normal flavor.</li>
            <li> Half the price of similar products though, which is nice.</li>
            <li> I tried this product recently for the first time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been drinking something majorly green for years and find it fabulous.</li>
            <li> The previous reviews were true....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to start with half a scoop and work on up to the full one.</li>
            <li> No scientific proof or anything, just a general feeling of wellness.</li>
            <li> It seems to give me a little more energy, but it does take a little getting used to the taste.</li>
            <li> From past experience I knew that green powders can be very strong, so I searched and came upon this brand.</li>
            <li> , I usually bought a $40 bottle a lot smaller than this size, Try this product it really helps with your digestion.</li>
            <li> If they will get it again, it would be hidden in brownies, or other sweet, dark foods.</li>
            <li> Normally I would give this 5 stars, but this time when I ordered it, thought I was getting the one with the green cover.  </li>
            <li> The thought was that it is hard to get the full 5 serving of vegetables everyday.</li>
            <li> Although not directly recommend by Doctor Oz Show he introduced the idea, see \\&quot;Dr.</li>
            <li> To me, it is tasty enough that I can drink it every morning (on an empty stomach without any problems) without dreading it, so this means I do it every day and am not tempted to skip it.</li>
            <li> I love the taste and would use it every day but its very expensive and is just a treat for me here and there.</li>
            <li> The cost is less than others, with ALL of the same ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I believe those who say it tastes better than other brands however I found it to be unpleasant to choke down daily.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t have a problem with the sweetness and the bit of added juice just gives a little oomph.</li>
            <li> This might be a bit expensive for some, but your health is worth it.</li>
            <li> The taste is not great by any means especially when compared to the brand dynamic greens but the amount of veggies you get in one scoop is unbeatable especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I actually look forward to drinking a glass everyday.</li>
            <li> It has a  taste that seems similar with other green drinks.</li>
            <li> If the taste of this product turned you off, try mixing it with some other products and see if you find a combo you like.</li>
            <li> I used to get colds and other sicknesses about 4-5 times per year.</li>
            <li> but I plan on keep trying other brands.</li>
            <li> I had a little bit left over from Vitamineral Green (VG), and would mix 1tbsp of VG with 1/2 tbsp of DG.</li>
            <li> I add it with other superfood powders and it makes it a lot easier to drink!</li>
            <li> I always have to squeeze in half a lime to tone down the sweetness.  </li>
            <li> If there are people who don&#x27;t like frothy green, a bit like pond scum, looking nutrition, they are the left out bunch.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over a year and have noticed an increase in energy and a reduction in appetite.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , it is a heavy metal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few yrs.</li>
            <li> This powder is so tasty that I can drink it with plain water.</li>
            <li> I used purified water, a little fruit juice and small juice blender.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the Berry flavor which in the past has always came with a green cap.</li>
            <li> I have a difficult time getting enough fruits &amp; veggies in each day.  </li>
            <li> Almost sickening sweet to me.  </li>
            <li> I mean, is there anything you could add to that list?</li>
            <li> and it seriously tastes like dessert!</li>
            <li> I have only been sick one time in four years!</li>
            <li> Way too much artificial sweetener in it.</li>
            <li> and the flavor isn&#x27;t too bad.  </li>
            <li> Kid&#x27;s thought it was nasty pond water.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great and taste good</li>
            <li> This is the second &amp;#34;greens&amp;#34; product I have purchased.  I was drawn to this product because of the price and it was Prime eligable.  I like how I feel on days that I take it and the flavor isn&#x27;t too bad.  I tried to mask the flavor by adding to a smoothie yesterday but I honestly feel like it&#x27;s better in just plain old water.  I sneak this into my kid&#x27;s diet and they haven&#x27;t noticed and I&#x27;ve noticed by husband drinking it every morning.</li>
            <li> A+++ product to be added to our daily dietary needs. This is the second time I have order this product but not the last. I have also introduce this to my husband with favorable results. I have notice this helps to stabilize my blood sugar levels. Although not directly recommend by Doctor Oz Show he introduced the idea, see \\&quot;Dr. Oz&#x27;s Best-Kept Health Secret\\&quot;. The thought was that it is hard to get the full 5 serving of vegetables everyday. Doctor Oz uses a similar product in his daily diet. It is delicious and easy to add to our diet. We will be ordering it again. We highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews about products, but I really want you to know that I have use this product for  couple months and it works great. The flavor is good  and sweet I think the best of all greens I have tasted before  and this is a very affordable price item, I usually bought a $40 bottle a lot smaller than this size, Try this product it really helps with your digestion. It&#x27;s awesome. I highly recommended....</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery. Product as advertised.</li>
            <li> My wife and I love this because it tastes great. Yes, it&#x27;s on the sweet side...but it makes you forget you&#x27;re drinking \\&quot;green\\&quot; powder. This product seems to keep me more \\&quot;regular\\&quot; than other products do. We tried 5 different superfood powders: Amazing Grass original, Macro Greens, Amazing Reds, Vitamineral Green, and this product. Delicious Greens Berry definitely tastes the best. It certainly mixes better than most.  Perhaps what I like the best about Delicious Greens (DG) is that it&#x27;s sweet enough to mix with other powders and (mostly) mask their flavor if you don&#x27;t like them. I had a little bit left over from Vitamineral Green (VG), and would mix 1tbsp of VG with 1/2 tbsp of DG. From my research I&#x27;ve concluded that the better a powder tastes, the less nutritionally dense it is - which leads me to believe that DG is not the strongest nutritionally. I&#x27;ve also concluded that VG is one of the most nutritionally dense powders on the market. Using this mixing method I&#x27;m able to get a level of sweetness that I like, and get the combined benefits of both powders.  This might be a bit expensive for some, but your health is worth it. If the taste of this product turned you off, try mixing it with some other products and see if you find a combo you like. VG has a slight bit of sweetness to it, the kind of grassy sweetness you find in wheatgrass juice. I found the DG flavor complimented this very well.</li>
            <li> Love the taste.  Great way to get vegetables</li>
            <li> Might be good for you, but the flavor is overbearing even when it is mixed.</li>
            <li> The previous reviews were true....love this product! It makes smoothies taste great and the good thing is you are getting all your greens and then some in!</li>
            <li> The first step to better health according to the book Diabetes without Drugs is to drink a green drink every day for 30 days. From past experience I knew that green powders can be very strong, so I searched and came upon this brand. The ingredients appear to be healthful and the reviews regarding the taste were encouraging so I decided to try it. I personally mix it with an ounce or two of Naked juice, 8-12 oz. water, and a scoop of Life Extension Mix powder.  A few shakes in my BlenderBottle (which I also love) and it&#x27;s good to go. To me, it is tasty enough that I can drink it every morning (on an empty stomach without any problems) without dreading it, so this means I do it every day and am not tempted to skip it. I personally don&#x27;t have a problem with the sweetness and the bit of added juice just gives a little oomph. If nothing else, it may be a good way of introducing someone to green drinks and then a person can more easily transition to something stronger by starting to add another powder gradually. I don&#x27;t really know if this is necessary, as this seems pretty packed with nutrients. I can honestly say that I have noticed a difference in how I feel both mentally and physically. I don&#x27;t recommend just anything to other people, but I do with this because I know it&#x27;s healthy and is easy to incorporate into one&#x27;s daily regime. No, it&#x27;s not so yummy I sip and savor it, but it&#x27;s good enough that I am happy to drink it every day. Let&#x27;s face it, nothing will do you any good if you can&#x27;t stand taking it, because in the end you won&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> The canister of Delicious Greens 8000 (Berry) powder was received right on time. It has a  taste that seems similar with other green drinks. I mix it with around  3 oz. Of apple juice and 5 oz. Of filtered water.  It does have a nice hint of berry flavor. I am amazed by the amount of  nutrition it contains. We hope that it helps to provide the benefits needed for our vitality.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product, and I would buy it again!  I have used it before and knew that it was good, this was the best price I could find.</li>
            <li> The taste is great, pleasant to drink. However, it contains ALOE VERA! Aloe vera is good for skin treatment but NOT to be consumed internally!&lt;br /&gt;It increases the growth of cancer cells and mutates healthy cells into cancer.&lt;br /&gt;That is why I rated it one star.&lt;br /&gt;I returned the container. If this mix didn&#x27;t have dangerous aloe vera, it&#x27;d be perfect.</li>
            <li> They make me feel good from the inside out. The taste is not great by any means especially when compared to the brand dynamic greens but the amount of veggies you get in one scoop is unbeatable especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I used to love the berry flavor, but after trying strawberry kiwi, I&#x27;ve got a new favorite.</li>
            <li> This product is a fantastic way to get all of the vitamins and nutrients your body needs. It&#x27;s so good...I&#x27;m requesting another order now :-)</li>
            <li> I ordered the Berry flavor which in the past has always came with a green cap. This one tastes quite a bit different and has a red cap, but it is okay. Was out of it and figured I could just deal with it.</li>
            <li> See comments re original .</li>
            <li> We love this supplement as it provides complete nutrition in an all natural platform. my 10 year old even loves her morning smoothie with delicious greens 8000</li>
            <li> I mix this in water and drink it every morning.  It tastes great and I honestly feel better taking it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best tasting drinks that is loaded healthy ingredients. I drink this at work and can really feel the energy. It does not cost an arm and a leg. I will purchase again!!! It is very good for PH balance instead of drinking coffee all day.</li>
            <li> taste not the greatest,but then it is greens.although it curbed my hunger I really didn&#x27;t notice that it did anything else.</li>
            <li> This is the most delicious green powder I have ever tried! The berry flavor is great mixed with other juices! I mix this with carrot juice, orange juice, and aloe vera juice and it seriously tastes like dessert! The mocha flavor is absolutely decadent! The chocolate flavor satisfies my sweet cravings! Dude, I love Delicious Greens 8000 :-) I wish they sold bigger sizes!</li>
            <li> I believe those who say it tastes better than other brands however I found it to be unpleasant to choke down daily. I can&#x27;t understand how so many have stated they have been taking it for years, and everyone is drinking it to add fruits and veggies to the diet, in other words, for health, so what I can&#x27;t understand is why so many people are choosing to ignore that the lead it contains is detrimental to health. NO amt. of lead in the body is ok, it is a heavy metal. One nutritionist I spoke with said you do not want to put any amt. of lead in your body, that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li> Gives me a lot of energy, but I am not the fondest of the flavor.  This is the first &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; supplement I&#x27;ve tried so it could taste better than others.  Half the price of similar products though, which is nice.</li>
            <li> Great green dring that tastes good and doesn&#x27;t break the bank.  Recommended by the Health Ranger (Mike Adams). Kids love the taste.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites for 2 years!</li>
            <li> other products are better</li>
            <li> This great green powder mixes easily and has a sweet delicious taste.  The cost is less than others, with ALL of the same ingredients.  I will be buying more of this.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Really flavorful.  I used purified water, a little fruit juice and small juice blender.  The colors separated some, but texture was consistent and good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few yrs. now and think it top notch. It has only recently come to my attention through Amazon. If I had any major comment it would be to be provided with a way to order by the case with an even better price. If there are people who don&#x27;t like frothy green, a bit like pond scum, looking nutrition, they are the left out bunch. I&#x27;ve been drinking something majorly green for years and find it fabulous.</li>
            <li> I am a regular user of Greens and the Berry Flavor is great...kids love it.  It&#x27;s definately sweeter than normal flavor.</li>
            <li> A good boost of vitamins. Not an every day thing for me...I&#x27;ll have to start with half a scoop and work on up to the full one. I&#x27;m not used to the sweet taste of stevia. Kid&#x27;s thought it was nasty pond water. If they will get it again, it would be hidden in brownies, or other sweet, dark foods. I probably won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> I add these greens to my smoothies and they taste great, plus they give me a boost of energy.  Excellent overall for the price and quality.</li>
            <li> Love the berry taste. Easy to add to smoothies or to water to make sure you get your veggies!!!  Mixes easily!</li>
            <li> Great taste, would recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using greens 8000 in my smoothies for several years now, great boost of energy and the berry is pleasant tasting!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this product for about 4 years. I used to get colds and other sicknesses about 4-5 times per year. Since I starting talking Delicious Greens 8000 I have only been sick one time in four years! I love this product because unlike herbs and vitamins this product is just great food that I should be eating every day but can&#x27;t because of the volume of food and the time to prepare it. I mix mine with a little fresh squeezed apple juice and good filtered water and it is delicious! I recommend this to everyone I talk with--In fact, I&#x27;ve given away a number of canisters of it. Look at the ingredients. I mean, is there anything you could add to that list? I will take this product literally until the end of my life. I&#x27;m 65 and the guys at the gym call me their idol because of my energy and body build. Thanks for the product and keep up the good work!</li>
            <li> Great taste!! My only issue with this product is the size of the container Vs. the cost. Pretty spendy, especially if you have 3 servings a day, as recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Trader Joes has a VERY comparable product for $19.99 but the taste isn&#x27;t quite as sweet. If there&#x27;s a way to purchase bulk at a substantial savings, I&#x27;d be interested.</li>
            <li> wonderful product! This drink mix taste surprisingly good and is easy to mix with smoothies and protein shakes, It has many wonderful, and beneficial nutrients. I recommend this to my family and friends</li>
            <li> Delicious way to ensure I get a variety of healthful greens. Work two jobs like most everyone, but often do not have the time or energy to cook healthy veggies. This product is a quick and easy way to get the extra nutrition that I need. Mixes well in cold water and has a delicious and smooth taste. I actually look forward to drinking a glass everyday.</li>
            <li> Normally I would give this 5 stars, but this time when I ordered it, thought I was getting the one with the green cover.  When it came, it had the red cover and don&#x27;t like the flavor as well.  Otherwise, know it still gives all the benefits, but really hope to receive the green cover next time</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over a year and have noticed an increase in energy and a reduction in appetite.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love the taste and would use it every day but its very expensive and is just a treat for me here and there.</li>
            <li> This stuff is tasty. I really don&#x27;t know if it actually does work, but it is easy to toss in my fruit shakes.</li>
            <li> Good taste makes you feel great after taking, really helps with regularity. I highly recommend this product to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soupy Twist.</li>
            <li> I really like the ingredients in Delicious Greens. I know I am feeding my body and my mind the best things found and a heaping days worth of goodness. Good taste and easy to put in a bottle of water and shake it up and then drink. Does it help me? I just feel better. No scientific proof or anything, just a general feeling of wellness.</li>
            <li> Well, this is a truly wonderful product.  The taste is good, it mixes well, has tons of good plant stuff in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I add the liquid vitamins I Reviewed, some frozen mixed berrys, a 1/2 glass of water, a scoop of fiber, cinnamomum, powered Vitamin c, and Udos Oil and some NOW Protein Mix.  Good stuff adding the greeens in, and only make it more complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also tastes better.  Not bad!</li>
            <li> So easy to use since it mixes easily with a spoon or is great added to a healthy smoothie.  This flavor was a special treat that combined well with my chocolate-flavored protein powder, almond milk, kale, frozen raspberries &amp; chia seeds for an energizing breakfast smoothie.</li>
            <li> I do not think you can get higher quality than this drink it is absolutely great tasting&lt;br /&gt;and the price is reasonable too.</li>
            <li> It was alright but really looking more for a green product so I&#x27;m switching to something else.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for more of a fruit or berry taste this might be it.</li>
            <li> Excellent berry taste, I love the chocolate but this is my second favorite. It&#x27;s a very healthy and delicious berry drink. If you don&#x27;t eat enough fruits and vegetables, don&#x27;t hesitate buying this product in both berry and chocolate flavors, you will definately reorder!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but I wish it was organic all the way!</li>
            <li> We add to our morning smoothie.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This drink was just gross.  Way too much artificial sweetener in it.</li>
            <li> Tastes great and dissolves easily.</li>
            <li> Great tasting!  I add it with other superfood powders and it makes it a lot easier to drink!</li>
            <li> I have a difficult time getting enough fruits &amp; veggies in each day.  This product taste good, unlike others I&#x27;ve tried.  Hopefully I&#x27;ll see some good results from a new regimen.</li>
            <li> I found this three years ago researching online for something for my pregnant daughter in law as an alternative to veggies. I sent this to them and she and my son loved it so. They got ME to try it and....well I&#x27;ve been buying it for all of us ever since. Now even the baby loves it. I do wish it came in bigger quants,</li>
            <li> Been using this for several years because it&#x27;s the best green drink I&#x27;ve ever found.  Love that it&#x27;s sweetened with Stevia, just wish it weren&#x27;t SO&lt;br /&gt;SWEET.  Almost sickening sweet to me.  I always have to squeeze in half a lime to tone down the sweetness.  Then it&#x27;s great.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I tried this product recently for the first time. I have tried other powdered greens and have wished they tasted better. This product tastes very good and adds a boost to the nutritional value of the fruit smoothies I make for many breakfasts in that it has both green and berry nutrition.</li>
            <li> It seems to give me a little more energy, but it does take a little getting used to the taste. Frozen fruit in milk makes it quit good, or a light juice and frozen fruit made it thick and creamy.  I have not tried the chocolate yet, but when I do, I&#x27;m going to try it with frozen strawberries or frozen cherries.</li>
            <li> This powder is so tasty that I can drink it with plain water. My teenage daughter loves it as well. If only she knew that it has so many vegetables that she dislike haha... I have tried also Amazing Grass Berry, it tastes good on a smoothie but tastes funny when mixed with just water. Would love to see this on a bigger container 2 or 3 month supply. This is my favorite so far but I plan on keep trying other brands. Love that contains organic ingredients. So good for your health!</li>
