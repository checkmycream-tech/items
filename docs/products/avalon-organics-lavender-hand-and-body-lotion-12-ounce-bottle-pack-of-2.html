            <li>I use it daily and love that it has all natural, organic ingredients</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a great light moisturizer, and although I can live with the sticky feeling through this bottle, I might try a few other different kinds before settling on a favorite lavender scented lotion.</li>
            <li>I wish they&#x27;d go back to the original formula.  </li>
            <li>It is thicker than before, so less is definitely more.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend them both.</li>
            <li>- I highly recommend to everyone whom I know....</li>
            <li>This is a terrific product that does exactly what you would like it to do!  </li>
            <li>In the meantime, I&#x27;m on the market for a new lotion.</li>

            <li>even hours after application, especially where my clothes make contact, even if I let it completely dry first.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that you really don&#x27;t smell the lavender very long.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> smooth and gentle, doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy.  absorbs quickly.  LOVE this lotion.</li>
            <li> great lotion; I use the other fragrances too.  Like that it&#x27;s organic &amp; has no parabens.</li>
            <li> excellent product sans paraben and phthalates (spelling ?) smells good is good use their body wash as well</li>
            <li> I like this lotion very much. The only drawback is that you really don&#x27;t smell the lavender very long.</li>
            <li> Has a bit of a chemically smell, not quite lavender oil or a soothing smell.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion. When I read that it had no parabens or harsh preservatives, I was drawn to it. Parabens affect hormone balance and mainline cosmetic companies have had us rubbing those compounds on our skin for years without considering what effects it caused - they only cared about their bank accounts. Avalon Organics is the brand I will be using from now on. The soap is just as nice as the lotion. I highly recommend them both.</li>
            <li> Wife uses this lotion almost daily.  She&#x27;s a lavender lovin&#x27; woman and she won&#x27;t use stuff that isn&#x27;t natural.  She loves the scent and loves how her hands feel after using it.  Get this for your wife!!</li>
            <li> Washing my hands a lot at work due to my profession, my hands get really dry.  I love this stuff.  My GF likes lavender, but the peppermint is what I like.  Keeps my hands nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> This light moisturizer is great for daily use. It&#x27;s creamy without being oily, and the smell is absolutely heavenly. I use it every morning, and it gives my morning a little pleasantly-scented lift. I would happily buy this again and again...after I run out, of course.</li>
            <li> Nice lotion, especially if you like the lavender fragrance.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells SO freaking good!</li>
            <li> I love love love the true lavender scent of this lotion. It is a good value for a natural product. The only drawback is that I found it leaves my skin feeling a bit sticky or tacky feeling (NOT greasy though) even hours after application, especially where my clothes make contact, even if I let it completely dry first. Overall, it is a great light moisturizer, and although I can live with the sticky feeling through this bottle, I might try a few other different kinds before settling on a favorite lavender scented lotion.</li>
            <li> love the aroma and all the natural ingridients</li>
            <li> Love this lavender scent.....</li>
            <li> Love, love this product!</li>
            <li> I like the smell and feel of this.  It seems to be absorbed quickly and my skin feels better after using it.  I will buy more.</li>
            <li> It smells very herbal to me - I absolutely love the fragrance, but it might not appeal to everyone.  Not floral at all.  It reminds me of an Aveda salon, if you&#x27;ve been to one. Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> This lotion has always been my go-to favorite.  I use it daily and love that it has all natural, organic ingredients so I&#x27;m not rubbing chemicals into my skin.  But the most recent time I purchased it, I found that they changed the formula.  It is thicker than before, so less is definitely more.  But the worst part is that it smells different.  I always loved the nice lavender scent, but now it has an overpowering medical smell.  Maybe it&#x27;s the aloe?  I wish they&#x27;d go back to the original formula.  In the meantime, I&#x27;m on the market for a new lotion.</li>
            <li> I have gotten this lotion before so I already know it was good loton but what a great deal. Defintly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Fast Speedy Delivery Service - Excellent product for dry skin, or mild skin problems - Excellent Product - I highly recommend to everyone whom I know....</li>
            <li> I use this with the hand soap of the same scent.  It is a nice lotion -- absorbs well, not oily.</li>
            <li> Love it. Great for dry skin.  Hard now to find in Canada!</li>
            <li> The lotion is very good. This time, though, the bottle push top fails to get the lotion out. One has to open the bottle and get the contents this way.. A bit disappointing</li>
            <li> love the lavender scent and how quickly it absorbs into my skin!</li>
            <li> I find this product overpriced, but the lavender fragrance is scrumptious.  I add a teaspoon or so to a handful of my tanning lotion.  Thoroughly mixed, it helps prevent color-streaking on my legs and overrides the chemical smell that such tanning lotions have.</li>
            <li> We buy this in bulk at our home. Smells wonderful and can be used on the face too. It is great!</li>
            <li> This is a terrific product that does exactly what you would like it to do!  Have recommended it to friends.</li>
            <li> she likes it, smells good but that fades fast</li>
            <li> I like the way the lotion absorbs and feels. Not too greasy, which is great. I don&#x27;t like that I smell a lot of citrus, like lime juice, that over powers the lavendar smell. I intended to use this lotion as part of my before bed routine. It seems more appropriate for a morning routine, as citrus is known for awakening, not calming.</li>
