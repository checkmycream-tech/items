            <li>Not the great deal i thought it was.</li>
            <li>Remington DA-307 is great.  </li>
            <li>I have owned , great close shave.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t work as well, but when fully charged it works great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with my purchase though and will probably do this again at some time.</li>
            <li>This economy shaver is really a great value.</li>
            <li>You will be happy.</li>
            <li>This is a beast of a razor but for the price it is great.  </li>
            <li>from that, they&#x27;re a great product</li>
            <li>THAT DOES NOT SHAVE GOOD TO ME</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say one good thing about this shaver.</li>
            <li>Good Product, close shave and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>It is good for 3 or 4 days</li>
            <li>I have purchased this brand and model reconditioned shaver before and loved it.  </li>
            <li>It work at home and abroad and good price too.</li>
            <li>A good value.</li>
            <li>I now enjoy looking good and feeling good!</li>
            <li>Over the years, I have been most happy with this brand/model of electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>very satisfied with the performance and quality of this</li>
            <li>Absolutely great razor and having a replacement that works like new is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Very strong and has a good charge.</li>
            <li>Works great for light to medium use.</li>
            <li>Does an excellent job, It has lots of power and really shaves close...AOK.</li>
            <li>this works well for me and the price sure is good.</li>
            <li>An excellent value, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>After receiving it and placing it on charge, I let my beard grow (uninhibited) for more than a week.  </li>
            <li>It is heavy, but it is good, real good.  </li>
            <li>and I am extremely satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li>The screen, blade and batteries would cost you more than the price of this shaver.</li>
            <li>It fits my hand perfectly, I wouldn&#x27;t want it any smaller.</li>
            <li>Much better shaver and price.</li>
            <li>The two steel rods that hold the blades are bent on one end - which make most of the blades end up well beneath the surface of the foil.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver.</li>
            <li>I am use to using this version, and found it is better than the lastest Remington Shaver.  </li>
            <li>replacement parts.l love this shaver.</li>
            <li>I have always used this shaver and was glad to be able to buy it again...</li>

            <li>This is one of the best shaving Remingtons I&#x27;ve had since 1965 when I got my first one for high school graduation.  </li>
            <li>Like new for a great price.  </li>
            <li>But if you don&#x27;t mind dealing with charging and batteries, this is an excellent shaver, but not worth</li>
            <li>I think this is one of the best razors ever produced, just wish I had the black colored one</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>Everything went fine with the order.</li>
            <li>Luckily I still had the blade part from my previous shaver - I was able to pop it on and now the shaver works perfectly.</li>
            <li>I ran across this one on Amazon and my new old friend is perfect.  </li>
            <li>I bought a similar Remington in the 80&#x27;s and it worked great for over 20 years.  </li>
            <li>It is important</li>
            <li>Great for facial hair !!!!</li>
            <li>Anyway - if it wasn&#x27;t for the one (but an important one) part being messed up, I would have given this shaver five stars.</li>
            <li>This shaver is smooth on your skin.</li>
            <li>The charger works but the indicator light never goes off.</li>
            <li>WELL IF THIS IS THE CASE, WHY WILL SO MANY GOOD SELLERS, TAKE A ITEM BACK,</li>
            <li>The razor doesn&#x27;t do a good job and is loud to boot.  </li>
            <li>I buy a new one about every 2 years and seems better than the many alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My experience with a earlier reconditioned shaver was not so good, but this one seems fine.</li>
            <li>With no power drop because of batteries, the shave is always consistenly smooth and quick.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money so far so good.</li>
            <li>It provides a clean cut.</li>
            <li>Great battery life, sharp blades, close comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>Most screens, though, are after-market but reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>and I had to replace it and found it was better just to buy the whole shave instead of</li>
            <li>While the shave quality was not bad, the batteries in both died.</li>
            <li>This thing shaves close, and with a fresh charge is very powerful.</li>
            <li>I have tried top of the line Remington shavers that cost way more money and none of them give me the same close shave as the tried and true DA 307.  </li>
            <li>Are the older ones the better ones?</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, a quick message to Remington.  </li>
            <li>It does have a quick charge feature.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver, although this is an older version.</li>
            <li>I have been extremely satisfied with them, and highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>This is the first electric razor I have ever had that gives a close shave that is also comfortable.</li>
            <li>the shaver is like new and actually better built than the newer models.</li>
            <li>A great shave under a minute and a half for one day&#x27;s growth.</li>
            <li>I have bought 3 of these reconditioned electric shavers (2 from Amazon), and they have been great little shavers.</li>
            <li>I got this cheap and really like the shave I get.</li>
            <li>Yes, powerful also means loud, but the time it&#x27;ll save you over the more elite shaver products is completely worth it.  </li>
            <li>For the price it is worth it.</li>
            <li>is right.  </li>
            <li>In fact, for my money these shavers could just as easily be classified as &#x27;Factory New.&#x27;</li>
            <li>My husband just bought his 3rd shaver of this kind in 10 years because he loves it so much.</li>
            <li>So far this shaver is working fine.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product since it first came on the market.  </li>
            <li>Sure enough!</li>
            <li>Much better than current models from Remington</li>
            <li>Evidently this must be updated from the DA 307</li>
            <li>I bought this for my son as his first razor.</li>
            <li>If you have a tough/heavy beard this razor will make short work of it and give your arm a work out too :)</li>
            <li>This was a basic $30 shaver and I am quite certain that I could sell my 9 remaing shavers at more than $200/piece.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is better than any other shaver I&#x27;ve tried (have tried over 20 different units)  and buying the rebuilt units is the cheapest way to make sure you always have a razor that is  like &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>If you are lucky enough to get original Remington screens, they will last significantly longer {up to 6 months}.</li>
            <li>I figured no, that&#x27;s not a good option, so rather than buy more batteries for these or more battery shavers, I just was able to buy two brand new Remington Microscreen 2 CORD ONLY shavers...</li>
            <li>This thing looks like and weighs as much as a brick, but its size and weight allows it to have a bigger power cell, making it a powerful shaver that gets the job done quickly.  </li>
            <li>The beard trimmer is pretty decent also.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It cuts very close</li>
            <li>I really like this product and the price</li>
            <li>The cord on these electric Remingtons I just bought are straight...</li>
            <li>If it is not broken don&#x27;t fix it.  </li>
            <li>Shaves very well...</li>
            <li>Fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li>It worked as if it were new, maybe even better than new (and I&#x27;ve owned several of these over the years).</li>
            <li>He would replace the foils when they wear out, but it&#x27;s worth it to spend $30 on the shaver and get a new cutter blade and brand new shaver/battery at this price.</li>
            <li>I purchased this &amp;#34;factory refurbished&amp;#34; model (exact replica of my old shaver)</li>
            <li>Still, I was lucky Amazon has merchants that sell the electric only version with no batteries.  </li>
            <li>It does a decent job.</li>
            <li>: I found that this particular unit (unlike identical ones I&#x27;ve purchased before on Amazon) has a shorter battery life before it has to be charged.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it gives a close shave and has high revs so no pulling or&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to press much harder to get a somewhat smooth shave &amp; finish off with a handheld disposable razor.</li>
            <li>Worth the money if you do not mind keeping it fully charged when the battery gets low</li>
            <li>The DA-57 is the same shaver but is brand new, factory fresh, on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Now if you want to put new batteries in.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame they don&#x27;t make new ones anymore.</li>
            <li>The cord was new, the screen was new, and the cutters were new.</li>
            <li>Although marketed and sold as &#x27;factory refurbished&#x27;, it was practically brand new condition.  </li>
            <li>Instead of buying new blades and foil for an existing Remington razor, I decided to buy a reconditioned shaver.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s a creature of habit and likes to stay with the same unit, thus this razor fit the bill totally!</li>
            <li>Very loud and noisy.  </li>
            <li>My initial impression is positive.</li>
            <li>Really the only thing that wasn&#x27;t new was the shaver body itself - but it appears to have been well cleaned and sanitized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re set on a rechargeable, the basic Remingtons for less than $35 are probably a better deal.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully I was able to find some brand new ones on Amazon a few years back and bought 10 of them along with replacement cuters..  </li>
            <li>they&#x27;re like this but no batteries, no waiting to charge, no loud buzzing, just a consistent power shaver that I can now keep and use the old foils and cutters from this DA-307.  </li>
            <li>But I also, only really charge it when it runs out of power, about once a week.</li>
            <li>When I received the shaver I was, frankly, surprised.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold the charge that any of my old ones did.</li>
            <li>The old DA-407 {unavailable now} had the ability to shave while recharging.</li>
            <li>I was going to replace the cutters in it but a refurbished one was only a few dollars more.</li>
            <li>I love this shave because it gets the hair down to the skin as if you never had hair!!!</li>
            <li>It will loose the charge very fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;to take off the foil covering and use the little brush to clean off the cutters on a&lt;br /&gt;regular basis.  </li>
            <li>This is the 3rd purchase of this razor as my first died after 4 years of daily use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It provides very close shaves and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>NOT THIS SELLER, THEY DO NOT WANT TO TAKE MY NEW SHAVER BACK,</li>
            <li>Though I only paid $25 each for these, they now want $40 at the shaver centers to put new batteries in.  </li>
            <li>This time the shaver, while having new packaging, was not properly (or at all?) reconditioned.  </li>
            <li>I have had this same shaver in the past but the battery died and I was only able to find this model on Amazon.</li>
            <li>, the list is endless, and its new, and does not shave well for you, all the other stores will take the shaver back, replace it, or refund your money, right.</li>
            <li>I notice the battery does not last as long on a charge as my old one.</li>
            <li>I use it for travel or a quick shave when I am running late.</li>
            <li>When you buy a new shaver from any other place, ebay, walmart, target, walgreens, ect.</li>
            <li>Over the last couple of months I have gone through two other, new Remington electric shavers that didn&#x27;t come close to what the D3 2000 shaver was and, so, ended up tossing them.  </li>

            <li> I have tried top of the line Remington shavers that cost way more money and none of them give me the same close shave as the tried and true DA 307.  </li>
            <li> Are the older ones the better ones?</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, a quick message to Remington.  </li>
            <li> It does have a quick charge feature.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver, although this is an older version.</li>
            <li> I have been extremely satisfied with them, and highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric razor I have ever had that gives a close shave that is also comfortable.</li>
            <li> the shaver is like new and actually better built than the newer models.</li>
            <li> A great shave under a minute and a half for one day&#x27;s growth.</li>
            <li> I have bought 3 of these reconditioned electric shavers (2 from Amazon), and they have been great little shavers.</li>
            <li> I got this cheap and really like the shave I get.</li>
            <li> Yes, powerful also means loud, but the time it&#x27;ll save you over the more elite shaver products is completely worth it.  </li>
            <li> For the price it is worth it.</li>
            <li> is right.  </li>
            <li> In fact, for my money these shavers could just as easily be classified as &#x27;Factory New.&#x27;</li>
            <li> My husband just bought his 3rd shaver of this kind in 10 years because he loves it so much.</li>
            <li> So far this shaver is working fine.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since it first came on the market.  </li>
            <li> Sure enough!</li>
            <li> Much better than current models from Remington</li>
            <li> Evidently this must be updated from the DA 307</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son as his first razor.</li>
            <li> If you have a tough/heavy beard this razor will make short work of it and give your arm a work out too :)</li>
            <li> This was a basic $30 shaver and I am quite certain that I could sell my 9 remaing shavers at more than $200/piece.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is better than any other shaver I&#x27;ve tried (have tried over 20 different units)  and buying the rebuilt units is the cheapest way to make sure you always have a razor that is  like &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> If you are lucky enough to get original Remington screens, they will last significantly longer {up to 6 months}.</li>
            <li> I figured no, that&#x27;s not a good option, so rather than buy more batteries for these or more battery shavers, I just was able to buy two brand new Remington Microscreen 2 CORD ONLY shavers...</li>
            <li> This thing looks like and weighs as much as a brick, but its size and weight allows it to have a bigger power cell, making it a powerful shaver that gets the job done quickly.  </li>
            <li> The beard trimmer is pretty decent also.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It cuts very close</li>
            <li> I really like this product and the price</li>
            <li> The cord on these electric Remingtons I just bought are straight...</li>
            <li> If it is not broken don&#x27;t fix it.  </li>
            <li> Shaves very well...</li>
            <li> Fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li> It worked as if it were new, maybe even better than new (and I&#x27;ve owned several of these over the years).</li>
            <li> He would replace the foils when they wear out, but it&#x27;s worth it to spend $30 on the shaver and get a new cutter blade and brand new shaver/battery at this price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this &amp;#34;factory refurbished&amp;#34; model (exact replica of my old shaver)</li>
            <li> Still, I was lucky Amazon has merchants that sell the electric only version with no batteries.  </li>
            <li> It does a decent job.</li>
            <li> : I found that this particular unit (unlike identical ones I&#x27;ve purchased before on Amazon) has a shorter battery life before it has to be charged.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it gives a close shave and has high revs so no pulling or&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to press much harder to get a somewhat smooth shave &amp; finish off with a handheld disposable razor.</li>
            <li> Worth the money if you do not mind keeping it fully charged when the battery gets low</li>
            <li> The DA-57 is the same shaver but is brand new, factory fresh, on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Now if you want to put new batteries in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame they don&#x27;t make new ones anymore.</li>
            <li> The cord was new, the screen was new, and the cutters were new.</li>
            <li> Although marketed and sold as &#x27;factory refurbished&#x27;, it was practically brand new condition.  </li>
            <li> Instead of buying new blades and foil for an existing Remington razor, I decided to buy a reconditioned shaver.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s a creature of habit and likes to stay with the same unit, thus this razor fit the bill totally!</li>
            <li> Very loud and noisy.  </li>
            <li> My initial impression is positive.</li>
            <li> Really the only thing that wasn&#x27;t new was the shaver body itself - but it appears to have been well cleaned and sanitized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re set on a rechargeable, the basic Remingtons for less than $35 are probably a better deal.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully I was able to find some brand new ones on Amazon a few years back and bought 10 of them along with replacement cuters..  </li>
            <li> they&#x27;re like this but no batteries, no waiting to charge, no loud buzzing, just a consistent power shaver that I can now keep and use the old foils and cutters from this DA-307.  </li>
            <li> But I also, only really charge it when it runs out of power, about once a week.</li>
            <li> When I received the shaver I was, frankly, surprised.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold the charge that any of my old ones did.</li>
            <li> The old DA-407 {unavailable now} had the ability to shave while recharging.</li>
            <li> I was going to replace the cutters in it but a refurbished one was only a few dollars more.</li>
            <li> I love this shave because it gets the hair down to the skin as if you never had hair!!!</li>
            <li> It will loose the charge very fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;to take off the foil covering and use the little brush to clean off the cutters on a&lt;br /&gt;regular basis.  </li>
            <li> This is the 3rd purchase of this razor as my first died after 4 years of daily use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It provides very close shaves and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> NOT THIS SELLER, THEY DO NOT WANT TO TAKE MY NEW SHAVER BACK,</li>
            <li> Though I only paid $25 each for these, they now want $40 at the shaver centers to put new batteries in.  </li>
            <li> This time the shaver, while having new packaging, was not properly (or at all?) reconditioned.  </li>
            <li> I have had this same shaver in the past but the battery died and I was only able to find this model on Amazon.</li>
            <li> , the list is endless, and its new, and does not shave well for you, all the other stores will take the shaver back, replace it, or refund your money, right.</li>
            <li> I notice the battery does not last as long on a charge as my old one.</li>
            <li> I use it for travel or a quick shave when I am running late.</li>
            <li> When you buy a new shaver from any other place, ebay, walmart, target, walgreens, ect.</li>
            <li> Over the last couple of months I have gone through two other, new Remington electric shavers that didn&#x27;t come close to what the D3 2000 shaver was and, so, ended up tossing them.  </li>
            <li> The pop-up trimmer mowed down the overall accumulated beard (something that the trimmers on the new ones that I tried out wouldn&#x27;t do) and the resulting shave; after having done that; was totally satisfactory.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased about a half dozen (both new and refurbished)</li>
            <li> I wanted the same model because it works so well and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Still, as long as you can get these at the refurbished price, don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase.</li>
            <li> It was disappointing, but true!</li>
            <li> but when it sounds just a little low needs to be recharged.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry about that rough feeling.</li>
            <li> It seems to work as well as other shavers, even though the price was not high.</li>
            <li> As of Jan 1, 2016, Amazon still carries this version for less than half this price of the cord only version---no charging, no batteries, and will outlast the 307.  </li>
            <li> On the down side, the shaver screens only last {me, at least} about 3-4 months {depending on where you get them}.  </li>
            <li> , THEY ARE AWFUL TO DEAL WITH ON RETURNS, EVEN IF THE ITEM WAS BRAND NEW, AND YOU HAVE TO OPEN THE BOX, CHARGE IT TO TRY IT, RIGHT, AFTER THIS FROM THIS SELLER, ITS A USED SHAVER, AND AGAIN WILL NOT TAKE IT BACK, BUYER BEWARE OF THIS SELLER.......</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to use other ones</li>
            <li> but thats due to the charger built in to it.</li>
            <li> I AM LETTING THE OTHER AMAZON BUYERS KNOW</li>
            <li> I have also tried other brands of shavers and none of them give me the close shave that this shaver provides.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint has been the battery.</li>
            <li> bought this shaver to replace one just like it that gave me years of service till it just recently died (or at least till the rechargeable batteries</li>
            <li> so if it gets run down you&#x27;ll have to charge it back up for at least 15 minutes to get a 6 or 7 minute shave.  </li>
            <li> A little on the heavy side</li>
            <li> The thing i hated most is that it tore up my neck</li>
            <li> The battery lasts for a few shaves.</li>
            <li> A waste of hard earned money.  </li>
            <li> The one delivered has a different cutting blade &amp; the screen seems finer.</li>
            <li> I tried using the shaver a couple times after getting it and it never seemed to work, or at least never seemed to work as well as the one I just retired.</li>
            <li> The shaver screen that glides along the user&#x27;s face was broken and missing in two spots.  </li>
            <li> Not a good razor for a close cut.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good at all.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A POOR SELLER</li>
            <li> Razor cuts poorly.  </li>
            <li> the cutting part broken on my shaver</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s just this unit and would be unlikely if I ordered another one of identical make and model.</li>
            <li> Frustrated after tying it again this morning I pulled the head off it just to see if there was anything on the blades as it didn&#x27;t seem to be cutting my beard.</li>
            <li> Remington DA-307 shavers, and have never had a bad experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was very unhappy when Remington discontinued this model.  </li>
            <li> I hate to imagine the hassle I would have had trying to get that part replaced.</li>
            <li> Bad decision!!!!.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This reconditioned DA-307 works just great!  I have been using a D3 2000 Remington for years (it was a gift) but it was finally giving up the ghost.  While looking to rerplace it with same, I found the price to be closer to $360.  Over the last couple of months I have gone through two other, new Remington electric shavers that didn&#x27;t come close to what the D3 2000 shaver was and, so, ended up tossing them.  The DA-307 was to be my last attempt at finding something that worked from this manufacturer.  After receiving it and placing it on charge, I let my beard grow (uninhibited) for more than a week.  I just gave the DA-307 a chance to perform... and perform it did!  The pop-up trimmer mowed down the overall accumulated beard (something that the trimmers on the new ones that I tried out wouldn&#x27;t do) and the resulting shave; after having done that; was totally satisfactory.  Is there something going on here?  Are the older ones the better ones?</li>
            <li> I bought a similar Remington in the 80&#x27;s and it worked great for over 20 years.  I ran across this one on Amazon and my new old friend is perfect.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> It is heavy, but it is good, real good.  Does an excellent job, It has lots of power and really shaves close...AOK.</li>
            <li> This thing looks like and weighs as much as a brick, but its size and weight allows it to have a bigger power cell, making it a powerful shaver that gets the job done quickly.  Yes, powerful also means loud, but the time it&#x27;ll save you over the more elite shaver products is completely worth it.  Uses a Ni-Cd power cell, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any decline in power over 2+ years.  But I also, only really charge it when it runs out of power, about once a week.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years. Have a very sensitive beard and must be very careful with shaving. This shaver is better than any other shaver I&#x27;ve tried (have tried over 20 different units)  and buying the rebuilt units is the cheapest way to make sure you always have a razor that is  like &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I have been most happy with this brand/model of electric shaver.  I&#x27;ve tried to use other ones but this one gives me the closest shave quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Great quality and value!</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd purchase of this razor as my first died after 4 years of daily use.&lt;br /&gt;It cuts very close and I am extremely satisfied with this product.  It is important&lt;br /&gt;to take off the foil covering and use the little brush to clean off the cutters on a&lt;br /&gt;regular basis.  A great shave under a minute and a half for one day&#x27;s growth.</li>
            <li> Great shaver. A little on the heavy side but thats due to the charger built in to it. The only draw back is that you cant use the shaver during charging but I still give it five stars.</li>
            <li> When you buy a new shaver from any other place, ebay, walmart, target, walgreens, ect., the list is endless, and its new, and does not shave well for you, all the other stores will take the shaver back, replace it, or refund your money, right. NOT THIS SELLER, THEY DO NOT WANT TO TAKE MY NEW SHAVER BACK, THAT DOES NOT SHAVE GOOD TO ME AT ALL, BECAUSE ITS A HEALTH REASONS, WELL IF THIS IS THE CASE, WHY WILL SO MANY GOOD SELLERS, TAKE A ITEM BACK, THAT DOES NOT WORK WELL FOR THE BUYER, AND NO QUESTIONS ASKED. ENEN IF IT IS A MEN&#x27;S SHAVER, USED ON A MAN&#x27;S FACE. THIS IS A POOR SELLER, I WOULD NOT DO BUSSINESS WITH THEM AGAIN, AND I AM LETTING THE OTHER AMAZON BUYERS KNOW, THEY ARE AWFUL TO DEAL WITH ON RETURNS, EVEN IF THE ITEM WAS BRAND NEW, AND YOU HAVE TO OPEN THE BOX, CHARGE IT TO TRY IT, RIGHT, AFTER THIS FROM THIS SELLER, ITS A USED SHAVER, AND AGAIN WILL NOT TAKE IT BACK, BUYER BEWARE OF THIS SELLER.......STAY AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE,......</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since it first came on the market.  It provides very close shaves and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and the price is right.  I buy a new one about every 2 years and seems better than the many alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$30 every 2 years for an excellent shave.</li>
            <li> Like new for a great price.  The screen, blade and batteries would cost you more than the price of this shaver.</li>
            <li> this razor is &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;.  I wish I had bought a more expensive one as it doesn&#x27;t get a close shave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for about 12 years. I was going to replace the cutters in it but a refurbished one was only a few dollars more. I wanted the same model because it works so well and lasts a long time. The one I received looks and works like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It weighs 7 oz, I don&#x27;t know why anyone would complain about the weight. It feels solid in your hand, not like some of the junk you can buy. It fits my hand perfectly, I wouldn&#x27;t want it any smaller. The trimmer works great too. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. I can&#x27;t believe the low price for such a quality product.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best shaving Remingtons I&#x27;ve had since 1965 when I got my first one for high school graduation.  I have two of these but they are starting to die as the batteries wear out.  Though I only paid $25 each for these, they now want $40 at the shaver centers to put new batteries in.  I figured no, that&#x27;s not a good option, so rather than buy more batteries for these or more battery shavers, I just was able to buy two brand new Remington Microscreen 2 CORD ONLY shavers...they&#x27;re like this but no batteries, no waiting to charge, no loud buzzing, just a consistent power shaver that I can now keep and use the old foils and cutters from this DA-307.  The cord on these electric Remingtons I just bought are straight...no coiled cord to pull against you.  With no power drop because of batteries, the shave is always consistenly smooth and quick.  But if you don&#x27;t mind dealing with charging and batteries, this is an excellent shaver, but not worth the price dealers are now charging because they don&#x27;t make them anymore.  If you&#x27;re set on a rechargeable, the basic Remingtons for less than $35 are probably a better deal.  Still, I was lucky Amazon has merchants that sell the electric only version with no batteries.  As of Jan 1, 2016, Amazon still carries this version for less than half this price of the cord only version---no charging, no batteries, and will outlast the 307.  The DA-57 is the same shaver but is brand new, factory fresh, on Amazon.  Much better shaver and price.</li>
            <li> It will loose the charge very fast. Not the great deal i thought it was. Now if you want to put new batteries in.</li>
            <li> So far this shaver is working fine. I use it in the car. It seems to work as well as other shavers, even though the price was not high.</li>
            <li> I purchased this &amp;#34;factory refurbished&amp;#34; model (exact replica of my old shaver) and it works perfectly.  g.r.derman, homestead, florida, USA</li>
            <li> I have had this same shaver in the past but the battery died and I was only able to find this model on Amazon. I love this shave because it gets the hair down to the skin as if you never had hair!!! Great for facial hair !!!!</li>
            <li> Factory reconditioned shaver.&lt;br /&gt;3 shaves then you will have to charge it.&lt;br /&gt;Results are poor.&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic is way better.&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Foil ripped open while I was shaving.....Ouch!&lt;br /&gt;Have to buy another shaver today.&lt;br /&gt;Cheap. DO NOT BUY!&lt;br /&gt;Updated 9/25/2013&lt;br /&gt;Original comments July 25, 2013.&lt;br /&gt;Have to buy another shaver today!</li>
            <li> The razor doesn&#x27;t do a good job and is loud to boot.  The thing i hated most is that it tore up my neck something fierce - razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say one good thing about this shaver.</li>
            <li> Awesome and I truly loved this product!!!</li>
            <li> Got this for my 88-year-old father-in-law.  He&#x27;s a creature of habit and likes to stay with the same unit, thus this razor fit the bill totally! I could not find this unit locally, but figured Amazon would have it. Sure enough!</li>
            <li> I have used two of these shavers in a row bought factory reconditioned. While the shave quality was not bad, the batteries in both died. One after 4 months and the second after 2 weeks. Had to throw both out. I will never buy Remington again and advise to stay away.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shaver for over 30 years.  I have tried top of the line Remington shavers that cost way more money and none of them give me the same close shave as the tried and true DA 307.  I have also tried other brands of shavers and none of them give me the close shave that this shaver provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very unhappy when Remington discontinued this model.  Thankfully I was able to find some brand new ones on Amazon a few years back and bought 10 of them along with replacement cuters..  That should last me the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, a quick message to Remington.  If it is not broken don&#x27;t fix it.  Tons of people like the DA-307 model and you should bring it back.  This was a basic $30 shaver and I am quite certain that I could sell my 9 remaing shavers at more than $200/piece.  When will companies start listening to the consumer?</li>
            <li> Remington DA-307 is great.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Good Product, close shave and inexpensive. I use it for travel or a quick shave when I am running late.</li>
            <li> for a close shave and to be a rugget  shaver i can take with me on the go without it getting damaged</li>
            <li> does not work as well as the prior one i purchased</li>
            <li> This is the 3 rd DA 307 I have owned , great close shave. Much better than current models from Remington I have tried. It&#x27;s a shame they don&#x27;t make new ones anymore.</li>
            <li> I got this cheap and really like the shave I get. The battery lasts for a few shaves. The shaver does not work on AC cord when plugged in, it only recharges the battery. It does have a quick charge feature.</li>
            <li> very satisfied with the performance and quality of this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;it gives a close shave and has high revs so no pulling or&lt;br /&gt;snatching is felt.</li>
            <li> I think this is one of the best razors ever produced, just wish I had the black colored one, my household has three of the blue ones.</li>
            <li> Worth the money if you do not mind keeping it fully charged when the battery gets low it doesn&#x27;t work as well, but when fully charged it works great. I still like it but when it sounds just a little low needs to be recharged.</li>
            <li> shavers are very individual - what works with some beards will not work for others.  this works well for me and the price sure is good.</li>
            <li> Evidently this must be updated from the DA 307 I used to have. The one delivered has a different cutting blade &amp; the screen seems finer. I have to press much harder to get a somewhat smooth shave &amp; finish off with a handheld disposable razor. Wouldn&#x27;t have ordered if I knew this was the shave I&#x27;d be getting.</li>
            <li> When I received the shaver I was, frankly, surprised. It worked as if it were new, maybe even better than new (and I&#x27;ve owned several of these over the years). My only complaint has been the battery. It doesn&#x27;t hold the charge that any of my old ones did. It is good for 3 or 4 days and then I need to recharge. The beard trimmer is pretty decent also. My experience with a earlier reconditioned shaver was not so good, but this one seems fine. All in all I&#x27;m happy with my purchase though and will probably do this again at some time.</li>
            <li> Razor cuts poorly.  Not a good razor for a close cut. Very loud and noisy.  Not recommended at any price.</li>
            <li> This economy shaver is really a great value. Shaves very well...this is my third one in about 15 years.  Only downside is that you cannot shave while plugged in....so if it gets run down you&#x27;ll have to charge it back up for at least 15 minutes to get a 6 or 7 minute shave.  The old DA-407 {unavailable now} had the ability to shave while recharging. Still, as long as you can get these at the refurbished price, don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase. On the down side, the shaver screens only last {me, at least} about 3-4 months {depending on where you get them}.  If you are lucky enough to get original Remington screens, they will last significantly longer {up to 6 months}. Most screens, though, are after-market but reasonably priced.  See my review of these screens.</li>
            <li> After reading  the favorable review regarding this shaver I decided to purchase one. Bad decision!!!!. A waste of hard earned money.  I am African American and this shaver will not I repeat will not shave my facial hairs. Additionally don&#x27;t even attempt to return this shaver to the seller  i.e. the shaver must not I repeat must not have been used in order to get a credit from the seller.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I will use it for a paper weight.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this brand and model reconditioned shaver before and loved it.  This time the shaver, while having new packaging, was not properly (or at all?) reconditioned.  The shaver screen that glides along the user&#x27;s face was broken and missing in two spots.  The shaver blades under the screen had shavings in them and the blade looked used.  I am hopeful this is a fluke, so am returning for a replacement.</li>
            <li> I was going to give this shaver 5-stars - but then changed my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this shaver to replace one just like it that gave me years of service till it just recently died (or at least till the rechargeable batteries died.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew this was a recondition shaver when I bought it. And it appeared to be restored to like-new condition. The cord was new, the screen was new, and the cutters were new. Really the only thing that wasn&#x27;t new was the shaver body itself - but it appears to have been well cleaned and sanitized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is making me give this shaver three-stars is that the cutters that came with it are bent. I tried using the shaver a couple times after getting it and it never seemed to work, or at least never seemed to work as well as the one I just retired. Frustrated after tying it again this morning I pulled the head off it just to see if there was anything on the blades as it didn&#x27;t seem to be cutting my beard. That&#x27;s when I discovered the deformity with the cutter blades. The two steel rods that hold the blades are bent on one end - which make most of the blades end up well beneath the surface of the foil. Luckily I still had the blade part from my previous shaver - I was able to pop it on and now the shaver works perfectly. I hate to imagine the hassle I would have had trying to get that part replaced. Anyway - if it wasn&#x27;t for the one (but an important one) part being messed up, I would have given this shaver five stars.</li>
            <li> Although marketed and sold as &#x27;factory refurbished&#x27;, it was practically brand new condition.  Great battery life, sharp blades, close comfortable shave.  An excellent value, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son as his first razor. My initial impression is positive.Works great for light to medium use. Well worth the money so far so good.</li>
            <li> This is my second one. It work at home and abroad and good price too. I&#x27;ll come back in the future.</li>
            <li> I  won the gamble. the shaver is like new and actually better built than the newer models. You will be happy.</li>
            <li> This thing shaves close, and with a fresh charge is very powerful. Pop-up trimmer takes care of the pesky hairs. A good value.</li>
            <li> Absolutely great razor and having a replacement that works like new is wonderful. I am satisfied!!! For some reason this model of razor shaves me the best of all electrics.</li>
            <li> Instead of buying new blades and foil for an existing Remington razor, I decided to buy a reconditioned shaver. I notice the battery does not last as long on a charge as my old one. It does shave close though.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to worry about using clippers anymore when you can use this. Don&#x27;t worry about that rough feeling. This shaver is smooth on your skin.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver. Very strong and has a good charge. Fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver, although this is an older version. I am use to using this version, and found it is better than the lastest Remington Shaver.  the cutting part broken on my shaver and I had to replace it and found it was better just to buy the whole shave instead of replacement parts.l love this shaver. It provides a clean cut.</li>
            <li> I have bought 3 of these reconditioned electric shavers (2 from Amazon), and they have been great little shavers. In fact, for my money these shavers could just as easily be classified as &#x27;Factory New.&#x27; I have been extremely satisfied with them, and highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good at all.</li>
            <li> I have always used this shaver and was glad to be able to buy it again... so I bought another just to have it when the 1st one dies.</li>
            <li> It does a decent job. The charger works but the indicator light never goes off. For the price it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Works fine. Take it or leave it. 18 more words required. 18 more words required. 18 more words required. 18 more words required. 18 more words required.</li>
            <li> Arrived timely and well packaged.  This is a beast of a razor but for the price it is great.  If you have a tough/heavy beard this razor will make short work of it and give your arm a work out too :)</li>
            <li> This is the first electric razor I have ever had that gives a close shave that is also comfortable. I now enjoy looking good and feeling good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased about a half dozen (both new and refurbished) Remington DA-307 shavers, and have never had a bad experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only design flaw seems to be that after two or three years, the flip-out trimmer quits working...and for the life of me I can&#x27;t figure out why (or how to fix it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that, they&#x27;re a great product and I hope they keep making them forever.</li>
            <li> Everything went fine with the order. Mdse is as described. Arrived on time. Could not be happier one, two, three</li>
            <li> My husband just bought his 3rd shaver of this kind in 10 years because he loves it so much. He would replace the foils when they wear out, but it&#x27;s worth it to spend $30 on the shaver and get a new cutter blade and brand new shaver/battery at this price. He loves this DA 307 brand of Remington and hopes they keep making it in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 8/19/2013: I found that this particular unit (unlike identical ones I&#x27;ve purchased before on Amazon) has a shorter battery life before it has to be charged. It was disappointing, but true! I think it&#x27;s just this unit and would be unlikely if I ordered another one of identical make and model.</li>
