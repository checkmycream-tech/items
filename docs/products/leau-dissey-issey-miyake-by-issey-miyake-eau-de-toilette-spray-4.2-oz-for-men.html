            <li>#34;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>Amazon was great regarding this problem and offered me a full refund.  </li>
            <li>It has a strong clean radiant scent!!!</li>
            <li>Very large and beautiful bottle.</li>

            <li>Great size, smells so fresh and light...!  </li>
            <li>I bought because the price was too good to be true, I learned my lesson.</li>
            <li>You may think you&#x27;re putting too much during the application, but the dry-down is perfect - sweet grapefruit, a pinch of spicy, but mostly woody.  </li>
            <li>Not a heavy strong odour, just perfect</li>
            <li>Love the smell</li>

            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I was able to save 20.00</li>

            <li>The best smell ever, for a man&#x27;s after shave spray, and I now use the women&#x27;s Issey Miyake perfume for the same reason!  </li>
            <li>The scent is ok but it does not stay.  </li>
            <li>My favorite fragrance Issey Miyake ...</li>

            <li>What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>Honestly I am satisfied with the purchase of this product.</li>
            <li>IF THIS IS YOUR FIRST TIME PURCHASING THIS, YOU WONT REGRET IT!!!</li>
            <li>It smells awesome but after 3-4 hours smell is pretty much gone bearly on ur skin...</li>

            <li>Others Ive tried and liked wear off quickly but Issey lasts all day.</li>
            <li>It smells really nice and it was delivered really quick.</li>
            <li>Loved it got to me really fast after I placed my order totally satisfied</li>
            <li>its a very special fragance you can use any time of the day</li>
            <li>The product is of very good quality, the downside was I presented with the purchase as it bid for 2 units and only got me one.</li>
            <li>They wanted to ensure safe and secure arrival so they upgraded my shipping to 2 day</li>
            <li>I loved the fragrance so much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend buying this product, Fast shipping, good product,  Issey Miyake</li>
            <li>I knew it was the real thing &amp; that I had gotten a good deal on this product</li>
            <li>The early arrival combined with the great price made this transaction so easy.  </li>
            <li>Great price for such a classic, timeless, great smelling scent.</li>
            <li>The original is timeless and elegant.</li>
            <li>I would definitely purchase this item again and the price was great - cost $30 more at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Seems lagit, smells good definitely a decent add to the collection.</li>
            <li>excellent article, very practical, very fast modern yy.</li>
            <li>Fantastic Fragrance, super service!</li>
            <li>Truly enjoy the scent.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the product.</li>
            <li>Genuine product.  </li>
            <li>This cologne fits his manly, firm but loving personality!!!!</li>
            <li>if you spray directly to contact you&#x27;ll get a citrus smell, but if you let it spray in the air first and let it fall on to you, smells more pleasant of a sweet smell</li>
            <li>as always this is an excelent product, original and I am already using it.</li>
            <li>YOU WILL SEE GREAT SMELLING AND LASTS  ALL DAY LONG /</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the original</li>
            <li>Product exceletente attention was great, widely recommended</li>
            <li>Apparently only good reviews are accepted.</li>
            <li>True to product details.</li>
            <li>but after I got it &amp; did a full comparison with a bottle I got from Macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li>and I would like to give full rate on this item.</li>
            <li>Thanks :)</li>
            <li>It is a very crisp and clean smell that doesn&#x27;t leave a lingering haze.</li>
            <li>Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations.</li>
            <li>incredible fragrance is very nice the way your base plate is decorative and gets a lot of attention and the girls immediately noticed the aroma</li>
            <li>quick and exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Somewhat flowery/feminine when first applied, but sexy, masculine dry-down.  </li>
            <li>This is by far one of my absolute favorite colognes.</li>
            <li>Everyone, particularly my wife LOVES IT!!</li>
            <li>Came very fast.  </li>
            <li>Great long lasting scent..</li>
            <li>My fiance will love it as a Christmas present.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Even if their price is a bit more (in this case it was below the others), they have made a customer for life because of their initial customer service.</li>
            <li>It was exactly as describe.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone interested in purchasing it</li>
            <li>Just got my first bottle after knowing about it for years.  </li>
            <li>Only buy from reputable sources, this is not it.</li>
            <li>Great woody scent and last for a long time.</li>
            <li>Very clean, simple, and timeless scent for a man</li>
            <li>If you turn the box over and look at the ingredients list its huge compaired to the same item sold at Macy&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>This is not the real Miyake cologne.  </li>
            <li>Agani, this is not  the real parfum.</li>
            <li>It works really well with my body chemistry.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced and would purchase again.</li>
            <li>It smells like something that you can buy at your local flee market - cheap.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.,</li>
            <li>so when I&#x27;m in air conditioning all day I have to be conservative with it because it&#x27;s really noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The order was correct and packed very well.</li>
            <li>thanks to all as agreed</li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T  THINK TO MUCH</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to women who are looking for a cologne to buy for that special someone.</li>
            <li>This product was at my door less than two days using standard shipping and it came pack so good that no damage would come to it.  </li>
            <li>This scent is a classic.</li>
            <li>Had some trouble with the delivery but overall its a good cologne, I think il get another one.</li>
            <li>Classic fragrance.</li>
            <li>I bought this bc the high ratings I can&#x27;t stand the smell</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it had a scent other than strong alcohol.</li>
            <li>Was an Aqua di gio guy forever, but this is a little more fresh and current.</li>
            <li>Long lasting is what I like the most.</li>
            <li>I have been using this cologne for more than 10 years and still use it everyday</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to try his new fragrance.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s reality, it seems the original this perfume, in that I&#x27;m giving my opinion later, you do not use it when removing them, but to use the smell goes very fast, or is expired or imitation is not recommend to buy them ...</li>
            <li>It is simple enough to be worn with weekend clothes and sophisticated enough to be worn to a business meeting.</li>
            <li>I usually do not wear Cologne because the smell changes when you sweat.  </li>
            <li>This is the Original stuff last all day long Issey Miyake rocks</li>
            <li>it reeks of old alcohol.  </li>
            <li>I was worried about buying the product after reading so many negative reviews.....</li>
            <li>Classy and refined.</li>
            <li>Citrus and classy notes.</li>
            <li>Not often you receive more than you pay for and was surprised to receive the cologne in a shaving kit type case and a small shower gel!</li>
            <li>Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wanted to try something new, but will have to stick to La Male.</li>
            <li>They by far went above and beyond.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that it is the same and at a way lower price.</li>

            <li> This fragrance has a distinctive smell that is suitable for almost any occasion or season.</li>
            <li> This is an original, good product and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great size, smells so fresh and light...!  </li>
            <li> I bought because the price was too good to be true, I learned my lesson.</li>
            <li> You may think you&#x27;re putting too much during the application, but the dry-down is perfect - sweet grapefruit, a pinch of spicy, but mostly woody.  </li>
            <li> Not a heavy strong odour, just perfect</li>
            <li> Love the smell</li>

            <li> YOU WILL SEE GREAT SMELLING AND LASTS  ALL DAY LONG /</li>

            <li> Apparently only good reviews are accepted.</li>
            <li> True to product details.</li>
            <li> but after I got it &amp; did a full comparison with a bottle I got from Macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li> and I would like to give full rate on this item.</li>
            <li> Thanks :)</li>
            <li> It is a very crisp and clean smell that doesn&#x27;t leave a lingering haze.</li>
            <li> Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations.</li>
            <li> incredible fragrance is very nice the way your base plate is decorative and gets a lot of attention and the girls immediately noticed the aroma</li>
            <li> quick and exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Somewhat flowery/feminine when first applied, but sexy, masculine dry-down.  </li>
            <li> This is by far one of my absolute favorite colognes.</li>
            <li> Everyone, particularly my wife LOVES IT!!</li>
            <li> Came very fast.  </li>
            <li> Great long lasting scent..</li>
            <li> My fiance will love it as a Christmas present.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Even if their price is a bit more (in this case it was below the others), they have made a customer for life because of their initial customer service.</li>
            <li> It was exactly as describe.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone interested in purchasing it</li>
            <li> Just got my first bottle after knowing about it for years.  </li>
            <li> Only buy from reputable sources, this is not it.</li>
            <li> Great woody scent and last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Very clean, simple, and timeless scent for a man</li>
            <li> If you turn the box over and look at the ingredients list its huge compaired to the same item sold at Macy&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> This is not the real Miyake cologne.  </li>
            <li> Agani, this is not  the real parfum.</li>
            <li> It works really well with my body chemistry.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> It smells like something that you can buy at your local flee market - cheap.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.,</li>
            <li> so when I&#x27;m in air conditioning all day I have to be conservative with it because it&#x27;s really noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The order was correct and packed very well.</li>
            <li> thanks to all as agreed</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T  THINK TO MUCH</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to women who are looking for a cologne to buy for that special someone.</li>
            <li> This product was at my door less than two days using standard shipping and it came pack so good that no damage would come to it.  </li>
            <li> This scent is a classic.</li>
            <li> Had some trouble with the delivery but overall its a good cologne, I think il get another one.</li>
            <li> Classic fragrance.</li>
            <li> I bought this bc the high ratings I can&#x27;t stand the smell</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it had a scent other than strong alcohol.</li>
            <li> Was an Aqua di gio guy forever, but this is a little more fresh and current.</li>
            <li> Long lasting is what I like the most.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cologne for more than 10 years and still use it everyday</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try his new fragrance.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s reality, it seems the original this perfume, in that I&#x27;m giving my opinion later, you do not use it when removing them, but to use the smell goes very fast, or is expired or imitation is not recommend to buy them ...</li>
            <li> It is simple enough to be worn with weekend clothes and sophisticated enough to be worn to a business meeting.</li>
            <li> I usually do not wear Cologne because the smell changes when you sweat.  </li>
            <li> This is the Original stuff last all day long Issey Miyake rocks</li>
            <li> it reeks of old alcohol.  </li>
            <li> I was worried about buying the product after reading so many negative reviews.....</li>
            <li> Classy and refined.</li>
            <li> Citrus and classy notes.</li>
            <li> Not often you receive more than you pay for and was surprised to receive the cologne in a shaving kit type case and a small shower gel!</li>
            <li> Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wanted to try something new, but will have to stick to La Male.</li>
            <li> They by far went above and beyond.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it is the same and at a way lower price.</li>
            <li> The ebay product was the real deal, even though Amazon says sealed in box, new - it is a poor knock off.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so thin, delicate, classy, sexy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also just to offset the \\&quot;you&#x27;ll get a lot of compliments on this cologne\\&quot; comments: women will only use what cologne you&#x27;re wearing as an excuse to talk to you if they want to talk to you.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, yet not in-your-face.  </li>
            <li> It prolonges (stays for long time) especially after shaving/shower.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to bathe in it for the scent to last for a long time.</li>
            <li> It has a little citrus, but the inscense-like smell is warm enough for the cold days.</li>
            <li> I have used this for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> I hope excuse what I&#x27;ll say</li>
            <li> I bought this scent a long time ago</li>
            <li> If you peel the stickers off you&#x27;ll see that the original barcode was cut off the box and covered with this fake barcode sticker.  </li>
            <li> This cologne is the same type as Irish Green Tweed</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any single complain.</li>
            <li> Green Irish Tweed</li>
            <li> I received the neatly packaged purchase well within the expected delivery time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband won&#x27;t wear any other cologne.</li>
            <li> I am so sad that this product was not the real thing!</li>
            <li> See my other ratings and you will realize that I am a cologne</li>
            <li> I searched long and hard for this</li>
            <li> I was afraid that it wasnt going to be the real Issey</li>
            <li> This is actually my first negative review, so that really say something terrible.  </li>
            <li> Not strong at all.</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> Not sure what happened with the atomizer</li>

            <li> get the goods at the stipulated time no more to say</li>
            <li> Girls, not many of you know about that cologne</li>
            <li> I commonly buy us complimenting scents.</li>
            <li> &quot; I mean \\&quot;bicycle 10 miles to class when it&#x27;s 96F outside\\&quot; magnitude of sweat</li>
            <li> Just weak and not popular</li>
            <li> The perfume i arrived broken, please i would like to hear you change.</li>
            <li> Not an overpowering scent but rather very subtle.  </li>
            <li> A little disappointed .  </li>
            <li> Something is weird here.</li>

            <li> I am totally disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> The base notes are incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> damaged packaging act not for sale, box hit very bad image for display and sale.</li>
            <li> Terrible Product.</li>

            <li> This is my go to cologne....I wear it almost daily but mix it up if I am going to dinner or the like. Long lasting is what I like the most. Others Ive tried and liked wear off quickly but Issey lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Smells just like it should :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased cologne and perfumes from Amazon stores before and by far, this was the best experience. I made the purchase on a Friday before a Monday holiday and opted for standard shipping. They wanted to ensure safe and secure arrival so they upgraded my shipping to 2 day and I received it the very next business day. They by far went above and beyond. Even if their price is a bit more (in this case it was below the others), they have made a customer for life because of their initial customer service.</li>
            <li> incredible fragrance is very nice the way your base plate is decorative and gets a lot of attention and the girls immediately noticed the aroma</li>
            <li> Truly enjoy the scent.  Delivery was excellent.</li>
            <li> This is a great scent also.  I love it.  I always get a lot of compliments when I wear this scent.  It&#x27;s bien good.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cologne for more than 10 years and still use it everyday&lt;br /&gt;Love the smell !!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and a very good product at a great price. Thank you.</li>
            <li> The product is of very good quality, the downside was I presented with the purchase as it bid for 2 units and only got me one. I did not receive any refund.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Great price.</li>
            <li> Seems lagit, smells good definitely a decent add to the collection. Seller was perfumania, so I assume it&#x27;s quality.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite colognes of all time it smells very wonderful and light trust me guys girls is going to go crazy for this one It&#x27;s a must bye</li>
            <li> Great cologne ...I really liked the delivery service as well. The item exceeded my expectations I also for a shampoo and a kit to go with the product</li>
            <li> I gave this away as a gift and my brother loved it&lt;br /&gt;this item was 80.00 in the mall . I was able to save 20.00</li>
            <li> The cologne is FAKE. I have bought MANY bottles of Issey Miyake to know the difference. This is actually my first negative review, so that really say something terrible.  As soon as you spray the cologne it reeks of old alcohol.  I am totally disappointed in this product.  I bought two bottles and now stuck with them.  I am so sad that this product was not the real thing! My husband and I compared bottles of what I had bought off of ebay to amazon... The ebay product was the real deal, even though Amazon says sealed in box, new - it is a poor knock off. I didn&#x27;t think it had a scent other than strong alcohol. YUCK!</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband as it&#x27;s his favorite scent. It really smells great and love the smelling the scent on the pillow. Reasonably priced and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have used this for as long as I can remember. Very clean, simple, and timeless scent for a man</li>
            <li> Great product, fast service</li>
            <li> This is one of the smoothest smelling colognes out there.  I would call it a every day cologne.  I use it every day.  Not strong at all.</li>
            <li> It smells like something that you can buy at your local flee market - cheap. Will never buy this product again and I can&#x27;t even return it because of this notice which I did not know about until now: &amp;#34;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com. Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations. Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wanted to try something new, but will have to stick to La Male. $52 lesson...</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS FRANGANCE</li>
            <li> Scent is excellent. Love on it on my husband. Order came in timely. Was packaged well. I don&#x27;t have any single complain.</li>
            <li> Product exceletente attention was great, widely recommended</li>
            <li> I hope excuse what I&#x27;ll say but it&#x27;s reality, it seems the original this perfume, in that I&#x27;m giving my opinion later, you do not use it when removing them, but to use the smell goes very fast, or is expired or imitation is not recommend to buy them ...</li>
            <li> I enjoy the product. It was exactly as describe. I would buy more if I needed some more. Get one</li>
            <li> I loved the fragrance so much. And I&#x27;m thinking to buy it again</li>
            <li> Had some trouble with the delivery but overall its a good cologne, I think il get another one.</li>
            <li> I searched long and hard for this and I finally found it.Great price for such a classic, timeless, great smelling scent. I was worried about buying the product after reading so many negative reviews..... But for my sweetie the scent was long-lasting and smelled great. I would definitely recommend this to women who are looking for a cologne to buy for that special someone.</li>
            <li> I bought this product not knowing if it would be the same as the ones they sell locally. I was surprised that it is the same and at a way lower price.</li>
            <li> I have had multiple ladies including my wife tell me this is great.  in the collection it goes...</li>
            <li> This fragrance has a distinctive smell that is suitable for almost any occasion or season. It has a little citrus, but the inscense-like smell is warm enough for the cold days. Classy and refined.This is by far one of my absolute favorite colognes. It is a very crisp and clean smell that doesn&#x27;t leave a lingering haze. It is simple enough to be worn with weekend clothes and sophisticated enough to be worn to a business meeting. I strongly suggest this cologne for anyone that wants to make a great impression</li>
            <li> Great value for the size</li>
            <li> my favorite fragrance of the moment</li>
            <li> really good, i&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Fragrance, super service!</li>
            <li> Heavenly scent. I would definitely purchase this item again and the price was great - cost $30 more at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Loved the fragrance.  This was a gift to my uncle.  The price was great and I would add order this item again.</li>
            <li> excellent article, very practical, very fast modern yy. From all points of view is excellent I recommend it to anyone interested in purchasing it</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Eau D&#x27;Issey (Issey Miyake) By Issey Miyake Mens Eau De Toilette (EDT)...I got the perfum on time and it is a very good product. Thank you so much.,</li>
            <li> True to product details.</li>

            <li> Excellent get the goods in good condition 100% recommended thanks greetings! get the goods at the stipulated time no more to say</li>
            <li> Love it. It was a great gift for my husband. Great, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Genuine product.  Came very fast.  This is my second bottle.  I love it, and more importantly, girls love it...Always getting complements.&lt;br /&gt;wonderful</li>
            <li> Great product, fast delivery!!</li>
            <li> This cologne is the same type as Irish Green Tweed but I prefer this one because the scent matches me better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts until I wash it off even if I sweat a lot, but it&#x27;s a lot weaker when I sweat. By \\&quot;sweat\\&quot; I mean \\&quot;bicycle 10 miles to class when it&#x27;s 96F outside\\&quot; magnitude of sweat so when I&#x27;m in air conditioning all day I have to be conservative with it because it&#x27;s really noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also just to offset the \\&quot;you&#x27;ll get a lot of compliments on this cologne\\&quot; comments: women will only use what cologne you&#x27;re wearing as an excuse to talk to you if they want to talk to you.</li>
            <li> Girls, not many of you know about that cologne but it&#x27;s so thin, delicate, classy, sexy. For me, it&#x27;s the best. Not for me, for my man, of course.</li>
            <li> Just got my first bottle after knowing about it for years.  Smelled it in a magazine once, couldn&#x27;t stop smelling the page, threw away the magazine, and could still recall what it smells like without physically smelling it.  It&#x27;s got the effect of fresh-cut grass, rain on cement, or a bonfire; you simply can&#x27;t forget it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somewhat flowery/feminine when first applied, but sexy, masculine dry-down.  Long lasting, yet not in-your-face.  Two sprays for your every day use; three sprays to protrude over the Acqua Di Gio and CK One guys at the club.  You may think you&#x27;re putting too much during the application, but the dry-down is perfect - sweet grapefruit, a pinch of spicy, but mostly woody.  The base notes are incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is that I wish I had purchased the 6.7 bottle.  Purchased through OTC Trading - 4.9 star distributor rating.</li>
            <li> Very good fragancy an very good price  . . . this articule arrival in good conditions . . .  i</li>
            <li> Classic fragrance. Daytime/nightime use. Citrus and classy notes. love it!</li>
            <li> Everytime my man puts this on, I want to nibble on him!  He smells SO good.  Thank you for a great product!</li>
            <li> Guys do not buy this item, it&#x27;s FAKE!!!!  After removing the outside wrapper, feel the barcodes and you will see they are stickers.  If you peel the stickers off you&#x27;ll see that the original barcode was cut off the box and covered with this fake barcode sticker.  If you turn the box over and look at the ingredients list its huge compaired to the same item sold at Macy&#x27;s.  I know the smell of ISSEY MIYAKE L&#x27;EAU D&#x27;ISSEY POUR HOMME and this didn&#x27;t smell the same to me. Amazon was great regarding this problem and offered me a full refund.  If you choose to buy the item look for these things then take it to Macy&#x27;s and compair the boxes, color of the juice and the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This same problem also happend to a bottle of YSL LA NUIT DE L&#x27;HOMME that I purchased from Amazon.  Again Amazon gave me a refund on that item as well.  Good Luck Guys!</li>
            <li> Here is my summer fragrance ranking:&lt;br /&gt;1) Creed Aventus&lt;br /&gt;2) La Nuit L&#x27;Homme&lt;br /&gt;3) L&#x27;Eau D&#x27;Issey&lt;br /&gt;4) Chanel Allure Homme Edition Blanche&lt;br /&gt;5) Green Irish Tweed</li>
            <li> Was an Aqua di gio guy forever, but this is a little more fresh and current. I wear this every day.</li>
            <li> as always this is an excelent product, original and I am already using it. 100% recommended. I&#x27;ll be buying another one soon</li>
            <li> I loved it and still loving it...It never goes out of style....It prolonges (stays for long time) especially after shaving/shower.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling product.  I have received many compliments on the smell.  The price is great also.  I have brought the cologne several times.</li>
            <li> The best smell ever, for a man&#x27;s after shave spray, and I now use the women&#x27;s Issey Miyake perfume for the same reason!  Not a heavy strong odour, just perfect, we don&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE THIS SMELL!!! ITS A PANTY DROPPER AND ALSO GUYS WILL ASK WHAT IM I USING!!! OVER THE YEARS IM ALWAYS COMING BACK TO THIS FRAGRANCE BECAUSE ITS SUITS ME WELL AND PLUS IT WORKS WITH YOUR BODY CHEMISTRY!!! IF THIS IS YOUR FIRST TIME PURCHASING THIS, YOU WONT REGRET IT!!!</li>
            <li> good product best clone ever</li>
            <li> A little disappointed .  The scent is ok but it does not stay.  Some girls think it&#x27;s not that great.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.  Great service and for the money.  Just weak and not popular</li>
            <li> This is an original, good product and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance Issey Miyake ... its aroma is very nice and durable, I recommend it for every occasion S</li>
            <li> it smells different from the mall store.</li>
            <li> I purchased this scent for my husband. It is a scent that I found by accident when one of our mutual male friends was wearing it. I decided to purchase it for my husband as he likes to smell good. I have female scent made by Issey Miyake that compliments his well. I have had it for awhile, so that is an added bonus! I commonly buy us complimenting scents. This scent definitely turns heads, so if you want that then buy this! You will not regret it!</li>
            <li> great product, arrived as advertised.</li>
            <li> I bought this scent a long time ago and I saw it at the mall recently and I missed it. Found it for cheaper on here.</li>
            <li> The perfume i arrived broken, please i would like to hear you change. el perfume me llego roto, por favor quisiera que me lo cambiaran</li>
            <li> The order was correct and packed very well.</li>
            <li> Perfume very beautiful and good quality, I hope that my son has a good performance with the girls and make many success and get better satisfaction.</li>
            <li> thanks to all as agreed&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;EAU D&#x27;ISSEY (issey Miyake) by Issey Miyake Eau De Toilette Spray 4.2 oz for Men&lt;br /&gt;ok i love it&lt;br /&gt;vey good care of the seller grateful</li>
            <li> Sr vendedor.&lt;br /&gt;Este perfume no es el original.&lt;br /&gt;Es una vulgar imitacion, una copia del Issey Miyake.&lt;br /&gt;Las letras se borraron del frasco, y el perfume huele solo a alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;No es la fragancia Issey, esta malo.&lt;br /&gt;Estoy muy muy decepcionada y muy disgustada con la compra.&lt;br /&gt;Existe alguna manera de compensarme?</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T  THINK TO MUCH GET IT A YOU WILL SEE GREAT SMELLING AND LASTS  ALL DAY LONG / NO PIENSE MUCHO OBTENGALO BUEN  OLOR Y DURA TODOEL DIA. JOHAN DE VENEZUELA</li>
            <li> mi papa quedo fasinado</li>
            <li> This product is FAKE. Only buy from reputable sources, this is not it. I bought because the price was too good to be true, I learned my lesson.</li>
            <li> It smells really nice and it was delivered really quick. I will definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that it wasnt going to be the real Issey but after I got it &amp; did a full comparison with a bottle I got from Macy&#x27;s I knew it was the real thing &amp; that I had gotten a good deal on this product</li>
            <li> Every time I wear L&#x27;eau D&#x27;issey it attracts compliments.  Not an overpowering scent but rather very subtle.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I usually do not wear Cologne because the smell changes when you sweat.  This product does not and is manly enough...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been one of my husband&#x27;s favorite for years...</li>
            <li> damaged packaging act not for sale, box hit very bad image for display and sale. solcito timely replacement as it is for a gift.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance to date and the one I wear most often. This is one of the best values for the 4.2 that I&#x27;ve seen since I started using it. I received the neatly packaged purchase well within the expected delivery time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% pleased and would recommend others to go for it as well!</li>
            <li> Product is perfect.....</li>
            <li> It smells awesome but after 3-4 hours smell is pretty much gone bearly on ur skin...&lt;br /&gt;pretty nice cologne and for the size and price not bad for work or a keep it in the car or just hanging out.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for myself after smelling the ad strip Men&#x27;s Health Magazine. Opened it at my birthday dinner and it got passed around the table--I didn&#x27;t think I would ever get it back!!  Everyone, particularly my wife LOVES IT!!</li>

            <li> I got this Cologne for my boyfriend and it is just awesome. You don&#x27;t need to bathe in it for the scent to last for a long time. It has a strong clean radiant scent!!! This cologne fits his manly, firm but loving personality!!!!</li>
