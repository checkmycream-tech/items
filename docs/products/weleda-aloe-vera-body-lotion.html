            <li>good stuff, but costly.</li>
            <li>Good sized bottle.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it&#x27;s a light-weight moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and it is by far the best lotion i have ever tried, love the organic smell and the fact that it is without any harmful ingredients.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite skin cream...</li>
            <li>Of course I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>
            <li>I love everything about this body lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spilled/wasted precious</li>
            <li>This body cream has a citrus-y scent and has been the source of many compliments when I wear it.  </li>
            <li>It is a treat for the senses for sure.</li>
            <li>I love this body lotion for my aging, drying skin.  </li>
            <li>I love sea buckthorn and use the oil on my face to help with Rosacea.  </li>
            <li>I love Weleda products.  </li>
            <li>I love citrus scented lotions</li>
            <li>Great product --pleasing odor and effective moisturizer that goes on easily and has no strange chemical feel.</li>
            <li>light orange fragrance reminds me more of orange blossoms than orange friut.</li>
            <li>They are so moisturizing but light and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>This sea buckthorn lotion is so good and priced so reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Great price, super fast delivery.</li>
            <li>But it hasn&#x27;t stopped me from being a huge Weleda fan</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s by far the best natural lotion I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>It is a great summer lotion, but I wouldn&#x27;t find it to be enough during the drier winter months in Minnesota.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and non greasy yet very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Light citrus fragrance and rich supple moisture without the greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>If your familiar with sea buckthorn you know how orange it can make your skin</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like all of the scents like Weleda adds to its products, but I enjoy this one--lightweight and orange citrus, and the smell fades fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>Nothing special for the price.  </li>
            <li>light and quickly absorbed.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell, and find it very nourishing and rejuvenating for my skin.</li>
            <li>Its a light to medium lotion that soaks right in.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s penetrates fairly quickly but I wouldn&#x27;t wear it under my work clothes</li>
            <li>Both my husband and I are delighted with its fragrance and its effect on dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Moisturizes much more effectively that the previously used Aubrey Sea Buckthorn body lotion.  </li>
            <li>and I like that the ingredients are safe and natural.</li>
            <li>Citrus(orange /grapefruit) and fresh .</li>
            <li>Its natural and healthy for the skin.</li>
            <li>Even though it seems a bit oily at first, it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>then other brands that are almost just as good.</li>
            <li>I choose to use it right after showering while my skin is still damp.</li>
            <li>and now instead of having the nozzle at an odd \\&quot;tipped\\&quot; angle, it&#x27;s now straight up and down and squirts out perfectly and easily.</li>
            <li>really effective for dry, itchy, inflamed skin!</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the lotions healing properties and will continue using in future!</li>
            <li>Still it feels and smells the same, and my skin looks much more nourished.</li>
            <li>The nozzle cover is also much improved!</li>
            <li>am only removing one star because the bottle I received was not the &amp;#34;newer&amp;#34; design with the better pump that gets every drop of the lotion out.</li>
            <li>First pump was alright</li>
            <li>The lotion goes on smoothly and absorbs nicely, effects last a long time.</li>
            <li>Happy that i found it on Amazon for a very reasonable price, but alas in a plastic bottle.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;ve used it on dry skin it does feel a bit greasy, used on damp skin is better for me.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>The only thing I really liked about it was the nice citrus scent, as other reviewers have commented, although the scent did not last even a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li>Welda makes very high quality skin products.</li>
            <li>I absolutely reccomend this.</li>
            <li>really wish the company would consider changing the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lotion is thin and spreads well, and this vacuum-type pump that raises the product UP with each pump means you use every last drop which is awesome.</li>
            <li>My favorite lotion in the whole wide world.  </li>
            <li>and I actually dumped the whole bottle into decorative lotion container, and now I don&#x27;t have to struggle using the original packaging anymore.</li>
            <li>A quality lotion at a great price -- a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>They do not leave a heavy residue and are absorbed very quickly into the skin.  </li>
            <li>Apparently sea buck-thorn is popular in other counties and is edible.</li>
            <li>This allows me to use less and spread it on more evenly.</li>
            <li>Weleda uses high quality and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>and I can recommend it highly to anyone with skin issues.</li>
            <li>What is even better than all of that is the bottle design -- you can turn it upside down and still get all of the lotion out!  </li>
            <li>It smells great--very clean and citrusy, and it really soaks in and helps my skin become softer and less itchy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to smell</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle, the first being the Citrus that I was given as a gift.  </li>
            <li>This is the only lotion I am satisfied with and generally prefer to use oils, but they can be too heavy in hot weather.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin....</li>
            <li>like the fact that it&#x27;s a natual product and it does not make my sensitive skin irritated at all.</li>
            <li>I skins looks as good as when I use the really expensive face creams.</li>
            <li>This lotion is going to move into my first choice preference for my very dry skin.</li>
            <li>Light enough for face, heavy enough for tougher skin .Moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion and my only negative point</li>
            <li>Leaves the skin soft and not dried out feeling for several hours after applying.  </li>
            <li>I have fairly dry, mature skin but not overly sensitive.</li>
            <li>i found this in whole foods (more expensive of course than amazon!)</li>
            <li>This body lotion is very hydrating but a little oily</li>

            <li> This body lotion is very hydrating but a little oily</li>
            <li> Seemed to moisturize no better than say the much cheaper lubriderm, aveeno, even avon products.  </li>
            <li> I like the Weleda products including Skin Food for dry hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this to maintain creamy skin treatment during winter dry &amp; scratchy months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to squirt out, as the nozzle is set at an odd angle for dispensing, and the clear plastic cap that snaps onto the nozzle area, is so tightly fit,</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> My other lotion would work immediately but skin would feel dry again within a few hours of use.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint is that the pump came off in my hand, spewing (wasting) lotion everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I tend to like mine a bit less watery</li>
            <li> Has a slight temporary sheen but not oily at all.  </li>
            <li> This was recommended  to me by a friend when I complained about having very dry skin this winter.  </li>
            <li> especially anything thin an/or silky.</li>
            <li> and I am forced to use boring, unscented lotions most of the time.  </li>
            <li> It can be hard to find in stores so &amp;#34;Thanks&amp;#34; to Amazon for carrying it.</li>
            <li> Please rethink this poor design.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s some weird plastic bag delivery system inside that made it impossible to reassemble.  </li>
            <li> but once your hands are already slippery it&#x27;s nearly impossible to pump again.</li>
            <li> but the smell is insanely intoxicating.</li>
            <li> However, I agree with reviewer who stated the lotion dispenser is horrible.</li>

            <li> Weleda is ALWAYS a good choice.  This is my favorite skin cream...light and quickly absorbed.  The botanical fragrance is a delight. Only complaint is that the pump came off in my hand, spewing (wasting) lotion everywhere.  There&#x27;s some weird plastic bag delivery system inside that made it impossible to reassemble.  Please rethink this poor design.  But it hasn&#x27;t stopped me from being a huge Weleda fan</li>
            <li> I love the smell, and find it very nourishing and rejuvenating for my skin. I use it daily.</li>
            <li> This body lotion is very hydrating but a little oily so I use it before I go to bed. It&#x27;s penetrates fairly quickly but I wouldn&#x27;t wear it under my work clothes especially anything thin an/or silky.</li>
            <li> good stuff, but costly.</li>
            <li> Great price, super fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Great product --pleasing odor and effective moisturizer that goes on easily and has no strange chemical feel.</li>
            <li> Apparently sea buck-thorn is popular in other counties and is edible. Welda makes very high quality skin products. Can&#x27;t recommend them enough, only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is the price is much more expensive then other brands that are almost just as good.</li>
            <li> Smells like a summer day. My skin was instantly softer. I absolutely reccomend this.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin. Prescription lotions don&#x27;t work as well as this lotion does.  In addition, this has a pleasant fragrance and a pleasant feel to it.  I like the Weleda products including Skin Food for dry hands.</li>
            <li> Nothing special for the price.  Seemed to moisturize no better than say the much cheaper lubriderm, aveeno, even avon products.  The only thing I really liked about it was the nice citrus scent, as other reviewers have commented, although the scent did not last even a couple of hours.  Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like all of the scents like Weleda adds to its products, but I enjoy this one--lightweight and orange citrus, and the smell fades fairly quickly. The lotion is thin and spreads well, and this vacuum-type pump that raises the product UP with each pump means you use every last drop which is awesome. Even though it seems a bit oily at first, it absorbs quickly. It is a great summer lotion, but I wouldn&#x27;t find it to be enough during the drier winter months in Minnesota.</li>
            <li> Very good experience.  My favorite lotion in the whole wide world.  I have sensitive skin.... the is wonderful.</li>
            <li> i found this in whole foods (more expensive of course than amazon!) and it is by far the best lotion i have ever tried, love the organic smell and the fact that it is without any harmful ingredients.  ps tried on my face and it does wonders.</li>
            <li> This lotion is a medium weight lotion. I choose to use it right after showering while my skin is still damp. This allows me to use less and spread it on more evenly. When I&#x27;ve used it on dry skin it does feel a bit greasy, used on damp skin is better for me.&lt;br /&gt;The light orange fragrance reminds me more of orange blossoms than orange friut. It fades away somewhat quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that it&#x27;s a natual product and it does not make my sensitive skin irritated at all.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it&#x27;s a light-weight moisturizer. I tend to like mine a bit less watery but the smell is insanely intoxicating. It also works well and I like that the ingredients are safe and natural.</li>
            <li> As i also ingest Sea Buckthorn oil for medicinal purposes. I am pleased with the lotions healing properties and will continue using in future!</li>
            <li> Good sized bottle. Has a citrusy fragrance. If your familiar with sea buckthorn you know how orange it can make your skin but this doesn&#x27;t do that. It absorbs well. I use it after every shower and sometimes on my face. I have fairly dry, mature skin but not overly sensitive.</li>
            <li> I just returned from France, where I stumbled across this item; in French, it&#x27;s Weleda Argousier, Lait Corps nourrissant.  Both my husband and I are delighted with its fragrance and its effect on dry skin.  Of course I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, good price, will be a staple for me.</li>
            <li> Light citrus fragrance and rich supple moisture without the greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Non-irritating scent and non-greasy.  Weleda uses high quality and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> This was recommended  to me by a friend when I complained about having very dry skin this winter.  It smells great--very clean and citrusy, and it really soaks in and helps my skin become softer and less itchy.</li>
            <li> My initial intro to this lotion was from Switzerland in a blue glass bottle. I like it so well that  i knew i needed a lifetime supply. Happy that i found it on Amazon for a very reasonable price, but alas in a plastic bottle. Still it feels and smells the same, and my skin looks much more nourished.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this body lotion. The scent is divine! Citrus(orange /grapefruit) and fresh . Its a light to medium lotion that soaks right in. Has a slight temporary sheen but not oily at all.  Light enough for face, heavy enough for tougher skin .Moisturizes very well. Its natural and healthy for the skin. Its best lotion ever! It can be hard to find in stores so &amp;#34;Thanks&amp;#34; to Amazon for carrying it.</li>
            <li> This sea buckthorn lotion is so good and priced so reasonable.  I skins looks as good as when I use the really expensive face creams.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely wonderful lotion. The best. Ever since discovering it, I will not ever be without my supply!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s mind boggling that the company would package this top-of-the-line lotion in such an inferior bottle. It&#x27;s very difficult to squirt out, as the nozzle is set at an odd angle for dispensing, and the clear plastic cap that snaps onto the nozzle area, is so tightly fit, that twice I&#x27;ve ripped the entire nozzle off trying to get the plastic lid off! I&#x27;ve spilled/wasted precious lotion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wish the company would consider changing the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/12/15:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I&#x27;d come back and update my review. I love this lotion and my only negative point was the packaging -- specifically the delivery spout and spout cover. Well, it seems they&#x27;ve updated their bottle design (hooray!) and now instead of having the nozzle at an odd \\&quot;tipped\\&quot; angle, it&#x27;s now straight up and down and squirts out perfectly and easily. The nozzle cover is also much improved! Kudos where deserved. I&#x27;m now very happy with both my lotion AND their packaging!</li>
            <li> Moisturizes much more effectively that the previously used Aubrey Sea Buckthorn body lotion.  Leaves the skin soft and not dried out feeling for several hours after applying.  My other lotion would work immediately but skin would feel dry again within a few hours of use.  This lotion is going to move into my first choice preference for my very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I adore Weleda and this lotion is no exception.  It does a great job of moisturizing my skin in the summertime (I haven&#x27;t tested it during the winter yet) and isn&#x27;t greasy at all.  I&#x27;m very sensitive to smell and I am forced to use boring, unscented lotions most of the time.  This, however, smells delightful and doesn&#x27;t overpower or cause me migraines at all.  What is even better than all of that is the bottle design -- you can turn it upside down and still get all of the lotion out!  Woohoo!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this to maintain creamy skin treatment during winter dry &amp; scratchy months. I started using it when I had eczema last year and I can recommend it highly to anyone with skin issues.</li>
            <li> This body cream has a citrus-y scent and has been the source of many compliments when I wear it.  It is a treat for the senses for sure.</li>
            <li> I love this body lotion for my aging, drying skin.  I love sea buckthorn and use the oil on my face to help with Rosacea.  This is the only lotion I am satisfied with and generally prefer to use oils, but they can be too heavy in hot weather.  Weleda Sea Buckthorn lotion to the rescue!</li>
            <li> I love Weleda products.  They are so moisturizing but light and refreshing.  They do not leave a heavy residue and are absorbed very quickly into the skin.  This is my second bottle, the first being the Citrus that I was given as a gift.  The Sea Buckthorn has a milder scent compared to the citrus, almost grapefruity to me.  I love citrus scented lotions so I am very happy with this purchase.  I might have to try the Pomegranate one in the future as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am only removing one star because the bottle I received was not the &amp;#34;newer&amp;#34; design with the better pump that gets every drop of the lotion out.</li>
            <li> really effective for dry, itchy, inflamed skin! It has a citrus-y (orange) sort of fragrance, part of that is the sea buckthorn. The lotion goes on smoothly and absorbs nicely, effects last a long time. A quality lotion at a great price -- a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Bought it locally and I&#x27;m hooked. It smells nice and non greasy yet very moisturizing. However, I agree with reviewer who stated the lotion dispenser is horrible. It is! First pump was alright but once your hands are already slippery it&#x27;s nearly impossible to pump again. I should take one star off but it&#x27;s by far the best natural lotion I&#x27;ve tried and I actually dumped the whole bottle into decorative lotion container, and now I don&#x27;t have to struggle using the original packaging anymore.</li>
