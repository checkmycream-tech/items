            <li>Great for beginners.</li>
            <li>It a good kit</li>
            <li>is junk so save yourself and the people your tattoo a lot of time and pain and throw it away and get good ink....</li>
            <li>Everything was good except the disc didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>johnny gault on youtube showed me more than this DVD did.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Super awesome arrived super quick and is a get kick start to tattooing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already giving myself two tattoos and fixed my moms tatt, this is the best kit for first timers...</li>
            <li>when I upgrade I strongly suggest people to go to Hildbrandt, and get a kit with Hildbrandt machines and Radiant inks atleast.</li>
            <li>But other than that it&#x27;s a great buy for a amazing price.</li>
            <li>I love my new tattoo kit, it was a day late but still its pretty awesome having my own,</li>
            <li>Ok, Contents of kit Appeared to be very sterile (smells like a clean hospital)</li>
            <li>The power supply works great every time, it is very light weight and very small.</li>
            <li>Great for the price, but the ink quality is iffy, i would recommend ordering better ink especially black.</li>
            <li>Only thing tat would ave been nice was bbigger bottles of ink and a travel carrying case</li>
            <li>As far as the overall equipment however it was outstanding it literally has everything you need. :)</li>
            <li>and I WILL be ordering more equipment from you in the future .</li>
            <li>Exactly wat it says.</li>
            <li>The product was exactly like it said it was.</li>
            <li>This tattoo kit is a good buy for the money especially if you are just starting out.</li>
            <li>Thanks again , exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>First thing Please Learn as Much as You can About Tattooing, and become licensed legally Before you Attempt Tattooing.</li>
            <li>hahaha .</li>
            <li>Arrived fast.</li>
            <li>This Kit offers No Practice Skin, so have fun buying alot of Fruit, (oranges, bananas) for practice.</li>
            <li>Other than that I&#x27;m quite pleased with my purchase and would highly recommend it for a beginning tattoo artist or someone like me who wants to try something new.</li>
            <li>The tattoo kit came with everything as described, though I had to go online to figure out how exactly to put the tattoo machine together, being totally novice.</li>
            <li>I also would say the DVD is out-dated and mostly focuses on the &amp;#34;history of tattooing&amp;#34; rather than showing correct set-up methods and procedures for sterile hygienic performance and artwork on various skin types, or even correct angle while using a heavy machine for tattoo work.</li>
            <li>The 4 machines are kind of assembled poorly and they need to be &amp;#34;Set</li>
            <li>(: highly recommend buying this kit, The power supply box is  smaller</li>

            <li> (: highly recommend buying this kit, The power supply box is  smaller</li>
            <li> Ordered and paid for four working tattoo machines and so far only one of the three that I&#x27;ve tried to use has half way worked</li>
            <li> Couple guns didn&#x27;t work well, but since have few back up guns wasn&#x27;t a big deal.</li>
            <li> Packing was a little crammed so the transfer paper was folded and wrinkled and one of my dark greens(dragon green) was busted open upon arrival.</li>
            <li> the only complaint I have is that the tattoo power supply is a little bit light-weighted, but gets the job done well.</li>
            <li> Its product has a little defect</li>
            <li> For the price you really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>

            <li> Just arrived and can&#x27;t stop using it (: highly recommend buying this kit, The power supply box is  smaller then I thought but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It a good kit but it didn&#x27;t come with everything and the ink that comes with the kit is junk so save yourself and the people your tattoo a lot of time and pain and throw it away and get good ink....</li>
            <li> Everything was good except the disc didn&#x27;t work. I tried contacting them to find out why or going they&#x27;d replace it but got no response. I would recommend to anyone buying tattoo equipment though</li>
            <li> Recieved quality sanitized product but the power supply looked like it had years of use on it and would not turn on.</li>
            <li> I love my new tattoo kit, it was a day late but still its pretty awesome having my own, I&#x27;ve already giving myself two tattoos and fixed my moms tatt, this is the best kit for first timers...</li>
            <li> Ordered and paid for four working tattoo machines and so far only one of the three that I&#x27;ve tried to use has half way worked but it sounds like there&#x27;s a short in it.</li>
            <li> Great for the price, but the ink quality is iffy, i would recommend ordering better ink especially black. As far as the overall equipment however it was outstanding it literally has everything you need. :)</li>
            <li> Super awesome arrived super quick and is a get kick start to tattooing. Definitely would buy again.</li>
            <li> I received the equipment the very next day as promised , thank you . I bought this as a gift for a friend and he hasn&#x27;t stopped working on peoples tattoos since I gave it to him . hahaha . Thanks again , exactly what I was looking for and I WILL be ordering more equipment from you in the future .</li>
            <li> Exactly wat it says. Great quality starter kit.</li>
            <li> Absolutely great. Everything needed was here.</li>
            <li> First thing Please Learn as Much as You can About Tattooing, and become licensed legally Before you Attempt Tattooing. Ok, Contents of kit Appeared to be very sterile (smells like a clean hospital) that&#x27;s good. Arrived fast. This Kit offers No Practice Skin, so have fun buying alot of Fruit, (oranges, bananas) for practice. Packing was a little crammed so the transfer paper was folded and wrinkled and one of my dark greens(dragon green) was busted open upon arrival. One of my grip tubes the silver one was corroded(tarnished) upon arrival. I would say the quality of this ink is about a 6 on a (1-10 scale) so it&#x27;s not the best ink you could buy on the market, but its usable. The power supply works great every time, it is very light weight and very small. The 4 machines are kind of assembled poorly and they need to be &amp;#34;Set Up Correctly&amp;#34; Before Tattooing!!! (Don&#x27;t just put it all together and start tattooing without any knowledge of what your doing or you&#x27;ll just poke a bunch of scars in your body and the ink will not stay, it will only leave scars and wont heal correctly.) I also would say the DVD is out-dated and mostly focuses on the &amp;#34;history of tattooing&amp;#34; rather than showing correct set-up methods and procedures for sterile hygienic performance and artwork on various skin types, or even correct angle while using a heavy machine for tattoo work. johnny gault on youtube showed me more than this DVD did. when I upgrade I strongly suggest people to go to Hildbrandt, and get a kit with Hildbrandt machines and Radiant inks atleast.</li>

            <li> This tattoo kit is a good buy for the money especially if you are just starting out. For the price you really can&#x27;t go wrong. The tattoo kit came with everything as described, though I had to go online to figure out how exactly to put the tattoo machine together, being totally novice. I was using the tattoo kit the night I received it and the only complaint I have is that the tattoo power supply is a little bit light-weighted, but gets the job done well. And, the tattoo ink bottles aren&#x27;t too big. Other than that I&#x27;m quite pleased with my purchase and would highly recommend it for a beginning tattoo artist or someone like me who wants to try something new.</li>
            <li> Excellent equipment, already tried it out and was great!</li>

            <li> The product was exactly like it said it was. Only thing tat would ave been nice was bbigger bottles of ink and a travel carrying case</li>
            <li> Love this product. Great for beginners. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the stencil paper. But other than that it&#x27;s a great buy for a amazing price.</li>
