            <li>still very pretty</li>
            <li>I added a couple coats of clear polish to make them shine more and they feel a lot smoother.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping, just under two weeks.</li>
            <li>These came super fast and they are very glittery</li>

            <li>A little more of a green hue than I thought but still very pretty, and they actually stayed on a lot longer than expected.</li>
            <li>They also are more green than blue black.</li>

            <li> Beautiful nails, wide selection of sizes and the nail glue worked awesome.&lt;br /&gt;These people stay in great contact with you</li>
            <li> My favorite nails for doing drag. And I&#x27;ve used every kind. They look better in person.</li>
            <li> Beautiful Nails I Can&#x27;t Get Over Them!!!!</li>
            <li> Glue that comes with product isn&#x27;t the best to use on nails,  but the nails themselves had good size choices and were pretty until I had to take them off with mail polish remover.</li>
            <li> A little more of a green hue than I thought but still very pretty, and they actually stayed on a lot longer than expected. I added a couple coats of clear polish to make them shine more and they feel a lot smoother.</li>
            <li> Horrible. Has a bad smell and doesn&#x27;t look like the picture. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> They are absolutely gorgeous!! They did not let me down, the nails are Sparkly just how I expected. I can&#x27;t really speak on the glue because people said it does hold well I just didn&#x27;t use it, I used krazy glue. I also painted pink sparkles on mine to make them more &amp;#34;me&amp;#34;. But overall I like them and I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> They are nice nails, but the glue kinda sucks. They also are more green than blue black.</li>
            <li> Super gorgeous in person. Lots of sparkle. While they do look more green in person that&#x27;s totally fine with me. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments and people asking where I got them done at. Will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> Sorry but they glue sucks</li>
            <li> these looked awesome! Hard to get my catsuit on and off with them, but that&#x27;s of no fault to the manufacturer. I should have thought of that.</li>
            <li> So cute and pretty! I loved these!</li>
            <li> These came super fast and they are very glittery :) I haven&#x27;t had the chance to wear them yet but I look forward to it! Also for anyone confused or wondering, this comes only with the sparkly black nails, not any of the nails in the other pictures.</li>
            <li> Nice but don&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Very durable but not black like told in the description. They&#x27;re more of a green color. And I had to buy to glue separately.</li>
            <li> Really cool and work well, but these were delivered late.</li>
            <li> They are described as black and the picture shows them as black but they are definitely more green...still very pretty and I would still have ordered them had I known the color difference but I was expecting black nails. Love the look, length and shape and they shipped and arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so pretty, I&#x27;ll definitely have to purchase again! They also came in under 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> amazing quality comes with nail glue and a free gift i highly recommend them they look so nice</li>
            <li> Way better in person vs the picture. Super sparkly. I will be buying these again to just to have them on hand! (haha) Super fast shipping, just under two weeks. As always, glue- lots of glue!</li>
            <li> Just received mine but very disappointed! It said it includes glue and there&#x27;s no glue whatsoever!</li>
            <li> I love these nails!!! They did need a bit of filing, but so do many kinds of fake nails. I didn&#x27;t use the sticky things that came with them, I used my own nail glue, so I can&#x27;t speak on those though.</li>
            <li> They look like 30 nails on me.i love these. Compliments daily .my only advise is to use Krazy glue instead of the glue that the nails came with</li>
            <li> Lovely. Much better in person. Worth the money. I did use my own glue though, as I&#x27;m tough on nails.</li>
            <li> These nails are perfect, they are very pretty! I Love em! They fit perfectly too! You Would Love Em Too! Guarenteed!</li>
            <li> Okay, the nails smell so you have to let them air out, Its also hard to do stuff with them on.</li>
