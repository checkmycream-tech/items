            <li>Am I seeing fine lines gone?</li>
            <li>The Sea Salt Face Wash with Tamanu and Lime, for Oily and Acne Prone Skin is totally amazing and really helped my skin.&lt;br /&gt;First off the packaging</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the places these scents send me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like its preparing itself to smooth out?</li>
            <li>Plus, you get free samples when you purchase anything from them.</li>
            <li>Originally from fl</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very effective and there&#x27;s no chemicals that will harm ur skin in the long run.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, and my skin feels clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this face wash</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>You definitely need a good moisturizer with this.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>My skin is much more clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have PCOS and it causes super oily skin.</li>
            <li>Seriously my face looks amazing!!</li>
            <li>This used to be a blend of mostly all natural products.</li>
            <li>and I know by feel pretty quick if the product is gonna work for me in one way or another.</li>
            <li>I will continue to try every product in this line that I feel is right for me.</li>
            <li>Iam 41 with very sensitive skin and light acne , this wash works for me...</li>
            <li>The company is very willing to help with returns/exchanges so it may be worth it to try if your skin isn&#x27;t too sensitive.</li>
            <li>Hasn&#x27;t really done anything more than any regular soap would.</li>
            <li>It clears up cystic pimples very fast but it&#x27;s also very drying</li>
            <li>; and it wasn&#x27;t strong enough for my skin type.</li>
            <li>The Sea Salt face wash comes in a large 8 ounce foaming style pump container.</li>
            <li>is really neat.</li>
            <li>You can really see the difference when I use this sea salt face wash</li>
            <li>I have very stubborn acne around my chin, and this product really helps.</li>
            <li>Intense wrinkle cream was sent as a sample.</li>
            <li>Thanks Diva Stuff!&lt;br /&gt;Lisa</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s how much it has helped my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Tamanu oil is greenish in tint so if there was any significant amount in the bottle, it would not be white.</li>
            <li>The scent and texture, at least, were pretty nice.</li>
            <li>I use it once a week for a deep clean.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite face wash, it&#x27;s gentle enough to keep my sensitive skin clear without drying it out and making it irritated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also encroaching on 30 and have developed some fine and deep lines across my forehead as well as hormonal/cystic acne along my jaw line and neck.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes based on reviews alone.</li>
            <li>but I wish it was a little more of an exfoliater...</li>
            <li>And this product is fresh, clean, makes your skin feel soft and tight.</li>
            <li>I received my new order in and the ingredients have changed to include adding SLS which is a paraben.</li>
            <li>I used to buy lush ocean scrub which is great but so expensive.</li>
            <li>I use hot honey daily.</li>
            <li>My skin is much less oily and my makeup stays on pretty much all day!</li>
            <li>So far what I&#x27;ve tried are impressing me in ways I didn&#x27;t expect.</li>
            <li>Got my mom to buy it as she struggles with adult acne</li>
            <li>I am trying to completely get away from synthetics and chemicals.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have Sensitive skin this may not be for you.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still half full</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell, and a little tingle that I love..plus a little really does go a long way with this product, I haven&#x27;t even used a quarter of the bottle yet</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry ur face that much either.</li>
            <li>This face wash is the only thing that has completely cleared up my skin and kept it clear.</li>
            <li>You can feel this face wash really cleaning the skin with a slight tingle.</li>
            <li>SKIN TYPE &amp; PROBLEMS: I have sensitive, dry, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>Not sure why some of the reviews are so extremely positive for this company, for me it was a mediocre cleanser that did nothing to help my sensitive skin or my acne, in fact I think I broke out a bit more while I was trying this.</li>

            <li> It also is made with SLS which is a pretty common irritant.</li>
            <li> And nothing I&#x27;ve used on my face as of yet has left a oily or dry feeling.</li>
            <li> I still need an exfoliator 2 times a week since this is not a scrub (using the &amp;#34;Diva Stuff Sugar Derm Facial Firm Scrubbies&amp;#34;) but as a face wash with no synthetics or harsh chemicals</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin overly dry</li>
            <li> , my face is less oily and it helps dry up those pesky pimples.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but when I do get a breakout it usually takes about a week for it to clear; using salicylic acid or harsh chemicals to treat it.</li>
            <li> It makes me think that there is almost no salt, or any other ingredients in there.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use everyday because it will dry you out!</li>
            <li> HATE to admit feels better</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never been let down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 40&#x27;ish and have less lines or wrinkles</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for a little over a month now</li>
            <li> My acne dried up and fizzled away almost immediately.</li>
            <li> well I&#x27;m not sure what to say.....</li>
            <li> BUT even with the very few I have.</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday!!</li>
            <li> Seriously, I tried diva stuff on a leap of faith from reviews</li>
            <li> have oily skin but gets dry in the cold ohio winters.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s kicking some serious acne butt!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking order, expensive serums, creams, hair products etc....</li>
            <li> then my other serums ( I TRULY hate saying that!)</li>
            <li> Needless to say I&#x27;m a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> Horrible product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> does not feel like a salt based soap at all. It makes me think that there is almost no salt, or any other ingredients in there. Tamanu oil is greenish in tint so if there was any significant amount in the bottle, it would not be white. and definitely no hint of lime either. feels like Softsoap that I can find in the grocery store.</li>
            <li> The Sea Salt Face Wash with Tamanu and Lime, for Oily and Acne Prone Skin is totally amazing and really helped my skin.&lt;br /&gt;First off the packaging is really neat. The Sea Salt face wash comes in a large 8 ounce foaming style pump container. It is perfect to get just the right amount of product for washing my face with just one pump.&lt;br /&gt;Second the scent is very nice. It takes my back to the beach walking along the shore with the wave at my feet, the scents of sea salt and a hint of lemon. I really enjoy the places these scents send me.&lt;br /&gt;Third it just feels amazing on my face. You can feel this face wash really cleaning the skin with a slight tingle. You can really see the difference when I use this sea salt face wash, my face is less oily and it helps dry up those pesky pimples.&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is an amazing product and I say TRY IT!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Diva Stuff.</li>
            <li> Iam 41 with very sensitive skin and light acne , this wash works for me...I just order my second bottle. Works better then Clinique acne bar soap</li>
            <li> Not sure why some of the reviews are so extremely positive for this company, for me it was a mediocre cleanser that did nothing to help my sensitive skin or my acne, in fact I think I broke out a bit more while I was trying this. It also is made with SLS which is a pretty common irritant. The company is very willing to help with returns/exchanges so it may be worth it to try if your skin isn&#x27;t too sensitive. The scent and texture, at least, were pretty nice.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this face wash but it caused cystic acne which I never had before.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product</li>
            <li> This used to be a blend of mostly all natural products. I received my new order in and the ingredients have changed to include adding SLS which is a paraben. Needless to say I&#x27;m a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> Bought this three months ago here on amazon and it&#x27;s still half full (I use it every night)&lt;br /&gt;I love how it foams, and the smell and how my face reacts on it. It doesn&#x27;t dry ur face that much either. It&#x27;s very effective and there&#x27;s no chemicals that will harm ur skin in the long run.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite face wash, it&#x27;s gentle enough to keep my sensitive skin clear without drying it out and making it irritated. It smells amazing, and my skin feels clean and soft. One of my favorite parts of summer is the way my skin feels after a day of swimming in the ocean. This wash is just like that, only without the tightness and drying from the salt water (and you know, seaweed...).</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have very stubborn acne around my chin, and this product really helps. I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts since I started using it, and trust me, I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of stuff. Even antibiotics did not help me. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m from Hawaii. And this product is fresh, clean, makes your skin feel soft and tight. If you haven&#x27;t tried this yet.....well I&#x27;m not sure what to say.....more for me?? Lol. Seriously, I tried diva stuff on a leap of faith from reviews and it&#x27;s the best &amp;#34;take a chance&amp;#34; purchases I&#x27;ve ever made. I have good skin,never a acne problem (bump once in awhile) I&#x27;m 40&#x27;ish and have less lines or wrinkles then most women in their 30&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve always had a beauty skin care regimen. And NOT with dept store bought stuff. I&#x27;m talking order, expensive serums, creams, hair products etc....and I know by feel pretty quick if the product is gonna work for me in one way or another. There is No miracle product made by ANYONE. It&#x27;s consistency, and loyalty you have, to the products that work for YOU, that&#x27;s the trick.  So far what I&#x27;ve tried are impressing me in ways I didn&#x27;t expect. Intense wrinkle cream was sent as a sample. I&#x27;ve used it for two days morning and night. Am I seeing fine lines gone? No. BUT even with the very few I have. What I am seeing and feeling is a change in the skin itself around my eyes. Like its preparing itself to smooth out? I don&#x27;t know how to explain it lol.  And nothing I&#x27;ve used on my face as of yet has left a oily or dry feeling. HATE to admit feels better then my other serums ( I TRULY hate saying that!) but it&#x27;s true. I will continue to try every product in this line that I feel is right for me. I had high hopes based on reviews alone. And I&#x27;m very happy to say that my results have been beyond my expectations! I can&#x27;t thank this woman enough. QUALITY. Not to mention price points. Thank you Kym. :)</li>
            <li> It clears up cystic pimples very fast but it&#x27;s also very drying and I have relatively oily skin. You definitely need a good moisturizer with this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for a little over a month now and I have to say it is the best face wash I&#x27;ve ever come across! Much better than anything you find in stores! It has a nice smell, and a little tingle that I love..plus a little really does go a long way with this product, I haven&#x27;t even used a quarter of the bottle yet and I use it everyday!! Seriously my face looks amazing!!</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t really done anything more than any regular soap would.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several things from diva stuff and I&#x27;ve never been let down. This face wash is the only thing that has completely cleared up my skin and kept it clear. Awesome! Plus, you get free samples when you purchase anything from them. Everything is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I actually really enjoy this product! I can always tell when I didn&#x27;t wash my face the night before. This stuff is awesome. The face wash is a lot thinner than I thought. It is not a gel-like wash. It is awesome though!</li>
            <li> What a great wash. I&#x27;m 23 have oily skin but gets dry in the cold ohio winters. Originally from fl my skin was always amazing after the beach and just being in the air. I used to buy lush ocean scrub which is great but so expensive. This works just as well! Can&#x27;t use everyday because it will dry you out! Smells nice too! Like a margarita for your face! Got my mom to buy it as she struggles with adult acne and she now glows</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but I wish it was a little more of an exfoliater...</li>
            <li> Made me break out with cystic acne. Horrible product.</li>
            <li> SKIN TYPE &amp; PROBLEMS: I have sensitive, dry, acne-prone skin. I&#x27;m also encroaching on 30 and have developed some fine and deep lines across my forehead as well as hormonal/cystic acne along my jaw line and neck. YAY! I&#x27;ve never had severe acne but when I do get a breakout it usually takes about a week for it to clear; using salicylic acid or harsh chemicals to treat it. I am trying to completely get away from synthetics and chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 30 days of use (washing day and night)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING! I started off using the &amp;#34;Diva Stuff Detox Charcoal Face Wash&amp;#34; and it wasn&#x27;t strong enough for my skin type. But after the first 3 days of using this product I had incredible results! My acne dried up and fizzled away almost immediately. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin overly dry but it&#x27;s kicking some serious acne butt! I still need an exfoliator 2 times a week since this is not a scrub (using the &amp;#34;Diva Stuff Sugar Derm Facial Firm Scrubbies&amp;#34;) but as a face wash with no synthetics or harsh chemicals this is hands down the best product I have found :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this on my chest and back for the occasional &amp;#34;workout breakout&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s keeping the sweat-induced acne away!</li>
            <li> Great face wash. If you have Sensitive skin this may not be for you. I use it once a week for a deep clean.I use hot honey daily.</li>
            <li> Love this!! All of the products that I have used from Diva Stuff are awesome!!! My face has never looked and felt better!!The only problem is choosing which to try next!!! Thanks Diva Stuff!&lt;br /&gt;Lisa 💜</li>
            <li> This was included in my customized skin care set. I use it every morning. I actually just bought my second bottle that&#x27;s how much it has helped my acne prone skin. My skin is much more clear and smooth. Thank you diva stuff!!</li>
            <li> I love this face wash! It makes my face feel so fresh and clean. I recommend this face wash for younger faces to help it keep it&#x27;s fresh feel!!</li>
            <li> I have PCOS and it causes super oily skin. I&#x27;m so happy I stumbled  on this miracle worker.  It made my face break out for about a week and then it began clearing up.  My skin is much less oily and my makeup stays on pretty much all day!</li>
