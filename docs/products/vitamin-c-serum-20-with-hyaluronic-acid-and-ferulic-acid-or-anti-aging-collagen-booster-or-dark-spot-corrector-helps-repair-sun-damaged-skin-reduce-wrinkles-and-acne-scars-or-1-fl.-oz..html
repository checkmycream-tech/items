            <li>and I can honestly say that it&#x27;s the best serum that I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Best of all, the price is amazing.</li>
            <li>However, I am happy with the serum</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>the smell and feel is great</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 2 weeks and can already see great results</li>
            <li>Great product…</li>
            <li>I have never used a vitamin C serum but have heard it does great things for your complexion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a great serum for moisture and whitening.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about 10 weeks now and is great.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>The price point is great too....</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a couple of weeks of use, I am happy to report that this serum satisfies all of these conditions (which I consider to be essential).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product my face looks and feel healthier</li>
            <li>This is a great skin product.</li>
            <li>I have to say, the smell isn&#x27;t that great, but the product is.</li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels great.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Used it for 90 days, made a great difference on my face.</li>
            <li>Great Vitamin C Serum at a great price.</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic!!!</li>
            <li>Smooth!!!</li>
            <li>I would wake up to beautiful bright skin</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>list of benefits listed on the box is impressive, and if you investigate Hyaluronic Acid and ferulic acid, you will find these claims to be true....from being anti-oxidant to exfoliating and rehydrating, and much more.</li>
            <li>Make sure to use with a moisturizer for best results.&lt;br /&gt;Mary</li>
            <li>It feels very pleasant on the skin, is refreshing, nourishing and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li>I use one drop of the serum and follow with a good moisturizer and sun screen twice a day</li>
            <li>I have held off giving this review for over a month because I wanted to give the product a fair chance.  </li>
            <li>I now have a nice glow and that makes me happy.</li>
            <li>my skin really loved it.</li>
            <li>a good product that does all it say&#x27;s it will, when used an exfoliating routine.</li>
            <li>I think it is a good serum.  </li>
            <li>She absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>I followed the good reviews and purchased this serum for anti-aging care.</li>
            <li>Light, doesn&#x27;t clog pores and makes my skin feel great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to good results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it a couple weeks now with a good moisturizer</li>
            <li>Wakes me up in the morning and refreshes my face for a good night sleep.  </li>
            <li>I knew from lots of research that vitamin C serum is really good for acne/acne scars, and my acne started fading away just after one week of use.</li>
            <li>So it is a good choice for both summer and winter, if you want to minimize the number of products you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So the product itself is good, I&#x27;ve just lost some of my enthusiasm for the applicator.  </li>
            <li>product has to inform good friends</li>
            <li>Good  </li>
            <li>and I am hopeful to see good results soon</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>My review is my own honest opinion and I am happy to declare that I love it!!</li>

            <li>My skin looks and feels better!</li>
            <li>I am an Esthetician and i love this Vitamin C Serum for my clients !  </li>
            <li>I now need to order more!</li>
            <li>I do have many spots from sun damage (darn those 1970&#x27;s when we slathered on baby oil for a tan!).  </li>
            <li>I hope to see more results as I continue to use it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this serum!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, skin feels very nice after application.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li>so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try its surprisingly amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>Aside from being a great product, it&#x27;s also cruelty free, which I stand by 100%.</li>
            <li>My skin is so happy getting all the fantastic nutrients from the serum.</li>
            <li>it is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>it is literally amazing.</li>
            <li>And I see amazing results.</li>
            <li>My skin really looks the best it has looked in quite some time.  </li>
            <li>Great product, shipped fast and great customer service.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own product.</li>
            <li>Nice pdt, shipment was fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When you put the product on, it feels kind of like glue.</li>
            <li>they probably would have faded on their own.</li>
            <li>and I am thrilled with this addition to my skin care routine.</li>
            <li>The serum has a citrus scent that is quite nice.</li>
            <li>Best time to use them on the lips is when one is ready to go to bed.</li>
            <li>that worry that women have about time catching up with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>think I like this product most because it feels good to wear.</li>
            <li>kind message activated my interest, again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They say I’ve probably dropped 5 years off my age which feels so nice to hear.</li>
            <li>Good seller, I&#x27;ll order more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely an effective anti-aging serum.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So, with both of those products, I&#x27;m noticing some nice changes.  </li>
            <li>kind of earthy like a plant.</li>
            <li>Quite nice.</li>
            <li>This product makes my skin feel nice</li>
            <li>As a licensed esthetician, I have access to some amazing professional products and I have to say that I&#x27;m very impressed with this over the counter serum.</li>
            <li>afterwards, I found that it gave a sensation of light flushing and tightening of my skin, and I had a pleasant tingling sensation.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use although I feel it will take some time.  </li>
            <li>This one goes on very easily.</li>
            <li>This one is nice and very light.</li>
            <li>It is nice to be able to see a difference when a product is used.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to try this serum because I liked the list of ingredients and figured it would be more stable.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent product because it delivers Vitamin C directly to face.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li>I have been using Best Natural Vitamin Serum for about a month</li>
            <li>The best part is that it is oil free, alcohol free, and paraben free.</li>
            <li>So easy to just apply in a jiffy and go!  </li>
            <li>It has a mild but pleasant scent of orange, with a hint of spice.  </li>
            <li>Great product, lightened my skin after the first use.</li>
            <li>I also put it on my legs and makes them very smooth.</li>
            <li>, my skin is still in good shape after using this (in fact, breakouts are healing quickly) and</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a nice texture that is easy to rub</li>
            <li>The product is easy to dose, very good to my skin (no irritations at all), smells heavenly – and it absorbs really well.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant light scent and is fairly light so it can be used both day and night.  </li>
            <li>, I try this out on the top of one of my hands to see if there was any visible difference of the skin between both hands and to see if there was any skin irritation.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it is because of this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my 5th bottle and I love the results - doesn&#x27;t make me look like a movie star, but evens my complexion well</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>and I can tell the cream goes on more evenly now that I am using the product.</li>
            <li>my skin appears more radiant, sun spots fade – and my skin looks rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>OK product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly speaking, though, the best prevention I&#x27;ve ever found for skin aging is bioidentical, pharmaceutical-grade progesterone such as [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a bit more of a &#x27;plumping&#x27; effect, but perhaps I have to use it for a while longer before I notice that.</li>
            <li>I love the way it made me skin feel when</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks now along with the Derma Roller that stimulates collagen production in my face and am quite pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t do anything outstanding for my skin.</li>
            <li>I really love the vitamin C serum</li>
            <li>Some of them are from aging (around my nose, mostly).</li>
            <li>This product was appealing to me.</li>
            <li>Most products break me out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too sure about &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34; ..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a vitamin C serum and wasn&#x27;t sure it would provide any benefits for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hope that by the time I finish this bottle, I can see better result.</li>
            <li>On top of that it breaks me out.  </li>
            <li>but my skin feels better and smoother.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be happy with it once I use the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>there are a lot of better product then that</li>
            <li>I feel my skin looks more radiant.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle now and hope the results keep on continuing :D!</li>
            <li>and I noticed improvement after one bottle :)</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li>WILL BUY MORE  </li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the vitamin c serum.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>they seemed to \\&quot;blend\\&quot; more.</li>
            <li>I use obaji products now and would love to be able to switch al products to Petunia.  </li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>Most of the reviews were impressive and it sounded like a product where I would definitely see results.  </li>
            <li>I could not be more pleased with this product...</li>
            <li>I hope they add more products to their line.</li>
            <li>and I love the way it feels under my  makeup foundation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this Vitamin C Serum.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my mother because she was the one that needed this more than me.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s going to purchase some more of it when this runs out.</li>
            <li>This product was okay, sometimes my face felt a lot more plump and looked youthful</li>
            <li>That being said, I do really love this serum.</li>
            <li>I love this Vit C</li>
            <li>I cannot be more pleased.</li>
            <li>so I need more than a hydrating moisturizer to combat aging skin and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>One drop is what I use followed by my favorite moisturizer or night cream.</li>
            <li>My skin has a better texture, is softer and more hydrated.</li>
            <li>I am going to keep buying from Petunia Skincare for sure.</li>
            <li>serum is lovely, lightweight, and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I am almost finished with this bottle and I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>five stars --it melts on your face  and the results is a lovely face.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it because many of the product reviews attest to its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>Great customer service, fast delivery...</li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t ask for more..</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>but I do think my skin looks and feels better than it did before I started using.</li>
            <li>and I’ve been using this serum for 3 months now, and feel fully confident that I have given a recommended time frame to review and share my experience with Petunia Skincare’s vitamin c</li>
            <li>I really love love what this serum did to my face..</li>
            <li>I feel like my skin has looked better since using it.  </li>
            <li>or so I&#x27;ll be able to see if it&#x27;s going to do what it suppose to.  </li>
            <li>I truly love it .....</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see what results come after more time.</li>
            <li>I use only organic skin products and this company makes some of the best!  </li>
            <li>Either way, when I use it, I love the glow I have and</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Really love this serum.</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li>but my skin is getting much better.</li>
            <li>I have used so many vitamin C serums.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m all about healthy choices and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for about a week now, in the morning, and I still find it to be an excellent product, although there are definitely some differences after the reformulation.  </li>
            <li>I note that this contains many plant extracts and pigments (i.e., astaxanthin, lycopene, beta carotene, etc.), and that I would expect these to give the color I see</li>
            <li>Absolutely, love it and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>My PIH (brown spots) doesn&#x27;t look much better, but perhaps it will take longer to see a difference in that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it has vitamin e, which makes the vitamin c more stable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the changes that I saw immediately and the ones that continue to make me look better.</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother, firmer and just better looking.</li>
            <li>It dries as a layer on top of the skin and that is what makes you feel like it is tightening your skin.</li>
            <li>I got this product for free through a Reddit code and i will honestly say i will purchase again.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>my skin seems smoother, tighter and has a more even tone,</li>
            <li>My skin looks glowing and in so much better condition.</li>
            <li>Your skin will look more radiant and yonger.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited about what the results will be 5 more weeks from now!</li>
            <li>and I love how it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
            <li>I noticed some brightening and more even skin tone after about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>and I imagine applying it night and day would make the results even better.</li>
            <li>I notice a more even tone as well.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Glad I ran across it.</li>
            <li>so my skin looked nice and clean, and smooth!</li>
            <li>This regimen will be the first step morning and night!!!</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this serum.  </li>
            <li>Very nice serum, I am pleased, I can&#x27;t see any visible results yet, but feels good on the face, absorbs quick,  makes my skin soft, I don&#x27;t have any brown spot, so I can&#x27;t tell if helps for discoloration.</li>
            <li>It’s sticky for the first minute or two, but then dries fairly well.</li>
            <li>Either because of good genes or the fact that we messed with all of this stuff when we were younger (or maybe both), my sister and I have always been told that we have good skin.  </li>
            <li>My aesthetician recommended a vitamin C serum for my face, so I spent time looking around and researching for the perfect one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great exfolliator that helps peel off the old skin</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, and I have no problems or allergies to it, which is a great comfort.</li>
            <li>I am pleased to note that this now specifies that the hyaluronic acid is plant-based -- this product is now vegan and cruelty free, if those are of concern to you.&lt;br /&gt;(5)</li>
            <li>It absorbs well and is not sticky and doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell to it which is good.</li>
            <li>It is nice to know this product contains no artificial colors or fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I do think my skin looks good for being out so much.</li>
            <li>Thanks Best Natural Vitamin C Serum!</li>
            <li>I totally fell in love with this product, the best thing is that it is very affordable!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other Vit C serums, and Petunia is the best.</li>
            <li>Used it with a derma roller, so not sure which product was responsible for the great changes in my complexion, but was very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I love the way Vitamin C Serum makes my face feel lovely and fresh.</li>
            <li>Serum is easy to use.</li>
            <li>It comes off easily with water.</li>
            <li>It spreads easily and it dries in just a minute or two</li>
            <li>It spreads easily and it dries in just a minute or two</li>
            <li>And the drop applicator makes applying it easy without waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually feel okay not using foundation because my skin looks so great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a serum that is perfect for even sensitive skin, thanks to the aloe and witch hazel, and a host of botanicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seems to be too strong.</li>
            <li>While I do love the silkiness of the serum and the light citrus fragrance, I cannot honestly say that I have seen much, if any, improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>who&#x27;s packaging definitely inspired Petunia&#x27;s) and it worked beautifully.</li>
            <li>I really liked this serum at first.</li>
            <li>It promises to diminish and reduce the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and enlarged pore size.</li>
            <li>The fine lines &amp; wrinkles aren&#x27;t as noticeable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a perfect test subject for skin oils/creams/serums.</li>
            <li>I used it twice a day faithfully and never saw any change in my skin, lightening, or decrease in fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li>My fine lines have even reduced.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping!</li>
            <li>And my skin absorbs moisturizer more quickly now.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely be getting more when I run out!</li>
            <li>I have fair fair skin, I am 45, with some lines around my eyes and slight discoloration from the sun on my cheeks and neck.  </li>
            <li>but it made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I notice a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, nice smooth transaction.  </li>
            <li>I hope you have the same great results that I have.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s unimaginably cheap for a skincare product for aging skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got a free coupon from /r freebies on reddit and decided to try this out.</li>
            <li>I decided to take the plunge and go for it since it was free.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it will remove the brown spots and light the circles.  </li>
            <li>After using both products together during this trial period, I will say that my skin is looking more fresh and awake than it did before.  </li>
            <li>but this product has extra stuff in it that works great</li>
            <li>Smooth and tighter skin</li>
            <li>I purchased the Vitamin C Anti-Aging Serum a few weeks ago and I am very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels so smooth.  </li>
            <li>I got this with the free coupon code.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;It is effective and very soothing on my face.  </li>
            <li>I appreciate your thoughtful follow up on my purchase of the Serum.  </li>
            <li>Noticeable fading of brown spots and skin tone is getting even and smooth.  </li>
            <li>so it’s important to use sunscreen.</li>
            <li>The best serum I have ever purchased and I have tried a few.</li>
            <li>I love the fresh feeling I get with this product.</li>
            <li>Knowing its healthy and organic and truly smells like I am using fresh oranges on my skin.</li>
            <li>I want to stock up on this product because when something works, I don&#x27;t want to take a chance that it isn&#x27;t available anymore.</li>
            <li>like how it:&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs very well into the skin&lt;br /&gt;Has a nice orange smell to it</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, the positives:  my skin is evening out and when the light hits it from the side, it looks smoother.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy consistency of product and appreciate ingredients at an affordable cost.</li>
            <li>The great reviews are the reasons for my purchase and i am looking forward to seeing the future results!</li>
            <li>I have waited a while to write this review (a month actually) just to make sure I gave it a good chance.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for couple weeks, so far do good.</li>
            <li>So far it look good, no complaints, no results yet either</li>
            <li>This has been a good product so far.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>To be clear, while I received this product for free, I am in no way obligated to give it a good review, nor am I being compensated to write this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, so good.</li>
            <li>At age 82, even though I have good young looking skin, I need all the help I can get and this product did help plump out my skin and make it smooth.  </li>
            <li>So far It seems to be good</li>
            <li>Since I wrote my original review, I have had a chance to try a lot of competing products, and have experienced a lot of different types of dispensers.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way – what an AWESOME product and a great price point compared with mainstream products.</li>
            <li>However I do not see any significant results.  </li>
            <li>But first week to try it&#x27;s was ok.</li>
            <li>Over all a simple successful purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two weeks of use, there is visible softening of creases/wrinkles at the corner of my eyes.</li>
            <li>I did receive this for free to review, and I can honestly say I will definitely continue to use this product and purchase more when my sample runs out.</li>
            <li>Great antioxidant serum, didn&#x27;t cause breakouts and it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>Product works, but takes time and is well worth it!</li>
            <li>My usual concern (skin sensitivity) was quickly squashed because this stuff makes my face feel great, no allergic reactions of any kind.  </li>
            <li>My usual concern (skin sensitivity) was quickly squashed because this stuff makes my face feel great, no allergic reactions of any kind.  </li>
            <li>I have huge pores &amp; I think they are getting smaller by using this product, but it still hadn&#x27;t reached the optimum result i wanted yet.</li>
            <li>and I felt comfortable going to the super market without putting on makeup..</li>
            <li>The formula is light weight and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>Goes on silky smooth and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Received quickly and am enjoying the product - thanks!</li>
            <li>Her skin looks fresh and this has lightened the fine lines.  </li>
            <li>In summary, this product is not bad but it is also nothing special.</li>
            <li>I really appreciated the follow-up by Petunia Skincare to be sure their product met my expectations.</li>
            <li>I am even trying it on the tops of my hands to see if it will have the same good results as on my face.</li>
            <li>I love it, thank you so much</li>
            <li>My wrinkles around my eyes also filled in, I could smile and the lines weren’t as noticeable..</li>
            <li>To top it off it&#x27;s reasonably priced</li>
            <li>Have not been able to tell much of a difference yet.</li>
            <li>I use this product twice daily, mostly around my eyes but lightly elsewhere, had no bad reaction to it , I use it mostly to maintain or prevent crows feet, I like the product and will continue using it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad and it&#x27;s not medicinal.  </li>
            <li>I was lucky to be selected to try the product for free in exchange of honest feedback – and I will definitely purchase the product again!</li>
            <li>but so far it goes on smoothly but will do an update when I&#x27;ve had more time to see how it&#x27;s going to affect my skin.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I was worried that the mild exfoliating effect might increase the flakiness of the psoriatic patches or otherwise irritate them, but it hasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>there is some reaction to make you feel something is working, this product is ultra mild.</li>
            <li>I received my order quickly and have also received emails that included additional tips and benefits of using Vitamin C serum.  </li>
            <li>I like the mild smell</li>
            <li>Lovely product, easy to apply, fast absorbing, leaves no residue, works well under moisturizer and makeup.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a transgendered woman, age 64, and I have found this serum to be extraordinary.</li>
            <li>This is still moisturizing, but it dries quickly and does not interfere with the application of makeup.  </li>
            <li>I like how quickly it absorbs (as well as the performance under makeup).  </li>
            <li>also I feel mild burning sensation on my face every time  using it .</li>
            <li>Great active ingredients make it so effective, and much more reasonably priced than similar products.</li>
            <li>It is bright orange, which is kind of unique, but it disappears into the skin right after being applied and leaves a dewy, smooth feeling behind.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast too!</li>
            <li>I have been using this for several weeks and have been very pleased.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product actually works and is worth the price!</li>
            <li>But now you are aware, in case this is important to you.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But now you are aware, in case this is important to you.)  </li>
            <li>The fine lines have diminished around my eyes and my entire face is much more healthy .Wonderful product ,thanks</li>
            <li>The serum I put on my hand absorbed quickly and without any greasy residue and did not irritate or burn my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have good normal/sometimes slightly dry skin.</li>
            <li>The serum is not sticky &amp; absorbed quickly into my skin.</li>
            <li>At first I started getting zits but not too many, they cleared up fast</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know if this is a good product, but did notice these reviewers have all reviewed several of the exact same products, which is a strong indication they are planted reviews by people paid to leave positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Super fast delivery!!</li>
            <li>highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>Love this product!!!-it does seem to protect my face from environment, and keeps it SUPER soft.</li>
            <li>There are so many Vitamin C serums sold online, so it&#x27;s really hard to dig through and find a good one.  </li>
            <li>Although this product is helpful in moisturizing and it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin, I have experienced no noticeable improvement in my uneven skin tone.  </li>
            <li>My pores look smaller - they weren&#x27;t huge to begin with, but they look better.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and absorbs really well with the derma roller.</li>
            <li>A couple of things I like about the company as a whole is that you get a free e-book that talks to you about beauty regimens, I received a follow up email to give me some tips on using their product</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a few months now, and it&#x27;s great for my skin.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to leave feedback until I&#x27;ve had some time with the product, so that I can offer useful feedback.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several of these but by no means do I consider myself any kind of skin care expert.  </li>
            <li>Nothing else compares for that purpose, in my own personal experience, and the progesterone has the added advantage of protecting one from cancer and strengthening the bones.</li>
            <li>The consistency is compared to a fresh orange juice.</li>
            <li>Immediate success</li>
            <li>Powerful antioxidant.</li>
            <li>Although I just started to use it, it is non-irritating to my skin and is quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li>By far one of my favorite skin care products.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin soft, and gently takes off the outer layer of skin, giving my skin a nice fresh look.  </li>
            <li>It is lightweight, powerful and efficient.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it may work better if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>But, this seems to be a useful product.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more very soon :)</li>
            <li>Eventually I grew skeptical of everything I see on Amazon because I always see 5 star rating on every product I bought which never worked on me and it seemed like lots of companies write good reviews themselves to make them look good.</li>
            <li>This product is perfect for putting on immediately afterwards, as it protects my skin with a thin barrier.</li>
            <li>product is a golden brown color and is translucent-to-opaque.  </li>
            <li>I have been pleased so far.  </li>
            <li>The &#x27;serum&#x27; does not get absorbed into skin as stated.</li>
            <li>Hence that is how you know it is not being absorbed.</li>
            <li>It is worth the try!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, gives my old skin a glow.</li>
            <li>This serum is by far one of my favorites if not my favorite.</li>
            <li>So far I love the results.</li>
            <li>It also arrived super fast to my mailbox!</li>
            <li>I did purchase it because the other rating were good.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and non-greasy, and absorbs right into the skin.</li>
            <li>Brown skin flakes combine with the surum and rub right off.</li>
            <li>I saw a difference right away.</li>
            <li>You feel it right away.</li>
            <li>Although I did receive this product for free, that does not mean that my review is biased.</li>
            <li>It is absorbed quickly, not sticky, leaves a good feeling on the face.  </li>
            <li>I am in my 30&#x27;s, have very sensitive, clog-prone skin, but I gave this a fair shot and even patch tested it on one area to see if it was different than an area without it.</li>
            <li>Overall, acne scars are still noticeable upon further inspection, but have nicely faded to blend better with the surrounding skin.</li>
            <li>The smell of the serum is also pleasant (kind of an orange-y smell) and a little bit of serum goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I am 43 years old, and although I do have good skin, I had noticed some discoloration on my cheeks and above my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>The serum is a little bit tacky at first, but dries to a nice smooth, finish.  </li>
            <li>Been using this for approximately 2 weeks now, it feels nice on skin, not too sticky, not oily, no unpleasant scent, glides nicely on skin and absorbs quite fast.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin very soft and smooth under makeup.</li>
            <li>The dullness most apparent on my cheeks and chin is gone and the skin is more even on my entire face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my mid 60&#x27;s, have a couple light colored age spots on my face, don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, don&#x27;t have many deep wrinkles, but I  have plenty of fine lines &amp; fine wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I definitely appreciated this product it does work quickly and be prepared to stay hydrated and moisturizer as the skin Renewal and repair starts within the first use.</li>
            <li>Absorbs very fast.  </li>
            <li>Then, as we got older, we would go to different beauty and makeup stories to buy our own goops to try out.  </li>
            <li>Seems to help my 57-year old skin be more vibrant looking, and smoother looking/softer feeling.  </li>
            <li>Great serum for dull skin.</li>
            <li>It is hard to find a product that does all this at an affordable price, so I am so happy to have found this.</li>
            <li>This vitamin c serum has made my skin extremely soft to touch and the fine lines around my eyes have diminished drastically to the point when I smile you can&#x27;t really see the lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Really work well and defiantly would purchase again!</li>
            <li>Also, the tiny blackheads on my nose seemed to have disappeared for the most part.</li>
            <li>Within the first week of use, I noticed an improvement in my complexion.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel at all oily and is readily absorbed when gently massaged into the skin&amp;mdash;and a drop or two goes</li>
            <li>and I will most likely buy it again when my bottle runs out.  </li>
            <li>I cannot handle most American brands and clearing my acne was a nightmare.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, it&#x27;s a very GRADUAL process so don&#x27;t expect results over night!</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it has all natural ingredients and it is paraben free.</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft, radiant and smooth.</li>
            <li>Keep using it, hope it work very well!</li>
            <li>It really works!  </li>
            <li>couple of months ago, I received an email from a lady at Petunia Skincare asking if I would be interested in trying one of their products.  </li>
            <li>I emailed her back that I would be glad to try out her product and received it a couple of days</li>
            <li>Love and regret that I have not learned about this serum earlier.</li>
            <li>The stuff really works!</li>
            <li>I love to try different brands.</li>
            <li>My entire skin on my face is more even and tighter.</li>
            <li>A lot of serums are pretty sticky and/or are too lightweight to feel like they are doing anything.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more radiant, smaller pores and smoother skin.</li>
            <li>I started seeing results the first week of use.</li>
            <li>The first week my skin soaked in the serum.</li>
            <li>Just say what the product really is!</li>
            <li>I will continue to use both products and will update when I have more solid results to report.  </li>
            <li>, I bet I&#x27;ll be checking out their whole line!  </li>
            <li>I find it funny that it took longer to process my order then shipping it.</li>
            <li>couple of weeks ago, I began considering trying a serum for the first time, and had been researching them online.  </li>
            <li>I do use a small bit more than the pea-sized amount recommended on the bottle/box, but nota lot more.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s exactly what I did.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s exactly what I did.  </li>
            <li>shipping on exactly as given.</li>
            <li>I attribute this to the balance of several ingredient working together to give you a more healthy overall skin.</li>
            <li>It smells slightly bitter, but not in a nice citrus-y way.</li>
            <li>After a week more co workers asked what I was doing different..</li>
            <li>I received this much more quickly than I expected to...</li>
            <li>I used this product during the day over my whole face and a retinol at night, and the combination seemed to be the right mix for me..</li>
            <li>product has great ingredients, which the manufacturer has accurately and completely listed here on this product page--which far too few companies bother to do for their cosmetics.</li>
            <li>but my fine lines are somewhat diminished and my skin has a refreshing brigthness that I&#x27;ve been missing.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; is quite weird, at first it remember me some kind of machine oil, after some time I thought it rather be kind of avocado smell or any plant o root.</li>
            <li>Beyond the cost comparison, the product also contains Hyaluronic Acid and other goodies for your skin and has a slight pleasant refreshing citrus/orange scent.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product a few weeks now, so far it is great.</li>
            <li>I love the Petunia Skincare Professional Vitamin C Serum because it is 98% natural and not tested on animals – and contains no parabens, no sulfates, no alcohol – and no gluten.</li>
            <li>I feel like this is the only product I&#x27;ve ever bought on Amazon that costs over $20, have really good reviews and ratings and ACTUALLY WORKED!</li>
            <li>Saw a marked reduction in neck area right away after just a week!</li>
            <li>The best part is it&#x27;s cheaper than high end brand names and does the same job if not better.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to use the serum around the eyes--one of the first and heaviest areas for skin to age--</li>
            <li>One other key ingredient to a great skin care regimen is Vitamin A</li>
            <li>Exfoliates and hydrates the dry, dehydrated skin for a more moisturized and plumped skin.</li>
            <li>it made it super soft and glowing.</li>
            <li>A lot of my friends have complimented me and asked me what did I do, because my skin is now super soft, plump and glowing.</li>
            <li>After using this, my face has certainly feel a lot softer and tighter.</li>
            <li>Then I use pure coco butter.</li>
            <li>It does also seem to lessen the appearance of those fine facial wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I bought other Vitamin C products in the past but this is the best value for the money.  </li>
            <li>The Mad Hippie used to absorb beautifully and leave my face smooth and matte.</li>
            <li>and I already have an amazing glow the skin on my neck and decollete seem is a little firmer.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s just say that, in the last couple of months, I have become a huge fan of Petunia Skincare products.  </li>
            <li>Have not seen much difference but will perservere till this bottle is gone.</li>
            <li>Using only this product after a couple weeks at one time a day I have a smooth complexion, no blackheads.</li>
            <li>I really am liking the way this product has made my skin look and feel, and it has also reduced redness as well.</li>
            <li>Provides antioxidant protection from free radicals end environmental damage such as the sun, pollution, and smoke.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care for the smell.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care for the smell.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much change in a couple light-colored age spots on my face, but  the spot on my hand is much smoother now...</li>
            <li>most of its rough texture is gone.</li>
            <li>Still using this twice a day and really like the way my skin feels.  </li>
            <li>It is really greasy on my face and does not brighten it at all.  </li>
            <li>This appears to be a very stable form of vitamin c which I appreciate.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t too noticeable unless you would come really close to my eye</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>They provide real customer service.  </li>
            <li>This serum has improved my skins texture a lot and made it really glow.</li>
            <li>but I also felt like the serum was really sticky on my face.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference otherwise.</li>
            <li>It is also cruelty free, made in the USA, and has a 100% money back guarantee.</li>
            <li>My mom uses this in the morning before she puts on her makeup and feels it really makes a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My mom uses this in the morning before she puts on her makeup and feels it really makes a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has helped fade my hyperpigmentation, and I wake up with a much brighter completion when I use this.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smoother, looks and feels so young and fresh.</li>
            <li>Nothing really</li>
            <li>I actually really like this serum.</li>
            <li>My daughter recommended this product and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>It really hydrate our skin.</li>
            <li>and it really seems to be working.  </li>
            <li>This really helped me decide that I should purchase and try it out for myself.  </li>
            <li>and I think doing it at night and morning was too much for me.  </li>
            <li>and I just gently rolled it over my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have rosacea and didn&#x27;t really think this roller and</li>
            <li>and it is very soothing.</li>
            <li>Between too much sun exposure and chemotherapy,  my face and neck are really beginning to show signs of aging.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried products like proactiv and acne.org before and none of them ever really stopped me from getting acne or treated acne scars.</li>
            <li>serum is very silky and soothing to the skin.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t need a lot of this to cover your whole face.  </li>
            <li>The eyedropper provided with the serum is a convenient way to dispense it without getting too much.  </li>
            <li>time, I believe the hyaluronic acid is starting to exert an effect; my forehead is particularly smooth these days.  </li>
            <li>Over time, I believe the hyaluronic acid is starting to exert an effect; my forehead is particularly smooth these days.  </li>
            <li>If you put another product on after applying the &#x27;serum&#x27;, then the serum becomes very watery all over again.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Product works really well.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, it does everything it says it will.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 66 years old, and thankfully don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, but it is working on those I do have around my eyes and upper lip.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m unsure of:&lt;br /&gt;Whether or not the pH level is low enough for the product to be effective.</li>
            <li>Upon applying,  the skin felt being slightly stretched or somewhat dry but the effect is good after continued use.  </li>
            <li>had had some breakouts recently, and those healed pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>I had had some breakouts recently, and those healed pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>I ordered 2 bottles so my face should be back to its original color in a matter of months.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel it made my skin any worse though, and that&#x27;s really saying something because I do clog easily and react to many things.</li>
            <li>What made me want to buy this serum is mainly because the seller is very informative on its product</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say with 100% certainty that this product was responsible for the quick healing, but that is similar to one of the benefits listed on the product page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say with 100% certainty that this product was responsible for the quick healing, but that is similar to one of the benefits listed on the product page.  </li>
            <li>The only real drawback is that this serum feels really sticky for quiet awhile so its not that comfortable when you first apply.</li>
            <li>I used to feel the oils in my skin piling on my face after a full day, and if I didn&#x27;t use Apricot Scrub every day to exfoliate, my skin felt &#x27;cakey&#x27; even after washing with regular facewash.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first one I received is the Professional Vitamin C Serum.  </li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t normally get compliments on my skin.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.um is a convenient way to dispense it without getting too much.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t sting or irritate my skin, and I have pretty sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s quite sticky and doesn&#x27;t dry smooth at all.</li>
            <li>This Vitamin C serum is similar to the many different brands being sold.  </li>
            <li>The only problem I had about those Vitamin C&#x27;s was that they oxidized too quickly and stung my face (no redness though)</li>
            <li>I purchased this product mainly for my wife</li>
            <li>As I am an older now with sun damaged skin, this product has given me softer skin already.</li>
            <li>I waited a while before reviewing because with my older skin, it took a bit to notice change.</li>
            <li>But lucky for me, I have been researching different products that claim to rejuvenate and refresh aging skin and in that search I came across a wonderfully worthy company that makes several rejuevenating products.  </li>
            <li>However, I took the plunge and so far, the results seem positive.  </li>
            <li>My high expectations for this product were based it&#x27;s claims and rave reviews.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>followed with a lip balm that has a high level of sunscreen.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kathryn B.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for this purpose.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it and the ProDermis Retinol night cream.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend both product and Petunia.</li>
            <li>Made my skin nice and soft but as far as removing spots from previous acne, it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>Sure, the serum softened it up a little after application...</li>
            <li>the serum would do anything to help with that; I was mostly hoping for improvement in the appearance of my pores and the little wrinkles that I blame on my husband.</li>
            <li>In general I didn&#x27;t stay interested in it. .</li>
            <li>I am really liking this so far.  </li>
            <li>At 45, I have old lady hands: wrinkled with practically polka dot age spots, and they are very dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will update my review after some long term use and will reserve final judgment of the product after I have used for a greater period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried many skin care products hoping to find a product that doesn&#x27;t irritate and also improves my uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li>After one month of use, I feel like I can see a difference where lines are starting to set on my forehead and smile lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Success enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t use vitamin serums in my beauty regiment but after trying out this serum</li>
            <li>/&gt;It leaves my skin smooth, soft and glowing all day long.</li>
            <li>Just like with the first product, these two products are used daily by myself and my mother (now she uses my stuff haha).  </li>
            <li>Just like with the first product, these two products are used daily by myself and my mother (now she uses my stuff haha).  </li>
            <li>My skin type is normal and this serum dryed my face</li>
            <li>totally worth to try, this was actually a gift one of my friends sent to me.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t normally get compliments on my skin.)  </li>
            <li>Smooth as it goes in…I really feel that the wrinkles are much less noticeable  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product to help lighten the area above my upper lip and minimize the fine lines there.</li>
            <li>serum is light orange in color, due to all the antioxidants it has in it, for example beta carotene, and it has a citrusy smell to it.</li>
            <li>GOES ON SMOOTH AND DOES NOT BURN LIKE SOME OF THE OTHER PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li>It kind of left a film over my skin that could be rubbed off into little balls with my fingertip.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are a product that I definitely recommend you give a try to - and remember what I said above, they are so sure that  you will love their product that they offer a 100% money back guarantee if you are not happy.r, which makes a mess if you&#x27;re just putting it on your finger to spread on your face</li>
            <li>Just a heads up it will take most likely over 30min to just dry completely and feel normal but it does get there.</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t really live here without sun affecting your skin, even if you jump through hoops to keep it protected.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t stop you from getting new acne because I still get acne</li>
            <li>Usually when vit C is applied there is mild stinging (not unpleasant)</li>
            <li>In short, if you are looking to try a Vit-C serum, this is the one to try ... if it works for you, you will be hooked (and if it does not, I seriously doubt other brand will do better).</li>
            <li>and I have to say the results are so amazing that I have started using the Serum on my neck and on a couple of sun spots on my arm, which I only started a few days ago and already see a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this products is fantastic, especially considering how affordable it is.</li>
            <li>The sun damage, from being in the sun too much when I was younger, has improved so much I am not self-conscience anymore.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This product made my skin very soft and I do notice a sunspot on my nose getting lighter.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li>Fine line wrinkles are definitely smoothed and your skin with feel fresh and firm.</li>
            <li>I also like that I support a new, innovative, small business – as I always opt to do this when I can.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s packed with the most effective ingredients for half the price of more expensive (and often less optimal) products.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my wife and after using the first bottle,  she has seen big difference.  </li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend this highly affective face serum!!</li>
            <li>Smells great and doesn&#x27;t interfere negatively with my other products and does not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>The price seems to be in line with other similar products yet it delivers so much more.</li>
            <li>so I still top off this serum with my usual Environ Vitamin A products.</li>
            <li>I was using this by itself for the first several days I had it</li>
            <li>After first used, I can see a different in my skin.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m not sure if the pH level of this serum is appropriate.</li>
            <li>My skin is totally free of any dark spots.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to apply the Vitamin C Serum, it is dispensed with an eyedropper and a little goes</li>
            <li>A single pea-sized drop on the palm of your hand will be enough for your entire face, and the results start showing up very quickly, even at the first application.</li>
            <li>; came into my mind - if all these years of trying new stuff has paid off so far, why change what I&#x27;m doing?  </li>
            <li>I should have started using this ten years ago, but I&#x27;m doing it now and based on my positive experience with Petunias brand</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was above average and left my skin feeling nice without the sting.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I never finished off the product and it crystalized after maybe 2 months, which I would assume would happen with any similar product, especially something like Vit C which deteriorates rather quickly.</li>
            <li>I am on my third bottle; I certainly would recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>My skin definitely has a more youthful appearance, is a little firmer &amp; looks brighter.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad because I can hardly see the scar now.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions clearly posted on this product page within the product description.</li>
            <li>I can see a difference in my skin, it does look healthier and clear.  </li>
            <li>If someone else knows, please clear up my confusion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves skin with a soft supple firmness.</li>
            <li>soft, moisturized and the blemishes that I did have are now gone.  </li>
            <li>I got breakouts after using this product, mine is a sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My pores became smaller, and my skin was much softer to the touch.</li>
            <li>So far, about 1 month, this serum is working to keep my skin soft.</li>
            <li>It smells like honey and old towels to me....</li>
            <li>It smells like honey and old towels to me....</li>
            <li>and i can feel it is so natural.</li>
            <li>I have been using Petunia Skincare Anti-Aging Serum for about three weeks now and have been pleasantly surprised by the results.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft and moist, and it is not sticky or tacky like some serums.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m liking the experience.  </li>
            <li>This has really helped me brighten my facial skin.</li>
            <li>They have lightened considerably.</li>
            <li>So far, there has been no change at all.  </li>
            <li>I have soft, acne-free skin before I used this.  </li>
            <li>Skin felt soft and nourished throughout the day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m 75 years young and have used 1 bottle of  Vitamin C Serum.  </li>
            <li>My neck is 66 yrs old and looks 55.</li>
            <li>This serum is 100% natural, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about putting chemicals or parabens on your face</li>
            <li>Ever since we were young, my sister and I have always played around with skincare products.  </li>
            <li>As I read that email, the old adage &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t fix what ain&#x27;t broke&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I shopped around for a serum made with all natural ingredients</li>
            <li>I regularly use sunblock and all sorts of lotions and overnight creams, but nothing really seems to protect the skin AND</li>
            <li>&gt; A very unease sensation follows this physical reaction.</li>
            <li>Nothing, no reaction -- which makes me wonder if there are enough actives to really do anything in the product.  </li>
            <li>It almost made my skin soft, and my gf has even started using it.</li>
            <li>so much I use it daily.</li>
            <li>So far I like this serum.</li>
            <li>It helps to keep my skin soft and youthful looking.</li>
            <li>however, this product did not get rid of my wrinkles completely</li>
            <li>I’ve just recently purchased Shiseido’s sunscreen and now I can really see the vitamin c lightening the spots..</li>
            <li>I just started using it a couple weeks ago and so far it&#x27;s helping somewhat.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I just got an old bottle.</li>
            <li>and I really notice the difference, especially with age spots.  </li>
            <li>My skin very challenged by years and years and years in sun and low humidity.  </li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive</li>
            <li>how soft my face feels.  </li>
            <li>I am 62 years old and looking to keep</li>
            <li>) Does not cause an allergic reaction (I have sensitive</li>
            <li>I wanted to wait several weeks before writing my review because I didn&#x27;t want to rave about something that was in my head or something I wasn&#x27;t really seeing.  </li>
            <li>When you apply it around your eyes, you only need to take it to your cheeck bone, that is far enough, it&#x27;ll get absorbed, that is what my dermatologist told me....and quite frankly this has hyaluronic acid in it, not something you want to put close to the eye either.  </li>
            <li>i have always looked old for my age, even as a teenager, and now at age 19 i look 25.</li>
            <li>Another thing I have REALLY sensitive skin, and I have no trouble using this product at all, it doesn&#x27;t sting, itchy, or cause redness/drying effect.</li>
            <li>and Im a 40 yr old man.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These are a product that I definitely recommend you give a try to - and remember what I said above, they are so sure that  you will love their product that they offer a 100% money back guarantee if you are not happy.</li>
            <li>I kept this in a cool, dark environment - not in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>I was waiting for a long term positive result and there was none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised about is that within the first two days, my acne began clearing up and my pores starting looking a wee bit smaller.</li>
            <li>On the one hand, it may be necessary because this is pretty thin in consistency (more liquid-like and not so gel-like).  </li>
            <li>here again, other serum felt &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; while this one does not have that stickiness feel but is rapidly absorbed by your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lots of wonderful reviews here, maybe it works for them but no long term effect for me, plus it&#x27;s a little expensive.  </li>
            <li>Also I had some dark spots on both sides of my face which are becoming much lighter and less noticeable.</li>
            <li>I had also some dark spots on my face which are becoming much lighter and less</li>
            <li>I have used other vitamin C serum and this one is ok compared to other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m giving 5 star rating for this product because this is the only product that actually worked for the first time with my acne scar.</li>
            <li>and it is a noticeable fade, not slight.....</li>
            <li>Since I am an older adult I do not expect miracles but the roller and serum combined with my usual moisturizer have done more than any other products I have used.  </li>
            <li>I appreciate the fact that I only have to allow this serum to dry on my skin for five minutes--versus twenty minutes for other wrinkle-prevention products I&#x27;ve experimented with--before applying a moisturizer on top of it.</li>
            <li>When I stopped, my skin went back normal.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to sound gross, but within days, I was seeing a lot of old dried out skin appear when I shaved or just washed my face.</li>
            <li>My skin pores look much tighter, the fine lines seem to have decreased.  </li>
            <li>I have always had a problem with large pores in the nose area, but with regular use this essentially erased them.  </li>
            <li>and I will update this review if there is any new developments but for me personally I may not be the target for this product.</li>
            <li>I use it every day and my skin is baby soft with no dry spots.</li>
            <li>I did receive free or deeply discounted product from Petunia Skincare and their PR firm for the purpose of testing.  </li>
            <li>and I am sure that I look at least 10 years younger.</li>
            <li>so I expected this to be a bit harsh, like most Vitamin C serums can be.</li>
            <li>This really dried my face and turned rancid quickly.</li>
            <li>I will update if there are any major changes or results.</li>
            <li>, my skin was firmer and my fine lines were hardly visible.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it morning and night for three weeks thus far, so am not surprised I don&#x27;t see much difference in that area.</li>
            <li>The company may send you Email for the first month after a first purchase (asking to rate and providing tips)  - amongst the recommendations the use of a skin moisturizer as Vit-C may dry your skin a little.</li>
            <li>I have no fine lines and pretty much look the same as I used to when I was 19 (but</li>
            <li>I am not a huge fan of the smell, it smells like oranges and other citrus fruits, my mother thinks the smell is refreshing.</li>
            <li>I use the serum every other night on sensitive areas of my face (under eyes, side nose, eye lids) and the next morning those areas are evidently rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>I noticed lightening of spots and fine lines after only a few applications!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product claims to lighten dark spots and sunspots, and I find this to be fairly true.. meaning that my spots have not completely disappeared.. but they are not as visible as before, and I think this is partly due to me forgetting to put on sunscreen for the first couple months.</li>
            <li>Since you get a rather large amount of this in the bottle, expect it to last a long time.  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m old enough to have started the wrinkling process, and I can speak to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far skin feels softer, pores seem a bit smaller, would update review as I go along...</li>
            <li>four years younger, when we would go into mom&#x27;s bathroom (of course, when she was busy elsewhere in the house) and pretend we were her, putting all kinds of goop on our faces.  </li>
            <li>Supposedly, this serum should last without refrigeration, which is why it surprised me that  things were growing in my bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only on my early 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I think this may just be the natural smell and color of the ingredients when mixed together.  </li>
            <li>While I found an acne medicine that finally worked for me, I was having troubles using my old cleanser (Murad) because of the acids in my acne medicine and the acids in my cleanser.</li>
            <li>But if they want a review for about one month&#x27;s use, I would say I see no detectable changes for the better or worse.</li>
            <li>I am always hesitant and even skeptical when trying anything new that comes into contact with my skin, but I can confidently recommend it to others.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve honestly cried so many times because of my horrible skin</li>
            <li>I am a 45 year old female, and my mother, who sees me often, asked what I was doing differently that my skin looked</li>
            <li>My skin is usually not dry, but I do believe a moisturizer would in the sunny months when I have to wear sunscreen.</li>
            <li>They quickly rushed the product out to me (one was actually delivered from the USPS on a Sunday) and within a few days I was noticing a big difference.  </li>
            <li>They quickly rushed the product out to me (one was actually delivered from the USPS on a Sunday) and within a few days I was noticing a big difference.  </li>
            <li>Does not dry the skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;The less positive: I&#x27;m not noticing a change in the age spots at all, on either hands or face.</li>
            <li>When you first open the bottle, the smell is very citrusy (obviously...) and the consistency is sort of thick, not runny.  </li>
            <li>will say, I am less enamored of the eyedropper than I was when I first received this product last year.  </li>
            <li>There is a slight stickiness at first, and then when it dries (directions say to wait 5 minutes before applying your usual face products), you have very supple, soft skin.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t personally report any amazingly noticeable difference in eliminating my existing wrinkles while using this product, but I also did not notice my skin getting worse, and at my age, no new, bad news translates to good news.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Effectiveness: First off, I have to let you all know that I do not rely on one product only  but usually apply this product for the first days of the week (Monday to Wednesday) and other by the second 1/2.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t really detect an odor, unlike other brand that range in smell from good to bad.  </li>
            <li>form of vitamin c (MAP) is more stable than other commonly used forms, which means the serum will last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have oily skin, and live in Southwest Florida, so I can&#x27;t use anything remotely lotion-y or oily on my face.</li>
            <li>I have to say that after using the serum for over a month, my skin looks much healthier, smoother, and less puffy.</li>
            <li>Like the spots on my face, it hasn&#x27;t changed much in color, maybe slightly lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a slight odor, but I don&#x27;t really have an opinion about the odor.  </li>
            <li>I am 65 years old and although I&#x27;m told I look very young for my age, I definitely have lines and wrinkles I would like to see less of not to mention a small sunspot right under my eye.  </li>
            <li>So far I am not having problems with really dry skin and it helps with skin problems, such as scars, etc.  </li>
            <li>First thing is my skin feels very tight as soon as it drys on my face.  </li>
            <li>Dealing with acne and hyper pigmentation pretty much all of my life, it was hard to find products that won&#x27;t continue to break me out, but will help me in other ways that I need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The texture and smell don&#x27;t offend me at all, but the citrus may be a little bit much for my skin, personally, which wouldn&#x27;t be the fault of the company</li>

            <li> Great product…</li>
            <li> I have never used a vitamin C serum but have heard it does great things for your complexion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a great serum for moisture and whitening.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 10 weeks now and is great.  </li>

            <li> The price point is great too....</li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a couple of weeks of use, I am happy to report that this serum satisfies all of these conditions (which I consider to be essential).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I would wake up to beautiful bright skin</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> list of benefits listed on the box is impressive, and if you investigate Hyaluronic Acid and ferulic acid, you will find these claims to be true....from being anti-oxidant to exfoliating and rehydrating, and much more.</li>
            <li> Make sure to use with a moisturizer for best results.&lt;br /&gt;Mary</li>
            <li> It feels very pleasant on the skin, is refreshing, nourishing and non-greasy.</li>
            <li> and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> I use one drop of the serum and follow with a good moisturizer and sun screen twice a day</li>
            <li> I have held off giving this review for over a month because I wanted to give the product a fair chance.  </li>
            <li> I now have a nice glow and that makes me happy.</li>
            <li> my skin really loved it.</li>
            <li> a good product that does all it say&#x27;s it will, when used an exfoliating routine.</li>
            <li> I think it is a good serum.  </li>
            <li> She absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> I followed the good reviews and purchased this serum for anti-aging care.</li>
            <li> Light, doesn&#x27;t clog pores and makes my skin feel great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to good results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it a couple weeks now with a good moisturizer</li>
            <li> Wakes me up in the morning and refreshes my face for a good night sleep.  </li>
            <li> I knew from lots of research that vitamin C serum is really good for acne/acne scars, and my acne started fading away just after one week of use.</li>
            <li> So it is a good choice for both summer and winter, if you want to minimize the number of products you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So the product itself is good, I&#x27;ve just lost some of my enthusiasm for the applicator.  </li>
            <li> product has to inform good friends</li>
            <li> Good  </li>
            <li> and I am hopeful to see good results soon</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>

            <li> I am an Esthetician and i love this Vitamin C Serum for my clients !  </li>
            <li> I now need to order more!</li>
            <li> I do have many spots from sun damage (darn those 1970&#x27;s when we slathered on baby oil for a tan!).  </li>
            <li> I hope to see more results as I continue to use it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this serum!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, skin feels very nice after application.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li> so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try its surprisingly amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> Aside from being a great product, it&#x27;s also cruelty free, which I stand by 100%.</li>
            <li> My skin is so happy getting all the fantastic nutrients from the serum.</li>
            <li> it is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> it is literally amazing.</li>
            <li> And I see amazing results.</li>
            <li> My skin really looks the best it has looked in quite some time.  </li>
            <li> Great product, shipped fast and great customer service.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own product.</li>
            <li> Nice pdt, shipment was fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When you put the product on, it feels kind of like glue.</li>
            <li> they probably would have faded on their own.</li>
            <li> and I am thrilled with this addition to my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> The serum has a citrus scent that is quite nice.</li>
            <li> Best time to use them on the lips is when one is ready to go to bed.</li>
            <li> that worry that women have about time catching up with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> think I like this product most because it feels good to wear.</li>
            <li> kind message activated my interest, again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They say I’ve probably dropped 5 years off my age which feels so nice to hear.</li>
            <li> Good seller, I&#x27;ll order more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely an effective anti-aging serum.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So, with both of those products, I&#x27;m noticing some nice changes.  </li>
            <li> kind of earthy like a plant.</li>
            <li> Quite nice.</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin feel nice</li>
            <li> As a licensed esthetician, I have access to some amazing professional products and I have to say that I&#x27;m very impressed with this over the counter serum.</li>
            <li> afterwards, I found that it gave a sensation of light flushing and tightening of my skin, and I had a pleasant tingling sensation.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use although I feel it will take some time.  </li>
            <li> This one goes on very easily.</li>
            <li> This one is nice and very light.</li>
            <li> It is nice to be able to see a difference when a product is used.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to try this serum because I liked the list of ingredients and figured it would be more stable.  </li>
            <li> This is an excellent product because it delivers Vitamin C directly to face.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li> I have been using Best Natural Vitamin Serum for about a month</li>
            <li> The best part is that it is oil free, alcohol free, and paraben free.</li>
            <li> So easy to just apply in a jiffy and go!  </li>
            <li> It has a mild but pleasant scent of orange, with a hint of spice.  </li>
            <li> Great product, lightened my skin after the first use.</li>
            <li> I also put it on my legs and makes them very smooth.</li>
            <li> , my skin is still in good shape after using this (in fact, breakouts are healing quickly) and</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a nice texture that is easy to rub</li>
            <li> The product is easy to dose, very good to my skin (no irritations at all), smells heavenly – and it absorbs really well.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant light scent and is fairly light so it can be used both day and night.  </li>
            <li> , I try this out on the top of one of my hands to see if there was any visible difference of the skin between both hands and to see if there was any skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it is because of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 5th bottle and I love the results - doesn&#x27;t make me look like a movie star, but evens my complexion well</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> and I can tell the cream goes on more evenly now that I am using the product.</li>
            <li> my skin appears more radiant, sun spots fade – and my skin looks rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> OK product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly speaking, though, the best prevention I&#x27;ve ever found for skin aging is bioidentical, pharmaceutical-grade progesterone such as [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a bit more of a &#x27;plumping&#x27; effect, but perhaps I have to use it for a while longer before I notice that.</li>
            <li> I love the way it made me skin feel when</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks now along with the Derma Roller that stimulates collagen production in my face and am quite pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t do anything outstanding for my skin.</li>
            <li> I really love the vitamin C serum</li>
            <li> Some of them are from aging (around my nose, mostly).</li>
            <li> This product was appealing to me.</li>
            <li> Most products break me out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too sure about &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34; ..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a vitamin C serum and wasn&#x27;t sure it would provide any benefits for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hope that by the time I finish this bottle, I can see better result.</li>
            <li> On top of that it breaks me out.  </li>
            <li> but my skin feels better and smoother.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be happy with it once I use the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> there are a lot of better product then that</li>
            <li> I feel my skin looks more radiant.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle now and hope the results keep on continuing :D!</li>
            <li> and I noticed improvement after one bottle :)</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li> WILL BUY MORE  </li>

            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the product.</li>

            <li> I could not be more pleased with this product...</li>
            <li> I hope they add more products to their line.</li>
            <li> and I love the way it feels under my  makeup foundation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love this Vitamin C Serum.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother because she was the one that needed this more than me.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s going to purchase some more of it when this runs out.</li>
            <li> This product was okay, sometimes my face felt a lot more plump and looked youthful</li>
            <li> That being said, I do really love this serum.</li>
            <li> I love this Vit C</li>
            <li> I cannot be more pleased.</li>
            <li> so I need more than a hydrating moisturizer to combat aging skin and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> One drop is what I use followed by my favorite moisturizer or night cream.</li>
            <li> My skin has a better texture, is softer and more hydrated.</li>
            <li> I am going to keep buying from Petunia Skincare for sure.</li>
            <li> serum is lovely, lightweight, and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I am almost finished with this bottle and I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> five stars --it melts on your face  and the results is a lovely face.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it because many of the product reviews attest to its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Great customer service, fast delivery...</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t ask for more..</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> but I do think my skin looks and feels better than it did before I started using.</li>
            <li> and I’ve been using this serum for 3 months now, and feel fully confident that I have given a recommended time frame to review and share my experience with Petunia Skincare’s vitamin c</li>
            <li> I really love love what this serum did to my face..</li>
            <li> I feel like my skin has looked better since using it.  </li>
            <li> or so I&#x27;ll be able to see if it&#x27;s going to do what it suppose to.  </li>
            <li> I truly love it .....</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what results come after more time.</li>
            <li> I use only organic skin products and this company makes some of the best!  </li>
            <li> Either way, when I use it, I love the glow I have and</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Really love this serum.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> but my skin is getting much better.</li>
            <li> I have used so many vitamin C serums.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m all about healthy choices and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about a week now, in the morning, and I still find it to be an excellent product, although there are definitely some differences after the reformulation.  </li>
            <li> I note that this contains many plant extracts and pigments (i.e., astaxanthin, lycopene, beta carotene, etc.), and that I would expect these to give the color I see</li>
            <li> Absolutely, love it and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> My PIH (brown spots) doesn&#x27;t look much better, but perhaps it will take longer to see a difference in that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it has vitamin e, which makes the vitamin c more stable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the changes that I saw immediately and the ones that continue to make me look better.</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother, firmer and just better looking.</li>
            <li> It dries as a layer on top of the skin and that is what makes you feel like it is tightening your skin.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free through a Reddit code and i will honestly say i will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> my skin seems smoother, tighter and has a more even tone,</li>
            <li> My skin looks glowing and in so much better condition.</li>
            <li> Your skin will look more radiant and yonger.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited about what the results will be 5 more weeks from now!</li>
            <li> and I love how it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
            <li> I noticed some brightening and more even skin tone after about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> and I imagine applying it night and day would make the results even better.</li>
            <li> I notice a more even tone as well.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Glad I ran across it.</li>
            <li> so my skin looked nice and clean, and smooth!</li>
            <li> This regimen will be the first step morning and night!!!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this serum.  </li>
            <li> Very nice serum, I am pleased, I can&#x27;t see any visible results yet, but feels good on the face, absorbs quick,  makes my skin soft, I don&#x27;t have any brown spot, so I can&#x27;t tell if helps for discoloration.</li>
            <li> It’s sticky for the first minute or two, but then dries fairly well.</li>
            <li> Either because of good genes or the fact that we messed with all of this stuff when we were younger (or maybe both), my sister and I have always been told that we have good skin.  </li>
            <li> My aesthetician recommended a vitamin C serum for my face, so I spent time looking around and researching for the perfect one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great exfolliator that helps peel off the old skin</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, and I have no problems or allergies to it, which is a great comfort.</li>
            <li> I am pleased to note that this now specifies that the hyaluronic acid is plant-based -- this product is now vegan and cruelty free, if those are of concern to you.&lt;br /&gt;(5)</li>
            <li> It absorbs well and is not sticky and doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell to it which is good.</li>
            <li> It is nice to know this product contains no artificial colors or fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I do think my skin looks good for being out so much.</li>
            <li> Thanks Best Natural Vitamin C Serum!</li>
            <li> I totally fell in love with this product, the best thing is that it is very affordable!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Vit C serums, and Petunia is the best.</li>
            <li> Used it with a derma roller, so not sure which product was responsible for the great changes in my complexion, but was very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I love the way Vitamin C Serum makes my face feel lovely and fresh.</li>
            <li> Serum is easy to use.</li>
            <li> It comes off easily with water.</li>
            <li> It spreads easily and it dries in just a minute or two</li>
            <li> It spreads easily and it dries in just a minute or two</li>
            <li> And the drop applicator makes applying it easy without waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually feel okay not using foundation because my skin looks so great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a serum that is perfect for even sensitive skin, thanks to the aloe and witch hazel, and a host of botanicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seems to be too strong.</li>
            <li> While I do love the silkiness of the serum and the light citrus fragrance, I cannot honestly say that I have seen much, if any, improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> who&#x27;s packaging definitely inspired Petunia&#x27;s) and it worked beautifully.</li>
            <li> I really liked this serum at first.</li>
            <li> It promises to diminish and reduce the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and enlarged pore size.</li>
            <li> The fine lines &amp; wrinkles aren&#x27;t as noticeable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a perfect test subject for skin oils/creams/serums.</li>
            <li> I used it twice a day faithfully and never saw any change in my skin, lightening, or decrease in fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li> My fine lines have even reduced.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping!</li>
            <li> And my skin absorbs moisturizer more quickly now.</li>
            <li> I will absolutely be getting more when I run out!</li>
            <li> I have fair fair skin, I am 45, with some lines around my eyes and slight discoloration from the sun on my cheeks and neck.  </li>
            <li> but it made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I notice a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, nice smooth transaction.  </li>
            <li> I hope you have the same great results that I have.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s unimaginably cheap for a skincare product for aging skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got a free coupon from /r freebies on reddit and decided to try this out.</li>
            <li> I decided to take the plunge and go for it since it was free.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will remove the brown spots and light the circles.  </li>
            <li> After using both products together during this trial period, I will say that my skin is looking more fresh and awake than it did before.  </li>
            <li> but this product has extra stuff in it that works great</li>
            <li> Smooth and tighter skin</li>
            <li> I purchased the Vitamin C Anti-Aging Serum a few weeks ago and I am very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels so smooth.  </li>
            <li> I got this with the free coupon code.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;It is effective and very soothing on my face.  </li>
            <li> I appreciate your thoughtful follow up on my purchase of the Serum.  </li>
            <li> Noticeable fading of brown spots and skin tone is getting even and smooth.  </li>
            <li> so it’s important to use sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The best serum I have ever purchased and I have tried a few.</li>
            <li> I love the fresh feeling I get with this product.</li>
            <li> Knowing its healthy and organic and truly smells like I am using fresh oranges on my skin.</li>
            <li> I want to stock up on this product because when something works, I don&#x27;t want to take a chance that it isn&#x27;t available anymore.</li>
            <li> like how it:&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs very well into the skin&lt;br /&gt;Has a nice orange smell to it</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the positives:  my skin is evening out and when the light hits it from the side, it looks smoother.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy consistency of product and appreciate ingredients at an affordable cost.</li>
            <li> The great reviews are the reasons for my purchase and i am looking forward to seeing the future results!</li>
            <li> I have waited a while to write this review (a month actually) just to make sure I gave it a good chance.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for couple weeks, so far do good.</li>
            <li> So far it look good, no complaints, no results yet either</li>
            <li> This has been a good product so far.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> To be clear, while I received this product for free, I am in no way obligated to give it a good review, nor am I being compensated to write this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far, so good.</li>
            <li> At age 82, even though I have good young looking skin, I need all the help I can get and this product did help plump out my skin and make it smooth.  </li>
            <li> So far It seems to be good</li>
            <li> Since I wrote my original review, I have had a chance to try a lot of competing products, and have experienced a lot of different types of dispensers.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way – what an AWESOME product and a great price point compared with mainstream products.</li>
            <li> However I do not see any significant results.  </li>
            <li> But first week to try it&#x27;s was ok.</li>
            <li> Over all a simple successful purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two weeks of use, there is visible softening of creases/wrinkles at the corner of my eyes.</li>
            <li> I did receive this for free to review, and I can honestly say I will definitely continue to use this product and purchase more when my sample runs out.</li>
            <li> Great antioxidant serum, didn&#x27;t cause breakouts and it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Product works, but takes time and is well worth it!</li>
            <li> My usual concern (skin sensitivity) was quickly squashed because this stuff makes my face feel great, no allergic reactions of any kind.  </li>
            <li> My usual concern (skin sensitivity) was quickly squashed because this stuff makes my face feel great, no allergic reactions of any kind.  </li>
            <li> I have huge pores &amp; I think they are getting smaller by using this product, but it still hadn&#x27;t reached the optimum result i wanted yet.</li>
            <li> and I felt comfortable going to the super market without putting on makeup..</li>
            <li> The formula is light weight and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> Goes on silky smooth and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Received quickly and am enjoying the product - thanks!</li>
            <li> Her skin looks fresh and this has lightened the fine lines.  </li>
            <li> In summary, this product is not bad but it is also nothing special.</li>
            <li> I really appreciated the follow-up by Petunia Skincare to be sure their product met my expectations.</li>
            <li> I am even trying it on the tops of my hands to see if it will have the same good results as on my face.</li>
            <li> I love it, thank you so much</li>
            <li> My wrinkles around my eyes also filled in, I could smile and the lines weren’t as noticeable..</li>
            <li> To top it off it&#x27;s reasonably priced</li>
            <li> Have not been able to tell much of a difference yet.</li>
            <li> I use this product twice daily, mostly around my eyes but lightly elsewhere, had no bad reaction to it , I use it mostly to maintain or prevent crows feet, I like the product and will continue using it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad and it&#x27;s not medicinal.  </li>
            <li> I was lucky to be selected to try the product for free in exchange of honest feedback – and I will definitely purchase the product again!</li>
            <li> but so far it goes on smoothly but will do an update when I&#x27;ve had more time to see how it&#x27;s going to affect my skin.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I was worried that the mild exfoliating effect might increase the flakiness of the psoriatic patches or otherwise irritate them, but it hasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> there is some reaction to make you feel something is working, this product is ultra mild.</li>
            <li> I received my order quickly and have also received emails that included additional tips and benefits of using Vitamin C serum.  </li>
            <li> I like the mild smell</li>
            <li> Lovely product, easy to apply, fast absorbing, leaves no residue, works well under moisturizer and makeup.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a transgendered woman, age 64, and I have found this serum to be extraordinary.</li>
            <li> This is still moisturizing, but it dries quickly and does not interfere with the application of makeup.  </li>
            <li> I like how quickly it absorbs (as well as the performance under makeup).  </li>
            <li> also I feel mild burning sensation on my face every time  using it .</li>
            <li> Great active ingredients make it so effective, and much more reasonably priced than similar products.</li>
            <li> It is bright orange, which is kind of unique, but it disappears into the skin right after being applied and leaves a dewy, smooth feeling behind.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast too!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several weeks and have been very pleased.  </li>
            <li> Amazing product actually works and is worth the price!</li>
            <li> But now you are aware, in case this is important to you.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But now you are aware, in case this is important to you.)  </li>
            <li> The fine lines have diminished around my eyes and my entire face is much more healthy .Wonderful product ,thanks</li>
            <li> The serum I put on my hand absorbed quickly and without any greasy residue and did not irritate or burn my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have good normal/sometimes slightly dry skin.</li>
            <li> The serum is not sticky &amp; absorbed quickly into my skin.</li>
            <li> At first I started getting zits but not too many, they cleared up fast</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know if this is a good product, but did notice these reviewers have all reviewed several of the exact same products, which is a strong indication they are planted reviews by people paid to leave positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Super fast delivery!!</li>
            <li> highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!-it does seem to protect my face from environment, and keeps it SUPER soft.</li>
            <li> There are so many Vitamin C serums sold online, so it&#x27;s really hard to dig through and find a good one.  </li>
            <li> Although this product is helpful in moisturizing and it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin, I have experienced no noticeable improvement in my uneven skin tone.  </li>
            <li> My pores look smaller - they weren&#x27;t huge to begin with, but they look better.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and absorbs really well with the derma roller.</li>
            <li> A couple of things I like about the company as a whole is that you get a free e-book that talks to you about beauty regimens, I received a follow up email to give me some tips on using their product</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few months now, and it&#x27;s great for my skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to leave feedback until I&#x27;ve had some time with the product, so that I can offer useful feedback.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several of these but by no means do I consider myself any kind of skin care expert.  </li>
            <li> Nothing else compares for that purpose, in my own personal experience, and the progesterone has the added advantage of protecting one from cancer and strengthening the bones.</li>
            <li> The consistency is compared to a fresh orange juice.</li>
            <li> Immediate success</li>
            <li> Powerful antioxidant.</li>
            <li> Although I just started to use it, it is non-irritating to my skin and is quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li> By far one of my favorite skin care products.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin soft, and gently takes off the outer layer of skin, giving my skin a nice fresh look.  </li>
            <li> It is lightweight, powerful and efficient.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it may work better if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> But, this seems to be a useful product.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more very soon :)</li>
            <li> Eventually I grew skeptical of everything I see on Amazon because I always see 5 star rating on every product I bought which never worked on me and it seemed like lots of companies write good reviews themselves to make them look good.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for putting on immediately afterwards, as it protects my skin with a thin barrier.</li>
            <li> product is a golden brown color and is translucent-to-opaque.  </li>
            <li> I have been pleased so far.  </li>
            <li> The &#x27;serum&#x27; does not get absorbed into skin as stated.</li>
            <li> Hence that is how you know it is not being absorbed.</li>
            <li> It is worth the try!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, gives my old skin a glow.</li>
            <li> This serum is by far one of my favorites if not my favorite.</li>
            <li> So far I love the results.</li>
            <li> It also arrived super fast to my mailbox!</li>
            <li> I did purchase it because the other rating were good.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and non-greasy, and absorbs right into the skin.</li>
            <li> Brown skin flakes combine with the surum and rub right off.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference right away.</li>
            <li> You feel it right away.</li>
            <li> Although I did receive this product for free, that does not mean that my review is biased.</li>
            <li> It is absorbed quickly, not sticky, leaves a good feeling on the face.  </li>
            <li> I am in my 30&#x27;s, have very sensitive, clog-prone skin, but I gave this a fair shot and even patch tested it on one area to see if it was different than an area without it.</li>
            <li> Overall, acne scars are still noticeable upon further inspection, but have nicely faded to blend better with the surrounding skin.</li>
            <li> The smell of the serum is also pleasant (kind of an orange-y smell) and a little bit of serum goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I am 43 years old, and although I do have good skin, I had noticed some discoloration on my cheeks and above my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> The serum is a little bit tacky at first, but dries to a nice smooth, finish.  </li>
            <li> Been using this for approximately 2 weeks now, it feels nice on skin, not too sticky, not oily, no unpleasant scent, glides nicely on skin and absorbs quite fast.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin very soft and smooth under makeup.</li>
            <li> The dullness most apparent on my cheeks and chin is gone and the skin is more even on my entire face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 60&#x27;s, have a couple light colored age spots on my face, don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, don&#x27;t have many deep wrinkles, but I  have plenty of fine lines &amp; fine wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I definitely appreciated this product it does work quickly and be prepared to stay hydrated and moisturizer as the skin Renewal and repair starts within the first use.</li>
            <li> Absorbs very fast.  </li>
            <li> Then, as we got older, we would go to different beauty and makeup stories to buy our own goops to try out.  </li>
            <li> Seems to help my 57-year old skin be more vibrant looking, and smoother looking/softer feeling.  </li>
            <li> Great serum for dull skin.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a product that does all this at an affordable price, so I am so happy to have found this.</li>
            <li> This vitamin c serum has made my skin extremely soft to touch and the fine lines around my eyes have diminished drastically to the point when I smile you can&#x27;t really see the lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Really work well and defiantly would purchase again!</li>
            <li> Also, the tiny blackheads on my nose seemed to have disappeared for the most part.</li>
            <li> Within the first week of use, I noticed an improvement in my complexion.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel at all oily and is readily absorbed when gently massaged into the skin&amp;mdash;and a drop or two goes</li>
            <li> and I will most likely buy it again when my bottle runs out.  </li>
            <li> I cannot handle most American brands and clearing my acne was a nightmare.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, it&#x27;s a very GRADUAL process so don&#x27;t expect results over night!</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it has all natural ingredients and it is paraben free.</li>
            <li> Skin feels soft, radiant and smooth.</li>
            <li> Keep using it, hope it work very well!</li>
            <li> It really works!  </li>
            <li> couple of months ago, I received an email from a lady at Petunia Skincare asking if I would be interested in trying one of their products.  </li>
            <li> I emailed her back that I would be glad to try out her product and received it a couple of days</li>
            <li> Love and regret that I have not learned about this serum earlier.</li>
            <li> The stuff really works!</li>
            <li> I love to try different brands.</li>
            <li> My entire skin on my face is more even and tighter.</li>
            <li> A lot of serums are pretty sticky and/or are too lightweight to feel like they are doing anything.</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more radiant, smaller pores and smoother skin.</li>
            <li> I started seeing results the first week of use.</li>
            <li> The first week my skin soaked in the serum.</li>
            <li> Just say what the product really is!</li>
            <li> I will continue to use both products and will update when I have more solid results to report.  </li>
            <li> , I bet I&#x27;ll be checking out their whole line!  </li>
            <li> I find it funny that it took longer to process my order then shipping it.</li>
            <li> couple of weeks ago, I began considering trying a serum for the first time, and had been researching them online.  </li>
            <li> I do use a small bit more than the pea-sized amount recommended on the bottle/box, but nota lot more.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s exactly what I did.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s exactly what I did.  </li>
            <li> shipping on exactly as given.</li>
            <li> I attribute this to the balance of several ingredient working together to give you a more healthy overall skin.</li>
            <li> It smells slightly bitter, but not in a nice citrus-y way.</li>
            <li> After a week more co workers asked what I was doing different..</li>
            <li> I received this much more quickly than I expected to...</li>
            <li> I used this product during the day over my whole face and a retinol at night, and the combination seemed to be the right mix for me..</li>
            <li> product has great ingredients, which the manufacturer has accurately and completely listed here on this product page--which far too few companies bother to do for their cosmetics.</li>
            <li> but my fine lines are somewhat diminished and my skin has a refreshing brigthness that I&#x27;ve been missing.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; is quite weird, at first it remember me some kind of machine oil, after some time I thought it rather be kind of avocado smell or any plant o root.</li>
            <li> Beyond the cost comparison, the product also contains Hyaluronic Acid and other goodies for your skin and has a slight pleasant refreshing citrus/orange scent.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product a few weeks now, so far it is great.</li>
            <li> I love the Petunia Skincare Professional Vitamin C Serum because it is 98% natural and not tested on animals – and contains no parabens, no sulfates, no alcohol – and no gluten.</li>
            <li> I feel like this is the only product I&#x27;ve ever bought on Amazon that costs over $20, have really good reviews and ratings and ACTUALLY WORKED!</li>
            <li> Saw a marked reduction in neck area right away after just a week!</li>
            <li> The best part is it&#x27;s cheaper than high end brand names and does the same job if not better.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to use the serum around the eyes--one of the first and heaviest areas for skin to age--</li>
            <li> One other key ingredient to a great skin care regimen is Vitamin A</li>
            <li> Exfoliates and hydrates the dry, dehydrated skin for a more moisturized and plumped skin.</li>
            <li> it made it super soft and glowing.</li>
            <li> A lot of my friends have complimented me and asked me what did I do, because my skin is now super soft, plump and glowing.</li>
            <li> After using this, my face has certainly feel a lot softer and tighter.</li>
            <li> Then I use pure coco butter.</li>
            <li> It does also seem to lessen the appearance of those fine facial wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I bought other Vitamin C products in the past but this is the best value for the money.  </li>
            <li> The Mad Hippie used to absorb beautifully and leave my face smooth and matte.</li>
            <li> and I already have an amazing glow the skin on my neck and decollete seem is a little firmer.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s just say that, in the last couple of months, I have become a huge fan of Petunia Skincare products.  </li>
            <li> Have not seen much difference but will perservere till this bottle is gone.</li>
            <li> Using only this product after a couple weeks at one time a day I have a smooth complexion, no blackheads.</li>
            <li> I really am liking the way this product has made my skin look and feel, and it has also reduced redness as well.</li>
            <li> Provides antioxidant protection from free radicals end environmental damage such as the sun, pollution, and smoke.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for the smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for the smell.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much change in a couple light-colored age spots on my face, but  the spot on my hand is much smoother now...</li>
            <li> most of its rough texture is gone.</li>
            <li> Still using this twice a day and really like the way my skin feels.  </li>
            <li> It is really greasy on my face and does not brighten it at all.  </li>
            <li> This appears to be a very stable form of vitamin c which I appreciate.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t too noticeable unless you would come really close to my eye</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> They provide real customer service.  </li>
            <li> This serum has improved my skins texture a lot and made it really glow.</li>
            <li> but I also felt like the serum was really sticky on my face.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference otherwise.</li>
            <li> It is also cruelty free, made in the USA, and has a 100% money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> My mom uses this in the morning before she puts on her makeup and feels it really makes a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My mom uses this in the morning before she puts on her makeup and feels it really makes a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has helped fade my hyperpigmentation, and I wake up with a much brighter completion when I use this.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smoother, looks and feels so young and fresh.</li>
            <li> Nothing really</li>
            <li> I actually really like this serum.</li>
            <li> My daughter recommended this product and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> It really hydrate our skin.</li>
            <li> and it really seems to be working.  </li>
            <li> This really helped me decide that I should purchase and try it out for myself.  </li>
            <li> and I think doing it at night and morning was too much for me.  </li>
            <li> and I just gently rolled it over my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have rosacea and didn&#x27;t really think this roller and</li>
            <li> and it is very soothing.</li>
            <li> Between too much sun exposure and chemotherapy,  my face and neck are really beginning to show signs of aging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried products like proactiv and acne.org before and none of them ever really stopped me from getting acne or treated acne scars.</li>
            <li> serum is very silky and soothing to the skin.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t need a lot of this to cover your whole face.  </li>
            <li> The eyedropper provided with the serum is a convenient way to dispense it without getting too much.  </li>
            <li> time, I believe the hyaluronic acid is starting to exert an effect; my forehead is particularly smooth these days.  </li>
            <li> Over time, I believe the hyaluronic acid is starting to exert an effect; my forehead is particularly smooth these days.  </li>
            <li> If you put another product on after applying the &#x27;serum&#x27;, then the serum becomes very watery all over again.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Product works really well.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it does everything it says it will.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 66 years old, and thankfully don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, but it is working on those I do have around my eyes and upper lip.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unsure of:&lt;br /&gt;Whether or not the pH level is low enough for the product to be effective.</li>
            <li> Upon applying,  the skin felt being slightly stretched or somewhat dry but the effect is good after continued use.  </li>
            <li> had had some breakouts recently, and those healed pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> I had had some breakouts recently, and those healed pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> I ordered 2 bottles so my face should be back to its original color in a matter of months.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel it made my skin any worse though, and that&#x27;s really saying something because I do clog easily and react to many things.</li>
            <li> What made me want to buy this serum is mainly because the seller is very informative on its product</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say with 100% certainty that this product was responsible for the quick healing, but that is similar to one of the benefits listed on the product page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say with 100% certainty that this product was responsible for the quick healing, but that is similar to one of the benefits listed on the product page.  </li>
            <li> The only real drawback is that this serum feels really sticky for quiet awhile so its not that comfortable when you first apply.</li>
            <li> I used to feel the oils in my skin piling on my face after a full day, and if I didn&#x27;t use Apricot Scrub every day to exfoliate, my skin felt &#x27;cakey&#x27; even after washing with regular facewash.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first one I received is the Professional Vitamin C Serum.  </li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t normally get compliments on my skin.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.um is a convenient way to dispense it without getting too much.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t sting or irritate my skin, and I have pretty sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s quite sticky and doesn&#x27;t dry smooth at all.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C serum is similar to the many different brands being sold.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I had about those Vitamin C&#x27;s was that they oxidized too quickly and stung my face (no redness though)</li>
            <li> I purchased this product mainly for my wife</li>
            <li> As I am an older now with sun damaged skin, this product has given me softer skin already.</li>
            <li> I waited a while before reviewing because with my older skin, it took a bit to notice change.</li>
            <li> But lucky for me, I have been researching different products that claim to rejuvenate and refresh aging skin and in that search I came across a wonderfully worthy company that makes several rejuevenating products.  </li>
            <li> However, I took the plunge and so far, the results seem positive.  </li>
            <li> My high expectations for this product were based it&#x27;s claims and rave reviews.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> followed with a lip balm that has a high level of sunscreen.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kathryn B.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for this purpose.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the product.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it and the ProDermis Retinol night cream.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend both product and Petunia.</li>
            <li> Made my skin nice and soft but as far as removing spots from previous acne, it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Sure, the serum softened it up a little after application...</li>
            <li> the serum would do anything to help with that; I was mostly hoping for improvement in the appearance of my pores and the little wrinkles that I blame on my husband.</li>
            <li> In general I didn&#x27;t stay interested in it. .</li>
            <li> I am really liking this so far.  </li>
            <li> At 45, I have old lady hands: wrinkled with practically polka dot age spots, and they are very dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will update my review after some long term use and will reserve final judgment of the product after I have used for a greater period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried many skin care products hoping to find a product that doesn&#x27;t irritate and also improves my uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> After one month of use, I feel like I can see a difference where lines are starting to set on my forehead and smile lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Success enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t use vitamin serums in my beauty regiment but after trying out this serum</li>
            <li> /&gt;It leaves my skin smooth, soft and glowing all day long.</li>
            <li> Just like with the first product, these two products are used daily by myself and my mother (now she uses my stuff haha).  </li>
            <li> Just like with the first product, these two products are used daily by myself and my mother (now she uses my stuff haha).  </li>
            <li> My skin type is normal and this serum dryed my face</li>
            <li> totally worth to try, this was actually a gift one of my friends sent to me.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t normally get compliments on my skin.)  </li>
            <li> Smooth as it goes in…I really feel that the wrinkles are much less noticeable  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product to help lighten the area above my upper lip and minimize the fine lines there.</li>
            <li> serum is light orange in color, due to all the antioxidants it has in it, for example beta carotene, and it has a citrusy smell to it.</li>
            <li> GOES ON SMOOTH AND DOES NOT BURN LIKE SOME OF THE OTHER PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> It kind of left a film over my skin that could be rubbed off into little balls with my fingertip.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are a product that I definitely recommend you give a try to - and remember what I said above, they are so sure that  you will love their product that they offer a 100% money back guarantee if you are not happy.r, which makes a mess if you&#x27;re just putting it on your finger to spread on your face</li>
            <li> Just a heads up it will take most likely over 30min to just dry completely and feel normal but it does get there.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t really live here without sun affecting your skin, even if you jump through hoops to keep it protected.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t stop you from getting new acne because I still get acne</li>
            <li> Usually when vit C is applied there is mild stinging (not unpleasant)</li>
            <li> In short, if you are looking to try a Vit-C serum, this is the one to try ... if it works for you, you will be hooked (and if it does not, I seriously doubt other brand will do better).</li>
            <li> and I have to say the results are so amazing that I have started using the Serum on my neck and on a couple of sun spots on my arm, which I only started a few days ago and already see a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this products is fantastic, especially considering how affordable it is.</li>
            <li> The sun damage, from being in the sun too much when I was younger, has improved so much I am not self-conscience anymore.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This product made my skin very soft and I do notice a sunspot on my nose getting lighter.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li> Fine line wrinkles are definitely smoothed and your skin with feel fresh and firm.</li>
            <li> I also like that I support a new, innovative, small business – as I always opt to do this when I can.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s packed with the most effective ingredients for half the price of more expensive (and often less optimal) products.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and after using the first bottle,  she has seen big difference.  </li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend this highly affective face serum!!</li>
            <li> Smells great and doesn&#x27;t interfere negatively with my other products and does not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> The price seems to be in line with other similar products yet it delivers so much more.</li>
            <li> so I still top off this serum with my usual Environ Vitamin A products.</li>
            <li> I was using this by itself for the first several days I had it</li>
            <li> After first used, I can see a different in my skin.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure if the pH level of this serum is appropriate.</li>
            <li> My skin is totally free of any dark spots.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to apply the Vitamin C Serum, it is dispensed with an eyedropper and a little goes</li>
            <li> A single pea-sized drop on the palm of your hand will be enough for your entire face, and the results start showing up very quickly, even at the first application.</li>
            <li> ; came into my mind - if all these years of trying new stuff has paid off so far, why change what I&#x27;m doing?  </li>
            <li> I should have started using this ten years ago, but I&#x27;m doing it now and based on my positive experience with Petunias brand</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was above average and left my skin feeling nice without the sting.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I never finished off the product and it crystalized after maybe 2 months, which I would assume would happen with any similar product, especially something like Vit C which deteriorates rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I am on my third bottle; I certainly would recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> My skin definitely has a more youthful appearance, is a little firmer &amp; looks brighter.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad because I can hardly see the scar now.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions clearly posted on this product page within the product description.</li>
            <li> I can see a difference in my skin, it does look healthier and clear.  </li>
            <li> If someone else knows, please clear up my confusion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves skin with a soft supple firmness.</li>
            <li> soft, moisturized and the blemishes that I did have are now gone.  </li>
            <li> I got breakouts after using this product, mine is a sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My pores became smaller, and my skin was much softer to the touch.</li>
            <li> So far, about 1 month, this serum is working to keep my skin soft.</li>
            <li> It smells like honey and old towels to me....</li>
            <li> It smells like honey and old towels to me....</li>
            <li> and i can feel it is so natural.</li>
            <li> I have been using Petunia Skincare Anti-Aging Serum for about three weeks now and have been pleasantly surprised by the results.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft and moist, and it is not sticky or tacky like some serums.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m liking the experience.  </li>
            <li> This has really helped me brighten my facial skin.</li>
            <li> They have lightened considerably.</li>
            <li> So far, there has been no change at all.  </li>
            <li> I have soft, acne-free skin before I used this.  </li>
            <li> Skin felt soft and nourished throughout the day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m 75 years young and have used 1 bottle of  Vitamin C Serum.  </li>
            <li> My neck is 66 yrs old and looks 55.</li>
            <li> This serum is 100% natural, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about putting chemicals or parabens on your face</li>
            <li> Ever since we were young, my sister and I have always played around with skincare products.  </li>
            <li> As I read that email, the old adage &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t fix what ain&#x27;t broke&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I shopped around for a serum made with all natural ingredients</li>
            <li> I regularly use sunblock and all sorts of lotions and overnight creams, but nothing really seems to protect the skin AND</li>
            <li> &gt; A very unease sensation follows this physical reaction.</li>
            <li> Nothing, no reaction -- which makes me wonder if there are enough actives to really do anything in the product.  </li>
            <li> It almost made my skin soft, and my gf has even started using it.</li>
            <li> so much I use it daily.</li>
            <li> So far I like this serum.</li>
            <li> It helps to keep my skin soft and youthful looking.</li>
            <li> however, this product did not get rid of my wrinkles completely</li>
            <li> I’ve just recently purchased Shiseido’s sunscreen and now I can really see the vitamin c lightening the spots..</li>
            <li> I just started using it a couple weeks ago and so far it&#x27;s helping somewhat.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I just got an old bottle.</li>
            <li> and I really notice the difference, especially with age spots.  </li>
            <li> My skin very challenged by years and years and years in sun and low humidity.  </li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive</li>
            <li> how soft my face feels.  </li>
            <li> I am 62 years old and looking to keep</li>
            <li> ) Does not cause an allergic reaction (I have sensitive</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait several weeks before writing my review because I didn&#x27;t want to rave about something that was in my head or something I wasn&#x27;t really seeing.  </li>
            <li> When you apply it around your eyes, you only need to take it to your cheeck bone, that is far enough, it&#x27;ll get absorbed, that is what my dermatologist told me....and quite frankly this has hyaluronic acid in it, not something you want to put close to the eye either.  </li>
            <li> i have always looked old for my age, even as a teenager, and now at age 19 i look 25.</li>
            <li> Another thing I have REALLY sensitive skin, and I have no trouble using this product at all, it doesn&#x27;t sting, itchy, or cause redness/drying effect.</li>
            <li> and Im a 40 yr old man.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These are a product that I definitely recommend you give a try to - and remember what I said above, they are so sure that  you will love their product that they offer a 100% money back guarantee if you are not happy.</li>
            <li> I kept this in a cool, dark environment - not in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I was waiting for a long term positive result and there was none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised about is that within the first two days, my acne began clearing up and my pores starting looking a wee bit smaller.</li>
            <li> On the one hand, it may be necessary because this is pretty thin in consistency (more liquid-like and not so gel-like).  </li>
            <li> here again, other serum felt &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; while this one does not have that stickiness feel but is rapidly absorbed by your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lots of wonderful reviews here, maybe it works for them but no long term effect for me, plus it&#x27;s a little expensive.  </li>
            <li> Also I had some dark spots on both sides of my face which are becoming much lighter and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I had also some dark spots on my face which are becoming much lighter and less</li>
            <li> I have used other vitamin C serum and this one is ok compared to other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m giving 5 star rating for this product because this is the only product that actually worked for the first time with my acne scar.</li>
            <li> and it is a noticeable fade, not slight.....</li>
            <li> Since I am an older adult I do not expect miracles but the roller and serum combined with my usual moisturizer have done more than any other products I have used.  </li>
            <li> I appreciate the fact that I only have to allow this serum to dry on my skin for five minutes--versus twenty minutes for other wrinkle-prevention products I&#x27;ve experimented with--before applying a moisturizer on top of it.</li>
            <li> When I stopped, my skin went back normal.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to sound gross, but within days, I was seeing a lot of old dried out skin appear when I shaved or just washed my face.</li>
            <li> My skin pores look much tighter, the fine lines seem to have decreased.  </li>
            <li> I have always had a problem with large pores in the nose area, but with regular use this essentially erased them.  </li>
            <li> and I will update this review if there is any new developments but for me personally I may not be the target for this product.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and my skin is baby soft with no dry spots.</li>
            <li> I did receive free or deeply discounted product from Petunia Skincare and their PR firm for the purpose of testing.  </li>
            <li> and I am sure that I look at least 10 years younger.</li>
            <li> so I expected this to be a bit harsh, like most Vitamin C serums can be.</li>
            <li> This really dried my face and turned rancid quickly.</li>
            <li> I will update if there are any major changes or results.</li>
            <li> , my skin was firmer and my fine lines were hardly visible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it morning and night for three weeks thus far, so am not surprised I don&#x27;t see much difference in that area.</li>
            <li> The company may send you Email for the first month after a first purchase (asking to rate and providing tips)  - amongst the recommendations the use of a skin moisturizer as Vit-C may dry your skin a little.</li>
            <li> I have no fine lines and pretty much look the same as I used to when I was 19 (but</li>
            <li> I am not a huge fan of the smell, it smells like oranges and other citrus fruits, my mother thinks the smell is refreshing.</li>
            <li> I use the serum every other night on sensitive areas of my face (under eyes, side nose, eye lids) and the next morning those areas are evidently rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> I noticed lightening of spots and fine lines after only a few applications!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product claims to lighten dark spots and sunspots, and I find this to be fairly true.. meaning that my spots have not completely disappeared.. but they are not as visible as before, and I think this is partly due to me forgetting to put on sunscreen for the first couple months.</li>
            <li> Since you get a rather large amount of this in the bottle, expect it to last a long time.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m old enough to have started the wrinkling process, and I can speak to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far skin feels softer, pores seem a bit smaller, would update review as I go along...</li>
            <li> four years younger, when we would go into mom&#x27;s bathroom (of course, when she was busy elsewhere in the house) and pretend we were her, putting all kinds of goop on our faces.  </li>
            <li> Supposedly, this serum should last without refrigeration, which is why it surprised me that  things were growing in my bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only on my early 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I think this may just be the natural smell and color of the ingredients when mixed together.  </li>
            <li> While I found an acne medicine that finally worked for me, I was having troubles using my old cleanser (Murad) because of the acids in my acne medicine and the acids in my cleanser.</li>
            <li> But if they want a review for about one month&#x27;s use, I would say I see no detectable changes for the better or worse.</li>
            <li> I am always hesitant and even skeptical when trying anything new that comes into contact with my skin, but I can confidently recommend it to others.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve honestly cried so many times because of my horrible skin</li>
            <li> I am a 45 year old female, and my mother, who sees me often, asked what I was doing differently that my skin looked</li>
            <li> My skin is usually not dry, but I do believe a moisturizer would in the sunny months when I have to wear sunscreen.</li>
            <li> They quickly rushed the product out to me (one was actually delivered from the USPS on a Sunday) and within a few days I was noticing a big difference.  </li>
            <li> They quickly rushed the product out to me (one was actually delivered from the USPS on a Sunday) and within a few days I was noticing a big difference.  </li>
            <li> Does not dry the skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;The less positive: I&#x27;m not noticing a change in the age spots at all, on either hands or face.</li>
            <li> When you first open the bottle, the smell is very citrusy (obviously...) and the consistency is sort of thick, not runny.  </li>
            <li> will say, I am less enamored of the eyedropper than I was when I first received this product last year.  </li>
            <li> There is a slight stickiness at first, and then when it dries (directions say to wait 5 minutes before applying your usual face products), you have very supple, soft skin.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t personally report any amazingly noticeable difference in eliminating my existing wrinkles while using this product, but I also did not notice my skin getting worse, and at my age, no new, bad news translates to good news.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Effectiveness: First off, I have to let you all know that I do not rely on one product only  but usually apply this product for the first days of the week (Monday to Wednesday) and other by the second 1/2.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t really detect an odor, unlike other brand that range in smell from good to bad.  </li>
            <li> form of vitamin c (MAP) is more stable than other commonly used forms, which means the serum will last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, and live in Southwest Florida, so I can&#x27;t use anything remotely lotion-y or oily on my face.</li>
            <li> I have to say that after using the serum for over a month, my skin looks much healthier, smoother, and less puffy.</li>
            <li> Like the spots on my face, it hasn&#x27;t changed much in color, maybe slightly lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a slight odor, but I don&#x27;t really have an opinion about the odor.  </li>
            <li> I am 65 years old and although I&#x27;m told I look very young for my age, I definitely have lines and wrinkles I would like to see less of not to mention a small sunspot right under my eye.  </li>
            <li> So far I am not having problems with really dry skin and it helps with skin problems, such as scars, etc.  </li>
            <li> First thing is my skin feels very tight as soon as it drys on my face.  </li>
            <li> Dealing with acne and hyper pigmentation pretty much all of my life, it was hard to find products that won&#x27;t continue to break me out, but will help me in other ways that I need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The texture and smell don&#x27;t offend me at all, but the citrus may be a little bit much for my skin, personally, which wouldn&#x27;t be the fault of the company</li>
            <li> First off, my skin: I have uneven, somewhat dry skin without acne</li>
            <li> I used it a few days and misplaced it and then forgot about it since i have so many other</li>
            <li> I got it free from a Reddit code and was a little skeptical at first.  </li>
            <li> The very last portion of was pretty dense, and hard to get out.</li>
            <li> perhaps I&#x27;m expecting too much, not sure what to look for, but nothing looks any different.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few seconds skin will feel dry and ready for the next steps...</li>
            <li> Also, idiot me told myself, the higher the price, the better.  </li>
            <li> it seems to agree with my skin very well my skin feels softer and a little brighter !  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants to give their skin a little &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes my facial skin glow and very soft even with a few days use</li>
            <li> only complaint with this product is that the writing on the bottle label is too small for me to read without a jeweler&#x27;s loupe, but the images here on the Amazon page are easy enough to read when enlarged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still not sure if this has any real use ..</li>
            <li> I am not able to use straight vitamin C serum</li>
            <li> I have not used this long enough to rate the benefits.  </li>
            <li> One of the things I like is, you don&#x27;t have to use big amounts of product, it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice any results</li>
            <li> So far, it looks like the serum does slightly heal my skin, and my face shows some improvement.</li>
            <li> I have seen dramatic results in only a few weeks of use, skin is clearer, brighter and softer :)</li>
            <li> My skin appears less dry, younger and alive.</li>
            <li> Non have shown such dramatic results so quick.</li>

            <li> so I only use it every other day.</li>
            <li> I worked it into my existing beauty regimen a couple weeks ago, started with just a little application in the evening followed by a deep moisturizer and then gradually added a second application in the morning- again followed by moisturizer .</li>
            <li> I applied after I cleansed my face, before my other skincare products and left it absorb for about 15mins.</li>
            <li> and my face has not been dry at all.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> But as the day went on, my skin still felt dry.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry...</li>
            <li> apply the serum after I wash my face and allow it to dry before adding my moisturizer/spf or my night cream over the top.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this serum hydrates my dry skin,&lt;br /&gt;without</li>
            <li> My skin  is hydrated and doesn&#x27;t dry out from wearing make up.  </li>
            <li> It is non-sticky, but you have to wait for it to dry.</li>
            <li> Once a week I use on my chest and let dry.</li>
            <li> I just apply it, wait for it to dry, add my blush, rest of my eye makeup and go.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday because I&#x27;ve been having trouble with my hormonal acne lately (thanks to an IUD)</li>
            <li> I also use other products so it&#x27;s hard to tell which product is producing certain results.</li>
            <li> Some are good  and some are plain bad but</li>
            <li> In comparison my Agave Oil Bottle doesn&#x27;t have a single crack</li>
            <li> an average exfoliant with simple ingredients</li>
            <li> The dark spots around my nose definitely faded.</li>
            <li> I only wanted the blemishes and dark spots gone but nothing happened.  </li>
            <li> Cannot tell about fading dark spots but definitely have noticed in skin texture.</li>
            <li> (I spent a long time working in a biochemistry lab in grad school</li>
            <li> (I spent a long time working in a biochemistry lab in grad school</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m getting older, I&#x27;m afraid to stop playing with all of these skincare products (haha),</li>
            <li> You know.. when you initially put the product on, your skin feels tight and dry as can be.</li>
            <li> my skin typically has only responded to Korean products.</li>
            <li> However, around the second month I owned it, it started developing white small growths inside the dropper and around the bottom of the bottle.</li>
            <li> the past I&#x27;ve tried sooo many expensive products to get rid of acne scars and none of them ever worked.</li>
            <li> This product has much less color than the last version.  </li>
            <li> This product has less of a scent than the last version.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because I have not used any similar products in the past, I can only comment on my results with this one in particular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get a very tight, sting-y feeling and usually it takes a pretty heavy moisturizer to make the sting go away, but when I applied the Vitamin C serum, it actually helped with that immediately.</li>
            <li> I have super-sensitive skin, and pushing 70, it&#x27;s also very dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a senior with very dry skin to boot</li>
            <li> I do wish that there was a different &amp;#34;applicator&amp;#34; - it&#x27;s a dropper, which makes a mess if you&#x27;re just putting it on your finger to spread on your face</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit, like a pea size that can be distributed all over your face.  </li>
            <li> but it seems to last a long time, you use very little.</li>
            <li> I noticed it went from not really having an effect to a gradual change after I did this.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re curious, try it yourself.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks, but I&#x27;ve already noticed that my pores have noticeably shrunk, and my skin is smoother and tighter.</li>
            <li> I have since used a few different brands of Vit C to compare with now.</li>
            <li> I have noticed over the last few years that my skin doesn&#x27;t have the brightness and vitality that it used to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using vitamin c serum for a few weeks</li>
            <li> After a few days of using this product one of my co workers actually told me my face looked radiant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the dark circles that were on the UPPER lids of my eyes going down to the bridge of my nose, are completely&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since this product was the only thing I was doing differently, that&#x27;s got to mean it&#x27;s working.  </li>
            <li> Since this product was the only thing I was doing differently, that&#x27;s got to mean it&#x27;s working.  </li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has an immediate effect of slightly smoothing and tightening the skin once it dries.  </li>
            <li> For the past 18 days, I&#x27;ve applied the serum once a day  to my face &amp; a rough, light-colored age spot on the back of my hand.</li>
            <li> My skin felt tight, sticky, and dry.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is wishful thinking or actual improvement, but my neck doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;crepe paper&amp;#34; look anymore.</li>
            <li> I have used other anti-aging products that never worked, but I have seen improvement with this Vitamin C serum.  </li>
            <li> I use this serum every other day with Retinal in between.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this along with my dermaroller every other day and ....</li>
            <li> A small amount is enough to apply to your face and neck..</li>
            <li> , I dropped it from a small height so be very fragile.</li>
            <li> like you do with some other products.</li>
            <li> AND there is a 100% money back guarantee if you are not satisfied with their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not confident enough to go out without foundation</li>
            <li> wrinkles and uneven tones away as long as I can.</li>
            <li> I can mix my other products with it.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, you basically have to use the dropper to put this in your hand before using your fingers to apply it to your face, and the product tends to run when you do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes away once I&#x27;ve layered other products onto it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a rule, I don&#x27;t usually review facial serums, despite receiving two or three requests a month from manufacturers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> Works well with all of my other products and did not cause any breakouts.</li>
            <li> Also, with this Petunia serum, I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes (for the better or worse) in my skin, where the Mad Hippie left me glowing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of spending money buying new products for my face that just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I also use other things on my face, like Vitamin K Capillary strengthening serum which contains oils, and under eye cream for dark circles.</li>
            <li> My skin felt softer and looked smoother with less wrinkles than the other hand.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed a bit less redness in my skin tone and even though it has been very cold, I&#x27;ve been using a lot of moisturizer on top of the serum</li>
            <li> but initially I will say that it does seem to work and least for making the skin smoother and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> My skin has dark spots.</li>
            <li> Lightens sun spots, dark spots, brown spots and discoloration.</li>
            <li> As for the dark spots from acne..</li>
            <li> I have brown spots and dark circles under my eyes</li>
            <li> I have had a scare that always was a dark spot on my face</li>
            <li> That is my only complaint.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any improvement with blemishes and dark sports around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It truly does lighten dark spots and softens skin.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the cap of my serum was secured with a strip of Parafilm</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the cap of my serum was secured with a strip of Parafilm</li>
            <li> I only had a few small areas but over of a period of about 3 weeks I have seen a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li> The dark spots on my face reduce in size.</li>
            <li> Not great for sensitive skin types.  </li>
            <li> and they responded promptly with the link to down load it.</li>
            <li> I remind this product hands down.</li>
            <li> I cannot say that the product is not good, just that I had &amp;#34;great expectations&amp;#34; about it because of Vit E and Hyluronic Acid, but sorry that I didn&#x27;t notice any special  change in my skin while I was using it for about three months maybe.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After a week or so, I did notice that the areas of my face where I had been using it, under the eyes and across my nose, started looking fresher and brighter and feeling less dried-out.  </li>
            <li> One bottle lasted me a month and a half to almost two months</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still translucent, but I would no longer call it &amp;#34;golden brown.&amp;#34;  There might be a tinge of color to it, but it is much less than before.  </li>
            <li> My hands as well look smoother and less wrinkled.  </li>
            <li> I used this every night and used about half dropper on my face.</li>
            <li> a pump.&lt;br /&gt;The serum itself has a slight herbal-medicinal scent.</li>
            <li> This serum is a bit cloudier, with a slightly pinkish-orangish hue.</li>
            <li> this serum penetrate on my uneven skin tone and dark spots i have on my face</li>
            <li> Adds a little redness to skin tone.  </li>
            <li> the immediate moment of applying the serum and for a little while</li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks of use I see little or no change.</li>
            <li> This serum is not worth the price!  </li>
            <li> As they say, a little dab will do ya.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over a week now, and I am already seeing results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I became a little discouraged.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s going to take a little patience to reverse it)</li>
            <li> I noticed immediately that my skin looked brighter and a little bit tighter.  </li>
            <li> Even the darkness, what little I had, under my eyes is lighter.  </li>
            <li> I put it on at night because its a little sticky</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fussy about aromas, and this one is slightly like citrus, and not strong at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, yes my skin did clear up but its not perfect, however it is to the point where I don&#x27;t need make-up where before I wouldn&#x27;t leave the house without a little.</li>
            <li> My bad acne has left me with hyper pigmentation that I&#x27;ve been trying to clear for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying all the reviews written for this product are genuine because I&#x27;m still a skeptical person, I believe that there are lots of companies writing fake reviews</li>
            <li> A waste of time and money</li>
            <li> This product claims to improve uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> This serum drastically changed the texture of my skin within just a few uses.</li>
            <li> When I was asked  to review Petunia Skincare Vitamin C Serum, I hesitated for a few days before accepting their offer.</li>
            <li> Rather than irritating the flaky patches, it actually has a soothing effect.  </li>
            <li> I then wait a few minutes and massage argan or jojoba oil or shea butter on those irritated areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I an still waiting on results for the uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> and it dried out my skin.  </li>
            <li> It lightened my skin, took out the uneven discoloration, lightened the skin around the eyes and made my face smoother.</li>
            <li> One bottle is a month use to me because I apply it everyday, morning and night before bed.  </li>
            <li> will update in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> After just a few uses</li>
            <li> I have been using it twice a day (morning and night) and noticed a difference after just a few days.</li>
            <li> I have been using for a few weeks now and it is delivering everything as promised.</li>
            <li> Waste of my $$.</li>
            <li> The few days I used it</li>
            <li> I use it over my face after washing, leave it on for a few minutes, then rub the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; skin off.</li>
            <li> It seems to me like the skin tightened up after a few days of use.  </li>
            <li> So this Vit C doesn&#x27;t feel too harsh.  </li>
            <li> but I did a double take seeing that the spelling and grammar rules were broken...</li>
            <li> I was using something from the dermatologist but decided against another round b/c of the concern of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> The tiny lines around my eyes are have decreased, as well as the sun damage on my face.....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any results as yet but after reading your tips it sounds like something I should be using everyday.</li>
            <li> You will see the results in matter of few days.  </li>
            <li> but I think I see a difference in my skin after a few weeks of using it.  </li>
            <li> within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it because there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any negative effects but no positive ones either.  </li>
            <li> Will keep it up and see if the wrinkles get less!</li>
            <li> It will likely take me 6+ months to use up this serum, and afterwards I&#x27;ll go back to Mad Hippie.</li>
            <li> serum is slightly viscous and has a very pale orange color, presumably from the beta carotene.  </li>
            <li> She wanted me to try it so bad, I didn&#x27;t believe it in the first place, but after applying to my skin every day before bedtime for a week, my skin dramatically changed since then.</li>
            <li> I applied a small drop to each age spot, each cheek, my forehead, nose &amp; chin, massaged it in &amp; finished by massaging in an upward motion for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> A little does a lot!  </li>
            <li> I was hoping that at least the sunspot would fade a little.  </li>
            <li> was a little unsure before I ordered I was using a nother product but was slowly creeping out of my price range</li>
            <li> A helpful tip from me is to use very little to avoid  stickiness.</li>
            <li> Am still using product and am still not sure</li>
            <li> I usually put this one before going to bed, after my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> small bottle of this serum was offered to me by Petunia Skincare for testing and unbiased review.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after several weeks of using it morning and night under my moisturizer, I don&#x27;t see any improvement in the condition of my skin.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t stink like some I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Not sure I understand what all the hype is about?  </li>
            <li> (Please note that hyaluronic acid usually comes from poultry processing, although there are some bacteria that produce it, as well.  </li>
            <li> (Please note that hyaluronic acid usually comes from poultry processing, although there are some bacteria that produce it, as well.  </li>
            <li> Not sure,</li>
            <li> I bought this Vtiamin C Serum and have been using it for the past month.</li>
            <li> but I have dry skin so hard to tell if it is worse or not.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but it definitely treated my acne scars and stupid red spots.</li>
            <li> Sometimes after I wash my face (I tend to SCRUB HARD to get the sunblock out of my pores)</li>
            <li> This serum is also made in the USA, which means you don&#x27;t have to fear potentially dangerous Chinese ingredients.</li>
            <li> What makes it harder is that there are fake reviews too.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 23 year old female with terrible, lifeless skin.</li>
            <li> I have had no allergies or even the slightest negative reactions from this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any immediate effects except a bit of tightening of my skin, which is an indication that this product is going to be firming and wrinkle/fine line-reducing, at least to a degree, from the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any immediate effects except a bit of tightening of my skin, which is an indication that this product is going to be firming and wrinkle/fine line-reducing, at least to a degree, from the beginning.  </li>
            <li> not my style at least.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is the texture -</li>
            <li> However, this product has been slowly fading them.</li>
            <li> I like how this serum is a thick serum rather than a watery serum.</li>
            <li> and I always wore foundation to school everyday to cover them up which probably made them worse.</li>
            <li> You have to try to see what I mean.</li>
            <li> I use this along with the Dermaroller---I could feel a difference with in a few usages and about two weeks into using I could see results!!</li>
            <li> I mean, how can a bunch of needles help my skin?  </li>
            <li> Sorry I do not have any pic to show before and after due to the fact I am on deployment.</li>
            <li> The results are slow and subtle (but I didn&#x27;t get all this skin damage overnight...</li>
            <li> I however did have a very small scar in my eyelid .. never listened to not putting things in my eyelids or under my eyes</li>
            <li> I was afraid at first because I&#x27;ve had bad, bad experiences with skin products (i have sensitive skin prone to break outs) and</li>
            <li> and I am serious about this, you should try it and see for yourself.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty disgusting thing to think about, and hard to explain, but that&#x27;s basically what happens.</li>
            <li> and I tried very hard to incorporate it into my routine and to make it work.</li>
            <li> But after a month I have to say it&#x27;s very hard for me to tell what it does.</li>
            <li> Dried my face like crazy.</li>
            <li> Worse than my face, though, is my hands.</li>
            <li> Neither product is irritating to my skin, does not cause redness or peeling.  </li>
            <li> I fell for all of the 5-star reviews and decided to try this serum when I ran out of my usual Vitamin C serum by Mad Hippie.</li>
            <li> I usually break out really bad during my cycle</li>
            <li> Amazon should monitor all the reviews and filter out fake ones.  </li>
            <li> I find it difficult to use with the dropper.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about using this, because nothing seems to work as they say it will, but I decided to try it, based on the reviews.  </li>
            <li> its smells kinda weird.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s unfair to write a review so soon.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with that.</li>
            <li> The fact is that it dried my skin something awful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cold</li>
            <li> I never have bad acne before</li>
            <li> product is not at all bad though.  </li>
            <li> (A cleanser I used before this with citrus gave me a bad rash)</li>
            <li> I have been quite disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a college student, I have a horrible skin and my face is infested with stupid acne and acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too terrible, but it is noticeable.</li>
            <li> Awful product, greasy &amp; sticky.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Still not sure if this has any real use .. i just tried it</li>
            <li> I have been using this product, especially on a spot of my skin with pigmentation for 3-4 weeks. So far, it looks like the serum does slightly heal my skin, and my face shows some improvement.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to leave feedback until I&#x27;ve had some time with the product, so that I can offer useful feedback.  That being said, I&#x27;ve been using this for just about a month.  My skin really looks the best it has looked in quite some time.  I am a 45 year old female, and my mother, who sees me often, asked what I was doing differently that my skin looked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you have it.  Buy this stuff and give it a couple of weeks.  I hope you have the same great results that I have.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C serum is similar to the many different brands being sold.  I have tried several of these but by no means do I consider myself any kind of skin care expert.  The bottle comes with an eye dropper for applying and the serum is an off-white color and I couldn&#x27;t really detect an odor, unlike other brand that range in smell from good to bad.  Like I do with all of these before putting on my face, I try this out on the top of one of my hands to see if there was any visible difference of the skin between both hands and to see if there was any skin irritation.  The serum I put on my hand absorbed quickly and without any greasy residue and did not irritate or burn my skin.  This seemed to work initially as well as other brands I have tried.  My skin felt softer and looked smoother with less wrinkles than the other hand.  My skin looked shiny and moisturized.  I am not one to say for any of these products create miracles but initially I will say that it does seem to work and least for making the skin smoother and moisturized.  I will update my review after some long term use and will reserve final judgment of the product after I have used for a greater period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Have been using for a month.  Have not seen much difference but will perservere till this bottle is gone.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Leaves skin with a soft supple firmness. Adds a little redness to skin tone.  Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> My face and  neck have a lot of troubles. I don&#x27;t understand why this has over 4 stars. When I stopped, my skin went back normal. This is suck!</li>
            <li> I use one drop of the serum and follow with a good moisturizer and sun screen twice a day and I can tell a difference.  I have fewer wrinkles and my skin seems to be firmer.  I have been using it for 3 weeks.  It is nice to be able to see a difference when a product is used.  Great product, shipped fast and great customer service.</li>
            <li> Am still using product and am still not sure but so far it goes on smoothly but will do an update when I&#x27;ve had more time to see how it&#x27;s going to affect my skin.</li>
            <li> Really work well and defiantly would purchase again!</li>
            <li> This is perfect.  I usually break out really bad during my cycle but I didn&#x27;t this month. I&#x27;m sure it is because of this product. I am ordering the entire set.</li>
            <li> vit c rocks for the skin...I&#x27;m on my 5th bottle and I love the results - doesn&#x27;t make me look like a movie star, but evens my complexion well</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and after using the first bottle,  she has seen big difference.  Her skin looks fresh and this has lightened the fine lines.  Upon applying,  the skin felt being slightly stretched or somewhat dry but the effect is good after continued use.  She has been using this on a regular basis since then.</li>
            <li> Using only this product after a couple weeks at one time a day I have a smooth complexion, no blackheads. Looking forward to the results I get adding hyalouric acid!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2weeks and I already have an amazing glow the skin on my neck and decollete seem is a little firmer. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the customer&#x27;s reviews and what the manufacturer says  of  it&#x27;s own product. The fact is that it dried my skin something awful. A waste of time and money</li>
            <li> I love the Petunia Skincare Professional Vitamin C Serum because it is 98% natural and not tested on animals – and contains no parabens, no sulfates, no alcohol – and no gluten. It repairs skins that suffered from environmental pollutants, oxidative stress, and chemical laden cosmetic products. The product is made in the USA. I also like that I support a new, innovative, small business – as I always opt to do this when I can. The product is easy to dose, very good to my skin (no irritations at all), smells heavenly – and it absorbs really well. I use it in conjunction with BB cream and I can tell the cream goes on more evenly now that I am using the product. Now that I have used the product for two weeks my skin appears more radiant, sun spots fade – and my skin looks rejuvenated. I will definitely reorder the product. A little goes a long way – what an AWESOME product and a great price point compared with mainstream products. I was lucky to be selected to try the product for free in exchange of honest feedback – and I will definitely purchase the product again!</li>
            <li> I started using this product about a month ago and I can honestly say that it&#x27;s the best serum that I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have always had a problem with large pores in the nose area, but with regular use this essentially erased them.  I use it in the morning and at night and he texture as well as the tone of my skin has drastically improved!  My face feels soft, moisturized and the blemishes that I did have are now gone.  I will be using this for a long time because it truly works wonders on my skin!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have noticed a difference in my skin and the discoloration from the sun. I ordered 2 bottles so my face should be back to its original color in a matter of months.  It is a winner!</li>
            <li> I got breakouts after using this product, mine is a sensitive skin. Will suggest you try it with caution.</li>
            <li> OK product. The very last portion of was pretty dense, and hard to get out.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions clearly posted on this product page within the product description. I appreciate the fact that I only have to allow this serum to dry on my skin for five minutes--versus twenty minutes for other wrinkle-prevention products I&#x27;ve experimented with--before applying a moisturizer on top of it. I don&#x27;t have brown spots, uneven skin tone, large pores, rough or dry skin, so I can&#x27;t attest to its effects on improving those issues. However, I&#x27;m old enough to have started the wrinkling process, and I can speak to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the immediate moment of applying the serum and for a little while afterwards, I found that it gave a sensation of light flushing and tightening of my skin, and I had a pleasant tingling sensation. I really wanted to use the serum around the eyes--one of the first and heaviest areas for skin to age--but I couldn&#x27;t find a way to ensure none of it would get rubbed into my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t personally report any amazingly noticeable difference in eliminating my existing wrinkles while using this product, but I also did not notice my skin getting worse, and at my age, no new, bad news translates to good news.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has great ingredients, which the manufacturer has accurately and completely listed here on this product page--which far too few companies bother to do for their cosmetics. This serum is also made in the USA, which means you don&#x27;t have to fear potentially dangerous Chinese ingredients. Best of all, the price is amazing. This one bottle, used as directed, will last me about four months. That&#x27;s unimaginably cheap for a skincare product for aging skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly speaking, though, the best prevention I&#x27;ve ever found for skin aging is bioidentical, pharmaceutical-grade progesterone such as [[ASIN:B0081RZ2BG Progestelle Progesterone Oil]]. Nothing else compares for that purpose, in my own personal experience, and the progesterone has the added advantage of protecting one from cancer and strengthening the bones. However, I only use it 21 days of the month, so I will probably keep using this product as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Distilled Water, Glycerin, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (Vitamin C), Hyaluronic Acid, Ferulic Acid, Phloretin (Apple Tree Leaves Extracts), Pomegranate Seed (Punica Granatum) Oil, Tocotrienols (Vitamin E), Vitamin E Oil (Alpha-D-Tocopherol), Astaxanthin (Yellow Leaves Extracts), Lycopene (Red Fruits Extracts), Lutein (Green Leafy Vegetables Extracts), Alpha Lipoic Acid, Beta Carotene (Carrot Extract), Xanthan Gum, Citrus Essential Oils, Phenoxyethanol (Sun Protection), Caprylyl Glycol (Plant Extract), Sorbic Acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE: I received a sample of this product from the manufacturer in order to test it so that I could write a review detailing my experiences with it.

            <li> Love this product! Great active ingredients make it so effective, and much more reasonably priced than similar products.</li>
            <li> I have good normal/sometimes slightly dry skin. I have tried many skin care products hoping to find a product that doesn&#x27;t irritate and also improves my uneven skin tone. My high expectations for this product were based it&#x27;s claims and rave reviews. This product claims to improve uneven skin tone. I have held off giving this review for over a month because I wanted to give the product a fair chance.  Although this product is helpful in moisturizing and it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin, I have experienced no noticeable improvement in my uneven skin tone.  There are many products that cost less that offer non irritating moisture that cost significantly less than this product. In summary, this product is not bad but it is also nothing special.</li>
            <li> The company has contacted me twice for a review. It&#x27;s been about 2 weeks since I&#x27;ve been using this serum and I&#x27;ve noticed a bit less redness in my skin tone and even though it has been very cold, I&#x27;ve been using a lot of moisturizer on top of the serum and my face has not been dry at all. I was hoping for a bit more of a &#x27;plumping&#x27; effect, but perhaps I have to use it for a while longer before I notice that. It absorbs well and is not sticky and doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell to it which is good. I will update if there are any major changes or results. If it&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve written this review, then nothing has changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****UPDATE*****&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve decided to change my rating from 4 starts to 5 stars after all. I have to say that after using the serum for over a month, my skin looks much healthier, smoother, and less puffy. My pores look smaller - they weren&#x27;t huge to begin with, but they look better. Also, the tiny blackheads on my nose seemed to have disappeared for the most part. I credit this to the ability of the product to continuously exfoliate. I used to feel the oils in my skin piling on my face after a full day, and if I didn&#x27;t use Apricot Scrub every day to exfoliate, my skin felt &#x27;cakey&#x27; even after washing with regular facewash. I really am liking the way this product has made my skin look and feel, and it has also reduced redness as well. Keep in mind I also use other things on my face, like Vitamin K Capillary strengthening serum which contains oils, and under eye cream for dark circles. The difference is noticeable after adding the serum in the morning and at night under the rest of the products I use. Try a bottle out. It will last over a month, and I do not use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> an average exfoliant with simple ingredients</li>
            <li> I have used other vitamin C serum and this one is ok compared to other brands I&#x27;ve used. The consistency is compared to a fresh orange juice. It feels a bit sticky upon application. This product is not for me</li>
            <li> This serum drastically changed the texture of my skin within just a few uses. My pores became smaller, and my skin was much softer to the touch. I love the way it made me skin feel when and it has a very pleasant  and awakening consistency when I put it on. It smells great too! Would definitely recommend this highly affective face serum!!</li>
            <li> I love the way Vitamin C Serum makes my face feel lovely and fresh. I recommend the Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of spending money buying new products for my face that just don&#x27;t work. My friend had to convince me to try this one. It was a gift so I gave it a try. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks now along with the Derma Roller that stimulates collagen production in my face and am quite pleased with the results. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use another type of beauty product ever again. This serum helps make my pores smaller, skin smoother, and brightens my complexion. It&#x27;s amazing.  Using the Derma Roller along the serum from the same company gives my face the results I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t do anything outstanding for my skin. Sure, the serum softened it up a little after application...but there was no lasting short term (through out the day) effects, nor long-term (after repeated use) effects. It kind of left a film over my skin that could be rubbed off into little balls with my fingertip.</li>
            <li> I have been quite disappointed with this product. After a couple of weeks of use I see little or no change. I simply cannot imagine the claims on this product. I do not think I will re order consiDering the price .</li>
            <li> I really love the vitamin C serum it seems to agree with my skin very well my skin feels softer and a little brighter !  Also, I was getting a pimple here and there that were like a cyst, since I have been using the serum I have not had a break out at all. I will always use this product.</li>
            <li> I have waited a while to write this review (a month actually) just to make sure I gave it a good chance. I love this stuff! My skin is probably the clearest and smoothest it has been since before puberty and the price is a third of what I paid at the spa! Shipping was very fast too!</li>
            <li> Nice pdt, shipment was fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my facial skin glow and very soft even with a few days use&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it and use continually</li>
            <li> I cannot say that the product is not good, just that I had &amp;#34;great expectations&amp;#34; about it because of Vit E and Hyluronic Acid, but sorry that I didn&#x27;t notice any special  change in my skin while I was using it for about three months maybe.  The &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; is quite weird, at first it remember me some kind of machine oil, after some time I thought it rather be kind of avocado smell or any plant o root. In general I didn&#x27;t stay interested in it. .</li>
            <li> Caused breakouts did not like it. Will be giving it to my mother.</li>
            <li> So far, about 1 month, this serum is working to keep my skin soft. I usually put this one before going to bed, after my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My skin has dark spots. Some of them are from aging (around my nose, mostly). Some of them are scars from acne and they go away with time. My skin is acne prone before each monthly cycle. Lines are starting to give away my age, but I think I have some time before they become a permanent part of my face. That being said. This product was appealing to me. I have dry skin. Most products break me out. For what it promises, this is what I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It promises to Increases your skins firmness and elasticity. When you put the product on, it feels kind of like glue. So yes. I agree. At the end of the day, my skin still feels tighter after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It promises to diminish and reduce the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and enlarged pore size. After one month of use, I feel like I can see a difference where lines are starting to set on my forehead and smile lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It says it will smoothen your skins texture and yes. It did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Exfoliates and hydrates the dry, dehydrated skin for a more moisturized and plumped skin. You know.. when you initially put the product on, your skin feels tight and dry as can be. In the beginning I questioned it, even though it said to apply your moisturizer afterwards. My skin felt tight, sticky, and dry. But as the day went on, my skin still felt dry. It&#x27;s cold here-- and I&#x27;m not needing to reapply moisturizer. So yes. Immediate success here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Exfoliate and brighten. I&#x27;m not too sure about &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34; .. but my skin has not been flaking. My skin is dry... so yes. Success enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Lightens sun spots, dark spots, brown spots and discoloration. As for the dark spots from acne.. they probably would have faded on their own. The dark spots around my nose definitely faded. I&#x27;m pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Provides antioxidant protection from free radicals end environmental damage such as the sun, pollution, and smoke. There is no way for me to prove this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the product and will probably buy again. I don&#x27;t really care for the smell. It smells like honey and old towels to me.... but the smell goes away after the product dries. It dries quickly. It did what it said it would do.r /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the product and will probably buy again. I don&#x27;t really care for the smell. It smells like honey and old towels to me.... but the smell goes away after the product dries. It dries quickly. It did what it said it would do.</li>
            <li> i feel skin is hurting after finish rolling my face with derma roller. This solution helps to sooth the aching of my face and i can feel it is so natural.</li>
            <li> When I was asked  to review Petunia Skincare Vitamin C Serum, I hesitated for a few days before accepting their offer. I&#x27;ve never used a vitamin C serum and wasn&#x27;t sure it would provide any benefits for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m in my mid 60&#x27;s, have a couple light colored age spots on my face, don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, don&#x27;t have many deep wrinkles, but I  have plenty of fine lines &amp; fine wrinkles.  For the past 18 days, I&#x27;ve applied the serum once a day  to my face &amp; a rough, light-colored age spot on the back of my hand. Within the first week of use, I noticed an improvement in my complexion. The fine lines &amp; wrinkles aren&#x27;t as noticeable. My skin definitely has a more youthful appearance, is a little firmer &amp; looks brighter. I haven&#x27;t noticed much change in a couple light-colored age spots on my face, but  the spot on my hand is much smoother now...most of its rough texture is gone. Like the spots on my face, it hasn&#x27;t changed much in color, maybe slightly lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I chose to apply the serum once a day, it can be applied twice a day for quicker results. The serum is not sticky &amp; absorbed quickly into my skin. I applied a small drop to each age spot, each cheek, my forehead, nose &amp; chin, massaged it in &amp; finished by massaging in an upward motion for a few seconds. Then waited about 5 minutes before applying my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try to remember to update my review if the age spots become noticeably lighter. (After 18, once a day applications, the age spots have lightened a little)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your satisfaction is guaranteed with a 100% Money Back Guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sample provided for review was purchased with the manufacturer&#x27;s coupon.</li>
            <li> I have been using Petunia Skincare Anti-Aging Serum for about three weeks now and have been pleasantly surprised by the results.  Because my skin is sensitive, I am always hesitant to risk irritating it with new chemicals, but the ingredient list was reassuring.  I still tested it on my inner arm twice a day for two days before using it on my face or psoriatic patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is slightly viscous and has a very pale orange color, presumably from the beta carotene.  It has a mild but pleasant scent of orange, with a hint of spice.  It doesn&#x27;t feel at all oily and is readily absorbed when gently massaged into the skin&amp;mdash;and a drop or two goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has an immediate effect of slightly smoothing and tightening the skin once it dries.  Rather than irritating the flaky patches, it actually has a soothing effect.  I then wait a few minutes and massage argan or jojoba oil or shea butter on those irritated areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week or so, I did notice that the areas of my face where I had been using it, under the eyes and across my nose, started looking fresher and brighter and feeling less dried-out.  It does also seem to lessen the appearance of those fine facial wrinkles. I was worried that the mild exfoliating effect might increase the flakiness of the psoriatic patches or otherwise irritate them, but it hasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint with this product is that the writing on the bottle label is too small for me to read without a jeweler&#x27;s loupe, but the images here on the Amazon page are easy enough to read when enlarged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small bottle of this serum was offered to me by Petunia Skincare for testing and unbiased review.  I am always hesitant and even skeptical when trying anything new that comes into contact with my skin, but I can confidently recommend it to others.  It&#x27;s certainly not a liquid facelift, but it is definitely helpful in improving and maintaining the feel and appearance of the skin.acum officinale).</li>
            <li> Still using this twice a day and really like the way my skin feels.  Will keep it up and see if the wrinkles get less!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for couple weeks, so far do good. I have huge pores &amp; I think they are getting smaller by using this product, but it still hadn&#x27;t reached the optimum result i wanted yet. I hope that by the time I finish this bottle, I can see better result. Anyway, I recommend to try this product.</li>
            <li> This serum is not worth the price!  It is really greasy on my face and does not brighten it at all.  On top of that it breaks me out.  I&#x27;ve used Vitamin C serums before and they all brighten my face instantly.  Not this one.  The only problem I had about those Vitamin C&#x27;s was that they oxidized too quickly and stung my face (no redness though) after awhile.  I wanted to try this serum because I liked the list of ingredients and figured it would be more stable.  Also, idiot me told myself, the higher the price, the better.  That is not the case.  There are so many Vitamin C serums sold online, so it&#x27;s really hard to dig through and find a good one.  What makes it harder is that there are fake reviews too.  Amazon should monitor all the reviews and filter out fake ones.  Anyway, I guess it&#x27;s a matter of trial and error to find something that works.</li>
            <li> Been using this for approximately 2 weeks now, it feels nice on skin, not too sticky, not oily, no unpleasant scent, glides nicely on skin and absorbs quite fast.  However I do not see any significant results.  Perhaps it&#x27;s long term perhaps I&#x27;m expecting too much, not sure what to look for, but nothing looks any different.  Usually when vit C is applied there is mild stinging (not unpleasant) there is some reaction to make you feel something is working, this product is ultra mild.</li>
            <li> I think this serum has made a big difference and I am thrilled with this addition to my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> I have not used this long enough to rate the benefits.  I did purchase it because the other rating were good.</li>
            <li> Only used this for a couple of weeks but my skin feels better and smoother. The serum has a citrus scent that is quite nice. I really appreciated the follow-up by Petunia Skincare to be sure their product met my expectations. Very pleased and will order this again!</li>
            <li> So far it look good, no complaints, no results yet either but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be happy with it once I use the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about a month. Not sure if it is wishful thinking or actual improvement, but my neck doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;crepe paper&amp;#34; look anymore. Serum is easy to use. I have used other anti-aging products that never worked, but I have seen improvement with this Vitamin C serum.  I definitely will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I am really liking this so far.  It makes my skin feel soft and moist, and it is not sticky or tacky like some serums.  This appears to be a very stable form of vitamin c which I appreciate.  I only removed one star because I do not know the pH of the product, and I prefer when facial products come with the pH on the bottle.  I&#x27;m going to have to buy testing strips and test it myself.  However, I am happy with the serum and I will most likely buy it again when my bottle runs out.  Smells great and doesn&#x27;t interfere negatively with my other products and does not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!!! My skin looks clearer and smoother than it has in years! It feels plumper also . I think it has made me look younger too! I wanted to use it for a while to make sure my skin improved before I did a write up on it! I will be ordering this again!</li>
            <li> there are a lot of better product then that</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several weeks and have been very pleased.  It has a pleasant light scent and is fairly light so it can be used both day and night.  My overall complexion seems to have improved.  I feel my skin looks more radiant.  I will absolutely be getting more when I run out!</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t use vitamin serums in my beauty regiment but after trying out this serum I regret not using this sooner. I use the serum every other night on sensitive areas of my face (under eyes, side nose, eye lids) and the next morning those areas are evidently rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> I got a free coupon from /r freebies on reddit and decided to try this out. I was afraid at first because I&#x27;ve had bad, bad experiences with skin products (i have sensitive skin prone to break outs) and my skin typically has only responded to Korean products. I cannot handle most American brands and clearing my acne was a nightmare. I decided to take the plunge and go for it since it was free. My bad acne has left me with hyper pigmentation that I&#x27;ve been trying to clear for years. However, this product has been slowly fading them. I&#x27;m on my second bottle now and hope the results keep on continuing :D! NOTE: It&#x27;s very important you apply this twice a day and use sunscreen!!! I noticed it went from not really having an effect to a gradual change after I did this. Furthermore, it&#x27;s a very GRADUAL process so don&#x27;t expect results over night! One bottle lasted me a month and a half to almost two months and I noticed improvement after one bottle :)</li>
            <li> was a little unsure before I ordered I was using a nother product but was slowly creeping out of my price range so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try its surprisingly amazing stuff. Very happy with it</li>
            <li> I purchased this product mainly for my wife however I started to use it to see if there would be a change.  I have brown spots and dark circles under my eyes so I&amp;#34;m gaiving it  a try.  First thing is my skin feels very tight as soon as it drys on my face.  Very easy to use although I feel it will take some time.  So far I&#x27;m liking the experience.  Hopefully it will remove the brown spots and light the circles.  Will see.</li>
            <li> If you are hesitating to buy this...don&#x27;t. Clears skin will be yours in about a month of nightly use. My skin is clearer and brighter.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I bought other Vitamin C products in the past but this is the best value for the money.  I try to use it twice a day.  I am even trying it on the tops of my hands to see if it will have the same good results as on my face.</li>
            <li> Although I did receive this product for free, that does not mean that my review is biased. Amazing product actually works and is worth the price!</li>
            <li> Great serum for dull skin. This has really helped me brighten my facial skin. I now have a nice glow and that makes me happy. My skin  also does feels a lot softer like it has just been exfoliated. I like the fact that it has all natural ingredients and it is paraben free. I will also get my husband to start using it. Great product.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Vitamin C Serum . the smell and feel is great and I have noticed a difference in my wife&#x27;s skin tone and look. Thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li> WORKS WELL  WILL BUY MORE  LASTED LONGER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 months. While I do love the silkiness of the serum and the light citrus fragrance, I cannot honestly say that I have seen much, if any, improvement in my skin. I will continue to use this product until it&#x27;s gone, and may buy a similar product in the future.....but it will not be this one!</li>
            <li> Wonderful and powerful vitamin C serum. Skin feels soft, radiant and smooth. Powerful antioxidant. Absorbs very fast.  Non-greasy. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> A little does a lot!  As they say, a little dab will do ya.  The best part is that it is oil free, alcohol free, and paraben free.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the vitamin c serum. I use it at night and have noticed my pores are smaller and my skin is tighter. I an still waiting on results for the uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> Very good, does have a like smell to it unlike the others but it&#x27;s still does a great job!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I’ve been incorporating the vitamin c serum into my daily face care routine for about two weeks now with the derma roller. After using both products together during this trial period, I will say that my skin is looking more fresh and awake than it did before.  Also, the products have not caused any distress to my face nor have they created any reactions to what I already use, including Retin-A.  Obviously any product that goes onto your face takes weeks to truly show results, but I’m slightly impressed with this duo!  I’ll be continuing to use them in my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 23 year old female with terrible, lifeless skin. I used this product during the day over my whole face and a retinol at night, and the combination seemed to be the right mix for me.. my skin really loved it. I never finished off the product and it crystalized after maybe 2 months, which I would assume would happen with any similar product, especially something like Vit C which deteriorates rather quickly. Aside from being a great product, it&#x27;s also cruelty free, which I stand by 100%. When looking to buy a similar product, I would definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> This Petunia Skincare Anti-Aging Serum is like nothing I have ever used before. A single pea-sized drop on the palm of your hand will be enough for your entire face, and the results start showing up very quickly, even at the first application. There is a slight stickiness at first, and then when it dries (directions say to wait 5 minutes before applying your usual face products), you have very supple, soft skin. Nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a perfect test subject for skin oils/creams/serums. I have super-sensitive skin, and pushing 70, it&#x27;s also very dry. Anything not 100% perfect will leave my skin looking like crinkled up tissue paper. I also have age spots. I noticed that they were lighter after using this....they seemed to \\&quot;blend\\&quot; more. I&#x27;m fussy about aromas, and this one is slightly like citrus, and not strong at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The list of benefits listed on the box is impressive, and if you investigate Hyaluronic Acid and ferulic acid, you will find these claims to be true....from being anti-oxidant to exfoliating and rehydrating, and much more. So this is very impressive serum. You can&#x27;t argue with results, and the results are visible!</li>
            <li> Keep using it, hope it work very well! But first week to try it&#x27;s was ok. I never have bad acne before but now I have a lot of scar from acne hopefully this product work for my skin.</li>
            <li> Love it !!!  I am not able to use straight vitamin C serum but this product has extra stuff in it that works great and I do not break out.  I use obaji products now and would love to be able to switch al products to Petunia.  I have had a scare that always was a dark spot on my face and it is gone!  facials and obaji have not made that happen</li>
            <li> I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this it makes my skin feel so wonderful</li>
            <li> Great product, lightened my skin after the first use. Made my face a lot lighter and even toned. Excellent produce!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.  I tried another one which was much more expensive and it dried out my skin.  So far I am not having problems with really dry skin and it helps with skin problems, such as scars, etc.  I find it difficult to use with the dropper.  That is my only complaint.  I would like your input on a moisturizer ..My skin is usually not dry, but I do believe a moisturizer would in the sunny months when I have to wear sunscreen.</li>
            <li> a good product that does all it say&#x27;s it will, when used an exfoliating routine.</li>
            <li> Absolutely remarkable, the first day I used the product I noticed incredible results. It really works!  I will purchase it again and again.</li>
            <li> This has been a good product so far.  I received my order quickly and have also received emails that included additional tips and benefits of using Vitamin C serum.  My pores do seem to be shrinking some and even some of the brown spots have lessened to a degree.  I am using this serum in combination with their derma roller.  I&#x27;m hoping these improvements will continue as well as getting that extra collagen boost for firmer skin.  So far so good.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the product. Although I just started to use it, it is non-irritating to my skin and is quickly absorbed. Contact seller regarding e- book and they responded promptly with the link to down load it. Over all a simple successful purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two weeks of use, there is visible softening of creases/wrinkles at the corner of my eyes.</li>
            <li> This serum has met all what has been stated in the promotion. It lightened my skin, took out the uneven discoloration, lightened the skin around the eyes and made my face smoother. Took years away. I used to use Retinal 1% daily with a moisturizer/sunscreen  but the texture and tone of my skin did not change till I started using this serum. I use this serum every other day with Retinal in between. I have had no allergies or even the slightest negative reactions from this product. I have also used this serum on my nipples. They have lightened considerably. I apply the product and then apply a skin moisturizer/ sunscreen lotion. I have also used it on my lips followed with a lip balm that has a high level of sunscreen. Best time to use them on the lips is when one is ready to go to bed. Otherwise it gets wiped out during the day when I eat. All it takes is one drop per nipple, a couple of drops for the lips and about a dozen drops for the face.</li>
            <li> Love this serum! Smooth and tighter skin&lt;br /&gt;In just one week!! This regimen will be the first step morning and night!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this along with my dermaroller every other day and .... OMG!!!!! the pores on and around my nose got so much smaller! I have no fine lines and pretty much look the same as I used to when I was 19 (but fatter) so I can&#x27;t tell you that my lines went away. I however did have a very small scar in my eyelid .. never listened to not putting things in my eyelids or under my eyes and I&#x27;m glad because I can hardly see the scar now. It wasn&#x27;t too noticeable unless you would come really close to my eye but now even then ... even w. a magnifying glass I can&#x27;t see it</li>
            <li> By far one of my favorite skin care products. I have seen dramatic results in only a few weeks of use, skin is clearer, brighter and softer :)</li>
            <li> I Love This Serum! I apply it ever night also when I finish dermarolling and it has dramatically improved my skin&#x27;s appearance! I just finished a bottle about to order a second one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this serum.  Most of the reviews were impressive and it sounded like a product where I would definitely see results.  Unfortunately, after several weeks of using it morning and night under my moisturizer, I don&#x27;t see any improvement in the condition of my skin.  I am 65 years old and although I&#x27;m told I look very young for my age, I definitely have lines and wrinkles I would like to see less of not to mention a small sunspot right under my eye.  I was hoping that at least the sunspot would fade a little.  So far, there has been no change at all.  I will continue to use it because there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any negative effects but no positive ones either.  I guess you can&#x27;t put youth in a bottle.</li>
            <li> this is the best serum everrrrrrrrr love love it.... will order again for life. Please never discontinue this wonderful product</li>
            <li> In fairness to this product, I waited for two months before reviewing it.  One bottle is a month use to me because I apply it everyday, morning and night before bed.  Aside from the moisturizer that I use from time to time, this is the only product that I apply on my face.  I don&#x27;t see any improvement with blemishes and dark sports around my eyes.  I already used two bottles and I have my third one now.  This should be my last bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediate result after use is brightening and that tightening feeling.  But that&#x27;s it.  When I rinse it off, it&#x27;s gone.  I was waiting for a long term positive result and there was none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not at all bad though.  I like the mild smell and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  I have soft, acne-free skin before I used this.  And it continues that way.  I only wanted the blemishes and dark spots gone but nothing happened.  In short, there was no improvement. Lots of wonderful reviews here, maybe it works for them but no long term effect for me, plus it&#x27;s a little expensive.  If you&#x27;re curious, try it yourself.  But I will not recommend.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything. I used as instructed and after using the entire bottle, I noticed no improvement in my face&#x27;s texture or appearance. I am not yet 40, but have some skin darkening and was hoping this would lighten those areas. It did not.</li>
            <li> I think it is a good serum.  It is absorbed quickly, not sticky, leaves a good feeling on the face.  There is only one problem with this serum - the smell.  I think if you could improve the smell I could give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I could not be more pleased with this product... I have been using it for 2 weeks and can already see great results... will definitely continue to use this....</li>
            <li> Very nice serum, I am pleased, I can&#x27;t see any visible results yet, but feels good on the face, absorbs quick,  makes my skin soft, I don&#x27;t have any brown spot, so I can&#x27;t tell if helps for discoloration.</li>
            <li> I have only used this for a couple weeks but I am noticing a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t see any wrinkles getting finer as yet.&lt;br /&gt;I do feel it is a bit drying but I have dry skin so hard to tell if it is worse or not.&lt;br /&gt;I will update in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Got as a gift for my mother. She love loved it!</li>
            <li> Great product…&lt;br /&gt;Super fast delivery!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Vitamin C Anti-Aging Serum a few weeks ago and I am very happy with the results.  My skin is tighter and smoother, my skin tone is brighter. I have seen improvement in the lines in my skin. I also purchased the Derma-Roller and I have been using it two to three times a week.  Since I am an older adult I do not expect miracles but the roller and serum combined with my usual moisturizer have done more than any other products I have used.  Petunia sends tips on using the products that I have found helpful.  They provide real customer service.  I hope they add more products to their line.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, skin feels very nice after application. I would give five stars except I can only apply at night since it&#x27;s not moisturizing. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Lovely product, easy to apply, fast absorbing, leaves no residue, works well under moisturizer and makeup.  Skin felt soft and nourished throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Excellent service and great product.</li>
            <li> I love this serum! I can feel a difference in my skin and I love the way it feels under my  makeup foundation.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> This product has done nothing for me at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No  noticeable difference at all in age spots, redness or skin texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not care for this product.</li>
            <li> I have never used a vitamin C serum but have heard it does great things for your complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have some acne scarring that I couldn&#x27;t seem to lighten. This serum seems to do the trick. It leaves my skin smoother and feeling refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this bottle comes with an eye dropper so that I can put it into my hands to massage into my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for reviewing purposes.</li>
            <li> to Petunia&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 75 years young and have used 1 bottle of  Vitamin C Serum.  I have noticed that the lines  on my face have soften.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the dark circles that were on the UPPER lids of my eyes going down to the bridge of my nose, are completely&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GONE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kathryn B.</li>
            <li> Dried my face like crazy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results of this product leaving my skin softer and radiant.  A small amount is enough to apply to your face and neck..</li>
            <li> This serum has improved my skins texture a lot and made it really glow. It goes on smoothly and absorbs really well with the derma roller. I use this serum every night. The best part is it&#x27;s cheaper than high end brand names and does the same job if not better.</li>
            <li> I love this Vitamin C Serum.  My skin looks and feels so smooth.  I will definately be ordering this product again.</li>
            <li> I got this with the free coupon code. I bought this for my mother because she was the one that needed this more than me. She absolutely loved it. She&#x27;s going to purchase some more of it when this runs out. This bottle will definitely last a while. Don&#x27;t let it&#x27;s size fool you! You get what you pay for here!</li>
            <li> Saw a marked reduction in neck area right away after just a week! I will continue to use this product. My neck is 66 yrs old and looks 55. I will take it!!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any difference yet! How long is it supposed to take for results?</li>
            <li> So far skin feels softer, pores seem a bit smaller, would update review as I go along...</li>
            <li> This product was okay, sometimes my face felt a lot more plump and looked youthful but I also felt like the serum was really sticky on my face. I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference otherwise. I did drop the bottle and it cracked immediately, I dropped it from a small height so be very fragile. In comparison my Agave Oil Bottle doesn&#x27;t have a single crack and I&#x27;ve dropped that before as well. So be careful with this since the glass is very fragile.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over a week now, and I am already seeing results.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to apply the Vitamin C Serum, it is dispensed with an eyedropper and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I apply the serum after I wash my face and allow it to dry before adding my moisturizer/spf or my night cream over the top.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my skin smooth, soft and glowing all day long. I have combination skin and this serum hydrates my dry skin,&lt;br /&gt;without leaving the rest of my face greasy or breaking me out. After just a few uses I noticed my pores were smaller, my skin was firmer and my fine lines were hardly visible. This serum is 100% natural, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about putting chemicals or parabens on your face like you do with some other products. It is also cruelty free, made in the USA, and has a 100% money back guarantee. It is hard to find a product that does all this at an affordable price, so I am so happy to have found this. I did receive this for free to review, and I can honestly say I will definitely continue to use this product and purchase more when my sample runs out.</li>
            <li> Ever since we were young, my sister and I have always played around with skincare products.  It began when I was in middle school, my sister four years younger, when we would go into mom&#x27;s bathroom (of course, when she was busy elsewhere in the house) and pretend we were her, putting all kinds of goop on our faces.  Then, as we got older, we would go to different beauty and makeup stories to buy our own goops to try out.  Either because of good genes or the fact that we messed with all of this stuff when we were younger (or maybe both), my sister and I have always been told that we have good skin.  Now that I&#x27;m getting older, I&#x27;m afraid to stop playing with all of these skincare products (haha), that worry that women have about time catching up with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of months ago, I received an email from a lady at Petunia Skincare asking if I would be interested in trying one of their products.  As I read that email, the old adage &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t fix what ain&#x27;t broke&amp;#34; came into my mind - if all these years of trying new stuff has paid off so far, why change what I&#x27;m doing?  I emailed her back that I would be glad to try out her product and received it a couple of days later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s just say that, in the last couple of months, I have become a huge fan of Petunia Skincare products.  A couple of things I like about the company as a whole is that you get a free e-book that talks to you about beauty regimens, I received a follow up email to give me some tips on using their product AND there is a 100% money back guarantee if you are not satisfied with their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first one I received is the Professional Vitamin C Serum.  It sits on the counter in the bathroom and is used daily by my mother and myself.  It makes my skin soft, and gently takes off the outer layer of skin, giving my skin a nice fresh look.  I have sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t bother my skin at all.  I do wish that there was a different &amp;#34;applicator&amp;#34; - it&#x27;s a dropper, which makes a mess if you&#x27;re just putting it on your finger to spread on your face (I use a cotton ball).&lt;br /&gt;  My mom uses this in the morning before she puts on her makeup and feels it really makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks ago, I received a second set of emails, this time talking about the the Revitalize Eye Serum and the Professional Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  Just like with the first product, these two products are used daily by myself and my mother (now she uses my stuff haha).  They quickly rushed the product out to me (one was actually delivered from the USPS on a Sunday) and within a few days I was noticing a big difference.  My usual concern (skin sensitivity) was quickly squashed because this stuff makes my face feel great, no allergic reactions of any kind.  When I don&#x27;t get enough sleep, I get the under eye issues that plague a lot of us and those were not only gone within two days of using this stuff, but continued use has caused them to not come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a product that I definitely recommend you give a try to - and remember what I said above, they are so sure that  you will love their product that they offer a 100% money back guarantee if you are not happy.r, which makes a mess if you&#x27;re just putting it on your finger to spread on your face (I use a cotton ball).&lt;br /&gt;  My mom uses this in the morning before she puts on her makeup and feels it really makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks ago, I received a second set of emails, this time talking about the the Revitalize Eye Serum and the Professional Hyaluronic Acid Serum.

            <li> I had been looking for a serum to add to my skincare routine for awhile, so when I was offered the chance to test out this serum I jumped at the opportunity. To be clear, while I received this product for free, I am in no way obligated to give it a good review, nor am I being compensated to write this. That being said, I do really love this serum. It is lightweight and non-greasy, and absorbs right into the skin. It has helped fade my hyperpigmentation, and I wake up with a much brighter completion when I use this. Overall, this products is fantastic, especially considering how affordable it is. I&#x27;m halfway through the bottle and will definitely repurchase when I am out.</li>
            <li> 5 starts I love this Vit C&lt;br /&gt;It is effective and very soothing on my face.  Make sure to use with a moisturizer for best results.&lt;br /&gt;Mary In Californai</li>
            <li> I followed the good reviews and purchased this serum for anti-aging care. I cannot be more pleased. It is lightweight, powerful and efficient. I have been using it twice a day (morning and night) and noticed a difference after just a few days. I have been using it for a couple of weeks total. My skin appears less dry, younger and alive. I&#x27;ve been also using it with microderma roller and they work wonderfully together. It feels very pleasant on the skin, is refreshing, nourishing and non-greasy. Love and regret that I have not learned about this serum earlier. Will continue to use!</li>
            <li> After using this, my face has certainly feel a lot softer and tighter. No complaints!</li>
            <li> One of the best products that I have tried.  It truly does lighten dark spots and softens skin.</li>
            <li> My aesthetician recommended a vitamin C serum for my face, so I spent time looking around and researching for the perfect one.  I decided on this one by Petunia and I absolutely love it!  My skin is so happy getting all the fantastic nutrients from the serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a senior with very dry skin to boot so I need more than a hydrating moisturizer to combat aging skin and wrinkles. I shopped around for a serum made with all natural ingredients and I believe this is it. It makes my skin very soft and smooth under makeup. Just the other day, I received compliments about my complexion from several friends so it makes me feel like this serum is working. The 4 stars is because I haven&#x27;t seen lightening of my brown spots yet. A helpful tip from me is to use very little to avoid  stickiness. One drop is what I use followed by my favorite moisturizer or night cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a transgendered woman, age 64, and I have found this serum to be extraordinary. I don&#x27;t want to sound gross, but within days, I was seeing a lot of old dried out skin appear when I shaved or just washed my face. My skin feels smoother, looks and feels so young and fresh. The stuff really works! Highest recommendation.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!-it does seem to protect my face from environment, and keeps it SUPER soft. It has shrunk my pore size  some, wish it could do it faster, but at my age, I&#x27;m thankful.One of the things I like is, you don&#x27;t have to use big amounts of product, it goes a long way. Also, the process and shipment pf product was excellent.Good job guys!</li>
            <li> As I am an older now with sun damaged skin, this product has given me softer skin already. I look forward to continue using it and seeing the results.</li>
            <li> I am a face cream and all beauty products lover. I love to try different brands. Some are good  and some are plain bad but once in a while I hit the jackpot with my choices and this product it is one of them. Absolutely fantastic!!! You have to try to see what I mean. I have been using for a few weeks now and it is delivering everything as promised. My skin has a better texture, is softer and more hydrated. Also I had some dark spots on both sides of my face which are becoming much lighter and less noticeable. My entire skin on my face is more even and tighter. I am going to keep buying from Petunia Skincare for sure.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know if this is a good product, but did notice these reviewers have all reviewed several of the exact same products, which is a strong indication they are planted reviews by people paid to leave positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon, allowing these types of reviews to remain erodes trust in your rating system.  Please pay better attention!</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, and live in Southwest Florida, so I can&#x27;t use anything remotely lotion-y or oily on my face. Another issue with living in Southwest Florida is sun damage- you can&#x27;t really live here without sun affecting your skin, even if you jump through hoops to keep it protected. I regularly use sunblock and all sorts of lotions and overnight creams, but nothing really seems to protect the skin AND also un-do some of the damage that has been incurred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is lovely, lightweight, and refreshing. It is bright orange, which is kind of unique, but it disappears into the skin right after being applied and leaves a dewy, smooth feeling behind. Again- it&#x27;s not oily, but it does leave the skin feeling refreshed (the orange scent definitely contributes to that feeling!) Sometimes after I wash my face (I tend to SCRUB HARD to get the sunblock out of my pores) I get a very tight, sting-y feeling and usually it takes a pretty heavy moisturizer to make the sting go away, but when I applied the Vitamin C serum, it actually helped with that immediately. I like that it also soothes my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I like this product most because it feels good to wear. A lot of serums are pretty sticky and/or are too lightweight to feel like they are doing anything. Is it a miracle potion? No. Nothing really is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, so good. I DO update my reviews regularly, so if anything changes, you&#x27;ll hear about it. In the meantime, I recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> My skin type is normal and this serum dryed my face out.&lt;br /&gt;it is perling out.&lt;br /&gt; A very unease sensation follows this physical reaction.</li>
            <li> Meh. I&#x27;ve used this product for over 2 months and have not seen any improvement. I have very sensitive skin so I expected this to be a bit harsh, like most Vitamin C serums can be. Nothing, no reaction -- which makes me wonder if there are enough actives to really do anything in the product.  I&#x27;ve used a similar product from Skinceuticals (who&#x27;s packaging definitely inspired Petunia&#x27;s) and it worked beautifully. Waste of my $$.</li>
            <li> It is a great serum for moisture and whitening.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product if you would like to have moisture skin and brighter skin.</li>
            <li> I appreciate your thoughtful follow up on my purchase of the Serum.  I used it a few days and misplaced it and then forgot about it since i have so many other serums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it and I like the listed ingredients.  I will use it again and hope it will be just what I wanted.  The few days I used it, I didn&#x27;t see any difference so I became a little discouraged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your kind message activated my interest, again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lo-Dema</li>
            <li> The wrinkles around my eyes have faded to almost nothing as a result of using this. This serum absorbs well and you don&#x27;t have to worry about greasy residue. It also doesn&#x27;t stink like some I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I love it, thank you so much</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product because it delivers Vitamin C directly to face.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 10 weeks now and is great.  I can see a difference in my skin, it does look healthier and clear.  I use the product 1 to 2 times daily.  My skin  is hydrated and doesn&#x27;t dry out from wearing make up.  I am almost finished with this bottle and I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I actually really like this serum. I use it over my face after washing, leave it on for a few minutes, then rub the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; skin off. Brown skin flakes combine with the surum and rub right off. It&#x27;s a pretty disgusting thing to think about, and hard to explain, but that&#x27;s basically what happens. It&#x27;s a great exfolliator that helps peel off the old skin so my skin looked nice and clean, and smooth!</li>
            <li> Great product. I have been using this for a few months now, and it&#x27;s great for my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I started using this serum about a month ago and I see a difference. My skin looks and feels better! And looks younger too!  I had also some dark spots on my face which are becoming much lighter and less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt; I will definitely recommend this serum to everyone!</li>
            <li> I use this along with the Dermaroller---I could feel a difference with in a few usages and about two weeks into using I could see results!!</li>
            <li> Made my skin nice and soft but as far as removing spots from previous acne, it didn&#x27;t work for me. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I used this to help lighten my acne scars and it has helped. I use it inconjunction with a sunscreen. Overall, acne scars are still noticeable upon further inspection, but have nicely faded to blend better with the surrounding skin. It almost made my skin soft, and my gf has even started using it.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m happy with this product.  Noticeable fading of brown spots and skin tone is getting even and smooth.  Also, no adverse reactions.</li>
            <li> I received this much more quickly than I expected to...thanks! I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks, but I&#x27;ve already noticed that my pores have noticeably shrunk, and my skin is smoother and tighter. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing the results after 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li> five stars --it melts on your face  and the results is a lovely face.  Pat Travis</li>
            <li> Light, doesn&#x27;t clog pores and makes my skin feel great! I recommendit!</li>
            <li> Though I followed the application directions for about a month, there is no improvement.  I purchased it because many of the product reviews attest to its effectiveness. However, I did not see any benefit.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with a dermaroller but I like it so much I use it daily.</li>
            <li> I am an Esthetician and i love this Vitamin C Serum for my clients !  Great customer service, fast delivery...couldn&#x27;t ask for more..Thank you !</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to help lighten the area above my upper lip and minimize the fine lines there. I&#x27;ve only been using it morning and night for three weeks thus far, so am not surprised I don&#x27;t see much difference in that area. What I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised about is that within the first two days, my acne began clearing up and my pores starting looking a wee bit smaller. My skin is also softer and smoother. Will continue to use this product and am optimistic over time, it will help with the area above my lips too.</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my skin feel. I use it every day and my skin is baby soft with no dry spots.</li>
            <li> My daughter recommended this product and I really like it.  At age 82, even though I have good young looking skin, I need all the help I can get and this product did help plump out my skin and make it smooth.  I am ordering another bottle.</li>
            <li> this serum penetrate on my uneven skin tone and dark spots i have on my face the serum leaves my skin feeling softer with even tone with a youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> So far I like this serum. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s helped with my melasma (6 weeks in) but I do think my skin looks and feels better than it did before I started using. I will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> Help improve texture and clarity.</li>
            <li> Did notice any difference using this and didn&#x27;t like the way it made my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I love this product it works great. It helps to keep my skin soft and youthful looking.</li>
            <li> I bought this serum of their website and I’ve been using this serum for 3 months now, and feel fully confident that I have given a recommended time frame to review and share my experience with Petunia Skincare’s vitamin c serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is light orange in color, due to all the antioxidants it has in it, for example beta carotene, and it has a citrusy smell to it. I am not a huge fan of the smell, it smells like oranges and other citrus fruits, my mother thinks the smell is refreshing. I like how this serum is a thick serum rather than a watery serum. This one goes on very easily. It is non-sticky, but you have to wait for it to dry. It’s sticky for the first minute or two, but then dries fairly well. I really love love what this serum did to my face.. it made it super soft and glowing. I would wake up to beautiful bright skin and I felt comfortable going to the super market without putting on makeup.. and I am serious about this, you should try it and see for yourself. My wrinkles around my eyes also filled in, I could smile and the lines weren’t as noticeable.. however, this product did not get rid of my wrinkles completely but it made a huge difference. A lot of my friends have complimented me and asked me what did I do, because my skin is now super soft, plump and glowing. They say I’ve probably dropped 5 years off my age which feels so nice to hear. I use this 2x a day, and have even put it on my hands (I have psoriasis) and it has done wonders for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product claims to lighten dark spots and sunspots, and I find this to be fairly true.. meaning that my spots have not completely disappeared.. but they are not as visible as before, and I think this is partly due to me forgetting to put on sunscreen for the first couple months. I’ve just recently purchased Shiseido’s sunscreen and now I can really see the vitamin c lightening the spots.. so it’s important to use sunscreen. Overall, this product gets a 5 stars from me, Ill be repurchasing again.</li>
            <li> Great antioxidant serum, didn&#x27;t cause breakouts and it goes a long way.  I feel like my skin has looked better since using it.  Great buy!  Quick shipping!</li>
            <li> I just started using it a couple weeks ago and so far it&#x27;s helping somewhat.  After six weeks or so I&#x27;ll be able to see if it&#x27;s going to do what it suppose to.  I&#x27;m looking forward to good results.</li>
            <li> My mom uses this product and she does say that she&#x27;s noticed some reduction in wrinkles, she&#x27;s been dabbing a drop or two for two weeks now. However she probably won&#x27;t buy another bottle for the current advertised price because it is just an ounce of liquid in a dropper bottle. The bottle itself can last a month if you use the liquid sparingly.</li>
            <li> One of the best skin care products I have ever used. Being a middle age male we tend to neglect taking care of our skin until we start seeing the lines show up. Have tried several different skin care products over the last few years. Non have shown such dramatic results so quick. You will see a difference in a matter of days. To top it off it&#x27;s reasonably priced</li>
            <li> I had been using this for about a year now. My daily routine is Vitamin C, moisturizer, sunblock in the morning and at night it&#x27;s Vitamin C and moisturizer. I notice a huge difference in my skin. It&#x27;s more radiant, smaller pores and smoother skin. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> this serum is amazing!! totally worth to try, this was actually a gift one of my friends sent to me. She wanted me to try it so bad, I didn&#x27;t believe it in the first place, but after applying to my skin every day before bedtime for a week, my skin dramatically changed since then. It became smoother and softer! It really hydrate our skin. I totally fell in love with this product, the best thing is that it is very affordable! I now need to order more!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about using this, because nothing seems to work as they say it will, but I decided to try it, based on the reviews.  I&#x27;ve been using it a couple weeks now with a good moisturizer and it really seems to be working.  My skin seems to have gotten back it&#x27;s dewey appearance, and the wrinkles are minimized.  I&#x27;m 66 years old, and thankfully don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, but it is working on those I do have around my eyes and upper lip.  I will definitely continue using it.</li>
            <li> This really dried my face and turned rancid quickly. (I purchased this ages ago and simply never wrote a review.) I have since used a few different brands of Vit C to compare with now. I kept this in a cool, dark environment - not in my bathroom. Perhaps it may work better if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin. Maybe I just got an old bottle.</li>
            <li> I use this product 2x a day and I really notice the difference, especially with age spots.  I do think the bottle hold be sealed though.</li>
            <li> I started seeing results the first week of use. The sun damage, from being in the sun too much when I was younger, has improved so much I am not self-conscience anymore. The first week my skin soaked in the serum. I am very  pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Not seeing results as advertised.  Would not buy again</li>
            <li> Works well.  I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> I truly love it .....best vitamin serum ever!</li>
            <li> Seems to help my 57-year old skin be more vibrant looking, and smoother looking/softer feeling.  So easy to just apply in a jiffy and go!  My skin very challenged by years and years and years in sun and low humidity.  But, this seems to be a useful product.  Fast shipping, nice smooth transaction.  Good seller, I&#x27;ll order more.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for the last week.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what results come after more time.</li>
            <li> This product made my skin very soft and I do notice a sunspot on my nose getting lighter. My skin is sensitive so I only use it every other day. Once a week I use on my chest and let dry. Then I use pure coco butter.</li>
            <li> Very happy with customer service and product</li>
            <li> The best serum I have ever purchased and I have tried a few.The fine lines have diminished around my eyes and my entire face is much more healthy .Wonderful product ,thanks</li>
            <li> I really liked this serum at first. However, around the second month I owned it, it started developing white small growths inside the dropper and around the bottom of the bottle. Supposedly, this serum should last without refrigeration, which is why it surprised me that  things were growing in my bottle. I think that refrigeration may be necessary and should be disclosed on the box.</li>
            <li> I will definitely recommend this serum to all my girlfriends!  I have been using it for a couple of weeks and can already see a difference in the texture of my skin.  It also arrived super fast to my mailbox!</li>
            <li> I love the fresh feeling I get with this product. Knowing its healthy and organic and truly smells like I am using fresh oranges on my skin. Wakes me up in the morning and refreshes my face for a good night sleep.  Thank you vitamin C.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a month and I tried very hard to incorporate it into my routine and to make it work. I am in my 30&#x27;s, have very sensitive, clog-prone skin, but I gave this a fair shot and even patch tested it on one area to see if it was different than an area without it. But after a month I have to say it&#x27;s very hard for me to tell what it does. The texture and smell don&#x27;t offend me at all, but the citrus may be a little bit much for my skin, personally, which wouldn&#x27;t be the fault of the company but perhaps I can&#x27;t use Vitamin C serums. I didn&#x27;t feel it made my skin any worse though, and that&#x27;s really saying something because I do clog easily and react to many things. (A cleanser I used before this with citrus gave me a bad rash) So I will continue to try this and I will update this review if there is any new developments but for me personally I may not be the target for this product.</li>
            <li> I use only organic skin products and this company makes some of the best!  The price seems to be in line with other similar products yet it delivers so much more.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference?  Not sure I understand what all the hype is about?  I&#x27;m still waiting to see if a difference appears.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see the standard \\&quot;USDA organic\\&quot; sign anywhere on the package/product! Why lie? Just say what the product really is!</li>
            <li> Have not been able to tell much of a difference yet. Have used for only two weeks.</li>
            <li> This product is truly a miracle!  It has gotten rid of my long-time acne and my skin feels great!!  I will definitely be buying more very soon :)</li>
            <li> Not great for sensitive skin types.  Seems to be too strong.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! It has great ingredients and leaves my skin with a beautiful glow! The price point is great too....As a licensed esthetician, I have access to some amazing professional products and I have to say that I&#x27;m very impressed with this over the counter serum. One other key ingredient to a great skin care regimen is Vitamin A so I still top off this serum with my usual Environ Vitamin A products.</li>
            <li> Before I purchased the Vitamin C Serum, I read a lot of the reviews.  This really helped me decide that I should purchase and try it out for myself.  I use the product after washing my face at night, then in the morning.  I feel like I look brighter and my skin feels like it has tighten overnight.  You only need a little bit, like a pea size that can be distributed all over your face.  For me, I started doing it just at night or in the morning, but not both.  My skin is very sensitive and I think doing it at night and morning was too much for me.  Either way, when I use it, I love the glow I have and how soft my face feels.  I want to stock up on this product because when something works, I don&#x27;t want to take a chance that it isn&#x27;t available anymore.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this product.  I mean, how can a bunch of needles help my skin?  It didn&#x27;t make sense to me.  However, I took the plunge and so far, the results seem positive.  I was using this by itself for the first several days I had it and I just gently rolled it over my skin.  It seems to me like the skin tightened up after a few days of use.  I came back and read the reviews and ended up ordering the Vitamin C Serum.  I have rosacea and didn&#x27;t really think this roller and the serum would do anything to help with that; I was mostly hoping for improvement in the appearance of my pores and the little wrinkles that I blame on my husband. :)  After using the vitamin C serum along with the roller, my husband remarked that my face didn&#x27;t seem so red.  I will continue to use both products and will update when I have more solid results to report.  So far, I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li> Really love this serum. I waited a while before reviewing because with my older skin, it took a bit to notice change. I use it morning and night and it is very soothing. I will continue to purchace this product!</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> I have noticed over the last few years that my skin doesn&#x27;t have the brightness and vitality that it used to. Between too much sun exposure and chemotherapy,  my face and neck are really beginning to show signs of aging. But lucky for me, I have been researching different products that claim to rejuvenate and refresh aging skin and in that search I came across a wonderfully worthy company that makes several rejuevenating products.  One of these products is the Petunia Skincare Vitamin C Serum.  I worked it into my existing beauty regimen a couple weeks ago, started with just a little application in the evening followed by a deep moisturizer and then gradually added a second application in the morning- again followed by moisturizer . The results are slow and subtle (but I didn&#x27;t get all this skin damage overnight...so it&#x27;s going to take a little patience to reverse it) but my fine lines are somewhat diminished and my skin has a refreshing brigthness that I&#x27;ve been missing.  I should have started using this ten years ago, but I&#x27;m doing it now and based on my positive experience with Petunias brand, I bet I&#x27;ll be checking out their whole line!  I did receive free or deeply discounted product from Petunia Skincare and their PR firm for the purpose of testing.  My review is my own honest opinion and I am happy to declare that I love it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a college student, I have a horrible skin and my face is infested with stupid acne and acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;In the past I&#x27;ve tried sooo many expensive products to get rid of acne scars and none of them ever worked. Eventually I grew skeptical of everything I see on Amazon because I always see 5 star rating on every product I bought which never worked on me and it seemed like lots of companies write good reviews themselves to make them look good. I&#x27;m not saying all the reviews written for this product are genuine because I&#x27;m still a skeptical person, I believe that there are lots of companies writing fake reviews but I&#x27;m giving 5 star rating for this product because this is the only product that actually worked for the first time with my acne scar. I knew from lots of research that vitamin C serum is really good for acne/acne scars, and my acne started fading away just after one week of use. I still get acne on my face but it does a really good job removing acne scars! I&#x27;ve honestly cried so many times because of my horrible skin and I always wore foundation to school everyday to cover them up which probably made them worse. I&#x27;m still not confident enough to go out without foundation but my skin is getting much better. I&#x27;ve tried products like proactiv and acne.org before and none of them ever really stopped me from getting acne or treated acne scars. This product doesn&#x27;t stop you from getting new acne because I still get acne but it definitely treated my acne scars and stupid red spots. I feel like this is the only product I&#x27;ve ever bought on Amazon that costs over $20, have really good reviews and ratings and ACTUALLY WORKED!</li>
            <li> No difference!! Cloudy sticky stuff</li>
            <li> I have been using the Vitamin C Serum for a couple of weeks and I am now beginning to see a difference of&lt;br /&gt;skin.  My skin pores look much tighter, the fine lines seem to have decreased.  I am going to continue using the&lt;br /&gt;product with a moisturizer as long as I continue to see skin improvement.  I am 62 years old and looking to keep&lt;br /&gt;those wrinkles and uneven tones away as long as I can.</li>
            <li> This vitamin c serum has made my skin extremely soft to touch and the fine lines around my eyes have diminished drastically to the point when I smile you can&#x27;t really see the lines around my eyes. It&#x27;s definitely an effective anti-aging serum.&lt;br /&gt;I like how it:&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs very well into the skin&lt;br /&gt;Has a nice orange smell to it&lt;br /&gt;Perfect consistency to it&lt;br /&gt;Dries within 5 mins and is not sticky</li>
            <li> Smooth as it goes in…I really feel that the wrinkles are much less noticeable  I don&#x27;t know what else to say</li>
            <li> I am a licensed Aesthetician, and I dermaroll my face. This product is perfect for putting on immediately afterwards, as it protects my skin with a thin barrier. I will buy this again. It comes off easily with water. I have extremely sensitive skin, and I have no problems or allergies to it, which is a great comfort. I would highly recommend this product for this purpose.</li>
            <li> I have used so many vitamin C serums. This one is nice and very light. I like that I can mix my other products with it.</li>
            <li> I find it funny that it took longer to process my order then shipping it. Nevertheless, I&#x27;m looking forward for it&#x27;s results. What made me want to buy this serum is mainly because the seller is very informative on its product and I appreciate the fact that they took the time to answer my question. Yes you can use this on your lips lol. Mind you I&#x27;m only on my early 20&#x27;s but I&#x27;m all about healthy choices and longevity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is very silky and soothing to the skin. Very hydrating. Non sticky and non oily.</li>
            <li> Update August 13, 2015:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received a sample of the reformulated serum to test.  I&#x27;ve used it for about a week now, in the morning, and I still find it to be an excellent product, although there are definitely some differences after the reformulation.  Some notes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) Still does not cause breakouts, is not drying, and has not caused any rashes.  So the reformulation still works with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;(2) This product has much less color than the last version.  It&#x27;s still translucent, but I would no longer call it &amp;#34;golden brown.&amp;#34;  There might be a tinge of color to it, but it is much less than before.  It appears that some of the plant pigments (astaxanthin, lycopene, beta carotene) have been removed, which would account for the change in color.  Please note that this may result in a decrease in antioxidant content of the serum, as well.&lt;br /&gt;(3) This product has less of a scent than the last version.&lt;br /&gt;(4) I am pleased to note that this now specifies that the hyaluronic acid is plant-based -- this product is now vegan and cruelty free, if those are of concern to you.&lt;br /&gt;(5) This is still moisturizing, but it dries quickly and does not interfere with the application of makeup.  (I am using it in the morning after toner and before moisturizer, SPF, and primer.)  So it is a good choice for both summer and winter, if you want to minimize the number of products you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, I am less enamored of the eyedropper than I was when I first received this product last year.  Since I wrote my original review, I have had a chance to try a lot of competing products, and have experienced a lot of different types of dispensers.  I have come to the conclusion that I actually don&#x27;t care for eyedroppers.  On the one hand, it may be necessary because this is pretty thin in consistency (more liquid-like and not so gel-like).  On the other hand, you basically have to use the dropper to put this in your hand before using your fingers to apply it to your face, and the product tends to run when you do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, my skin is still in good shape after using this (in fact, breakouts are healing quickly) and I like how quickly it absorbs (as well as the performance under makeup).  So the product itself is good, I&#x27;ve just lost some of my enthusiasm for the applicator.  4.5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of weeks ago, I began considering trying a serum for the first time, and had been researching them online.  So, when I was offered the chance to receive this serum for review, I agreed.  Because I have not used any similar products in the past, I can only comment on my results with this one in particular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, there are several conditions that must be met for me to continue using any skincare product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) Does not cause breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;(2) Does not dry the skin (I have dry skin, especially on my cheeks, and it&#x27;s winter here).&lt;br /&gt;(3) Does not cause an allergic reaction (I have sensitive skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of weeks of use, I am happy to report that this serum satisfies all of these conditions (which I consider to be essential).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is a golden brown color and is translucent-to-opaque.  It has a slight odor, but I don&#x27;t really have an opinion about the odor.  It&#x27;s not bad and it&#x27;s not medicinal.  I think this may just be the natural smell and color of the ingredients when mixed together.  I note that this contains many plant extracts and pigments (i.e., astaxanthin, lycopene, beta carotene, etc.), and that I would expect these to give the color I see (I&#x27;ve got a Ph.D. in biochemistry and have also taken a lot of botany classes, so I know a bit about plant pigments).  It is nice to know this product contains no artificial colors or fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need a lot of this to cover your whole face.  I do use a small bit more than the pea-sized amount recommended on the bottle/box, but nota lot more.  Since you get a rather large amount of this in the bottle, expect it to last a long time.  The eyedropper provided with the serum is a convenient way to dispense it without getting too much.  The only complaint I have is that the cap of my serum was secured with a strip of Parafilm (I spent a long time working in a biochemistry lab in grad school so I recognize Parafilm when I see it), which, while being watertight, is not a tamper-proof seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, this product should be used after a cleanser and toner (if you use a toner) but before a moisturizer.  That&#x27;s exactly what I did.  It spreads easily and it dries in just a minute or two (I do a hair treatment while I&#x27;m waiting so that I&#x27;m not just standing around the bathroom, wasting time).  I don&#x27;t notice any immediate effects except a bit of tightening of my skin, which is an indication that this product is going to be firming and wrinkle/fine line-reducing, at least to a degree, from the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had had some breakouts recently, and those healed pretty quickly.  I can&#x27;t say with 100% certainty that this product was responsible for the quick healing, but that is similar to one of the benefits listed on the product page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over time, I believe the hyaluronic acid is starting to exert an effect; my forehead is particularly smooth these days.  (Please note that hyaluronic acid usually comes from poultry processing, although there are some bacteria that produce it, as well.  I do not know whether animal or bacterial sources were used in this product.  But now you are aware, in case this is important to you.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this for a couple of weeks, I actually received an unsolicited compliment from a stranger (a dental hygienist, so someone who got an up-close look at my face) on my complexion.  Since this product was the only thing I was doing differently, that&#x27;s got to mean it&#x27;s working.  (I don&#x27;t normally get compliments on my skin.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.um is a convenient way to dispense it without getting too much.

            <li> First off, my skin: I have uneven, somewhat dry skin without acne but with a lot of dullness.  I do have many spots from sun damage (darn those 1970&#x27;s when we slathered on baby oil for a tan!).  Worse than my face, though, is my hands. At 45, I have old lady hands: wrinkled with practically polka dot age spots, and they are very dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Started using this on both my face and hands.  I should mention at the same time I started using a cleansing oil to take off makeup and wash (I like Julep brand).  So, with both of those products, I&#x27;m noticing some nice changes.  I&#x27;ve been using it 30 days now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the positives:  my skin is evening out and when the light hits it from the side, it looks smoother.  The dullness most apparent on my cheeks and chin is gone and the skin is more even on my entire face.  My hands as well look smoother and less wrinkled.  All of this is also without burning or stinging (like some retinol products do). So this Vit C doesn&#x27;t feel too harsh.  And the drop applicator makes applying it easy without waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The less positive: I&#x27;m not noticing a change in the age spots at all, on either hands or face. But the smoothness and evenness does make change noticeable.  Based on this, I will continue to use and repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The con:  This may be a minor thing, but there are typos in the writing on the label and the box. Somehow that struck me as unprofessional, or maybe a translation issue?? Not sure, but I did a double take seeing that the spelling and grammar rules were broken...made me wonder why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Product rec&#x27;d for review from manufacturer: however, this doesn&#x27;t change my use or opinion of product)</li>
            <li> Is a very good product.&lt;br /&gt;The product has to inform good friends</li>
            <li> I am on my third bottle; I certainly would recommend this product.  And you don&#x27;t have a monthly order.</li>
            <li> Organic Vitamin C Serum  Good  but i didn&#x27;t like it&#x27;s  smell also I feel mild burning sensation on my face every time  using it . shipping on exactly as given.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and use it in conjunction with the ProDermis Retinol night cream.  I was using something from the dermatologist but decided against another round b/c of the concern of the ingredients. I have fair fair skin, I am 45, with some lines around my eyes and slight discoloration from the sun on my cheeks and neck.  I bought this product for two reasons: the glowing reviews and the ingredients. I wanted to wait several weeks before writing my review because I didn&#x27;t want to rave about something that was in my head or something I wasn&#x27;t really seeing.  I have use this product in the morning and the ProDermis Retinol night cream at night and I have to say the results are so amazing that I have started using the Serum on my neck and on a couple of sun spots on my arm, which I only started a few days ago and already see a noticeable difference.  The tiny lines around my eyes are have decreased, as well as the sun damage on my face.....I only had a few small areas but over of a period of about 3 weeks I have seen a noticeable difference.  Neither product is irritating to my skin, does not cause redness or peeling.  I also don&#x27;t apply any sunscreen either over the serum.  I just apply it, wait for it to dry, add my blush, rest of my eye makeup and go.  I highly recommend the product.  Areas I have applied it to on my neck are fading...and it is a noticeable fade, not slight.....it is amazing.  When you apply it around your eyes, you only need to take it to your cheeck bone, that is far enough, it&#x27;ll get absorbed, that is what my dermatologist told me....and quite frankly this has hyaluronic acid in it, not something you want to put close to the eye either.  Anyway. it is a five star product w/c the five star price.  Highly recommend it and the ProDermis Retinol night cream.</li>
            <li> After first used, I can see a different in my skin.  Absolutely, love it and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 because I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week and therefore can&#x27;t rate it on long-term results. I will update my review in the future if I notice them. After one week of using it 2x a day, I can say I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin looks noticeably brighter and feels somewhat smoother. My PIH (brown spots) doesn&#x27;t look much better, but perhaps it will take longer to see a difference in that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like:&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t sting or irritate my skin, and I have pretty sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice texture that is easy to rub in.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel too sticky or goopy.&lt;br /&gt;That it has vitamin e, which makes the vitamin c more stable.&lt;br /&gt;The form of vitamin c (MAP) is more stable than other commonly used forms, which means the serum will last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;The smell. It smells strange... kind of earthy like a plant. It&#x27;s not too terrible, but it is noticeable. It goes away once I&#x27;ve layered other products onto it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;m unsure of:&lt;br /&gt;Whether or not the pH level is low enough for the product to be effective. I tested the pH of the serum in the bottle I received, and it was around 6. The sources I&#x27;ve consulted have said differing things about what pH level is best for MAP (some say 4-5, some say 6-7, etc). So I&#x27;m not sure if the pH level of this serum is appropriate. If someone else knows, please clear up my confusion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a very good product that seems to deliver what it promises. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a MAP serum.</li>
            <li> It does make appearance of skin smoother. Have been using it for just 2 weeks. Cannot tell about fading dark spots but definitely have noticed in skin texture. Smooth!!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice any results but I will continue to use it until it&#x27;s gone. Hopefully I will see some results by then.</li>
            <li> I have been pleased so far.  It has only been 2 weeks but I do think there is some difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I noticed lightening of spots and fine lines after only a few applications! I remind this product hands down.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he loves it!!</li>
            <li> its smells kinda weird. not my style at least. I will buy a different brand next time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s summer so I &#x27;m out in the sun a lot. I have been traveling and forgetting yo use the product every day. I do think my skin looks good for being out so much. I&#x27;m liking the feel of the serum.</li>
            <li> Petunia skincare has emailed me twice to get me to write a review. I just got this bottle and it&#x27;s unfair to write a review so soon. But if they want a review for about one month&#x27;s use, I would say I see no detectable changes for the better or worse. I have no idea whether this works or not as of this moment. But as of one month&#x27;s use, I see no difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks, it applies and absorbs well and I am hopeful to see good results soon</li>
            <li> I love the changes that I saw immediately and the ones that continue to make me look better. I have been using Best Natural Vitamin Serum for about a month and I am sure that I look at least 10 years younger. My skin is smoother, firmer and just better looking. Thanks Best Natural Vitamin C Serum!</li>
            <li> My derma-needle was just received and so I have only had to use it three times. I don&#x27;t see any results as yet but after reading your tips it sounds like something I should be using everyday. I will start using it every night and hopefully I&#x27;ll be needing to order from you again/</li>
            <li> I have seen visible results from using products. Skin Appears BRIGHTER AND Clearer After A Couple weeks.</li>
            <li> Awful product, greasy &amp; sticky. Foul smelling.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;serum&#x27; does not get absorbed into skin as stated. It dries as a layer on top of the skin and that is what makes you feel like it is tightening your skin. If you put another product on after applying the &#x27;serum&#x27;, then the serum becomes very watery all over again. Hence that is how you know it is not being absorbed. I used it twice a day faithfully and never saw any change in my skin, lightening, or decrease in fine wrinkles. I was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Quite nice. I&#x27;ve used Vitamin C serums before.&lt;br /&gt;This was above average and left my skin feeling nice without the sting.&lt;br /&gt;I received this serum as a test sample from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Great product my face looks and feel healthier</li>
            <li> Very good for my skin</li>
            <li> I got this product for free through a Reddit code and i will honestly say i will purchase again. this has changed my skin so dramatically. i have always looked old for my age, even as a teenager, and now at age 19 i look 25. since using this product, my skin has looked younger, fresher, and glowier. it is literally amazing. i do not know if it is this specific brand, but since it is doing wonders, i will stick with it. definitely test the product out. one thing i did notice is if i used it twice a day consistiently, my skin would get oily. so just alternate days when using it twice if you have oily skin like i do. but besides that it is great!</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  I got it free from a Reddit code and was a little skeptical at first.  When you first open the bottle, the smell is very citrusy (obviously...) and the consistency is sort of thick, not runny.  The serum is a little bit tacky at first, but dries to a nice smooth, finish.  I noticed immediately that my skin looked brighter and a little bit tighter.  I don&#x27;t use it everyday because I&#x27;ve been having trouble with my hormonal acne lately (thanks to an IUD) but when I do use it, this stuff definitely makes a different.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to give their skin a little &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It has smoothed my complexion,and I already notice a decrease in lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The product works and delivery always on time. I will definitely buy again and recommend as well.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for a couple of weeks.....my skin seems smoother, tighter and has a more even tone,</li>
            <li> Enjoy consistency of product and appreciate ingredients at an affordable cost.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This serum did wonders for my skin, my pores look smaller, it helped with my acne, etc. My skin looks glowing and in so much better condition. I actually feel okay not using foundation because my skin looks so great. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, yes my skin did clear up but its not perfect, however it is to the point where I don&#x27;t need make-up where before I wouldn&#x27;t leave the house without a little. The only real drawback is that this serum feels really sticky for quiet awhile so its not that comfortable when you first apply. Just a heads up it will take most likely over 30min to just dry completely and feel normal but it does get there. Another thing I have REALLY sensitive skin, and I have no trouble using this product at all, it doesn&#x27;t sting, itchy, or cause redness/drying effect. Hope that helps!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this serum too long but i like the way my skin feels. The great reviews are the reasons for my purchase and i am looking forward to seeing the future results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about three weeks. I also use other products so it&#x27;s hard to tell which product is producing certain results. I can tell though that my sun spots seem to have faded and I am not breaking out with acne. I would purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> I bought this Vtiamin C Serum and have been using it for the past month. Since then, I have been seeing results in reducing the redness of my skin and winkles on my face. I hope to see more results as I continue to use it! The smell of the serum is also pleasant (kind of an orange-y smell) and a little bit of serum goes a long way. I recommend!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3O4H56YXPB2S1]]</li>
            <li> Excellent serum!!!  You will see the results in matter of few days.  Your skin will look more radiant and yonger.  It is worth the try!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> I used the Serum with my derma roller. And I see amazing results. It moisturizes my skin and my acne scars are fading with only a couple of weeks use. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 5 weeks now.  I am 43 years old, and although I do have good skin, I had noticed some discoloration on my cheeks and above my eyebrows.  I have seen about 40% improvement using this product.  My fine lines have even reduced.  I&#x27;m excited about what the results will be 5 more weeks from now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using vitamin c serum for a few weeks but I look forward to using it every time</li>
            <li> This is a great skin product. Love it!</li>
            <li> Love i, but too expensive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle.  The formula is light weight and dries quickly.  For the price, it cannot be beat.  It&#x27;s packed with the most effective ingredients for half the price of more expensive (and often less optimal) products.</li>
            <li> Company is very reputable. Product works really well. Like any product of this type it requires time to notice the benefits.</li>
            <li> Love this serum! Goes on silky smooth and absorbs quickly. My skin soaks it up - especially after using the dermaroller. I use it day and night under my moisturizer and I love how it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
            <li> I used this every night and used about half dropper on my face. I noticed some brightening and more even skin tone after about 3 weeks. I applied after I cleansed my face, before my other skincare products and left it absorb for about 15mins. I think this helped a lot and I imagine applying it night and day would make the results even better.</li>
            <li> Amongst the Vitamin-C serum, you will probably like this one the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General product feel and handling: I used to get the Csi version (Vit-C only) but the Csi is 12% quoted while the Petunia (this product) is 20% rated for about the same price (while discounted). Can&#x27;t go wrong with that. Beyond the cost comparison, the product also contains Hyaluronic Acid and other goodies for your skin and has a slight pleasant refreshing citrus/orange scent. When you apply the serum, there is a smoothness to it - here again, other serum felt &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; while this one does not have that stickiness feel but is rapidly absorbed by your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness: First off, I have to let you all know that I do not rely on one product only  but usually apply this product for the first days of the week (Monday to Wednesday) and other by the second 1/2. This being said I am impressed by this product. In combination with the product cycles I use, it works well and has visible effect. Fine line wrinkles are definitely smoothed and your skin with feel fresh and firm. The company may send you Email for the first month after a first purchase (asking to rate and providing tips)  - amongst the recommendations the use of a skin moisturizer as Vit-C may dry your skin a little. In my experience, I do not notice the dryness (but did with the Csi product). I attribute this to the balance of several ingredient working together to give you a more healthy overall skin. In short, if you are looking to try a Vit-C serum, this is the one to try ... if it works for you, you will be hooked (and if it does not, I seriously doubt other brand will do better).</li>
            <li> Great product! Leaves my skin feeling refreshed and rejuvenated!</li>
            <li> This serum is the best!  My skin is totally free of any dark spots.  Even the darkness, what little I had, under my eyes is lighter.  I feel that this Vit C serum makes my skin feel firmer.  I&#x27;ve used other Vit C serums, and Petunia is the best.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, gives my old skin a glow. I also put it on my legs and makes them very smooth. You would not think a serum like this would exfoliate, but it does.  I notice a more even tone as well. also noticed the price went up, that I don&#x27;t like but it seems to last a long time, you use very little.</li>
            <li> I use this product twice daily, mostly around my eyes but lightly elsewhere, had no bad reaction to it , I use it mostly to maintain or prevent crows feet, I like the product and will continue using it</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it does everything it says it will.</li>
            <li> I have to say, the smell isn&#x27;t that great, but the product is. I&#x27;ve been using a few of the Petunia products and I have to say I&#x27;m really sold on the quality of their products. This serum is by far one of my favorites if not my favorite. Dealing with acne and hyper pigmentation pretty much all of my life, it was hard to find products that won&#x27;t continue to break me out, but will help me in other ways that I need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does that. While I found an acne medicine that finally worked for me, I was having troubles using my old cleanser (Murad) because of the acids in my acne medicine and the acids in my cleanser. The amount is so low in this, that I do not have a reaction. This serum isn&#x27;t drying and kept my face feeling hydrated. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product a few weeks now, so far it is great. I can see and feel  the difference.  I will be purchasing my second bottle.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I have been using it twice a day during 3 weeks and now see some results in my hands and my face.</li>
            <li> Product works, but takes time and is well worth it!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:6caf69fe563ece4f1987f6623032f464]] As a rule, I don&#x27;t usually review facial serums, despite receiving two or three requests a month from manufacturers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After taking a closer look at the ingredients*, I agreed, and Petunia Skincare sent a sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is hygienically packaged, remove the cap and twist the dropper on. As the video shows, the dropper allows you total control over the amount of product you use. It&#x27;s also easier to recycle or reuse than a pump.&lt;br /&gt;The serum itself has a slight herbal-medicinal scent. After application, it is not noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;Smooth it on, going outward and upward in order to facilitate lymphatic drainage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few seconds skin will feel dry and ready for the next steps...moisturizer, sunscreen, foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a serum that is perfect for even sensitive skin, thanks to the aloe and witch hazel, and a host of botanicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Ingredients:Deionized Aqua (Water), Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf (Aloe), Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (20% Vitamin C), MSM, Plant Based Hyaluronic Acid (Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide), Witch Hazel (Hamamelis Virginiana), Vitamin E (d-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate), Carbomer, Arginine, Ferulic Acid, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Jojoba Oil (Organic Simmondsia Chinensis), Phenoxyethanol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin, Gotu Kola Extract (Organic Centella Asiatica), Horsetail Plant Extract (Organic Equisetum Arvense), Geranium Extract (Organic Pelagonium Gravoleons), Dandelion Extract (Organic Taraxacum Officinale)</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff and Im a 40 yr old man.  I put it on at night because its a little sticky but I think I see a difference in my skin after a few weeks of using it.  Im hooked.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT.  I ALSO USE IT WHILE DOING MY DERMA PEN TREATMENT BEFORE, DURING AND AFTER. GOES ON SMOOTH AND DOES NOT BURN LIKE SOME OF THE OTHER PRODUCTS. WOULD RECOMMEND IT.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I did the see the difference in the texture of my skin. within a few weeks. The dark spots on my face reduce in size. I would recommend this product based on my result of using this product. i will be purchasing another bottle soon. The price was reasonable. Sorry I do not have any pic to show before and after due to the fact I am on deployment.</li>
            <li> I definitely appreciated this product it does work quickly and be prepared to stay hydrated and moisturizer as the skin Renewal and repair starts within the first use. And my skin absorbs moisturizer more quickly now. I had never tried this product before, but I would try it again. It lasts.</li>
            <li> I fell for all of the 5-star reviews and decided to try this serum when I ran out of my usual Vitamin C serum by Mad Hippie. This serum is a bit cloudier, with a slightly pinkish-orangish hue. It smells slightly bitter, but not in a nice citrus-y way. My biggest complaint is the texture - it&#x27;s quite sticky and doesn&#x27;t dry smooth at all. The Mad Hippie used to absorb beautifully and leave my face smooth and matte. Also, with this Petunia serum, I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes (for the better or worse) in my skin, where the Mad Hippie left me glowing. It will likely take me 6+ months to use up this serum, and afterwards I&#x27;ll go back to Mad Hippie.</li>
            <li> Good product. Firms and nourishes. Glad I ran across it. Thank you.</li>
            <li> So far It seems to be good I have not finished using the second bottle yet.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels great. Works well with all of my other products and did not cause any breakouts.</li>
            <li> Great product. My skin loves the vitamin C serum. I use it on my face, neck and chest. I saw a difference right away.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of sun with my work  and thought my skin could use some added nutrition. I have been using this daily for about 3 weeks. This product makes my skin feel nice but I haven&#x27;t noticed any visual changes in my appearance.</li>
            <li> Received quickly and am enjoying the product - thanks!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month now. At first I started getting zits but not too many, they cleared up fast and I don&#x27;t get them anymore. I have deep wrinkles in some areas and they are definitely softer looking. Can&#x27;t wait to see the long term effects. So far I love the results.</li>
            <li> It does fad spots when applied topically.</li>
            <li> After a few days of using this product one of my co workers actually told me my face looked radiant. Can you believe that! After a week more co workers asked what I was doing different.. I told them and 3 went ahead and purchased Petunia.&lt;br /&gt;It is 3 weeks or so and it really did firm up my face. You feel it right away.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always re-order in time before they run out and I can definitely see the difference when I am not using it.</li>
            <li> Good product. Used it for 90 days, made a great difference on my face. Used it with a derma roller, so not sure which product was responsible for the great changes in my complexion, but was very happy with the results. Have also used it on cuts to help them heal.</li>
            <li> Great Vitamin C Serum at a great price. If you&#x27;re looking for C, plus ferulic acid and Vitamin E, can&#x27;t beat Petunia Skincare&#x27;s version. Highly recommend both product and Petunia.</li>
