            <li>I can not say I liked it.  </li>
            <li>All the years of acne fighting have not been kind to me.  </li>
            <li>I am thrilled.  </li>
            <li>far as line refining and pore minimizing perhaps if I used it another 8 months I would get a result, but I will say as a skin moisturizer, it&#x27;s great!</li>

            <li>Glides on easily, nice smell and not irritating to the skin!  </li>
            <li>The lotion part is fine.  </li>
            <li>Works a whole lot better!</li>

            <li>Extremely light on the skin.</li>
            <li>Not too heavy but great hydration!  </li>
            <li>very good cream for the face especially if you have sensitive skin or rosacea.</li>
            <li>The only plus is that it smells nice and doesn&#x27;t make my face look like a grease spoon.  </li>
            <li>I gave it a shot a few more times in hopes that my lines and pores will get visibly better, but of course nothing had changed.</li>
            <li>Easy on sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It did not cause any breakouts and it is pretty hydrating.  </li>
            <li>The first time I put this face cream on, I though it had a consistency of a cleanser or one of those rinse off treatments from blemishes.</li>
            <li>an essential, works great, can not live without it.</li>
            <li>And I have large pores, especially large on my nose, but today my skin in smooth and moist and the pores on my nose are minimal.</li>

            <li>A good everyday cream for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The second one is still full.  </li>
            <li>Great product---really hides small lines and wrinkles!!!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry off my sensitive skin and stay nicely all day long.</li>
            <li>I have large pores and they do seem to be a bit smaller now.</li>
            <li>However, it offers no sun protection</li>
            <li>But this product has seriously hydrated my skin and given it a more youthful appearance.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice a dramatic change in any fine lines, though.</li>
            <li>I am 36 and have very inconsistent skin (oily and dry!)</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use Murad Pore and Line Minimizing face cream every day.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it every day!</li>
            <li> Murad products are awesome. This really helps for pores.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion on my face for years! I try other brands but i always come back to this one.  I love the consistency of this brand and formula.  I am 36 and have very inconsistent skin (oily and dry!) and i even break out if i dont take care of my skin!  This formula works great, keeps my skin moisturized, doesnt feel greasy and i dont get breakouts.</li>
            <li> I went through one tube of this and purchased another one.  The second one is still full.  It did not cause any breakouts and it is pretty hydrating.  However, it offers no sun protection and I needed this to wear under my makeup.  I ended up purchasing the Cotz Sunscreen which is amazing.</li>
            <li> very good cream for the face especially if you have sensitive skin or rosacea.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a week, and even got my boyfriend using it and we both can notice a difference in our pore sizes. I have large pores and they do seem to be a bit smaller now. I don&#x27;t really notice a dramatic change in any fine lines, though. I normally use a heavy moisturizer, this one isn&#x27;t and usually makes my face feel a little tight at first. It&#x27;s great for layering under BB cream.</li>
            <li> This product and its line is a little too drying for my middle aged skin, even though I do have oily skin and breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time finding a moisturizer where my skin doesn&#x27;t feel oily after using it. I love this stuff. I was my face 2 times a day and use this moisturizer. Even 8 hours after use, my skin still isn&#x27;t oily.</li>
            <li> Having used this product for over a month, I can say that it was a total waste of a lot of money.  The only plus is that it smells nice and doesn&#x27;t make my face look like a grease spoon.  However, it did nothing to minimize pores and wrinkles. For pore minimizing, I would recommend using Benefit&#x27;s pore minimizer.  Works a whole lot better!</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizer, but didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin at all. My pores are still raging.</li>
            <li> I use this for my night time moisturizer.  But if you need A LOT of moisture, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> Great for overly oily skin. Extremely light on the skin.</li>
            <li> Terrific moisturizer for combination skin.  Not too heavy but great hydration!  My skin looks and feels great - smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li> A good everyday cream for my sensitive skin. I like it a lot. Just a little expensive. I hope they reduce the price.</li>
            <li> an essential, works great, can not live without it.</li>
            <li> I can not say I liked it.  Pore minimizing is a pipe dream.  The lotion part is fine.  But I can get that from almost anyone.</li>
            <li> Lightweight. Doesn&#x27;t feel oily on the skin. Been using it for 2 weeks my skin tone has become more even and i have less dry patches.</li>
            <li> Best light &amp; non-greasy moisturizer.  It doesn&#x27;t dry off my sensitive skin and stay nicely all day long.</li>
            <li> The first time I put this face cream on, I though it had a consistency of a cleanser or one of those rinse off treatments from blemishes. I gave it a shot a few more times in hopes that my lines and pores will get visibly better, but of course nothing had changed. Let&#x27;s face it, pores will probably get anything but minimal, and lines with time wont go away either. Sorry...  To be on a realistic side, one thing I do look for in a lotion/face cream is easy absorbency, moisture component, and lack of residue that feels heavy, and this product fails in all.</li>
            <li> Smells good, feels good, dries quickly, not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feel. Just a pea size is all you need; face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;As far as line refining and pore minimizing perhaps if I used it another 8 months I would get a result, but I will say as a skin moisturizer, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Easy on sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Works well and is much more affordable here vs. in a store!</li>
            <li> Great product---really hides small lines and wrinkles!!! :). Glides on easily, nice smell and not irritating to the skin!  I will buy it again!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!!  My skin looks amazing in just 3 days I can see a huge difference!!  I have problem skin. Its dry and thick, and prone to acne and over 50.  I always have bumps, lots of little ones, and some big ones all over my face.  And I have large pores, especially large on my nose, but today my skin in smooth and moist and the pores on my nose are minimal. And my lines are noticeably deminished.  All the years of acne fighting have not been kind to me.  But this product has seriously hydrated my skin and given it a more youthful appearance.  I am thrilled.  Cant stop looking at my skin!! Just to be completely fair I am pairing it with a Cindy Crawford Creme de Serum. But I&#x27;ve been using that line for...ever...and this combo definately gives me a finer texture and deeper hydration. Dramatic improvement. Oh yeah and I started the Murad supplements a few days ago too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a five star product !</li>
    </ol>
