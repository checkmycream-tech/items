            <li>makes me less dry and the scent is good:)</li>

            <li> and I was surprised to see how much grim/makeup was actually left behind by the soap.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I still have some of the Benefit refresher spray left but plan to refill the bottle with this formula when it&#x27;s empty.</li>
            <li> I use it to refresh my face when it feels dry or just needs a bit of cooling.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I randomly started struggling with adult acne and this has definitely helped so much!</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all like other toners.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The toner removes any make up left behind that didn&#x27;t come off with just washing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in combination with face wash, coconut oil, jojoba oil, moisturizer and occasional Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay masks.</li>
            <li> the brand was Sea Breeze and it burned my face and had a very unpleasant strong menthol scent.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face everyday!</li>
            <li> Plus, this product is so much less expensive than other options, but works just as well, if not better, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Subtle scent</li>
            <li> I thought I already reviewed this, sorry.  </li>

            <li> Roses are such a lovely scent. Can anyone even argue? The formula in the Thayer&#x27;s toner feels gentle and smells floral and feminine.  I like to breath deep when applying it to my face. For me personally using this toner has the added benefit of aromatherapy and makes me feel tranquil just before bed time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used one other facial toner many years ago when I was in grade school the brand was Sea Breeze and it burned my face and had a very unpleasant strong menthol scent. Thayer&#x27;s is quite the opposite of that. In my nightly skin care routine I use about 3 to 4 squirts. After washing my face with warm water and Dove white bar I apply the toner onto my skin with a cotton ball and gently rub it all over my face. Including my jawline and neck. I continue rubbing and stop once everything is off and the last cotton ball comes back clean. The toner removes any make up left behind that didn&#x27;t come off with just washing and I was surprised to see how much grim/makeup was actually left behind by the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to have added this to my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> Subtle scent, skin feels very smooth and hydrated after. I&#x27;ve been using this in combination with face wash, coconut oil, jojoba oil, moisturizer and occasional Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay masks. My skin has never looked better!</li>
            <li> As a retired RN, BSN I am delighted to order this product which is excellent for so many skin irritations and certainly is, for my money, the best materials to use on a cotton facial pad to leave one&#x27;s skin  protected, renewed and refreshed.  It is very soothing to any areas of skin irritation, and used with cotton facial disc--It is an easily made soothing compress for itch or burn.

            <li> Lasts really long. Bought this almost five months ago and it still has product in it. I use it twice a day at night and in the morning. I love it has no burn or anything, very pleasant. My skin is so smooth from using this as a part of my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> Excellent shipping and awesome product! Will purchase again...</li>
            <li> I love using this in a spray bottle! Feels so good!</li>
            <li> This smells so good and helps my skin stay clear!</li>
            <li> I love this toner it is very refreshing and gentle in my skin&lt;br /&gt;and i like the smell</li>
            <li> great value, does what it says, leaves my skin very clean ready for lotion...</li>
            <li> Amazing product!! After using it, my skin is so much softer and it&#x27;s so gentle which is perfect because my skin is so sensitive.</li>
            <li> This is the best, mild, facial toner I have ever found. I like the rose petal version in particular for the excellent smell, but any of the Thayers Witch Hazel products are a great choice-- they are natural, and have no alcohol or harsh chemicals, and they help leave my skin feeling really refreshed and clean. Plus, this product is so much less expensive than other options, but works just as well, if not better, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Thayers Witch Hazel Aloe Vera Rose Petal formula is a good facial spritzer for anytime during the day. I use it to refresh my face when it feels dry or just needs a bit of cooling. Benefit makes something similar that comes in a spritzer bottle. I still have some of the Benefit refresher spray left but plan to refill the bottle with this formula when it&#x27;s empty. It would be nice if this product came with a spritzer head but I don&#x27;t know if that is the intended use. It works for me and you should try it out. I appreciate how the company reaches out to make sure you are satisfied with their product. Great customer service and super product!</li>
            <li> Great for my adult on-set acne! Smells wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I really like it but probably prefer Kate Maxwell Natural Rosewater Toner.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face everyday! I have incredibly sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all like other toners.&lt;br /&gt;I love this so much and I will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> I really love this product I&#x27;ve been searching near and far for a good toner! A few years ago I randomly started struggling with adult acne and this has definitely helped so much! And I&#x27;ve tried everything! I can see all the dirt come off with this toner every time. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Very good product! Gentle to the skin, smells good</li>
            <li> really cleans the skin without drying it out.</li>
            <li> Using this in combination with Leven Rose organic jojoba oil, my skin has stopped breaking out, has a nice firmness, and is moisturized without being oily. Also, it has started fading my acne scars and begun evening out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Reduces red spots considerably</li>
            <li> My FAVORITE!! Makes my skin pore free!</li>
            <li> Thank you for the fast shipping! This product is amazing! My skin feels fresh and clean and the fact it&#x27;s all natural I love it even more.</li>
            <li> makes me less dry and the scent is good:)</li>
            <li> Does a great job. Thanks</li>
            <li> I use this every day as a part of my nighttime routine. I wish I&#x27;d known about this stuff earlier. So do my friends. When I found out how awesome it is, I ordered some for them. They love it too. I love the way it makes me feel. This is no ordinary witch hazel.</li>
            <li> I thought I already reviewed this, sorry.  I am very pleased with it, I use it twice daily and find it very refreshing. Will purchase again. Seller was right on.  Bottle sealed securely.</li>
            <li> feels good on my face</li>
