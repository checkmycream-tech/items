            <li>AND I JUST LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>have been using these for over 30 yrs and love them.</li>
            <li>I give these away as stocking stuffers to friends and family during the holidays and people seem to love them.</li>
            <li>My favorite type of toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy on gums and healthy for them too.</li>
            <li>What a unique toothbrush...easy to use, not rough on my gums and very effective.  </li>
            <li>Regardless, this has really improved her ability to brush her own teeth.</li>
            <li>Been using them for years and love the soft bristles and effective cleaning.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush that cleans the whole thing very well.</li>
            <li>Also, the right hand/left hand handles help in getting the most performance from the brush!&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t overwork the gums, but leave them feeling clean.</li>
            <li>,The dental hygienist tells me every time I get my teeth cleaned, to keep doing what I do to clean my teeth.</li>
            <li>This is a very high quality product with soft bristles that are kind to your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>may try to get the right handed version too and see how this works for her.  </li>
            <li>However, the brush might be just a bit too large!</li>
            <li>I like this brush because it easily covers my entire teeth, is soft and leaves a very clean feeling in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I love the larger size.  </li>
            <li>It also messages my gums much better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The bristles are super soft and comfortable, and the large head is built in such a way that it fits easily despite the size.</li>
            <li>i like this toothbrush because it&#x27;s BIG and easy to use...</li>
            <li>The large head and handle makes brushing a breeze and the brush lasts 7 months..</li>
            <li>I really like this tooth brush.</li>
            <li>It really and gently cleans both the teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>Not that I do that very often.  </li>
            <li>Radius Original Left Hand Toothbrush, Soft Bristles, Adult, Colors..  </li>
            <li>I love these toothbrushes, won&#x27;t go back to the old &#x27;standard&#x27; form in the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li>Strangely enough she actually uses it with her RIGHT hand?  </li>
            <li>My family makes fun of me for using this oversized toothbrush but it get my teeth cleaner than any other toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Those of us that are left handed, I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re used to using regular brushes these will fill your whole mouth and at first feel strange, but then you never go back to the skinny brushes!</li>
            <li>and then it can be melted into something new and smaller.</li>
            <li>Radius toothbrushes make my tooth cleanings go faster, less painful, &amp; more effective by far.</li>
            <li>It is worth the few extra dollars for this tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>The extra large head takes a little getting used to, and will feel weird at first, but your mouth will feel far cleaner than with a normal brush.</li>

            <li> but I think that once you brush your teeth with this extra large bristled head, you will not want to go back to your regular small sized tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> looks strange</li>
            <li> and I cannot reach my back teeth due to the size of the bristle head.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Radius for years and could never think of switching back to a conventional toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but after using, I like the bigger brush.</li>
            <li> too big for little ones mouth</li>
            <li> the bristles are that wide.</li>
            <li> Not sure why, since she is left handed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this one, however, has bristles that are too stiff -- not soft as described...</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these toothbrushes a few years ago on a clearance sale</li>
            <li> but why do I always get a green one!?</li>
            <li> still not sure what &amp;#34;adult colors&amp;#34; are</li>
            <li> These have been around since at least 1991.</li>

            <li> This is a substantial tooth brush.  I love the larger size.  It is easier to brush gums and teeth. Also I am left handed and it is easier to use.</li>
            <li> My daughter Is left handed and this tooth brush is so perfect for her. My son had one all ready and now I plan to get one great tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I really like this tooth brush. It&#x27;s easy on gums and healthy for them too. It lasts a long time. I plan to use this bush from now on. It really and gently cleans both the teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Best tooth brush there is!</li>
            <li> Been using them for years and love the soft bristles and effective cleaning.</li>
            <li> I only received one toothbrush in the two pack!</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush I am switching from a Sonic to a manual and this brush has great coverage. The large head and handle makes brushing a breeze and the brush lasts 7 months..</li>
            <li> I like this brush because it easily covers my entire teeth, is soft and leaves a very clean feeling in my mouth.  It also messages my gums much better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have my wisdom teeth and I cannot reach my back teeth due to the size of the bristle head.  If you have a smaller mouth, this toothbrush is not for you.</li>
            <li> What a unique toothbrush...easy to use, not rough on my gums and very effective.  I am so  glad I found it; I love it and had to order more.</li>
            <li> This is the best tooth brush I have ever had.  My dentist has been impressed. I no longer accept the one he provides after each check-up.</li>
            <li> I got the left handed one of these and it works well for my mom who has a movement disorder.  Strangely enough she actually uses it with her RIGHT hand?  Not sure why, since she is left handed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may try to get the right handed version too and see how this works for her.  Regardless, this has really improved her ability to brush her own teeth.</li>

            <li> My family makes fun of me for using this oversized toothbrush but it get my teeth cleaner than any other toothbrush. Those of us that are left handed, I highly recommend this. It gets your gums too the bristles are that wide.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are excellent. They don&#x27;t overwork the gums, but leave them feeling clean. The bristles are super soft and comfortable, and the large head is built in such a way that it fits easily despite the size. The extra large head takes a little getting used to, and will feel weird at first, but your mouth will feel far cleaner than with a normal brush.</li>
            <li> Have always loved my Radius toothbrushes... this one, however, has bristles that are too stiff -- not soft as described... but I will keep it.</li>
            <li> 3-toothbrushes, were shown, and that&#x27;s what I thought I was buying,  only one (1) tooth brushed was shipped from Amazon.  I have been ordering them by the case of six (6) several times from the Vitamin Shoppe, I have been using this type toothbrush for years. ,The dental hygienist tells me every time I get my teeth cleaned, to keep doing what I do to clean my teeth. The price I paid Amazon was the retail price.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush that cleans the whole thing very well. Hence the name .</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, but why do I always get a green one!?</li>
            <li> On time and well packaged.  I was skeptical at first but after using, I like the bigger brush.</li>
            <li> Radius Original Left Hand Toothbrush, Soft Bristles, Adult, Colors..  i like this toothbrush because it&#x27;s BIG and easy to use... still not sure what &amp;#34;adult colors&amp;#34; are</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these toothbrushes a few years ago on a clearance sale and I decided to buy another one to have on hand.&lt;br /&gt;It looks strange but I think that once you brush your teeth with this extra large bristled head, you will not want to go back to your regular small sized tooth brush.  It is worth the few extra dollars for this tooth brush.  You will love it!!!</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes, won&#x27;t go back to the old &#x27;standard&#x27; form in the foreseeable future. Radius toothbrushes make my tooth cleanings go faster, less painful, &amp; more effective by far. Even my wife has noticed the difference!</li>
            <li> BEST TOOTH BRUSH EVER...STARTED USING THIS TYPE OF BRUSH OVER 5 YEARS AGO AND I JUST LOVE IT. WHEN I CAN&#x27;T FIND IT IN THE VITAMIN STORE I ORDER ONLINE...YOU SHOULD GIVE IT A TRY.</li>
            <li> have been using these for over 30 yrs and love them. my son has CF and it made all the difference in the world for his teeth and gums</li>
            <li> These are the best toothbrushes.....the BEST. The size cleans not just the teeth but gives the gums an excellent massage. Also, the right hand/left hand handles help in getting the most performance from the brush!&lt;br /&gt;A really good tooth brush.</li>
            <li> These have been around since at least 1991. Covers all of your teeth, from gum line to end/top of tooth. If you&#x27;re used to using regular brushes these will fill your whole mouth and at first feel strange, but then you never go back to the skinny brushes!</li>
            <li> too big for little ones mouth</li>
            <li> I have been using the Radius for years and could never think of switching back to a conventional toothbrush. I give these away as stocking stuffers to friends and family during the holidays and people seem to love them.</li>
            <li> My favorite type of toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I tried this after receiving a coupon.  The head of the brush is too big. It is like chewing on a dish brush. Not that I do that very often.  If you are Mick Jagger, this would be awesome. It is 100% recyclable, though and I like that. I am toughing it out for the 60 days and then it can be melted into something new and smaller.</li>
            <li> 1 thought I ordered 3 but only one was sent. Brush is good</li>
