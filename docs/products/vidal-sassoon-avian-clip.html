    <ol>
            <li>Very attractive, sleek, polished design.  </li>
            <li>Also, the price is just great!!!!</li>
            <li>Great for the price as well!</li>
            <li>Best Hair Clip I have ever owned-</li>
            <li>Mine is still in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>This clip is a great alternative to a Ficcare.</li>
            <li>If the print&#x27;s not your thing, it&#x27;s great to know that you can remove it and even paint the clip to your</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d trust it for a formal hairstyle, but if you are reading or playing on the computer and need your hair out of your face immediately and w/o fuss, this is a great tool.  </li>
            <li>This is a great addition to my accessories.  </li>
            <li>Great quality metal and spring system.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, attractive, and IT WORKS!</li>
            <li>A good look &amp; a good buy.</li>
            <li>It looks good, holds well, and seems well-made.</li>
            <li>The enamel is good.</li>
            <li>as good as Ficcare at</li>
            <li>Good price for a hair guru clip.</li>
            <li>, so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good buy.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s cute and works great, nice to use instead of an elastic.</li>
            <li>I love this clip!</li>
            <li>The best thing about this clip is that the colored design removes easily with acetone, revealing a smooth and shiny silver surface.</li>
            <li>I love that this very strong clip keeps it all in place!</li>
            <li>No tearing, doesn&#x27;t get caught, curves nicely to lay against the head.</li>
            <li>It is metal and is a very strong clamp.</li>
            <li>It holds my hair very secure and looks so nice.</li>
            <li>Would be better with teeth.  </li>
            <li>These clips hold my hair up in a cute twist without breaking hairs or pulling.  </li>
            <li>Also kind of molds around the shape of your head, so comfortable to wear for 12-hour shifts.</li>
            <li>I have a medium size Ficcare that I love.</li>
            <li>These are JUST the clips I had been searching for  : )  </li>
            <li>Love my clip.  </li>
            <li>well most of the time</li>
            <li>This is my favorite clip.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad to have found it again</li>
            <li>I  love the clip  </li>
            <li>A sleek rather sophisticated look for keeping hair out if the way during routine activities.</li>
            <li>Looks elegant.</li>
            <li>If you have used the Ficcare Maximus clip it is comparable but without the teeth on the inside that most of Ficarre clips have.</li>
            <li>Love this clip, holds my hair in place.</li>
            <li>No teeth like the ficcare has.&lt;br /&gt;Metal bends very easily, which isn&#x27;t the best but is easy to bend back.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good clip for the price.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and slips out more than the clips with teeth.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to insert.  </li>
            <li>This thing is so strong.</li>
            <li>Works wonderfully to hold back lots of hair, very gentle.</li>
            <li>I think if you use clips like this one, this will work just fine for you.</li>
            <li>I needed a clip to hold my medium length, semi fine hair.</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair or even the weight of something holding your hair bothers you</li>
            <li>a much lower price- LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>they are available.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable too.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great value.</li>
            <li>I have an avian clip that is 5-6 years old and a good deal worn.</li>
            <li>I love this clip so much I wish I could find it in more colors/patterns.</li>
            <li>A bit smaller, and silver but very nice and under $10.  </li>
            <li>say “I want the Avian hair clip back”  Update to review 3/20/2016 -- A successful substitue can be found:  by SCUNCI  CONCRDE CLIP ...</li>
            <li>I have very long hair and fly aways from always wearing my hair in a ponytail.  </li>
            <li>I really like it and plan to get more.</li>
            <li>then close the top gently over the pinned bun.</li>
            <li>very useful just right for my hair.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t rip it out of your hair quickly or it will tear your hair.</li>
            <li>This beautiful clip really holds hair securely and does not get tangled and does not pull hair out from the roots like other clips that have &#x27;teeth.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>Great clip for holding up long straight hair.  </li>
            <li>This one is really sturdy and the spring is strong.  </li>
            <li>Holds for most of the day before redoing, but simple and easy to redo.</li>
            <li>It is a large metal clip and holds all of my hair securely.  </li>
            <li>However for the price differenceit&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve ever used a pencil to keep your hair up, it&#x27;s similar, just more secure and decorative.</li>
            <li>Compared to a Ficcare, the metal is flimsier (which I guess is to be expected), the gap for your hair between the top and bottom parts is narrower, and it doesn&#x27;t have the teeth on the underside of the top part.  </li>
            <li>I am THRILLED to find the clip available on amazon.com ... especially because the price is so reasonable.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a nice clip to hold my hair back as it grows out.  </li>
            <li>I have very long hair and these clips hold VERY well, plus the shape of them make them very comfortable to wear  : )  </li>
            <li>While this doesn&#x27;t have teeth like a Ficcare does, it still holds up my almost-Classic-length hair if I twist it up just right.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very large.  </li>
            <li>This is a big clip, if you have shorter hair, or very fine hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very nice clip, but unfortunately I can&#x27;t use it because my hair is too fine!</li>
            <li>Its not as amazing as the original version, and there aren&#x27;t any other color options, but it still does the job, and at a much lower price point.  </li>
            <li>The price and quality of this clip is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I bought two of these as this is the first clip that can hold all my hair, and hold it in place.</li>
            <li>I only wish it came in more colours.  </li>
            <li>I only wish these came in more colors.</li>
            <li>This thing is pretty</li>
            <li>Works great for my medium thick hair.</li>
            <li>I kept it, so I can can give it to a relative that has coarser hair and may be able to use it.</li>
            <li>This is a great clip for thick hair.</li>
            <li>I wish they had more in several colors/</li>
            <li>This is a very close second and comes at a much better price.</li>
            <li>The price was high, but because the clip works so well, it was worth the money.</li>
            <li>The metal is different but strong.</li>
            <li>The clip is large, holding lots of hair.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t comment on durability, but overall I&#x27;ve been pretty pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li>edited to add: this clip works best when you make a loose bun of your hair at the back of your head, hold the bun against your scalp and after opening the clip, use the bottom metal piece like a hair stick (weaving it in and out of the loose bun)</li>
            <li>My only real gripes are that it turned out to be longer and a bit pointier than I was expecting and the &amp;#34;tortoiseshell&amp;#34; painted on the top looks cheap--but for $6, I can live with that.  </li>
            <li>I never use this clip because it just doesn&#x27;t hold my tailbone length, straight hair.  </li>
            <li>Maybe with very curly hair</li>
            <li>Seems very durable.</li>
            <li>an at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Probably won&#x27;t bother sending it back since it was so cheap.  </li>
            <li>Great poor folks&#x27; ficcare.</li>
            <li>but this style still works very well and at a much reduced price.</li>
            <li>For the price difference I would absolutely buy more of these if it were available in other colors and smaller.</li>
            <li>I have long fine hair and it stays in mine.  </li>
            <li>The package says it&#x27;s for thick hair, but my hair is fine and medium-long and it works fine for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what kind of hair this would work for.  </li>
            <li>It is larger (5.5&amp;#34;) than my Ficcare (4&amp;#34;) and no teeth.</li>
            <li>I like these curved ones a little better.  </li>
            <li>Since then, that seller discontinued carrying the clip and I have searched nearly 4 years for a seller.</li>
            <li>If your hair is thick or long, you will be very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>This one is bigger than some of the others I have, so its worth a try for people with long, thicker hair.</li>
            <li>I have several clips that are long and straight.  </li>
            <li>Lovely clip, holds my thick curls and seems as if it will be long lasting.</li>
            <li>The only thing missing versus the expense ficcare ones is the little grips on the top to hold in your hair.  </li>
            <li>I have long, thick, but slippery hair that slips out of clips easily.  </li>
            <li>But I think people with full or thick hair might not have that problem.</li>
            <li>I ordered this clip not realizing how strong it would be; I now realize it is too heavy and will actually pull on my hair and bring it down.</li>
            <li>The only clip that holds my waist long, very thick hair up on top of my head.  </li>
            <li>While the metal used is a little lighter it still holds up very well after prolonged use.</li>
            <li>The clip has no grip whatsoever, so for those with fine, thick hair, it will absolutely not stay in your hair.</li>

            <li> Lovely clip, holds my thick curls and seems as if it will be long lasting.</li>
            <li> The only thing missing versus the expense ficcare ones is the little grips on the top to hold in your hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick, but slippery hair that slips out of clips easily.  </li>
            <li> But I think people with full or thick hair might not have that problem.</li>
            <li> I ordered this clip not realizing how strong it would be; I now realize it is too heavy and will actually pull on my hair and bring it down.</li>
            <li> The only clip that holds my waist long, very thick hair up on top of my head.  </li>
            <li> While the metal used is a little lighter it still holds up very well after prolonged use.</li>
            <li> The clip has no grip whatsoever, so for those with fine, thick hair, it will absolutely not stay in your hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine, not all that thick, hair down to the middle of my back.</li>
            <li> This is a much less expensive version of an amazing $40+ hair clip.  </li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of money for me.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit too long for my taste...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long</li>
            <li> I have thick shoulder length curly hair and this clip really held up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bigger than my other &amp;#34;fakkare&amp;#34; clips, as the online community calls them.  </li>
            <li> I have very long (butt length) hair of medium thickness</li>
            <li> I also have the Ficcare version of this that I spent about $40 on.  </li>
            <li> Oh and it is made in CHINA, expected Sassoon to be USA made.</li>
            <li> This hair clip works well for those with thick hair that have difficulty finding clips that actually work and don&#x27;t break.  </li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t thick enough for this to hold it.</li>
            <li> This clip can hold up my very long and thick hair without any stress or strain on my scalp or other hair.</li>
            <li> It is very heavy and hard to push down to get the clip to open.</li>
            <li> This clip holds it up (with a few adjustments) for hours on end.</li>
            <li> I bought this clip and have been wearing it for a few hours.  </li>
            <li> Very tight hold.</li>
            <li> I bought 4 and use them everyday!</li>
            <li> but it is so heavy it pulls my hair!  </li>
            <li> Not sure I will ever find a use for it.</li>
            <li> and it is very heavy.</li>
            <li> Hard to imagine.  </li>
            <li> I have thick BSL 2a/2b hair and this clip can contain it all.</li>
            <li> I recommend it for anyone with thick hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got thick hair just below the shoulders.  </li>
            <li> A  very small pattern defect but not bothersome.</li>
            <li> Is it metal and very heavy!  </li>
            <li> Like any long-hair fanatic, I&#x27;m always looking for ways to get my hair up!</li>
            <li> It also work on my husband&#x27;s VERY thick shoulder blade length hair.  </li>
            <li> Terribly disappointed .  </li>
            <li> This one is awful!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this clip! It reminds me a lot of Ficcare clip. It holds my hair very secure and looks so nice.</li>
            <li> very useful just right for my hair.</li>
            <li> Very attractive, sleek, polished design.  Works well for twisting my hair up in back.  Would be better with teeth.  My hair is fine and slips out more than the clips with teeth.  But I think people with full or thick hair might not have that problem.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good clip for the price. I also have the Ficcare version of this that I spent about $40 on.  This is a very close second and comes at a much better price. It is metal and is a very strong clamp. I have long, thick, but slippery hair that slips out of clips easily.  These clips hold my hair up in a cute twist without breaking hairs or pulling.  Also kind of molds around the shape of your head, so comfortable to wear for 12-hour shifts. No headache towards the end of the day</li>
            <li> Like any long-hair fanatic, I&#x27;m always looking for ways to get my hair up! This clip is a great alternative to a Ficcare. While this doesn&#x27;t have teeth like a Ficcare does, it still holds up my almost-Classic-length hair if I twist it up just right. The best thing about this clip is that the colored design removes easily with acetone, revealing a smooth and shiny silver surface. If the print&#x27;s not your thing, it&#x27;s great to know that you can remove it and even paint the clip to your liking!&lt;br /&gt;The pictures show my clip after being wiped with acetone nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> holds ALL my hair when pinned up....it&#x27;s easy to insert.  It doesn&#x27;t slip....it&#x27;s lightweight...I really like it and plan to get more.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these as this is the first clip that can hold all my hair, and hold it in place. No tearing, doesn&#x27;t get caught, curves nicely to lay against the head. A good look &amp; a good buy.</li>
            <li> This is a big clip, if you have shorter hair, or very fine hair I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.  I have very long (butt length) hair of medium thickness and this holds up a bun or twist like a champ.  It also work on my husband&#x27;s VERY thick shoulder blade length hair.  I only wish it came in more colours.  When I receive my ficcare clip I will write a comparison of the two</li>
            <li> I never use this clip because it just doesn&#x27;t hold my tailbone length, straight hair.  I have tried various hair styles and it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what kind of hair this would work for.  There are no teeth to let it grip your hair and it&#x27;s very large.  I have wavy, shoulder-length hair that I keep in a simple up twist for work.  This immediately falls out of my hair no matter which direction I clip it into.  It was a complete waste of money for me.  Maybe with very curly hair it would work?  Hard to imagine.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> It looks good, holds well, and seems well-made. I have thick BSL 2a/2b hair and this clip can contain it all.</li>
            <li> I have a medium size Ficcare that I love. This appears to have a stronger spring. The metal is different but strong. The enamel is good. It is larger (5.5&amp;#34;) than my Ficcare (4&amp;#34;) and no teeth. For the price difference I would absolutely buy more of these if it were available in other colors and smaller.</li>
            <li> Great clip for holding up long straight hair.  This beautiful clip really holds hair securely and does not get tangled and does not pull hair out from the roots like other clips that have &#x27;teeth.&#x27;  I just twist my hair a few times at the nape of the neck, hold it straight up and clamp it with the clip and let the rest of the hair flop over the clip.</li>
            <li> This hair clip works well for those with thick hair that have difficulty finding clips that actually work and don&#x27;t break.  The only thing missing versus the expense ficcare ones is the little grips on the top to hold in your hair.  However for the price differenceit&#x27;s worth it.  I only wish these came in more colors.</li>
            <li> I have fine, not all that thick, hair down to the middle of my back. This clip holds it up (with a few adjustments) for hours on end. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d trust it for a formal hairstyle, but if you are reading or playing on the computer and need your hair out of your face immediately and w/o fuss, this is a great tool.  ----------  edited to add: this clip works best when you make a loose bun of your hair at the back of your head, hold the bun against your scalp and after opening the clip, use the bottom metal piece like a hair stick (weaving it in and out of the loose bun) then close the top gently over the pinned bun. That method will get it to stay for hours. If you&#x27;ve ever used a pencil to keep your hair up, it&#x27;s similar, just more secure and decorative.</li>
            <li> This thing is pretty and I use it to fancy up my hair after I put it up with things that actually grip - don&#x27;t buy this thinking it will hold your hair.</li>
            <li> The only clip that holds my waist long, very thick hair up on top of my head.  When I finally located them I bought a dozen so I will never be without again.</li>
            <li> These are JUST the clips I had been searching for  : )  I have very long hair and these clips hold VERY well, plus the shape of them make them very comfortable to wear  : )  Also, the price is just great!!!!</li>
            <li> Love my clip.  This is a great addition to my accessories.  It&#x27;s bigger than my other &amp;#34;fakkare&amp;#34; clips, as the online community calls them.  There are no teeth, but I like that because I have waist length (when straightened), kinky textured hair (4a) and those teeth snag the heck out of my hair.  This one is really sturdy and the spring is strong.  Great for the price as well!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this style of clip ANYWHERE but here. I bought 4 and use them everyday!</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t thick enough for this to hold it.</li>
            <li> It is a bit too long for my taste...</li>
            <li> Best Hair Clip I have ever owned- as good as Ficcare at a much lower price- LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and fly aways from always wearing my hair in a ponytail.  This clip keeps my hair up in a neat bun all day without having to readjust.  Also doesn&#x27;t give me a headache like some clips do.  I wear it every day.  Seems very durable.</li>
            <li> Lovely clip, holds my thick curls and seems as if it will be long lasting. A  very small pattern defect but not bothersome. Good price for a hair guru clip.Oh and it is made in CHINA, expected Sassoon to be USA made.</li>
            <li> This thing is so strong. Don&#x27;t rip it out of your hair quickly or it will tear your hair. But it&#x27;s cute and works great, nice to use instead of an elastic.</li>
            <li> I bought this expecting it to be a cheaper version of a Ficcare Maximas clip--which it sort of is.  Compared to a Ficcare, the metal is flimsier (which I guess is to be expected), the gap for your hair between the top and bottom parts is narrower, and it doesn&#x27;t have the teeth on the underside of the top part.  That said, it still does the job and stays in place well most of the time, so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good buy.  My only real gripes are that it turned out to be longer and a bit pointier than I was expecting and the &amp;#34;tortoiseshell&amp;#34; painted on the top looks cheap--but for $6, I can live with that.  The package says it&#x27;s for thick hair, but my hair is fine and medium-long and it works fine for me.  I haven&#x27;t had it long so I can&#x27;t comment on durability, but overall I&#x27;ve been pretty pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li> Does not hold my escape artist hair. Seems comfy but I can not keep it in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have an avian clip that is 5-6 years old and a good deal worn. I have managed to not misplace it.  This is my favorite clip.  I am so glad to have found it again an at a reasonable price.  I  love the clip  but Vidal Sassoon has discontinued it.  Terribly disappointed .  If you’d like it back in production – go to their facebook page say “I want the Avian hair clip back”  Update to review 3/20/2016 -- A successful substitue can be found:  by SCUNCI  CONCRDE CLIP ...A bit smaller, and silver but very nice and under $10.  I bought several with they are available.</li>
            <li> About 5 years ago I purchased this clip at the Vermont Country Store for about $14. The price was high, but because the clip works so well, it was worth the money. Since then, that seller discontinued carrying the clip and I have searched nearly 4 years for a seller. I am THRILLED to find the clip available on amazon.com ... especially because the price is so reasonable. This clip can hold up my very long and thick hair without any stress or strain on my scalp or other hair. It is easy to use, attractive, and IT WORKS! If your hair is thick or long, you will be very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a nice clip to hold my hair back as it grows out.  This one is awful!  Is it metal and very heavy!  It probably holds the hair back but it is so heavy it pulls my hair!  Not sure I will ever find a use for it. Probably won&#x27;t bother sending it back since it was so cheap.  I don not recommend for any type hair.</li>
            <li> This is a much less expensive version of an amazing $40+ hair clip.  Its not as amazing as the original version, and there aren&#x27;t any other color options, but it still does the job, and at a much lower price point.  Beware, the pattern is starting to peel off on the one I&#x27;ve had for about a year, but its not all that noticeable, and it still functions</li>
            <li> The clip is large, holding lots of hair.  A sleek rather sophisticated look for keeping hair out if the way during routine activities.</li>
            <li> If you can only buy one hair clip, buy this one. It is all you need. Great quality metal and spring system. Very tight hold. Looks elegant.</li>
            <li> The clip has no grip whatsoever, so for those with fine, thick hair, it will absolutely not stay in your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice clip, but unfortunately I can&#x27;t use it because my hair is too fine! I recommend it for anyone with thick hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this clip and have been wearing it for a few hours.  I have long fine hair and it stays in mine.  This one is bigger than some of the others I have, so its worth a try for people with long, thicker hair. I have several clips that are long and straight.  I like these curved ones a little better.  I think if you use clips like this one, this will work just fine for you.</li>
            <li> Great poor folks&#x27; ficcare. Works wonderfully to hold back lots of hair, very gentle. No teeth like the ficcare has.&lt;br /&gt;Metal bends very easily, which isn&#x27;t the best but is easy to bend back.</li>
            <li> I can use this to wrap up all of my hair into a bun. The hump in the clip helps to achieve this - I cannot wrap all of my hair up with clips that do not have this. Holds for most of the day before redoing, but simple and easy to redo.</li>
            <li> Way too big-not represented correctly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got thick hair just below the shoulders.  I love that this very strong clip keeps it all in place!</li>
            <li> This product is as described.  It is a large metal clip and holds all of my hair securely.  It is comfortable too.</li>
            <li> I love this clip so much I wish I could find it in more colors/patterns. If you have used the Ficcare Maximus clip it is comparable but without the teeth on the inside that most of Ficarre clips have. I prefer the ones with teeth but this style still works very well and at a much reduced price. Here on Amazon it runs about 10% of the price of a Ficcare Maximus clip. While the metal used is a little lighter it still holds up very well after prolonged use. Mine is still in perfect condition. Overall this is a great value.</li>
            <li> Works great for my medium thick hair.</li>
            <li> Love this clip, holds my hair in place.</li>
            <li> I have thick shoulder length curly hair and this clip really held up.</li>
            <li> I needed a clip to hold my medium length, semi fine hair. I ordered this clip not realizing how strong it would be; I now realize it is too heavy and will actually pull on my hair and bring it down. I kept it, so I can can give it to a relative that has coarser hair and may be able to use it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this clip not seeing that it was a metal clip and it is very heavy. If you have fine hair or even the weight of something holding your hair bothers you this isn&#x27;t the clip for you.  It is very heavy and hard to push down to get the clip to open. I returned it to Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a great clip for thick hair. The price and quality of this clip is very reasonable. I wish they had more in several colors/</li>
