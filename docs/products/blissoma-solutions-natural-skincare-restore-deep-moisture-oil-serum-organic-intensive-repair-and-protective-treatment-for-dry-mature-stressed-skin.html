            <li>The oil serum is amazing!</li>
            <li>And I have to say, this product is amazing!</li>
            <li>I have tried many oils and creams but this serum is one of the best that I have tried!  </li>
            <li>Nevertheless, using it at night on top of face cream or a facemask is ideal.</li>
            <li>I just love this product!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did!  </li>

            <li>This is absolutely the BEST!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think its worth the time to make my own when I can get  fabulous oil at a great price.</li>
            <li>this is the best facial oil I have ever used!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible (earthy), but it&#x27;s not something I love.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I would continue using this moisturizer for the wonderful benefits it brings to your skin.</li>
            <li>I feel like I have combination oily skin, (oily mostly in the t-zone)</li>
            <li>It smells lovely and moisturizes without oily residual.  </li>
            <li>My skin seems so much more even</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to use \\&quot;oil\\&quot; on my face but am so glad I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li>It is a phenomenal antioxidant.</li>
            <li>It feels heavenly and gives my skin a healthy glow .</li>
            <li>With Restore, I love everything about it</li>
            <li>and I wished I could have given more information</li>
            <li>RESTORE felt lovely on my skin, but seemed to be most beneficial in the evening.  </li>
            <li>even though I enjoyed my sample of RESTORE, I am sticking with my A+ serum.</li>
            <li>Am IN LOVE with this product.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it primarily for night use as putting makeup on top of it leaves a somewhat oily finish.</li>
            <li>I use Blissoma Smooth A+ Moisture Serum all the time and LOVE IT, so</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s full of essentials oils that I know work wonderes for my skin!</li>
            <li>What a perfect name for this product as it has certainly restored deep moisture to my face!</li>
            <li>I have been a huge fan of Blissoma for years now.</li>
            <li>This is a great facial oil.</li>
            <li>I should note that this oil has also helped to keep my face blemish free.  </li>
            <li>and I am so happy to make it part of my daily skincare routine.</li>
            <li>showed some remarkable improvement after two weeks of daily application.</li>
            <li>It has a very light feeling to me and it is totally absorbed right into my skin.  </li>
            <li>After using this every night for around two weeks, my skin has honestly never felt more hydrated and bright!</li>
            <li>It soaks into the skin quickly and doesn&#x27;t make me feel greasy or sticky.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the Restore Deep Moisture Oil Serum for a couple of weeks, and have been very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it every night after I wash with Blissoma&#x27;s Fresh Mild Rice Cleanser.</li>
            <li>I used it more on my elbows and the heels of my feet where I have more cracked dry skin.</li>
            <li>I dab it gently under my eyes and smooth it over my forehead, cheeks and neck.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nourishment that is immediately absorbed and gives you a glow vs. a grease appearance.</li>
            <li>I really love that this product is made of the highest quality ingredients, rich in nutrients and essential to healing and regeneration.</li>
            <li>It soaks right into my skin.  </li>
            <li>but it soaks right in and never feels greasy.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle and relaxing.</li>
            <li>and this really did help to balance my dry spots and well as give me a more radiant appearance!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>It sinks in enough to where it doesn&#x27;t get on the pillowcase and waking in the morning with soft skin is wonderful!</li>
            <li>The scent is light but earthy and makes my aging skin feel SO SOFT.</li>
            <li>It just feels smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Thanks Blissoma!</li>
            <li>I use it first and then apply moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was hesitant at first because you think \\&quot;Oil on my face?</li>
            <li>so it may be ok for people with larger pours.</li>
            <li>After a few days, my face did not look good.</li>
            <li>At first I was using too much and I was getting oily by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>This is the first type of moisturizer that completely took care of the ALL the dryness!!!  </li>
            <li>First let me say that I was chosen as a reviewer for this Blissoma product and mailed a free sample, but the opinion expressed here is entirely my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the perfect oil for dry climates and cooler weather, a night time treatment during warmer weather or skin that could use a little extra hydration.&lt;br /&gt;The oil absorbs quickly and I did not experience any skin sensitivities or</li>
            <li>I did try it in the mornings prior to using my mineral makeup-in the hopes that it is true that sometimes excess oiliness means your skin actually needs MORE oil-</li>
            <li>It really does make your skin super soft.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t smile without my cheeks looking like I was an 80 year old woman.  </li>
            <li>My breakouts were much fewer and farther between when I started using the rice cleanser</li>
            <li>I found this to be light enough not to cause break outs.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how well it quickly absorbed into my skin</li>
            <li>Thanks Blissoma for letting me try the sample</li>
            <li>This is something that I will most certainly buy again and would recommended it for everyone, even someone with sensitivity to fragrances or other creams.</li>
            <li>The oil sat on top of my skin and was not absorbed.</li>
            <li>You &#x27;re better off going to your local high end store and buying a name brand for the same price, at least you&#x27;ll be able to test it out before spending a lot of money for nothing!</li>
            <li>With the very first application of Blissoma&#x27;s Restore Deep Moisture Oil Serum</li>
            <li>I love how the ingredients are all natural and do not irritate my sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li>This product kept my skin soft and moisturized and NO FLAKIES!!  </li>
            <li>The scent is the only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about.  </li>
            <li>am a frequent oil user and usually make my own.</li>
            <li>I had never used an oil on my face before... to be honest, the idea really scared me since I have frustrating skin that seems to forget that high school was 15 years ago and breaks out even still.</li>
            <li>You could easily have this product 3-6 months as a squirt a day is all that&#x27;s really necessary, especially as your skin becomes naturally supple over time.</li>
            <li>Not only does it soak right in, but it leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I cannot thank Julie enough for helping my aging, but break out prone skin to find some much needed balance!</li>
            <li>My skin has cleared up completely and is very soft now.</li>
            <li>It took a few minutes to really soak in, but my skin was left soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I had tried creams and lotions but my skin is so sensitive that it would cause me to break out a lot.    </li>
            <li>My skin is so much softer and my texture has improved because of the extra hydration that my skin has gotten from this serum!!!  </li>
            <li>and I really like the combo, especially when using Restore.</li>
            <li>I am 46 years old, but no one would ever know.  </li>
            <li>I tried to send it back but too much time had elapsed so they wouldn&#x27;t take it.</li>
            <li>It was the missing link to the full nourishment</li>
            <li>When I heard through [...] that they were releasing a new facial oil, I had to try it.</li>
            <li>I have a skin condition called rosacea, so I&#x27;ve never really used a facial oil before because my skin is already pretty oily, especially in the T-zone area.  </li>
            <li>I have normal to dry skin and this oil makes my face glow!  </li>
            <li>Just a little disclaimer: I received this product as a free sample through the Blissoma Product Review program (with no compensation other than the sample</li>
            <li>it did make my skin feel soft and not so dry looking.</li>
            <li>I have somewhat sensitive skin with an occasional breakout in my T-zone and dry skin on my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> it did make my skin feel soft and not so dry looking.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin with an occasional breakout in my T-zone and dry skin on my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but with such a small amount to use, I did not have enough time or sample to use enough on the face to tell if it would help with the mature aspect</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t tell you what it might do long term but</li>
            <li> I have to say that I was a little skeptical putting an oil onto my face even though I have used Blissoma products in the past with no regrets, but I am so glad I got this!</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate typically my skin is so dry and flaky through the winter - but not with this!!  </li>
            <li> After using Blissoma&#x27;s Rice Cleanser, I applied the serum to the dry areas.</li>
            <li> but I do know it works for the dry part.</li>
            <li> So, on that alone I would recommend to someone who has really dry skin.</li>
            <li> I was amazed as I have had dry skin for years!  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin with a few fine wrinkles but this product made it worse!  </li>
            <li> You really only need to use a little to get the benefits.  </li>
            <li> I recently moved into a drier climate (southwestern U.S.) and was having a lot of trouble getting my skin to adjust to the lack of humidity that it had been accustomed to.</li>
            <li> It has the consistency of olive oil, so a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I have tried other oil products before but they didn&#x27;t absorb and they bothered my eyes.</li>
            <li> I only received a small sample</li>
            <li> Either way, just a little bit of this product goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> I knew this was the missing ingredient my dry skin had been waiting for!</li>
            <li> So very little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> If you are unhappy with your appearance, it is worth using.</li>
            <li> but it did not tone the oily areas down during the day.  </li>

            <li> this is the best facial oil I have ever used! my skin glow  every time i use it and doesn&#x27;t bother my  hormonal acne</li>
            <li> This is a great facial oil. I usually apply it at night. Not only does it soak right in, but it leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturized. The smell is sort of earthy/herby and is not overpowering. I love how the ingredients are all natural and do not irritate my sensitive dry skin. If you are looking for a facial oil, this is definitely one you should consider.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin with a few fine wrinkles but this product made it worse!  The oil sat on top of my skin and was not absorbed. My skin ended up looking like those pictures you see of the bottom of a lake that has mud dried up in fractured pieces. I couldn&#x27;t smile without my cheeks looking like I was an 80 year old woman.  I have never used a product that just didn&#x27;t absorb like this before. The phone I used at work ended up being covered in this oil.&lt;br /&gt;  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product. You &#x27;re better off going to your local high end store and buying a name brand for the same price, at least you&#x27;ll be able to test it out before spending a lot of money for nothing!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Restore Deep Moisture Oil Serum for a couple of weeks, and have been very pleased with the results.  It really does make your skin super soft.  I prefer oil moisturizers and this absorbs well into your skin.  The scent is the only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about.  It&#x27;s not terrible (earthy), but it&#x27;s not something I love.  Overall, I would continue using this moisturizer for the wonderful benefits it brings to your skin.</li>
            <li> I have never used an oil serum before this, so I was a bit hesitant to put an oil on my face. I feel like I have combination oily skin, (oily mostly in the t-zone) but I have dryer areas on my cheeks. After using Blissoma&#x27;s Rice Cleanser, I applied the serum to the dry areas. It took a few minutes to really soak in, but my skin was left soft and smooth. It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts for me. It is very gentle and relaxing. I recommend this product to anyone (as well as everything else by Blissoma).</li>
            <li> I just love this product! I live in a very dry climate typically my skin is so dry and flaky through the winter - but not with this!!  This product kept my skin soft and moisturized and NO FLAKIES!!  It soaks into the skin quickly and doesn&#x27;t make me feel greasy or sticky.  It has an herbal scent that I find soothing and not overpowering at all.  I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> After using this every night for around two weeks, my skin has honestly never felt more hydrated and bright! It&#x27;s full of essentials oils that I know work wonderes for my skin! I have combination/dry skin and this really did help to balance my dry spots and well as give me a more radiant appearance!</li>
            <li> I have been a huge fan of Blissoma for years now. When I heard through [...] that they were releasing a new facial oil, I had to try it. I have actually been using it for several months now and I honestly am not sure I could go without it now. I had never used an oil on my face before... to be honest, the idea really scared me since I have frustrating skin that seems to forget that high school was 15 years ago and breaks out even still. My breakouts were much fewer and farther between when I started using the rice cleanser but I was hesitant to introduce \\&quot;oil\\&quot; into my regime. The fact that my skin is also aging and seems to be on the drier side these days is what made me go for it. I am so glad I did!  I love the restore oil! I use it every morning to help hydrate my skin and prep it for my beauty routine. It smells lovely and moisturizes without oily residual.  My skin seems so much more even and so well hydrated.I would never start my days without it now. I cannot thank Julie enough for helping my aging, but break out prone skin to find some much needed balance!</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and was reserved to try this product but the cold weather and indoor heat dried part of my skin out. I found this to be light enough not to cause break outs.</li>
            <li> I have been using Blissoma products for a few months now and I absolutely love them!  With the very first application of Blissoma&#x27;s Restore Deep Moisture Oil Serum I knew this was the missing ingredient my dry skin had been waiting for! I was amazed as I have had dry skin for years!  This is the first type of moisturizer that completely took care of the ALL the dryness!!!  I was hesitant to use \\&quot;oil\\&quot; on my face but am so glad I gave it a try.  RESTORE Oil Serum does not feel greasy on the surface of my skin. It has a very light feeling to me and it is totally absorbed right into my skin.  It was the missing link to the full nourishment my skin cells have needed.  This is absolutely the BEST!  What a perfect name for this product as it has certainly restored deep moisture to my face!</li>
            <li> The Blissoma Restore Deep Moisture Oil Serum showed some remarkable improvement after two weeks of daily application. If you are unhappy with your appearance, it is worth using.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I was a little skeptical putting an oil onto my face even though I have used Blissoma products in the past with no regrets, but I am so glad I got this! I recently moved into a drier climate (southwestern U.S.) and was having a lot of trouble getting my skin to adjust to the lack of humidity that it had been accustomed to. I had tried creams and lotions but my skin is so sensitive that it would cause me to break out a lot.    The oil serum is amazing! It has the consistency of olive oil, so a little goes a long way but it moisturizes so well without clogging my pores. I use a little bit in the morning and evening, when I wash my face. My skin has cleared up completely and is very soft now. This is something that I will most certainly buy again and would recommended it for everyone, even someone with sensitivity to fragrances or other creams.</li>
            <li> I have tried many oils and creams but this serum is one of the best that I have tried!  It soaks right into my skin.  At first I was using too much and I was getting oily by the end of the day.  You really only need to use a little to get the benefits.  My skin is so much softer and my texture has improved because of the extra hydration that my skin has gotten from this serum!!!  I will be buying this once I run out of what I have.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this oil. It is a phenomenal antioxidant. It does go on somewhat thick and takes about a half hour to absorb. I would recommend it primarily for night use as putting makeup on top of it leaves a somewhat oily finish. Nevertheless, using it at night on top of face cream or a facemask is ideal. It sinks in enough to where it doesn&#x27;t get on the pillowcase and waking in the morning with soft skin is wonderful! I should note that this oil has also helped to keep my face blemish free.  When I travel it is the only moisturizer that I bring with me. It works beautifully</li>
            <li> This product, though oil-based, feels nothing like \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; oil on your skin. It&#x27;s a nourishment that is immediately absorbed and gives you a glow vs. a grease appearance. I recently started using oil-based moisturizers with a SPF moisturizer mixed together and I really like the combo, especially when using Restore. So very little goes a long way. You could easily have this product 3-6 months as a squirt a day is all that&#x27;s really necessary, especially as your skin becomes naturally supple over time.</li>
            <li> I am in love with Restore Oil Serum! The scent is light but earthy and makes my aging skin feel SO SOFT. I have been using it every night after I wash with Blissoma&#x27;s Fresh Mild Rice Cleanser. I put it on liberally but it soaks right in and never feels greasy. It just feels smooth and soft. I dab it gently under my eyes and smooth it over my forehead, cheeks and neck. It feels heavenly and gives my skin a healthy glow . I really love that this product is made of the highest quality ingredients, rich in nutrients and essential to healing and regeneration. I have tried other oil products before but they didn&#x27;t absorb and they bothered my eyes. With Restore, I love everything about it and I am so happy to make it part of my daily skincare routine. I highly recommend this product! Thanks Blissoma!</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin with an occasional breakout in my T-zone and dry skin on my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;I am a frequent oil user and usually make my own. But now that I have found the Restore I don&#x27;t think its worth the time to make my own when I can get  fabulous oil at a great price. It performs as well as oils 2-3x its price.&lt;br /&gt;I used it over my entire face every night and just on my cheeks during the day. This is the perfect oil for dry climates and cooler weather, a night time treatment during warmer weather or skin that could use a little extra hydration.&lt;br /&gt;The oil absorbs quickly and I did not experience any skin sensitivities or breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful Product!</li>
            <li> I am 46 years old, but no one would ever know.  I have normal to dry skin and this oil makes my face glow!  I use it first and then apply moisturizer.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have never used a Blissoma product before so I had no expectations. I was pleasantly surprised at how well it quickly absorbed into my skin and I did start to notice a change in the way that my skin felt and looked. I just wasn&#x27;t too crazy about the scent though. But it wasn&#x27;t enough to stop me from using the product. I only received a small sample so I can&#x27;t tell you what it might do long term but short term it did make my skin feel soft and not so dry looking. I used it more on my elbows and the heels of my feet where I have more cracked dry skin. I did try it several times on my face and it did absorb well with just a touch of shininess. I only used at night because of that. It worked wonders though on my elbows and the heels of my feet. Thanks Blissoma for letting me try the sample and I wished I could have given more information but with such a small amount to use, I did not have enough time or sample to use enough on the face to tell if it would help with the mature aspect but I do know it works for the dry part. So, on that alone I would recommend to someone who has really dry skin.</li>
            <li> Just a little disclaimer: I received this product as a free sample through the Blissoma Product Review program (with no compensation other than the sample product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant at first because you think \\&quot;Oil on my face? Won&#x27;t that break me out?\\&quot; But after reading about it, I decide to give it a shot with my regular lotion. And I have to say, this product is amazing! During winter months, my skin is a bit on the flake-y side on my t-zone but this helped stop that. It leaves my face feeling moisturized without leaving an oily mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I mix this with my moisturizer, I use maybe 3-4 drops of the product. Since it is a sample size, it does not come with the same pump the full-size does. Either way, just a little bit of this product goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> First let me say that I was chosen as a reviewer for this Blissoma product and mailed a free sample, but the opinion expressed here is entirely my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been reviewing a sample of Blissoma RESTORE Deep Moisture Oil Serum for almost a month now.  I have a skin condition called rosacea, so I&#x27;ve never really used a facial oil before because my skin is already pretty oily, especially in the T-zone area.  RESTORE felt lovely on my skin, but seemed to be most beneficial in the evening.  I did try it in the mornings prior to using my mineral makeup-in the hopes that it is true that sometimes excess oiliness means your skin actually needs MORE oil-but it did not tone the oily areas down during the day.  I had no problems or allergies with this product-it has a very nice smell.  I use Blissoma Smooth A+ Moisture Serum all the time and LOVE IT, so even though I enjoyed my sample of RESTORE, I am sticking with my A+ serum.</li>
            <li> I got this product as a back-up to the brand I usually use so I only used it occasionally. But it was the only one I took with me for what was supposed to be short trip but turned out to be a 2-week trip. After a few days, my face did not look good. I think the oil was too thick for my face and clogged my pours. I have small pours so it may be ok for people with larger pours. I tried to send it back but too much time had elapsed so they wouldn&#x27;t take it. So now I have an expensive product I cannot use.</li>
            <li> Am IN LOVE with this product. Ive used it for a month and have already been seeing great results. I bought it to help my acne scars and marks and they have lightened a lot!! My friends noticed as well. I like to mix it into my nightly moisturizer at night for an extra boost. Def buying more of this!!</li>
