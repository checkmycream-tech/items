            <li>Great coverage without looking like a pancake.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t find a good brand that I felt</li>
            <li>This foundation is gorgeous.</li>

            <li>However, I liked this.</li>
            <li>I honestly feel like I have nothing on my skin while using this product.</li>
            <li>and I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would be so nice.</li>
            <li>I actually really liked this foundation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to put on and not cake at all.</li>
            <li>for sure!:)</li>
            <li>definitely my new favorite!!!</li>
            <li>This is the best foundation by covergirl so far.</li>
            <li>I received this product free from Influenster to test and fell in love with it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and for a drugstore make up is certaintly gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I really love this foundation.  </li>
            <li>I received this product for free to try from Influenster!</li>
            <li>Such a great product!</li>
            <li>my favorite Rimmle London foundation looks like a catastrophe.</li>
            <li>this has the feeling of a tinted moisturizer but with more coverage and no sunscreeny smell.</li>
            <li>Will repurchase :)</li>
            <li>I love itl</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this foundation.</li>
            <li>I got to sample this product for free on Influenster!</li>
            <li>I really love this foundation.</li>
            <li>so I had to use a lot of concealer and powder on top.</li>
            <li>But overall it&#x27;s the best drugstore foundation I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>Very light weight and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I really loved this foundation, I always felt the foundation I had been using made my face look very oily</li>
            <li>It matched my skin tone beautifully, I would definitely recommend this to a friend!</li>
            <li>so I typically stay away from matte foundations, but after seeing some awesome reviews for this I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Not for me, it cakes into the fine lines.</li>
            <li>but this really helps to make my face looks beautifully smooth!!</li>
            <li>Not only does it give great coverage</li>
            <li>and it did great at keeping a lasting matte finish all day.</li>
            <li>It goes on so light and smooth</li>
            <li>fit my skin</li>
            <li>I received this foundation free from influenster for testing purposes</li>
            <li>Totally worth it!</li>
            <li>so this product feels very light on the skin but is very well pigmented and can be layered.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have many blemishes on my skin</li>
            <li>So I received the Covergirl ready set gorgeous through Influenster for testing purposes only, and I must say I&#x27;m glad I was chosen to try this foundation out because if they didn&#x27;t, then I probably wouldn&#x27;t have tried it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it did a great job cover mild pink zones on my face</li>
            <li>I love the blend ability of this product and how decent the coverage is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first foundation to not make my skin super oily and it matched my skin tone PERFECTLY, which is a hard task to accomplish.</li>
            <li>Blends well, the only downside really is that it kind of smells strongly.</li>
            <li>I got this product free for testing purposes in my Voxbox last week and I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>I received this liquid foundation from Influenster a few weeks ago and I love it!!</li>
            <li>right.</li>
            <li>I was very lucky enough to recieve this product free from Influenster.com for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and looks very natural.</li>
            <li>It has a medium, matte coverage, which feels soft and light.</li>
            <li>Thanks Influenster!</li>
            <li>(I really have youthful-looking skin with only very fine wrinkles, so there is an upside).</li>
            <li>It stays matte even with 100 degree weather in Southern California and blends easily.</li>
            <li>It is definitely build able but it looks very natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light with a natural matte finish that last ALL day!</li>
            <li>this was very Liquidy</li>
            <li>this is a very lightweight foundation</li>
            <li>It also is very affordable.</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and breath-able, like you aren&#x27;t wearing anything at all.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to someone who wants something new in their life.</li>
            <li>It did make my face shiny and oily after a few hours but most makeup does that to me.</li>
            <li>it is my new go to foundation.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a full-coverage, lightweight, barely there foundation.</li>
            <li>I am 48 years old and have been plagued by oily skin all my life.  </li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised by this foundation and it has made me reconsider liquid foundations.</li>
            <li>I like it way better than my amazonian clay liquid foundation from Tarte because this one doesn&#x27;t cake up if you apply a little more than usual, and it doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin while still giving me a matte finish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different oil fee foundations and I really like the coverage of this one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very watery in texture and not very buildable</li>
            <li>although it does have a slight scent it is pleasant and not over powering just smells a little like olay moisturizer but again not overwhelmingly.</li>

            <li> got this free through Influenster and will be using this over Victoria Secret!</li>
            <li> I normally am use to buying such expensive make up but this did the job with no streaks, no uneven skin tone, no caking of the face, and fills in just about any line on my face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use a powder of it like all my others, and it lasts quite a long time!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> but it wont fully cover under-eye if too dark or bigger blemishes on face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of drugstore foundations usually, as I have oily, acne prone skin, but this one actually works for me.</li>
            <li> Unlike other liquid foundations that I have tried, this does not leave that &#x27;caked on&#x27; feeling.</li>
            <li> I had a blemish the other day</li>
            <li> My face has been very dry lately without proper moisturizer</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the coverage.</li>
            <li> and you really cannot go wrong with the price.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cake up around my nose, where most foundations seem to just blend horribly around my nose.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like liquid foundations.</li>
            <li> I have a really hard time finding foundations that won&#x27;t make me break out and stay on because I have oily skin</li>
            <li> But ever since receiving this foundation from Influenster, I have put the matte down!!!</li>
            <li> Goes to show that you can have the glam without the ridiculous price!</li>
            <li> but I was wrong!</li>

            <li> I received this product for free to try from Influenster! I don&#x27;t wear face makeup often, only on my eyes. However, I liked this.

            <li> Received this in my Deans list VoxBox by influenster. My face has been very dry lately without proper moisturizer my favorite Rimmle London foundation looks like a catastrophe. I needed something smoother. this was very Liquidy but it applied evenly and was great for blending out this is a very lightweight foundation but it gave me medium coverage. it did a great job cover mild pink zones on my face but it wont fully cover under-eye if too dark or bigger blemishes on face. this has the feeling of a tinted moisturizer but with more coverage and no sunscreeny smell. although it does have a slight scent it is pleasant and not over powering just smells a little like olay moisturizer but again not overwhelmingly.

            <li> I really love this foundation. It is great on oily skin and lasts all day. I would definitely recommend this foundation to people with oily or combination skin. I tend to have an oily T-zone and it did great at keeping a lasting matte finish all day. It&#x27;s very easy to put on and not cake at all. Great coverage without looking like a pancake.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care for the color, way too orangey. Not for me, it cakes into the fine lines.</li>

            <li> This stuff is great! I usually don&#x27;t like liquid foundations. I have used the same matte formula foundation for 10 years. But ever since receiving this foundation from Influenster, I have put the matte down!!! Unlike other liquid foundations that I have tried, this does not leave that &#x27;caked on&#x27; feeling. It is very lightweight and breath-able, like you aren&#x27;t wearing anything at all. I am pleasantly surprised by this foundation and it has made me reconsider liquid foundations. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a full-coverage, lightweight, barely there foundation.</li>
            <li> I received this liquid foundation from Influenster a few weeks ago and I love it!! I don&#x27;t really have many blemishes on my skin but this really helps to make my face looks beautifully smooth!!</li>
            <li> So I received the Covergirl ready set gorgeous through Influenster for testing purposes only, and I must say I&#x27;m glad I was chosen to try this foundation out because if they didn&#x27;t, then I probably wouldn&#x27;t have tried it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay so this product feels very light on the skin but is very well pigmented and can be layered. I had a blemish the other day and it actually covered it up quite well to where I forgot that I even had a pimple to begin with!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stay power is about 8 hours but when applied with the powder, it stays a good 12 hours for me. I would recommend this product to someone who wants something new in their life. Thanks Influenster!</li>
            <li> I actually really liked this foundation. I&#x27;m not a big fan of drugstore foundations usually, as I have oily, acne prone skin, but this one actually works for me. It matched my skin tone beautifully. My only complaint is the coverage. It&#x27;s very watery in texture and not very buildable so I had to use a lot of concealer and powder on top. But overall it&#x27;s the best drugstore foundation I&#x27;ve tried and you really cannot go wrong with the price. I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
