    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This allows the reflective surfaces to meet perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Both mirrors are also mounted on an adjustable mechanism that allows you to dial in the seam perfectly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a wonderful art piece with which to spark conversation.  </li>
            <li>This one however had a perfect alignment so the image is not distorted, just the permanent mold.</li>
            <li>It arrived and Im delighted its like looking into a picture box and has opened up dimensions of myself from all angles.  </li>
            <li>Can you please just send a clean and perfect aligned mirror?</li>
            <li>This may be true, but without buying this excellent product you would never find out about all the neat things it can do!</li>
            <li>You would need two webcams perfectly aligned at eye width as well as the appropriate software and computer monitor to truly see your 3d true reflection using a webcam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The craftsmanship is amazing with this.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing invention.</li>
            <li>The seam line between the two mirrors is invisible--something I could never achieve if I built my own.  </li>
            <li>but once you look through it at your own reflection it falls out of focus and disappears.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The more you look at this, the more amazing it gets (assuming you’re the kind of person that likes to ponder the meaning of self).  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care how HD your video is, you lose some of the magic when you&#x27;re experiencing something through a screen rather than your own two eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A webcam (especially a nice HD one) does a pretty good job at showing you what you really look like</li>
            <li>it took the creator many years to build the first perfect true mirror, and he was an engineer.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s more like i&#x27;m looking at another person rather than my reflection.</li>
            <li>It helps your brain and body realize more connections, and become more spatially aware.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>Hopefully there&#x27;s another manufacturer somewhere that has taken this idea and implemented it better.</li>
            <li>There just are better options out there in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I know that John used to make the cases out of wood, but it is my understanding that they were more prone to flexing than the plastic ones.  </li>
            <li>I know that John used to make the cases out of wood, but it is my understanding that they were more prone to flexing than the plastic ones.  </li>
            <li>I would have been fully satisfied with my purchase if it had come in a nicer box, even at the cost of a $25-50 price raise.</li>
            <li>This thing in wood would truly be a magical object that me or my father would keep around a treasure for the rest of time.</li>
            <li>Can you inspect and make sure it&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s supposed to</li>
            <li>Maybe I can do another review with more details then.</li>
            <li>for the affects of the mirror I have noticed that my asymmetrical features seem even more pronounced, probably just because I&#x27;m so used to seeing the skews reversed.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a high-quality mirror that perfectly frames my entire neck and head, even at a close distance, so</li>
            <li>This is an excellent tool for personal work.</li>
            <li>it is interesting.</li>
            <li>I first met the charming designer of this product at burning man and vowed to have myself one - someday.  </li>
            <li>OR..... turn on the mirroring effect in photo booth (granted you have a mac) and get BOTH a mirror image AND a true mirror image SIDE BY SIDE for your comparison!</li>
            <li>A lot of people have been saying that this product is just a corner mirror, and that you could easily replicate the results yourself by placing two mirrors together.</li>
            <li>You can also read and harness your own facial expressions MUCH more effectively.</li>
            <li>Really interesting to see your true self.</li>
            <li>This item looks like its made of really cheap materials.</li>
            <li>I cannot see that happening with something that feels so damn cheap when you pick it up.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect display case for small objects and provides an extremely unique insight into yourself to boot.</li>
            <li>would have given it the full 5 if it didn&#x27;t feel so cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are all made by hand in the USA and each one has a unique serial.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not the full experience.</li>
            <li>The image you see on your computer screen will be 2d whereas this true mirror shows your reflection in 3d.</li>
            <li>but once I did it was way cool.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool, works as advertised.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;But even if you&#x27;re not interested in the science there is a lot to like about these mirrors, especially if becoming aware of how you truly appear is a priority for you.&lt;br</li>
            <li>On the one hand, the actual true mirror experience is great and very singular.</li>
            <li>I still haven’t ponied up for one because it is definitely a chunk of money, but I thought that while I’m saving up it would be a kind deed to all those who are interested to know how amazing these really are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Thanks True Mirror!</li>
            <li>but I believe looking at one&#x27;s true reflection for just a couple minutes a day can have a profound effect on the way you see yourself and the world-for the better.</li>
            <li>Solid wood would of course look amazing, but sounds like the payoff may not be worth it.</li>
            <li>In order for the two mirrors to look like one seamless one, the reflective surfaces have to meet in the center with an incredible degree of precision.  </li>
            <li>it worth $200?  </li>
            <li>I do not regret the purchase, the object might not have felt worth the $200 but the experience was certainly worth every penny.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it if you can spare the money.</li>
            <li>The first time I looked into the true mirror</li>
            <li>it was mind blowing and exciting and a bit spooky.</li>
            <li>yes, this is a special mirror, and given how much of a specialty item it is and all, the price does seem more or less appropriate.  </li>
            <li>Regular mirrors are just more useful for performing dexterous activities.  </li>
            <li>That being said, many wood workers use high grade plywood with real wood veneers for this same reason (most high end cabinets are built this way as well).  </li>
            <li>That being said, many wood workers use high grade plywood with real wood veneers for this same reason (most high end cabinets are built this way as well).  </li>
            <li>I found that my reflection in this mirror reveals far more depth and detail than a normal mirror</li>
            <li>I saw these for the first time at Burning Man 8 years ago and was blown away.  </li>
            <li>It will astound many to learn that their self-image has been flipped their entire lives!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First mirror received had a permanent mold in angle where both mirrors meet.</li>
            <li>I placed a cat of open cat food in front of my amazing new mirror.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real trip to see yourself the way people actually see you, and it&#x27;s definitely better than a selfie camera or seeing yourself onscreen somehow.</li>
            <li>fascinating little known invention!</li>
            <li>Because the true mirror has no resolution (other than the wavelength of light that is) you will only be able to see yourself as others truly see you using a mirror like this.</li>
            <li>For example, upon closer examination, I discovered that there are actually TWO FULL mirrors in this box!</li>
            <li>This is a cool piece of work, and the effect it gives to the psyche is quite profound.</li>
            <li>If you are applying makeup or a certain hairdo and want to see how it would look to someone else.</li>
            <li>If you are interested in improving your smile or seeing how someone else may see your smile or facial expressions.</li>
            <li>Was really looking forward to getting this.</li>
            <li>The casing looks like really crappy ikea material.</li>
            <li>The quality of this product was *not* commensurate with very hefty price.</li>
            <li>There is no seam at all between the mirrors which really makes the effect.</li>
            <li>This mirror shows you how you really appear, with correct chirality.  </li>
            <li>Also wish it had included a protective glass covering--everyone wants to touch it after seeing it.  </li>
            <li>This is very noticeable and the gap causes a distortion in the image.</li>
            <li>The seam really is invisible.</li>
            <li>If you want to really get to know yourself you can gaze into the mirror as a practice.</li>
            <li>To my knowledge the number in circulation is quite limited so if you are lucky enough to have one please enjoy it, and show your friends!</li>
            <li>If you are into meditation, magick, wicca, buddhism or other reflective philosophies you will love it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I like this image or my other image more, ​but</li>
            <li>The full length version is offered at larger than life prices no one can really afford.</li>
            <li>Replacement was clean, however there is a tiny gap on the bottom part where the mirror meets.</li>
            <li>Two specialty mirrors are angled at perfect 45 degree angles to each other reversing the normal reversing effects of a typical mirror thus showing a “true” reflection of yourself…what other people see when they look at you.  </li>
            <li>Solid wood would of course look amazing, but sounds like the payoff may not be worth it.one who has mentally left planet earth, but it is definitely a one-of-a-kind experience.  </li>
            <li>This came packed carefully and it was easy to pop out of the box.</li>
            <li>Adjust it by staring at faraway objects because any misalignment is amplified at a greater distance.&lt;br /&gt;The enclosure is molded plastic, not spray-painted wood or anything cheap.&lt;br /&gt;There is a brace affixed to the back that hooks over the included flat wall hook.</li>
            <li>I would have never gotten this from just putting two normal mirrors together.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like looking in the normal mirror anymore - this</li>
            <li>.you are very unlikely to be able to build one of these on your own.  </li>
            <li>Left is right, and right is left.</li>
            <li>Stand right in front of one mirror, preferably the larger of the two.  </li>
            <li>But people won&#x27;t always see you when you&#x27;re looking right at them anyway, and it gives you an idea what you actually look like to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear any makeup or have a whole lot of hair to speak of, but if I did either of these activities, I could see some major</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not ready to drop $200 on a true mirror</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really spent a lot of time with the true mirror</li>
            <li>I could definitely see the quality (and potential heirloom issue) taking a huge leap forward if John were to construct these out of high grade plywood instead and finish it with solid wood edging.  </li>
            <li>I could definitely see the quality (and potential heirloom issue) taking a huge leap forward if John were to construct these out of high grade plywood instead and finish it with solid wood edging.  </li>
            <li>It only took about 36 hours of continuous staring, but after that I was able to clearly see into a horrible nightmare realm of true terror and wonder from which there was no waking (a great deal for only 200 bucks.</li>
            <li>But I have noticed that if you look in at certain angles, you can glimpse a standard flipped reflection.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are looking to do some modeling or come off looking super great (or super awful if that&#x27;s your thing), then this mirror will definitely help you to see how others will see you when facing you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is something I don&#x27;t notice at all in a regular mirror curiously even when I looked specifically for it after noticing it in the True Mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do not regret the purchase, the object might not have felt worth the $200 but the experience was certainly worth every penny.ecial occasion like kids coming over for the holidays; the black plastic has visible defects from the molding process and is not exactly aesthetically pleasing.</li>
            <li>If you want hot pink just ask; they may have it in stock even though it&#x27;s not advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Dimensions</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty small mirror for such a large price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s literally two mirrors taped facing together to form a &#x27;V,&#x27; then you look directly in the middle.</li>
            <li>You definitely see a side of yourself only others normally see.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The magic behind the mirrors?  </li>
            <li>Personally, I noticed that one of my eyes becomes much larger and the other much smaller with the way I currently smile.</li>
            <li>Instead it will probably sooner or later be put away in a closet except maybe for special occasion like kids coming over for the holidays; the black plastic has visible defects from the molding process and is not exactly aesthetically pleasing.</li>

            <li> I was having a Diet Coke and smoking a cigarette while my cat played around the room. There were no open windows or doors in the space and only one area he could hide, under my desk. After I finished my cigarette. I searched the entire room and moved the desk multiple times to find Hugo, my cat. &amp;#34;HUGO!&amp;#34; No answer. Then I heard a faintly distant meowing. I placed a cat of open cat food in front of my amazing new mirror. Within a few moments I heard a bumping noise coming from within the mirror itself! This has been going on for over 24 hours and the bumping noises are fewer and fewer. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this item to anyone owning a at or small dog.</li>
            <li> This is a cool piece of work, and the effect it gives to the psyche is quite profound. Looking into this mirror is a lot different than looking into a conventional mirror. At first glance your face will seem scarily out of proportion, but after your brain gets used to it you&#x27;ll turn back into a human. I found that my reflection in this mirror reveals far more depth and detail than a normal mirror, it&#x27;s more like i&#x27;m looking at another person rather than my reflection. You can also read and harness your own facial expressions MUCH more effectively. But be warned, you may notice some asymmetry you hadn&#x27;t noticed before, this is all discussed in the pamphlet included with your purchase (which i recommend reading before looking into the mirror.)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s literally two mirrors taped facing together to form a &#x27;V,&#x27; then you look directly in the middle. Then they put it in a flimsy box. There&#x27;s is no specialty glass or wavelength or secret code into the fifth dimension. Please please please don&#x27;t waste your money unless you just want a reason to spend 200$.</li>
            <li> Mirror works well as promised. You definitely see a side of yourself only others normally see. It&#x27;s definitely a little different than the flat mirror image of normal mirrors. The biggest bonus is seeing how you look when moving. Left is right, and right is left. It helps your brain and body realize more connections, and become more spatially aware.&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is the price. It&#x27;s a pretty small mirror for such a large price. The full length version is offered at larger than life prices no one can really afford. Too bad.</li>
            <li> Was really looking forward to getting this. On the one hand, the actual true mirror experience is great and very singular. It&#x27;s a real trip to see yourself the way people actually see you, and it&#x27;s definitely better than a selfie camera or seeing yourself onscreen somehow. However, this is a really poor implementation of this idea. This item looks like its made of really cheap materials. The casing looks like really crappy ikea material. The mirrors themselves appeared warped. The knob was tiny and very stiff and nearly impossible to turn easily. The mirror was poorly packaged, and arrived at our house badly scratched, both on the mirror itself and the casing. The casing has cheesy silver stickers, that were applied poorly with bubbles in them. The quality of this product was *not* commensurate with very hefty price. We were really disappointed and have returned it. Hopefully there&#x27;s another manufacturer somewhere that has taken this idea and implemented it better.</li>
            <li> The craftsmanship is amazing with this. There is no seam at all between the mirrors which really makes the effect. It&#x27;s the perfect display case for small objects and provides an extremely unique insight into yourself to boot. If I was selling any small object I&#x27;d want a few of these to display my wares in. In my home it&#x27;s always a conversation piece. There&#x27;s just nothing else like it out there.</li>
            <li> If you want to look at a reflection of yourself that&#x27;s not mirrored, but oriented the way others see you, you can just take any two mirrors.  Basically, you just look at your reflection in one of them through the other.  Stand right in front of one mirror, preferably the larger of the two.  Now place the other mirror off to one side, and angle it so that you can see your reflection in the mirror you&#x27;re in front of (the larger one) through said smaller one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue here is that your eyes won&#x27;t actually appear to be looking at yourself, which is a bit weird.  But people won&#x27;t always see you when you&#x27;re looking right at them anyway, and it gives you an idea what you actually look like to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or you could get an HD video camera and put the video up on a monitor or TV, though there will probably be some lag, and the image quality may possibly leave something to be desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, this is a special mirror, and given how much of a specialty item it is and all, the price does seem more or less appropriate.  There just are better options out there in my opinion.</li>
            <li> anyone could put two mirrors next to each other at a 90 degree angle. seriously. there&#x27;s no reason to buy this for 200 bucks</li>
            <li> A lot of people have been saying that this product is just a corner mirror, and that you could easily replicate the results yourself by placing two mirrors together. This may be true, but without buying this excellent product you would never find out about all the neat things it can do! For example, upon closer examination, I discovered that there are actually TWO FULL mirrors in this box! Also, if you stare at it long enough, it can actually open a gateway to another dimension. It only took about 36 hours of continuous staring, but after that I was able to clearly see into a horrible nightmare realm of true terror and wonder from which there was no waking (a great deal for only 200 bucks. Have you guys seen what Necronomicons are going for these days?!). I would have never gotten this from just putting two normal mirrors together. Thanks True Mirror!</li>
            <li> I first met the charming designer of this product at burning man and vowed to have myself one - someday.  It arrived and Im delighted its like looking into a picture box and has opened up dimensions of myself from all angles.  I don&#x27;t like looking in the normal mirror anymore - this I a life changer if your open to it.</li>
            <li> The idea behind how this mirror works is very simple, but the effect is profound.  Two specialty mirrors are angled at perfect 45 degree angles to each other reversing the normal reversing effects of a typical mirror thus showing a “true” reflection of yourself…what other people see when they look at you.  The more you look at this, the more amazing it gets (assuming you’re the kind of person that likes to ponder the meaning of self).  There is no doubt Freud and Jung would have had one of these if they could have…well maybe just Freud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, LET’S SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT….you are very unlikely to be able to build one of these on your own.  Why?  It comes down to the transition point where the two 45 degree mirrors meet.  In order for the two mirrors to look like one seamless one, the reflective surfaces have to meet in the center with an incredible degree of precision.  To accomplish this, the maker (whose name I unfortunately cannot recall) uses two mirrors that have the reflective surface on the front face, as opposed to 1/8” back under glass the way 99% of mirrors are manufactured.  This allows the reflective surfaces to meet perfectly.  Both mirrors are also mounted on an adjustable mechanism that allows you to dial in the seam perfectly.  This is the only way to really get this to work as atmospheric changes in the environment are likely to cause subtle shifts to the mirrors and box and break the illusion.  In short, while the concept of the mechanics of this are very simple, the construction is much more complicated than it looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it worth $200?  That depends on what your interests are.  I say undoubtedly yes.  I saw these for the first time at Burning Man 8 years ago and was blown away.  The connection you make with yourself is unlike anything you will ever experience through a picture or video.  It is the closest you will come to meeting yourself in person. The experience is uncanny and difficult to describe without seeming like someone who has mentally left planet earth, but it is definitely a one-of-a-kind experience.  I still haven’t ponied up for one because it is definitely a chunk of money, but I thought that while I’m saving up it would be a kind deed to all those who are interested to know how amazing these really are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 12/1/2015:  For those of you who are disappointed with the plastic case...I agree.  I know that John used to make the cases out of wood, but it is my understanding that they were more prone to flexing than the plastic ones.  This in turn causes the mirrors to need regular adjustment.  That being said, many wood workers use high grade plywood with real wood veneers for this same reason (most high end cabinets are built this way as well).  I could definitely see the quality (and potential heirloom issue) taking a huge leap forward if John were to construct these out of high grade plywood instead and finish it with solid wood edging.  Solid wood would of course look amazing, but sounds like the payoff may not be worth it.one who has mentally left planet earth, but it is definitely a one-of-a-kind experience.

            <li> I have no idea why I thought this would work, as a vampire, I haven&#x27;t seen my reflection in over 200 years.  All I want to do is watch myself brush my teeth, I just wasted 200 bucks.</li>
            <li> OR..... turn on the mirroring effect in photo booth (granted you have a mac) and get BOTH a mirror image AND a true mirror image SIDE BY SIDE for your comparison! All for the low low price of free.99!!</li>
            <li> You can take any two mirrors and put them next to each other at a 90 degree angle and have the same effect. $200 for two mirrors in a box? How about $20 for two mirrors hung in the corner of your bathroom wall?</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not ready to drop $200 on a true mirror but you want to experience seeing yourself as others see you then the closest you&#x27;re going to get is a webcam or phone camera. A webcam (especially a nice HD one) does a pretty good job at showing you what you really look like but it&#x27;s not the full experience. There are two problems:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;stereopsis- The image you see on your computer screen will be 2d whereas this true mirror shows your reflection in 3d. You would need two webcams perfectly aligned at eye width as well as the appropriate software and computer monitor to truly see your 3d true reflection using a webcam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;resolution- Because the true mirror has no resolution (other than the wavelength of light that is) you will only be able to see yourself as others truly see you using a mirror like this. I don&#x27;t care how HD your video is, you lose some of the magic when you&#x27;re experiencing something through a screen rather than your own two eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve wanted one of these things for years and finally worked up the nerve to drop 200 smackers on it for my dad&#x27;s birthday present this year. The price tag definitely feels expensive as f*** when you pull this thing out of the box but I didn&#x27;t pay for the plastic, glass and metal, I paid for the experience and I can tell you the product delivers as promised on that front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given it the full 5 if it didn&#x27;t feel so cheap and flimsy. The plastic box is not even solid and you can feel the sides flex in when you lift it up. I would have been fully satisfied with my purchase if it had come in a nicer box, even at the cost of a $25-50 price raise. This thing in wood would truly be a magical object that me or my father would keep around a treasure for the rest of time. It might have even become a family heirloom. I cannot see that happening with something that feels so damn cheap when you pick it up. Instead it will probably sooner or later be put away in a closet except maybe for special occasion like kids coming over for the holidays; the black plastic has visible defects from the molding process and is not exactly aesthetically pleasing. Then the case will probably accidentally crack during a move or something and that will be that. I do not regret the purchase, the object might not have felt worth the $200 but the experience was certainly worth every penny.ecial occasion like kids coming over for the holidays; the black plastic has visible defects from the molding process and is not exactly aesthetically pleasing.

            <li> So, a couple things to note, this mirror will be helpful:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. If you are interested in improving your smile or seeing how someone else may see your smile or facial expressions. Personally, I noticed that one of my eyes becomes much larger and the other much smaller with the way I currently smile. This is something I don&#x27;t notice at all in a regular mirror curiously even when I looked specifically for it after noticing it in the True Mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. If you are applying makeup or a certain hairdo and want to see how it would look to someone else. I don&#x27;t wear any makeup or have a whole lot of hair to speak of, but if I did either of these activities, I could see some major benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a basic mirror, then you don&#x27;t need this. If you are looking to do some modeling or come off looking super great (or super awful if that&#x27;s your thing), then this mirror will definitely help you to see how others will see you when facing you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fascinating little known invention!</li>
            <li> This mirror shows you how you really appear, with correct chirality.  It will astound many to learn that their self-image has been flipped their entire lives!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful art piece with which to spark conversation.  I showed a friend this mirror and he was shocked to learn his hair was parted \\&quot;on the wrong side!\\&quot;  The designer of these mirrors is credited with pioneering a \\&quot;hair part theory\\&quot; drawing on gender, perception, psychology and the left-right brain duality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even if you&#x27;re not interested in the science there is a lot to like about these mirrors, especially if becoming aware of how you truly appear is a priority for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of notes for prospective patrons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You probably won&#x27;t be using this mirror to shave or apply makeup anytime soon. Regular mirrors are just more useful for performing dexterous activities.  But I have noticed that if you look in at certain angles, you can glimpse a standard flipped reflection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The magic behind the mirrors?  Each one is essentially 2 mirrors angled at 90º with the center line or crease carefully concealed.  As such, sometimes air pressure and humidity will slowly affect the angle of the mirrors, and you&#x27;ll have to adjust by turning a small knob on the side of the frame to fine-tune their positions every few days.  It&#x27;s not an unenjoyable process, but it does take one or two tries to get the hang of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are all made by hand in the USA and each one has a unique serial.  To my knowledge the number in circulation is quite limited so if you are lucky enough to have one please enjoy it, and show your friends!</li>
            <li> Had wanted to build one until I found this one for sale.  Quality construction.  The seam line between the two mirrors is invisible--something I could never achieve if I built my own.  I wish the bigger sizes weren&#x27;t so expensive.  Also wish it had included a protective glass covering--everyone wants to touch it after seeing it.  I call it my vampire mirror--vampires have no image in a regular mirror but their images do appear in my &amp;#34;true mirror&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing. First mirror received had a permanent mold in angle where both mirrors meet. This one however had a perfect alignment so the image is not distorted, just the permanent mold. Ordered replacement. Replacement was clean, however there is a tiny gap on the bottom part where the mirror meets. This is very noticeable and the gap causes a distortion in the image. Can you please just send a clean and perfect aligned mirror? Combine both? Come on this thing is 200$. Can you inspect and make sure it&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s supposed to so I don&#x27;t have this headache?</li>
            <li> Fantastic.  I would like one made out of wood instead of plastic.</li>
            <li> This came packed carefully and it was easy to pop out of the box. No assembly required. I was &#x27;afraid&#x27; (yeah, afraid) to look at it for days but once I did it was way cool. I&#x27;m now parting my hair on a different side. Ha! I haven&#x27;t really spent a lot of time with the true mirror yet but I will. Maybe I can do another review with more details then. So far, so good.</li>
            <li> The seam really is invisible. If you stare at it you can make it out but once you look through it at your own reflection it falls out of focus and disappears.&lt;br /&gt;There is a small turn-knob on the left side used to adjust the alignment. Adjust it by staring at faraway objects because any misalignment is amplified at a greater distance.&lt;br /&gt;The enclosure is molded plastic, not spray-painted wood or anything cheap.&lt;br /&gt;There is a brace affixed to the back that hooks over the included flat wall hook. Screws and anchors are also included.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend purchasing from truemirror.com because it offers other sizes and other colors. If you want hot pink just ask; they may have it in stock even though it&#x27;s not advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Dimensions of this model are 12\\&quot; by12\\&quot; by 7\\&quot; deep.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a video of the mirror:&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s an interview with the mirror&#x27;s creator (starts ten minutes in):&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;As for the affects of the mirror I have noticed that my asymmetrical features seem even more pronounced, probably just because I&#x27;m so used to seeing the skews reversed. But beyond that it&#x27;s not a huge difference from a traditional reflection. It doesn&#x27;t make me want to change the parting of my hair. But it&#x27;s a high-quality mirror that perfectly frames my entire neck and head, even at a close distance, so it&#x27;s worth it if you can spare the money.</li>
            <li> What is seen in this mirror is hard to describe but I believe looking at one&#x27;s true reflection for just a couple minutes a day can have a profound effect on the way you see yourself and the world-for the better. You cannot create this yourself-it took the creator many years to build the first perfect true mirror, and he was an engineer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool, works as advertised.  I&#x27;m not quite so mesmerized by it, but my kids like it and it looks cool hanging on the wall behind our bar.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing invention. The first time I looked into the true mirror it was mind blowing and exciting and a bit spooky. There I was! I realized that I had never really seen myself before. In the mirror &amp;#34;you&amp;#34; are there along with your reflection. This is an excellent tool for personal work. If you want to really get to know yourself you can gaze into the mirror as a practice. Although I expensive I highly recommend this for people who wish to delve deeper into themselves. If you are into meditation, magick, wicca, buddhism or other reflective philosophies you will love it.</li>
            <li> Really interesting to see your true self. I don&#x27;t know if I like this image or my other image more, ​but it is interesting.</li>
