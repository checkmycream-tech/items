    <ol>
            <li>The tip on this pen is incredible!</li>
            <li>Thought it had been discontinued - am VERY glad to see that it still exists!</li>
            <li>It works good.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a good liquid eyeliner</li>
            <li>Very good deep color, staying power, and a perfect applicator.</li>
            <li>Great, easy to use eyeliner.</li>
            <li>goes on nicely but wore off while sweating</li>
            <li>, otherwise it&#x27;s a nice eyeliner</li>
            <li>Defiantly recommend to anyone practicing liquid eyeliner, appliance is very easy.</li>
            <li>This one&#x27;s very easy to control</li>
            <li>Its very easy to create a winged liner look and smokey eye look with this liner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy some more right now !!!</li>
            <li>The shipping cost more then the eye liner did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of liner - pencil, liquid brush, and liquid marker like this one - and this is my second favorite, it&#x27;s excellent.  </li>
            <li>(I hope it&#x27;s safe.)  </li>
            <li>Even non-waterproof liners are more color-fast than this.  </li>
            <li>I liked this very much!</li>
            <li>And believe me, I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money looking for a pen with the perfect tip!</li>
            <li>It was easy to use and control, however it didn&#x27;t even perform one time for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seen a waterproof liner that ran so easily.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping , cheap price and good quality .</li>
            <li>They went on easily and smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I used it once, and it was fine.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried various colors and found them great too.  </li>
            <li>but the price makes it totally worth it!</li>
            <li>Could not find this brand locally; smooth transaction and fast shipping, I would buy from again.</li>
            <li>but I love it, this Styli is different in texture but just as good...........lasts all day!</li>
            <li>This eye liner was cheap, so I shouldn&#x27;t have been surprised at its performance.  </li>
            <li>Durable and smooth, there&#x27;s no other liquid liner like it!</li>
            <li>I had originally liked the waterproof black liner but had problems getting the liquid all the way to the tip, as others had mentioned.  </li>
            <li>(Nars is my favorite but way more expensive)</li>
            <li>This stuff lasts through swimming, exercising, high humidity temps, without smudging or fading.</li>
            <li>This one stays looking smooth and professional all day long.</li>
            <li>So disappointed after reading many good reviews about this product.</li>
            <li>Some other liquid waterproof eye liners I&#x27;ve tried look nice at first but then start to look cracked or faded after a few hours.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to draw and last long ,too .</li>
            <li>Since I was ok with the black, I decided to try the blue and turquoise.</li>
            <li>I essentially use it more like a paintbrush, which works, but it&#x27;s less convenient.  </li>
            <li>BUT, I have to press the tip against a smooth surface (I use a little mirror) until the makeup bleeds out</li>
            <li>Or maybe I just got an old one.  </li>
            <li>No other liner is this easy to apply, and has such long lasting results.</li>
            <li>It seemed like it was half empty when I got it because it comes out very lightly.</li>
            <li>Very disappointed because several years ago this product was much better and great as semi-permanent eye liner.</li>
            <li>People ask me all the time how I get such a smooth black line...</li>
            <li>DOES last 24 hours, but it drys out somewhat fast, which is to be expected from a drug store liquid eyeliner pen.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s familiar to hold, easy to control, and can go from thick to thin.  </li>
            <li>I guess it was dried up for the first use.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I sure didn&#x27;t have to press very hard as the other reviewer said, maybe that was a faulty one?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a beauty blogger and recommend this to everyone who is in search of a long lasting liner.</li>
            <li> Put some on your hand, wait for it to dry, then apply some water and watch the blue smear all over.  </li>
            <li> However after a couple of hours it had bled into my crease and upper lid and when my eyes watered, it bled everywhere and ran right INTO my eyes making my eyes entirely blue, which was scary and had to be rinsed out.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any trouble removing it with regular water either somehow.  </li>
            <li> I try other liners-</li>
            <li> otherwise it pools at the other end.</li>
            <li> If it starts to dry out, put the cap on a shake a few times, like a pen, to get the ink to the tip.</li>
            <li> It will dry out after a few months-</li>
            <li> Stored it upside down to encourage the liquid to saturate the tip.  </li>
            <li> The pen has to be stored--point down-- to access the liquid,</li>
            <li> I have to say, though, it does have staying power and isn&#x27;t as harsh as some eyeliners can be.</li>
            <li> After that, however, it dried up.  </li>
            <li> This goes on very weakly and dried up within days!</li>
            <li> the firmness of this pen&#x27;s tip is the secret!</li>
            <li> The colored versions are BAD, BAD PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> Had an awful time trying to get the product to show up - kept trying it on a piece of paper to ensure it was still working.  </li>
            <li> the shipping was awful.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> goes on nicely but wore off while sweating so it&#x27;s definitely not waterproof.  would not recommend to anyone for the waterproof purposes, otherwise it&#x27;s a nice eyeliner</li>
            <li> Great, easy to use eyeliner. Goes on smoothly. Stays on even during my 12 hour shift!</li>
            <li> Could not find this brand locally; smooth transaction and fast shipping, I would buy from again.</li>
            <li> DOES last 24 hours, but it drys out somewhat fast, which is to be expected from a drug store liquid eyeliner pen. Defiantly recommend to anyone practicing liquid eyeliner, appliance is very easy.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this years ago at a cosmetics shop as a &#x27;waterproof liquid liner.&#x27; I try other liners- $20 liners- and keep coming back to this one. Very good deep color, staying power, and a perfect applicator. If it starts to dry out, put the cap on a shake a few times, like a pen, to get the ink to the tip. It will dry out after a few months- but the price makes it totally worth it!</li>
            <li> This eyeliner sucked. It seemed like it was half empty when I got it because it comes out very lightly. It&#x27;s not the brand its just this specific eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Based on a youtube makeup recommendation, I bought this product.  Stored it upside down to encourage the liquid to saturate the tip.  Had an awful time trying to get the product to show up - kept trying it on a piece of paper to ensure it was still working.  I guess it was dried up for the first use.  It was easy to use and control, however it didn&#x27;t even perform one time for me.  I ended up having to go over with a gel liner to get it to perform as intended.</li>
            <li> I liked this very much!</li>
            <li> It works good. I have no problems with it. I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a good liquid eyeliner</li>
            <li> Very disappointed because several years ago this product was much better and great as semi-permanent eye liner. Ingredients must have change because it&#x27;s dryer and NOT admit- perm anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed w purchase,&lt;br /&gt;Debra McDonald</li>
            <li> Like the Styli Style liquid liner works well. But well not order it again the shipping was awful.  The shipping cost more then the eye liner did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of liner - pencil, liquid brush, and liquid marker like this one - and this is my second favorite, it&#x27;s excellent.  (Nars is my favorite but way more expensive) This one&#x27;s very easy to control and it stays on - truly stays on - all day and night if you want.  I don&#x27;t have any trouble removing it with regular water either somehow.  I&#x27;ve also tried various colors and found them great too.  I sure didn&#x27;t have to press very hard as the other reviewer said, maybe that was a faulty one?</li>
            <li> I had originally liked the waterproof black liner but had problems getting the liquid all the way to the tip, as others had mentioned.  Since I was ok with the black, I decided to try the blue and turquoise. They went on easily and smoothly.  However after a couple of hours it had bled into my crease and upper lid and when my eyes watered, it bled everywhere and ran right INTO my eyes making my eyes entirely blue, which was scary and had to be rinsed out.  (I hope it&#x27;s safe.)  I&#x27;ve never seen a waterproof liner that ran so easily.  Even non-waterproof liners are more color-fast than this.  The colored ones I tried are all going back.  Try it yourself.  Put some on your hand, wait for it to dry, then apply some water and watch the blue smear all over.  The colored versions are BAD, BAD PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> This is the only waterproof eye liner I&#x27;ve ever found that would stay on until I washed it off. This stuff lasts through swimming, exercising, high humidity temps, without smudging or fading. Last week I was freaking out because I couldn&#x27;t find it at any CVS store and the website said it was out of stock. Thought it had been discontinued - am VERY glad to see that it still exists! No other liner is this easy to apply, and has such long lasting results. Some other liquid waterproof eye liners I&#x27;ve tried look nice at first but then start to look cracked or faded after a few hours. This one stays looking smooth and professional all day long. Its very easy to create a winged liner look and smokey eye look with this liner. I&#x27;m a beauty blogger and recommend this to everyone who is in search of a long lasting liner.</li>
            <li> This goes on very weakly and dried up within days! So disappointed after reading many good reviews about this product.</li>
            <li> The tip on this pen is incredible! Durable and smooth, there&#x27;s no other liquid liner like it! And believe me, I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money looking for a pen with the perfect tip! People ask me all the time how I get such a smooth black line...the firmness of this pen&#x27;s tip is the secret! I have bought 5 extra just to have them in reserve!!!</li>
            <li> I was using &amp;#34;Blinc&amp;#34; which is pricy but I love it, this Styli is different in texture but just as good...........lasts all day!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping , cheap price and good quality . It&#x27;s also easy to draw and last long ,too . I&#x27;m going to buy some more right now !!!</li>
            <li> I like the idea of an eyeliner that applies like the tip of a pen.  It&#x27;s familiar to hold, easy to control, and can go from thick to thin.  BUT, I have to press the tip against a smooth surface (I use a little mirror) until the makeup bleeds out so I can soak it back up and apply in an even line.  I essentially use it more like a paintbrush, which works, but it&#x27;s less convenient.  I have to say, though, it does have staying power and isn&#x27;t as harsh as some eyeliners can be.</li>
            <li> This eye liner was cheap, so I shouldn&#x27;t have been surprised at its performance.  I used it once, and it was fine.  After that, however, it dried up.  Problem lies in the construction, I think.  The pen has to be stored--point down-- to access the liquid, otherwise it pools at the other end. Or maybe I just got an old one.  Anyway, I&#x27;m going to stick with the liquid liners that have an \\&quot;inkwell\\&quot; into which you stick the tip.</li>
