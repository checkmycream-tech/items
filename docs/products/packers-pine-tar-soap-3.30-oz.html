            <li>Wonderful soap if you live in a tick/chigger/&#x27;nosee-em&#x27; infested area.. helps relieve the itchiness and seems like it helps heal them up.  </li>
            <li>Be warned, it smells very strongly, which I am guessing is what repels the insects.</li>
            <li>Still, with that said, i will be ordering more come spring time!~~~:)</li>
            <li>This soap is EXCELLENT at repelling bugs (mosquitos) naturally.</li>
            <li>This is a great soap, it really makes you feel clean!!</li>
            <li>Love this soap.  </li>
            <li>Unlike many prescription products I&#x27;ve tried, your skin doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;wear out its welcome\\&quot; with the pine tar soap.</li>
            <li>Got it for acne, doesnt seem to make things better.</li>
            <li>My skin has never been better.</li>
            <li>More lather.</li>
            <li>great product, fast service</li>
            <li>its fabulous!</li>
            <li>I also love the smell of pine.</li>
            <li>I prefer it over the medicine which has many warnings and switched to pine tar soap.</li>
            <li>yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU WILL ENJOY ITS PINEY ODOR!</li>
            <li>Top of the Line product.</li>
            <li>It was just what I was looking for thanks, it a great product for your hair and skin.</li>
            <li>Time to buy more.</li>
            <li>This soap has been worked better than any steroid I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This product is as good as I remembered it from my youth, lots of cleansing suds and the beautiful scent of pine.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like showering in the middle of a pine forest and your hair is totally clean with no chemical residue.</li>
            <li>I like it because when I use it my skin feels very clean.</li>
            <li>Unusual aroma but pleasant.</li>
            <li>A wonderful help for those with dry skin.</li>
            <li>It definitely a strong smell, but I kinda love the smell.  </li>
            <li>So if you are in need and looking for something that is chemical free and safe for your family; Pine Tar soap is a must for you and your family.</li>
            <li>Now this is a true Pine Tar medicinal Soap!</li>
            <li>Has a strong Pine smell but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Also noticed the strong Pine scent acts as an air freshener for the bathroom.</li>
            <li>I had forgotten how strong the odor of pine tar can be, however I used it every day, until it disintegrated.  </li>
            <li>It smelled strong.</li>
            <li>Although Packers also make a shampoo, this soap doubles as a fine shampoo.</li>
            <li>Has a clean, refreshing scent and leaves you feeling (squeaky clean).</li>
            <li>Both soaps do a better job of cleaning and leaving the body with a fresh smooth skin.</li>
            <li>not silky smooth-</li>
            <li>Daily use on skin affected by excema or seborrheic dermatitis, in conjunction with a good moisturizer, will relieve itching and redness, halt flaking skin in its tracks, and restore a healthy color to the skin.</li>
            <li>and it makes you feel so clean.  </li>
            <li>I feel so clean...</li>
            <li>This seems to work ok, as long as you do not put any lotion on top!  </li>
            <li>I have used other brands of pine tar soap, but this easily is the best brand so far.</li>
            <li>I have psoriasis and have used this soap for my skin for many years and it really does help.  </li>
            <li>he loved it and uses it everyday :) I&#x27;m looking forward to try it during mosquito season</li>
            <li>Love this soap- helped a lot with my husbands psoriasis and seems to really live up to helping with bugs-</li>
            <li>Packers PT soap also helped calm my mosquito bites, which I am allergic to.</li>
            <li>It is worth the price.</li>
            <li>really does a good job of deep cleaning.</li>
            <li>Love it, and the free shipping, never going back.</li>
            <li>Now my bathroom smells piney fresh after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>Now, as a mature woman, I enjoy the creamy lather and mild, thorough cleaning my face receives.</li>
            <li>this was the first brand of pine I used and have tried others since, as it&#x27;s rare to find this brand in stores.</li>
            <li>but my hair (straight fine thick) looks good people tell me, and no one mentions the piney smell-ever.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only soap I am ever going to use, have already bought more.</li>
            <li>but I would definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair silky soft and my skin clean and there is no residual smell.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>A real man.</li>
            <li>Packer&#x27;s Pine Tar Soap is an old-fashioned remedy that really works.</li>
            <li>It also lathers well and rinses off your skin very well.</li>
            <li>I really like the scent of this soap.</li>
            <li>Amazing soap works to assist aid in multiple ways clear out a few minor imperfections or just for everyday use and will see marvelous results.</li>
            <li>How is this not more popular?</li>
            <li>and I hope thats true as after alot of rain the last 90 days we have a bumper crop of them.</li>
            <li>I use this mainly for my face, when taking the morning shower, and have for quite some years.</li>
            <li>Wish I&#x27;d found it during high school years.</li>
            <li>and it seemed like it was a little better then</li>
            <li>I had used the product before, but only years ago, and it was exactly as I remembered!  </li>
            <li>Makes yout skin and hair soft and it really works the way it claims.</li>
            <li>I have battled mild to moderate psoriasis for my entire life.</li>
            <li>in our opinion, deserves to be both an old and modern standard).</li>
            <li>If you get this get a soap stand because this soap WILL get very mushy if left sitting on water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready to put in my next order for the product .  </li>
            <li>I usually bathe them with their regular soap (Dove) and then wash them down lightly (face, arms, feet, ears, legs) with the Pine Soap and then rinse them lightly before getting out of the tub.</li>
            <li>I love it, but I think it is much too expensive.</li>
            <li>Oh and it leaves a stench like no other, but i wouldnt care if it cleared my acne.</li>
            <li>Not so easy to find in stores but helps to make dry flaky red patches of skin softer, clearer and less itchy.</li>
            <li>Also works well to clear up facial outbreaks.</li>
            <li>My 16 year old grandson sometimes has breakouts on his back...</li>
            <li>this soap blows grandpas pine tar out of the water as far as later, cleansing, and scent.</li>
            <li>An old standard in pine tar soap (&amp;.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel fresh, and it isn&#x27;t harsh.</li>
            <li>I like this but not as much as the other brand I was using.</li>
            <li>It gives a lot of soap with just a little bit of a rub, it cleans very well, and relieves the irritation of sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Wonderful at cutting through the dirt and grime from working a hard da.  </li>

            <li> Wonderful at cutting through the dirt and grime from working a hard da.  </li>
            <li> The next morning I went to a pharmacist and asked is there ANYTHING that they&#x27;d recommend that would really work besides DEET and all of the products that I&#x27;ve used in the past</li>
            <li> I have to use conditioner afterwards because pine tar soap makes my hair wild, a slightly tacky feel which conditioner remedied for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using it a long time.</li>
            <li> I tried this and will go back to my other brand</li>
            <li> No blemishes from dry skin anymore.</li>
            <li> the winter my skin is too dry</li>
            <li> My 5yr old son is the only one in our family that use to get eaten alive by mosquitos no matter how much bug repellent he had on (even when I nearly poured it on him).</li>
            <li> The only con that I have when using the soap is that it leaves dark stains in the soap dish.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s only been a few weeks but no mosquito bites</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m not very manly.  </li>
            <li> Still, my hair seems fuller- as though there is some residue or is it the hairs repel each other?-</li>
            <li> So Soft (Avon) oil, which also is an insect repellent (not its original purpose)</li>
            <li> the dark side of your wardrobe is waiting..</li>
            <li> and it made my shower walls dark.</li>
            <li> I have a back and forth case of psoriasis on my scalp and the $75 medicine the dermatologist prescribed me was no better than the pine tar soap!</li>
            <li> &amp; with the smell of the pine tar, might.. though not positive about this, keep some of the little buggers off!</li>
            <li> Might reduce redness a little.</li>
            <li> It was so bad that he couldn&#x27;t walk and was in tears because of the swelling and pain after getting bitten on his legs, after an outing early last Summer.</li>
            <li> And it is not cheap.</li>
            <li> I let the lather sit on my hair for a few minutes, 3?, then rinse and wash again.</li>
            <li> Sorry for the long review, but I just can&#x27;t resist talking about this product that actually works (for me at least).</li>
            <li> Though it does make a mess of the shower!  </li>
            <li> Also with Grandpa&#x27;s I notice less brown soap scum in our shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packers</li>
            <li> It really works with bad feet smells</li>
            <li> I read a few reviews that were very negative about this soap.</li>
            <li> It also functions pretty well as a bug repellent.</li>
            <li> skin never felt any different :(</li>
            <li> This soap is very hard to find.</li>
            <li> but it made it worse.  </li>
            <li> also i hate that the smell lingers the whole day! :(</li>
            <li> but im really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like the results, just hate the pine and tar smell.</li>
            <li> Has mosquito repellent powers with continued use</li>
            <li> So, if you put on any lotion after showering with this, you cover the repellent.</li>
            <li> A very difficult product to find !!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I use this mainly for my face, when taking the morning shower, and have for quite some years.</li>
            <li> I like the results, just hate the pine and tar smell.</li>
            <li> 5 stars aren&#x27;t enough for this product!  This soap is EXCELLENT at repelling bugs (mosquitos) naturally. My 5yr old son is the only one in our family that use to get eaten alive by mosquitos no matter how much bug repellent he had on (even when I nearly poured it on him). It was so bad that he couldn&#x27;t walk and was in tears because of the swelling and pain after getting bitten on his legs, after an outing early last Summer. The next morning I went to a pharmacist and asked is there ANYTHING that they&#x27;d recommend that would really work besides DEET and all of the products that I&#x27;ve used in the past (he had them on when he was bitten) and he told me about Pine Tar Soap. I immediately purchased a bar and began using it on both kids since the June 2009. My son has not had even ONE mosquito bite since then; not even ONE!!! I will FOREVER be using Pine Tar soap on myself and definitely on my children. I usually bathe them with their regular soap (Dove) and then wash them down lightly (face, arms, feet, ears, legs) with the Pine Soap and then rinse them lightly before getting out of the tub. I do moisturize them afterwards with Skin So Soft (Avon) oil, which also is an insect repellent (not its original purpose) and they are protected 100%. So if you are in need and looking for something that is chemical free and safe for your family; Pine Tar soap is a must for you and your family. Sorry for the long review, but I just can&#x27;t resist talking about this product that actually works (for me at least). Good Luck with a bite-free Summer.</li>
            <li> Great soap for skin conditions.  Couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere locally. Thanks.</li>
            <li> How is this not more popular? It is great great stuff. It smells wonderful too. If you&#x27;re a man. A real man. And you bathe every now and again. You must buy this. Quit using your girlfriends oil of olay body wash, get your debit card out of your purse and buy this. Sissy!</li>
            <li> Wonderful soap if you live in a tick/chigger/&#x27;nosee-em&#x27; infested area.. helps relieve the itchiness and seems like it helps heal them up.  &amp; with the smell of the pine tar, might.. though not positive about this, keep some of the little buggers off! (wishful thinking maybe) Though it does make a mess of the shower!  Still, with that said, i will be ordering more come spring time!~~~:)</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  It smells so good and it makes you feel so clean.  I have been using it a long time.</li>
            <li> Amazing soap works to assist aid in multiple ways clear out a few minor imperfections or just for everyday use and will see marvelous results.</li>
            <li> Packer&#x27;s Pine Tar Soap is an old-fashioned remedy that really works. Daily use on skin affected by excema or seborrheic dermatitis, in conjunction with a good moisturizer, will relieve itching and redness, halt flaking skin in its tracks, and restore a healthy color to the skin. Unlike many prescription products I&#x27;ve tried, your skin doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;wear out its welcome\\&quot; with the pine tar soap. This is a treatment that will go the distance!    (By the way, if you&#x27;re looking for a really good moisturizer, try Cetaphil.)</li>
            <li> Got it for acne, doesnt seem to make things better. Might reduce redness a little. If you get this get a soap stand because this soap WILL get very mushy if left sitting on water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels somewhat sticky skin after use. Oh and it leaves a stench like no other, but i wouldnt care if it cleared my acne.</li>
            <li> This is a great soap, it really makes you feel clean!!</li>
            <li> Best bar soap I have ever used. Unusual aroma but pleasant.</li>
            <li> A wonderful help for those with dry skin. My 16 year old grandson sometimes has breakouts on his back...this soap has stopped that from happening. It&#x27;s the only soap I am ever going to use, have already bought more.</li>
            <li> Not so easy to find in stores but helps to make dry flaky red patches of skin softer, clearer and less itchy.</li>
            <li> Started using the soap in the Summer of 2013. My skin has never been better. Feels cleaner and smoother. No blemishes from dry skin anymore. Best soap product I have ever used. Prior to using Packers Pine Tar soap I used Ivory soap for over fifty years.</li>
            <li> the winter my skin is too dry so I use neem in winter and pine in summer. this was the first brand of pine I used and have tried others since, as it&#x27;s rare to find this brand in stores. I&#x27;m very happy to go out of my way and order it online if that&#x27;s how I can get it, because Packers is worth it! Wish I&#x27;d found it during high school years. Face and body. clears up skin well and gives it smoother color.</li>
            <li> It is a good soap, I prefer Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar. More lather. Also with Grandpa&#x27;s I notice less brown soap scum in our shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packers Pine Tar I understand to be a different blend of ingredients, whose to say which is what. Both soaps do a better job of cleaning and leaving the body with a fresh smooth skin.</li>
            <li> great product, fast service</li>
            <li> this soap blows grandpas pine tar out of the water as far as later, cleansing, and scent. its fabulous! get it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This soap is the bomb!! I dare you too use this twice a day with mg217 ointment..the dark side of your wardrobe is waiting..</li>
            <li> I like this soap. I read a few reviews that were very negative about this soap. I like it because when I use it my skin feels very clean. It also lathers well and rinses off your skin very well. I have 4 daughters and they did not complain about the smell it leaves in the shower. The only con that I have when using the soap is that it leaves dark stains in the soap dish.I also love the smell of pine. This soap is very hard to find. And it is not cheap.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for over fifty years - since the Packer Company made it in Mystic, Connecticut. It makes your skin feel fresh, and it isn&#x27;t harsh. Although Packers also make a shampoo, this soap doubles as a fine shampoo. It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Good product.I have a back and forth case of psoriasis on my scalp and the $75 medicine the dermatologist prescribed me was no better than the pine tar soap! I let the lather sit on my hair for a few minutes, 3?, then rinse and wash again. I have to use conditioner afterwards because pine tar soap makes my hair wild, a slightly tacky feel which conditioner remedied for me. Still, my hair seems fuller- as though there is some residue or is it the hairs repel each other?- not silky smooth-but my hair (straight fine thick) looks good people tell me, and no one mentions the piney smell-ever. It doesn&#x27;t matter which conditioner I use so I know its the soap. I prefer it over the medicine which has many warnings and switched to pine tar soap. Packers PT soap also helped calm my mosquito bites, which I am allergic to.</li>
            <li> really does a good job of deep cleaning. i had this back in 90s and it seemed like it was a little better then but maybe it was just me. still good soap either way</li>
            <li> Love this soap- helped a lot with my husbands psoriasis and seems to really live up to helping with bugs- it&#x27;s only been a few weeks but no mosquito bites yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU WILL ENJOY ITS PINEY ODOR!</li>
            <li> Well I thought it smelled like tires and beef jerky. As a soap for my boyfriend with psoriasis, he said it felt good on his skin.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like to be around when he uses it though.</li>
            <li> Packers Pine Tar Soap is all it says it can do. Makes yout skin and hair soft and it really works the way it claims. Used it as a child. Now my garnd daughter uses it. Job well done</li>
            <li> I like this but not as much as the other brand I was using.I tried this and will go back to my other brand</li>
            <li> My daughter has psoriasis and says it works great.</li>
            <li> This made me remember what my mother used to wash my hair with and I&#x27;m now 86.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent of this soap. Kind of manly.</li>
            <li> I didnt like the smell, fought through it...skin never felt any different :( bought it thinking it would help with my acne but im really disappointed. also i hate that the smell lingers the whole day! :(</li>
            <li> Now this is a true Pine Tar medicinal Soap! Has a strong Pine smell but not overpowering. Lathers better than any soap I have used Ever! Leaves my hair silky soft and my skin clean and there is no residual smell. Has mosquito repellent powers with continued use and I hope thats true as after alot of rain the last 90 days we have a bumper crop of them. Been around since 1869. Top of the Line product. [[ASIN:B000NRT07O PackerS Pine Tar Soap - 3.3 Oz]] Also noticed the strong Pine scent acts as an air freshener for the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready to put in my next order for the product .  It gives a lot of soap with just a little bit of a rub, it cleans very well, and relieves the irritation of sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have used other brands of pine tar soap, but this easily is the best brand so far. This soap lathers up, cleans, and rinses well. I use this as a hair shampoo and body bar. Has a clean, refreshing scent and leaves you feeling (squeaky clean).</li>
            <li> My husband needed it for his skin …. it took a while to get here-- but he is thrilled with it !  A very difficult product to find !!</li>
            <li> An old standard in pine tar soap (&amp;. in our opinion, deserves to be both an old and modern standard).</li>
            <li> I feel so clean... Wonderful at cutting through the dirt and grime from working a hard da.  The best for my hair as it leaves it squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> My dandruff is almost non-existent after using this product, now I still use my regular hair products and body wash, although they aren&#x27;t truly necessary.  It definitely a strong smell, but I kinda love the smell.  Love it, and the free shipping, never going back.</li>
            <li> This soap is the best. My skin no longer feels itchy after getting out of the shower. I have grown used to the scent, and my roommates have too. Now my bathroom smells piney fresh after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> It was just what I was looking for thanks, it a great product for your hair and skin. It&#x27;s good for flake on the scalp.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product when she notices her hair falling out and she seems to get immediate results after only a couple of washes.  Also works well to clear up facial outbreaks.</li>
            <li> I like the quality and it smells exactly as I remember it in the past. It really works with bad feet smells</li>
            <li> I love it, but I think it is much too expensive.</li>
            <li> I had forgotten how strong the odor of pine tar can be, however I used it every day, until it disintegrated.  Time to buy more.</li>
            <li> I have battled mild to moderate psoriasis for my entire life. This soap has been worked better than any steroid I&#x27;ve used. It also functions pretty well as a bug repellent.</li>
            <li> This seems to work ok, as long as you do not put any lotion on top!  Be warned, it smells very strongly, which I am guessing is what repels the insects. So, if you put on any lotion after showering with this, you cover the repellent.</li>
            <li> Got it suggested to help with my skin problems. It smelled strong. Just didn&#x27;t work for my skin at all.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the delivery and the soap!</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a present for my husband because we recently moved to alaska. he loved it and uses it everyday :) I&#x27;m looking forward to try it during mosquito season but I would definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and have used this soap for my skin for many years and it really does help.  Not the best of fragrance but that&#x27;s because of the tar ingredient that makes it work so well.  Great product.</li>
            <li> My order was actually delivered a week ahead of schedule.  I had used the product before, but only years ago, and it was exactly as I remembered!  The soap helps to heal cuts and scrapes rapidly; is a great way to wash your hair; and leaves you with the fragrance of pine...  I love it!</li>
            <li> I used this product as a kid with acne and it worked wonders.  Now, as a mature woman, I enjoy the creamy lather and mild, thorough cleaning my face receives.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m not very manly.  I didn&#x27;t like the smell and it made my shower walls dark. Thought might reduce my dogs itchy skin but it made it worse.  My son finished it up...guess he&#x27;s the most manly of us all!  Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> This product is as good as I remembered it from my youth, lots of cleansing suds and the beautiful scent of pine.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like showering in the middle of a pine forest and your hair is totally clean with no chemical residue.</li>
