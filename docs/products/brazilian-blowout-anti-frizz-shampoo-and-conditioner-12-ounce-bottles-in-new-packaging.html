            <li>THE BEST and THE ONLY shampoo</li>
            <li>I bought most of the products they sell after having a Brazilian Blowout.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous!</li>
            <li>Love both products</li>
            <li>/&gt;NOT recommend this product to most people.</li>
            <li>quality and there are better products out there.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Will buy again as soon as I need more.</li>
            <li>I found all of them to be okay.</li>
            <li>There are products I like better.</li>
            <li>I like Chi&#x27;s Iron Guard  and Silk Fusion better than the Brazilian Blowout dimethicone based heat serum.</li>
            <li>…this didn&#x27;t cut it for me…I think panteen conditioner is way better for my hair type…I will continue to use the hair balm</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to be able to purchase it at an affordable price :)</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner combo.</li>
            <li>now on I will be purchasing them from Amazon :)</li>
            <li>but since I&#x27;ve gotten this as well as the thermal balm my hair is cleaner a lot softer straighter and more shiny.</li>
            <li>After receiving the BB I wanted the best products to help make it last</li>
            <li>My hair is so healthy and shiny, and it cleans well.</li>
            <li>Recommend that those with wavy to curly hair for sure try it,</li>
            <li>but this product help to make it look healthy.</li>
            <li>An excellent product, especially if you have a brazillian blowout on your hair.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve had a Brazilian Blowout make sure to always use phosphate-free products so you don&#x27;t prematurely strip the BB treatment out of your hair.</li>
            <li>I receive a blowout treatment about every three months and this shampoo and conditioner keep my hair shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>Nice light scent that does not overpower.</li>
            <li>Smells like lemon :)</li>
            <li>Love these products.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair feeling healthy and frizz free at a cheaper price than the salon!</li>
            <li>Such a great deal!  </li>
            <li>love love love this product.</li>
            <li>My Brazilian Blowout was better than the Keratin treatment; my hair was straighter from the Brazilian Blowout.</li>
            <li>If you had the Brazilian blowout treatment, you should get this product to play it safe.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;But when these anti-frizz products are used with the &amp;#34;after-wash&amp;#34; products for deep conditioning and styling, they can be combined to create great results!  </li>
            <li>I love my hair after a Brazilian Blowout.</li>
            <li>The results of the Brazilian are so wonderful, of course I&#x27;m going to do everything possible to preserve it.</li>
            <li>Loves the way it leaves, hair shinny and frizz free !</li>
            <li>and I love these products.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and great price</li>
            <li>In love.</li>
            <li>well it makes your hair feel and look healthy.</li>
            <li>I suggest that they can be send in a more economis way.</li>
            <li>Never realized these products were available on Amazon!</li>
            <li>This shampoo is effective, doesn&#x27;t require a lot to be used well, smells good, and leaves the hair fairly soft.  </li>
            <li>I got a Brazilian Blowout and afterward the stylist said I needed to be sure to use parafin and sulfate free shampoo/conditioner</li>
            <li>I love this Shampoo and Cream rinse make my hair so silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It works much better than the matrix sulfate free shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>fast shipping good price</li>
            <li>So glad I checked Amazon first!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;the hair gets super silky and strong!</li>
            <li>Smells great and keeps hair soft and smooth, but I do not recommend using this product repeatedly as it causes scalp build-up.</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny and so easy to comb thru</li>
            <li>The merchandise came very quickly.</li>
            <li>My hair is easy to manage now, and it dries faster.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried most of the popular Keratin and Blowout products (depending on the straightening treatment) and none of them worked very well.</li>
            <li>very satisfied with the product and the way it was package thanks.</li>
            <li>While it may work marvelously with the Brazilian Blowout, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s anything but average for those who don&#x27;t have the treatment.</li>
            <li>Love my brazillian blow out and the best way to keep it from frizzing back so fast is to use this shampoo and conditioner.. thank you ..</li>
            <li>i love it, hair felt so smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>Perfect half the price of salon</li>
            <li>Product is great, much cheaper than buying from the salon, thanks!</li>
            <li>It is fantastic stuff.</li>
            <li>Keeps hair smooth and frizz free.</li>
            <li>great price for both products, I can only use this product being that I have the brazillian blowout in my hair.</li>
            <li>Just like cheap shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>FANTASTIC PRODUCTS,</li>
            <li>Great shampoo and conditioner to keep&lt;br /&gt;Brazilian blow out lasting longer and even without one&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>I fel secure with the transaction &amp; the delivery</li>
            <li>Works well with the brazilian blowout treatment and keeps hair smooth longer.</li>
            <li>Hair is smooth</li>
            <li>I have received Keratin a few times and this is the best shampoo/conditioner to keep my hair in tip/top shape.  </li>
            <li>It does make my hair smooth and since I had the blowout done to my hair</li>
            <li>If I use another sulfate free shampoo and conditioner, I don&#x27;t notice any difference.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never been so smooth and silky, not even when I was a kid.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to be able to buy them outside of the salon, the price is much more reasonable.</li>
            <li>My hair dries shiny, smooth and defined.  </li>
            <li>it smells good…but in my opinion its way too much for what it is…I really liked the balm for straightening your hair…</li>
            <li>I also think it has sulphates though is supposed to be sulphate free.  </li>
            <li>But it still keeps my hair frizz free.</li>
            <li>Sulfate free so does not damage hair or color.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>The shampoo conditioner system kept my hair moisturized and smooth for 4 months, extending the effects of the smoothing.</li>
            <li>It works great and would definitely recommend it to anyone out there!!</li>
            <li>My stylist is not carrying the products in the salon, so she suggest I used a paraben free shampoo and conditioner, which I had on hand.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to use this product unless you require a sulfate free product (keratin or smoothing blow out).</li>
            <li>These are products that I already use, they are fantastic.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>thanks!!!</li>
            <li>Which is of course the most important part ;)</li>
            <li>I thought it smelled and felt like cheap drugstore shampoo, nothing special at all.</li>
            <li>and I am never disappointed.</li>
            <li>I originally posted a one star bc</li>
            <li>I was really excited to use this product and see how it worked.&lt;br</li>
            <li>LIKE THE ORIGINAL ONE</li>
            <li>I originally bought the Brazilian Blowout shampoo and conditioner from the salon, and the products from Beauty</li>
            <li>but once you blow dry and then you will have a shiny, smooth and healthy looking hair!!</li>
            <li>Brazilian blowout shampoo and conditinor is the best sulfate free shampoo I have ever used, my hair was really damaged and I was going to have to cut it all off , then I started using this shampoo and conditinor and with in a week it had smooth out my rough ends and helped so much with my frizzy hair and just made it feel Better all over .</li>
            <li>I have been using it for two years, by far the best product that help the blowout last longer.</li>
            <li>Did nothing special.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the way my hair turned out and I am not sure this product makes it better</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t get a better deal on this shampoo anywhere else.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready to order more just in case</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper than most quality product lines.</li>
            <li>Nice thing about this product, for my naturally curly (but not wiry) hair, is I get the effect of a Blowout, without the cost of a Blowout.</li>
            <li>Using the correct shampoo really does matter, and buying thru Amazon makes it more affordable.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly</li>
            <li>I looked all over town and even tried a different kind of sulfate free shampoo that I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and leaves my hair soft and smooth</li>
            <li>depending on Texas weather, but overall great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Like most conditioners, it&#x27;s mainly a detangler, so</li>
            <li>Super quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Take a lot more conditioner than Shampoo (normal)</li>
            <li>My wife was very satisfied with the result even after several months of havng the brazilian blow-out treatment.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair in great condition and keeps my color from fading, which happens to be a vibrant red.</li>
            <li>Great product for hair treated with Keratin/Brazilian Blowout products; was half the price the salon wanted.</li>
            <li>but I was so happy to find it on amazon for less than that..</li>
            <li>but I can say it has made my hair a little more tamer for sure!</li>
            <li>Recently purchased this product &amp; I love it!</li>
            <li>Flat ironing was becoming a battle and my waves were almost winning.</li>
            <li>…it could possibly stop frizz…but the balm does that just fine too…that you put on after your hair is already washed…so why waste the money on the shampoo and conditioner…when I don&#x27;t leave the shower feeling wonderful</li>
            <li>it is an amazing shampoo and conditioner not only did it work for her hair</li>
            <li>and I wanted it to last, so I&#x27;ve been using this&lt;br /&gt;shampoo and Conditioner and its been amazing.  </li>
            <li>I follow some recommendations and after my treatment this product help my hair to stay smooth and straight.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by how many suds you get.</li>
            <li>, scent is all off and different and lathers (unlike authentic BB sulfate free shampoo).&lt;br /&gt;***BEWARE-</li>
            <li>and I rarely use it.</li>
            <li>It is a luxurious line and worth the splurge if it works well for you.</li>
            <li>I love the way these products leave my hair feeling silky and soft.</li>
            <li>I believe ths protein treatment is effective and beneficial on human hair from 1A to 4C. For information on her treatment, just type</li>
            <li>and my hair is soft, shiny, and smooth!</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair soft and freeze free!</li>
            <li>Worth the buy.</li>
            <li>The scent is fabulous and tame my frizzies fairly well.</li>
            <li>I should have known less than 1/2 price for the set, to good to be true.  </li>
            <li>Much better than other sulfate free shampoos (even Bumble and Bumble!)</li>
            <li>I also think that the clients who come in to get it done love it more than other brands.</li>
            <li>I have no doubt they are the right products to use.</li>
            <li>I will probably always buy these products as long as they are available :)</li>
            <li>my hair was so healthy and soft the first day i used these in the shower</li>
            <li>excited to try the new product!</li>
            <li>I even did a good bar scan on the previous bottles and compared to the bar scan on the items I received and they are indeed the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Conditioner leaves hair soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really sure they work better than sulfate free products I have purchased in the store, but they seem to be fine.</li>
            <li>The shipment was super fast.  </li>
            <li>Last time I got a brazilian blowout (the real branded kind)</li>
            <li>The shampoo &amp; conditioner is great for any hair types if you want soft hair without paying high prices at the salon that use the same products</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so smooth and soft!</li>
            <li>exactly what i ordered super fast ship time.</li>
            <li>This did not happen the first time, it seems to have been a compounding affect.</li>
            <li>The first month or 2 the shampoo and conditioner seemed to work well.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I would go back and get more  </li>
            <li>Purchasing this product thru Amazon Prime, the shampoo has a totally different consistency than the shampoos purchased thru a reputable salon.  </li>
            <li>Lightning fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I use both daily and love it.  </li>
            <li>I also purchased the deep conditioner and love it as well.</li>
            <li>I do find the smell of this to be pretty offensive.</li>
            <li>It really is anti-frizz!</li>
            <li>My hair finally looks so much better after trying so many different products over the years.</li>
            <li>I tried this after my first brazilian blow out hair treatment.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if its the brazilian blowout that I got in the first place.  </li>
            <li>Product was exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner really do prolong the life of a keratin treatment!</li>
            <li>They leave hair soft, shiny and frizz free.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not sorry I purchased, because I will get the Brazilian Blowout Zero Plus this Summer.</li>
            <li>same product better price.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner seem to work pretty well.  </li>
            <li>My first Brazilian Blowout</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty useful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the price , I expected to see some kind of results.</li>
            <li>They clearly just used the bottle and put in a cheap shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>price was good - have been using shampoo for a few years, and like it.</li>
            <li>When I ran out I researched and found that this is the exact same product my stylist sold me for a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used other sodium free, sulfate free shampoos</li>
            <li>After washing and &amp;#34;detangling&amp;#34;, using the deep conditioning masque is incredible, especially when left on overnight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product in the past that I bought at a beauty supply store &amp; loved how it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li>The takes care of any remaining frizz and makes my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>(yes, I was certain to fully rinse out the shampoo and conditioner every time).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fine shampoo for regular hair, but the thing that makes this get 5 stars from me is that it leaves my hair soft, shiny, and lengthens the keratin treatment more significantly than when I use other shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Using a knock off or a cheaper brand will only ruin your treatment and make you need to get it done again--and Brazilian Blowouts aren&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li>It does make my blowout last longer and keeps my hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Love the product....makes my thick curly hair very shiny and smooth....</li>
            <li>I have very oily hair and even though it does not specify any type of hair usage</li>
            <li>I think shampoo is really gentle to prevent faded Brazilian blow out.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, but when it arrived there was conditioner everywhere inside the package.</li>
            <li>This is not the real product.  </li>
            <li>I had my hair treatment 2 months ago and my hair is very curly</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this stuff is real.</li>
            <li>Well I read the reviews AFTER I purchased the product AND used it and ready to reorder and was wondering why my hair was STILL frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I really like these products a lot.</li>
            <li>SO GENTLE ON THE HAIR</li>
            <li>FAST  SHIPPING,  </li>
            <li>works really well.</li>
            <li>was fast.</li>
            <li>Gentle on colored hair and soooo smoothing.</li>
            <li>Very impress with the service I got it with in2 days of order.</li>
            <li>I must note the fact that the flip top lids were sealed closed.  </li>
            <li>You really have to force it out.</li>
            <li>I get an off-brand keratin treatment, but this shampoo/conditioner combo really prolongs the life of it.</li>
            <li>not the real thing</li>
            <li>Would also recommend the intense mask.</li>
            <li>this is not the real stuff....</li>
            <li>I like the product and it was reasonably priced and arrived in a timely matter.</li>
            <li>it make you hair much softer and shinier.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference until I used this product.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really like the way it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li>Not the real thing.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making my Blowout maintenance so affordable.  </li>
            <li>Salon prices are way to high, always use Amazon to buy these products!</li>
            <li>I have been told it holds the treatment much longer.</li>
            <li>Gentle on the hair and phosphate-free.</li>
            <li>and I can tell it has really protected my keratin treated hair.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny for my frizzy wild hair.</li>
            <li>The Anti-Frizz Shampoo &amp; Conditioner really helps prolong the blowout at a fraction of the salon price.</li>
            <li>I have frizzy hair and thus combo really gets it under control.</li>
            <li>Looks and smells like the real deal.</li>
            <li>Since it seemed to do the job I didn&#x27;t think much.</li>
            <li>(I had highlights and a brazillian blowout) and really like the product.  </li>
            <li>I expected a better result.    </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>These are NOT the real Brazilian Blowout Acai shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thank you for fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I really like the Brazilian Blowout Anti Frizz Shampoo and Conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Product works well and does keep the hair straight and frizz-less longer.</li>
            <li>but it IS NOT the real shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Not too heavy &amp; moisturizes nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it twice and love it so far.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is okay, and smells fantastic, but doesn&#x27;t leave my hair totally &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34;, which other products have done.  </li>
            <li>In the past, the product always has seemed authentic, but I do not thing the most recent shampoo is the real thing.  </li>
            <li>I will say it did make a huge difference when washing, blow drying &amp; flat ironing my hair.</li>
            <li>Price is definitely better on Amazon over other online vendors and salons.</li>
            <li>I will never use any other shampoo or conditioner - this stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I bought this product because it was more affordable than other options, and I just had a Keratin treatment and wanted to get a specialized shampoo and conditioner to protect</li>
            <li>This is my personal experience with this product, but it doesn&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t work great for someone else which apparently it does due to all the good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am not sure of the reason, but there is a big difference between the results I experienced with this product before and now.</li>
            <li>Really, probably deserves two stars because of the high price.</li>
            <li>It didnt offer any special quality and especially not for the money.</li>
            <li>Unlike any previous bottles or what I know is the real thing from salons, my latest bottle has a grainy texture.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair normally.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without these!</li>
            <li>Hers is a protein treatment that delivers, shine, smoothness, ease of styling, and less heat needed for good styling results when flat ironed...similar to a BB or Keratin treatment, without the chemicals or heat.</li>
            <li>originally bought at salon, but this saves me a few dollars, and getting the same Salon product I love.</li>
            <li>If you had the Brazilian Blow Dry Treatment, this products realy help to maintain your hair frizz free.</li>
            <li>For even better results I use this same brand&#x27;s Daily Smoothing Serum.</li>
            <li>Left my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I wrote a review at the time, but said I had to try the products longer to see if they were better than Keratin shampoo (with a different brand color saving conditioner) which I had been using before I got the actual Brazilian treatment.    </li>
            <li>Highly recommend to people with curly hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product even if you don&#x27;t have the Brazilian Blow out.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend them as they are both the price they charge.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>My expectations were too high for these products.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and very manageable.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised how fast this came.  </li>
            <li>i noticed the more i kept using these everyday</li>
            <li>Maybe I have to use it a few times more.</li>
            <li>This is definitely the right brand.</li>
            <li>I have ordered so many shampoo and conditioners trying to tame my hair&#x27;s frizzies and nothing has truly worked until this.</li>
            <li>Worth the money as a little goes a long way and you&#x27;ll love the feel of your hair.  </li>
            <li>Then I&#x27;ll update my results with this product versus other sulfate free products,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I buy new bottles just as soon as I&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without Brazilian blowouts or the accompanying products.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>shipped and sealed like new.</li>
            <li>and I have new hair since doing them and using these products.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I should have spent the extra money for a better quality product.</li>
            <li>Very soft, no friz.  </li>
            <li>The results are not as long lasting as an instense protein treatments, but her treatment is easy and  made in the comfort of your kitchen.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I use it with the brazilian blowout every 3-4 months and my hair is so soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>It Is are the same exact products.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never been so soft and frizz-free with these products!</li>
            <li>After using this product for years I am pretty sure whomever is behind this listing  is now selling knockoffs.</li>
            <li>It really extends the life of the BB treatment and helps keep my very frizzy hair undercontrol even when I go too long between processes!</li>
            <li>Its soft and shiny and not dead!</li>
            <li>how heavy it is on my fine hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It left my hair feeling MORE dry and coarse.</li>
            <li>It keeps your hair soft and silky, and it doesn&#x27;t ruin the treatment.</li>
            <li>I have natural curls</li>
            <li>Used it for a month so far</li>
            <li>Use enough but not too much.</li>
            <li>I had a brazilian blowout done professionally at a salon and the package included the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>my hair was soft and shiny again,</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt so soft and looks shiny.  </li>
            <li>and they leave my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this again, but from a different seller as it wasn&#x27;t available from the same seller on Amazon.</li>
            <li>My hair is worn naturally.</li>
            <li>…my hair is naturally wavy</li>
            <li>Three days after I started using the shampoo and conditioner, I developed dandruff which I&#x27;ve never had in my life.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li>No trouble blow drying my hair</li>
            <li>Now I have to send the whole order back.</li>
            <li>keeps my hair shiny and soft after blow drying and straightening.</li>
            <li>My wife has naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>You hear that the product could be old or a knock off.</li>
            <li>Wow what a difference.  </li>
            <li>, my hair didn&#x27;t feel soft and it wasn&#x27;t as manageable.  </li>
            <li>Make your Brazillian Blowout last much longer.</li>
            <li>My opinion changed completely after using the product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other sulfate free shampoo and conditioner but always come back to BB brand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other sulfate free products before that left my hair feeling greasy after about a week.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, getting a brazilian blowout can cause hair to break leaving you with shorter pieces of hair and a less full head of hair.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend  it especially if you use keratin it Brazilian blowout treatments!</li>
            <li>It really works on the frizz and as long as you rinse it out</li>
            <li>After using a clarifying shampoo my hair was back to normal.</li>
            <li>This product really makes my Brazilian blowout last longer which is the only thing that has truly removed my frizz in this humidity.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shiny and I have no fly aways :)</li>
            <li>im not sure if the product is original or not....</li>
            <li>Now I use no other product and I can go a month longer between getting another Brazilian Blowout.</li>
            <li>This proves to keep my hair down!</li>
            <li>compared to other conditioners i think this washes out easier than some of the other sodium free shampoos</li>
            <li>Keeps your hair extra smoothe and soft.  </li>
            <li>First time ai got a blowout I used my regular shampoo and conditioner and it didn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li>Just recently I had my hair salon order product direct from the Brazilian blowout company.</li>
            <li>the shampoo is thick so it lasts too a long time :)</li>
            <li>a little hard to lather but other than that they were great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not so strong to discourage using it, but it&#x27;s not good.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t use any other anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of trying new products especially when there are such rave reviews.</li>
            <li>I have been only using these products that I bought online since I got my Brazilian Blowout only two months ago, and it has already faded considerably</li>
            <li>It does nothing special to my hair and it&#x27;s hard to lather.</li>
            <li>the way, I have kinky curly hair, very tight zig-zag curl pattern in the back and loose waves on top, spiral curls on sides, so a combination of African American hair.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m so surprised its lasted this long.</li>
            <li>but I made my hair feel really weighed down.</li>
            <li>Best of all it is so much less expensive to buy this product on Amazon!!</li>
            <li>I have very frizzy hair, due to years of flat ironing my hair.  </li>
            <li>Shampoo is super thick when you go to pour it out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I used to constantly search for and try new shampoos and conditioners and hair serums; spent TONS of money and years on my search.  </li>
            <li>So to pay a little extra for products that will help it along is the smart thing to do.  </li>
            <li>Using other sulfate-free shampoo, I feel like I need a new blowout after about 8 weeks.</li>
            <li>Money well spent, particularly if you are 40+ and want to keep your hair long.</li>
            <li>Not worth the high price tag.</li>
            <li>No other shampoo will make your blowout last as long.</li>
            <li>I use sulfer free shampoo all the time, but for some reason this left my hair feeling heavy with residue and not clean.  </li>

            <li> My hair salon sells it for more then twice the amount this merchant is selling it for.</li>
            <li> favorite product and more cheaper that in stores</li>
            <li> I love these products.</li>
            <li> I continued to use the shampoo and conditioner and have found that it makes my hair more manageable even without the treatment.</li>
            <li> and now my hair is so healthy.</li>
            <li> I get compliments on my hair and how shiny and healthy it looks.</li>
            <li> It also seems like my color holds longer because my hair is healthy.</li>
            <li> I love this Brazilian blow out shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> THE BEST and THE ONLY shampoo</li>
            <li> I bought most of the products they sell after having a Brazilian Blowout.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous!</li>
            <li> Love both products</li>
            <li> /&gt;NOT recommend this product to most people.</li>
            <li> quality and there are better products out there.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Will buy again as soon as I need more.</li>
            <li> I found all of them to be okay.</li>
            <li> There are products I like better.</li>
            <li> I like Chi&#x27;s Iron Guard  and Silk Fusion better than the Brazilian Blowout dimethicone based heat serum.</li>
            <li> …this didn&#x27;t cut it for me…I think panteen conditioner is way better for my hair type…I will continue to use the hair balm</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad to be able to purchase it at an affordable price :)</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner combo.</li>
            <li> now on I will be purchasing them from Amazon :)</li>
            <li> but since I&#x27;ve gotten this as well as the thermal balm my hair is cleaner a lot softer straighter and more shiny.</li>
            <li> After receiving the BB I wanted the best products to help make it last</li>
            <li> My hair is so healthy and shiny, and it cleans well.</li>
            <li> Recommend that those with wavy to curly hair for sure try it,</li>
            <li> but this product help to make it look healthy.</li>
            <li> An excellent product, especially if you have a brazillian blowout on your hair.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve had a Brazilian Blowout make sure to always use phosphate-free products so you don&#x27;t prematurely strip the BB treatment out of your hair.</li>
            <li> I receive a blowout treatment about every three months and this shampoo and conditioner keep my hair shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> Nice light scent that does not overpower.</li>
            <li> Smells like lemon :)</li>
            <li> Love these products.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair feeling healthy and frizz free at a cheaper price than the salon!</li>
            <li> Such a great deal!  </li>
            <li> love love love this product.</li>
            <li> My Brazilian Blowout was better than the Keratin treatment; my hair was straighter from the Brazilian Blowout.</li>
            <li> If you had the Brazilian blowout treatment, you should get this product to play it safe.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;But when these anti-frizz products are used with the &amp;#34;after-wash&amp;#34; products for deep conditioning and styling, they can be combined to create great results!  </li>
            <li> I love my hair after a Brazilian Blowout.</li>
            <li> The results of the Brazilian are so wonderful, of course I&#x27;m going to do everything possible to preserve it.</li>
            <li> Loves the way it leaves, hair shinny and frizz free !</li>
            <li> and I love these products.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great price</li>
            <li> In love.</li>
            <li> well it makes your hair feel and look healthy.</li>
            <li> I suggest that they can be send in a more economis way.</li>
            <li> Never realized these products were available on Amazon!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is effective, doesn&#x27;t require a lot to be used well, smells good, and leaves the hair fairly soft.  </li>
            <li> I got a Brazilian Blowout and afterward the stylist said I needed to be sure to use parafin and sulfate free shampoo/conditioner</li>
            <li> I love this Shampoo and Cream rinse make my hair so silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It works much better than the matrix sulfate free shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> fast shipping good price</li>
            <li> So glad I checked Amazon first!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;the hair gets super silky and strong!</li>
            <li> Smells great and keeps hair soft and smooth, but I do not recommend using this product repeatedly as it causes scalp build-up.</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny and so easy to comb thru</li>
            <li> The merchandise came very quickly.</li>
            <li> My hair is easy to manage now, and it dries faster.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried most of the popular Keratin and Blowout products (depending on the straightening treatment) and none of them worked very well.</li>
            <li> very satisfied with the product and the way it was package thanks.</li>
            <li> While it may work marvelously with the Brazilian Blowout, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s anything but average for those who don&#x27;t have the treatment.</li>
            <li> Love my brazillian blow out and the best way to keep it from frizzing back so fast is to use this shampoo and conditioner.. thank you ..</li>
            <li> i love it, hair felt so smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Perfect half the price of salon</li>
            <li> Product is great, much cheaper than buying from the salon, thanks!</li>
            <li> It is fantastic stuff.</li>
            <li> Keeps hair smooth and frizz free.</li>
            <li> great price for both products, I can only use this product being that I have the brazillian blowout in my hair.</li>
            <li> Just like cheap shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC PRODUCTS,</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner to keep&lt;br /&gt;Brazilian blow out lasting longer and even without one&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> I fel secure with the transaction &amp; the delivery</li>
            <li> Works well with the brazilian blowout treatment and keeps hair smooth longer.</li>
            <li> Hair is smooth</li>
            <li> I have received Keratin a few times and this is the best shampoo/conditioner to keep my hair in tip/top shape.  </li>
            <li> It does make my hair smooth and since I had the blowout done to my hair</li>
            <li> If I use another sulfate free shampoo and conditioner, I don&#x27;t notice any difference.  </li>
            <li> My hair has never been so smooth and silky, not even when I was a kid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to be able to buy them outside of the salon, the price is much more reasonable.</li>
            <li> My hair dries shiny, smooth and defined.  </li>
            <li> it smells good…but in my opinion its way too much for what it is…I really liked the balm for straightening your hair…</li>
            <li> I also think it has sulphates though is supposed to be sulphate free.  </li>
            <li> But it still keeps my hair frizz free.</li>
            <li> Sulfate free so does not damage hair or color.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> The shampoo conditioner system kept my hair moisturized and smooth for 4 months, extending the effects of the smoothing.</li>
            <li> It works great and would definitely recommend it to anyone out there!!</li>
            <li> My stylist is not carrying the products in the salon, so she suggest I used a paraben free shampoo and conditioner, which I had on hand.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to use this product unless you require a sulfate free product (keratin or smoothing blow out).</li>
            <li> These are products that I already use, they are fantastic.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Which is of course the most important part ;)</li>
            <li> I thought it smelled and felt like cheap drugstore shampoo, nothing special at all.</li>
            <li> and I am never disappointed.</li>
            <li> I originally posted a one star bc</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use this product and see how it worked.&lt;br</li>
            <li> LIKE THE ORIGINAL ONE</li>
            <li> I originally bought the Brazilian Blowout shampoo and conditioner from the salon, and the products from Beauty</li>
            <li> but once you blow dry and then you will have a shiny, smooth and healthy looking hair!!</li>
            <li> Brazilian blowout shampoo and conditinor is the best sulfate free shampoo I have ever used, my hair was really damaged and I was going to have to cut it all off , then I started using this shampoo and conditinor and with in a week it had smooth out my rough ends and helped so much with my frizzy hair and just made it feel Better all over .</li>
            <li> I have been using it for two years, by far the best product that help the blowout last longer.</li>
            <li> Did nothing special.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the way my hair turned out and I am not sure this product makes it better</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t get a better deal on this shampoo anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready to order more just in case</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much cheaper than most quality product lines.</li>
            <li> Nice thing about this product, for my naturally curly (but not wiry) hair, is I get the effect of a Blowout, without the cost of a Blowout.</li>
            <li> Using the correct shampoo really does matter, and buying thru Amazon makes it more affordable.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly</li>
            <li> I looked all over town and even tried a different kind of sulfate free shampoo that I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and leaves my hair soft and smooth</li>
            <li> depending on Texas weather, but overall great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Like most conditioners, it&#x27;s mainly a detangler, so</li>
            <li> Super quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Take a lot more conditioner than Shampoo (normal)</li>
            <li> My wife was very satisfied with the result even after several months of havng the brazilian blow-out treatment.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair in great condition and keeps my color from fading, which happens to be a vibrant red.</li>
            <li> Great product for hair treated with Keratin/Brazilian Blowout products; was half the price the salon wanted.</li>
            <li> but I was so happy to find it on amazon for less than that..</li>
            <li> but I can say it has made my hair a little more tamer for sure!</li>
            <li> Recently purchased this product &amp; I love it!</li>
            <li> Flat ironing was becoming a battle and my waves were almost winning.</li>
            <li> …it could possibly stop frizz…but the balm does that just fine too…that you put on after your hair is already washed…so why waste the money on the shampoo and conditioner…when I don&#x27;t leave the shower feeling wonderful</li>
            <li> it is an amazing shampoo and conditioner not only did it work for her hair</li>
            <li> and I wanted it to last, so I&#x27;ve been using this&lt;br /&gt;shampoo and Conditioner and its been amazing.  </li>
            <li> I follow some recommendations and after my treatment this product help my hair to stay smooth and straight.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how many suds you get.</li>
            <li> , scent is all off and different and lathers (unlike authentic BB sulfate free shampoo).&lt;br /&gt;***BEWARE-</li>
            <li> and I rarely use it.</li>
            <li> It is a luxurious line and worth the splurge if it works well for you.</li>
            <li> I love the way these products leave my hair feeling silky and soft.</li>
            <li> I believe ths protein treatment is effective and beneficial on human hair from 1A to 4C. For information on her treatment, just type</li>
            <li> and my hair is soft, shiny, and smooth!</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair soft and freeze free!</li>
            <li> Worth the buy.</li>
            <li> The scent is fabulous and tame my frizzies fairly well.</li>
            <li> I should have known less than 1/2 price for the set, to good to be true.  </li>
            <li> Much better than other sulfate free shampoos (even Bumble and Bumble!)</li>
            <li> I also think that the clients who come in to get it done love it more than other brands.</li>
            <li> I have no doubt they are the right products to use.</li>
            <li> I will probably always buy these products as long as they are available :)</li>
            <li> my hair was so healthy and soft the first day i used these in the shower</li>
            <li> excited to try the new product!</li>
            <li> I even did a good bar scan on the previous bottles and compared to the bar scan on the items I received and they are indeed the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Conditioner leaves hair soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure they work better than sulfate free products I have purchased in the store, but they seem to be fine.</li>
            <li> The shipment was super fast.  </li>
            <li> Last time I got a brazilian blowout (the real branded kind)</li>
            <li> The shampoo &amp; conditioner is great for any hair types if you want soft hair without paying high prices at the salon that use the same products</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> exactly what i ordered super fast ship time.</li>
            <li> This did not happen the first time, it seems to have been a compounding affect.</li>
            <li> The first month or 2 the shampoo and conditioner seemed to work well.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I would go back and get more  </li>
            <li> Purchasing this product thru Amazon Prime, the shampoo has a totally different consistency than the shampoos purchased thru a reputable salon.  </li>
            <li> Lightning fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I use both daily and love it.  </li>
            <li> I also purchased the deep conditioner and love it as well.</li>
            <li> I do find the smell of this to be pretty offensive.</li>
            <li> It really is anti-frizz!</li>
            <li> My hair finally looks so much better after trying so many different products over the years.</li>
            <li> I tried this after my first brazilian blow out hair treatment.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if its the brazilian blowout that I got in the first place.  </li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner really do prolong the life of a keratin treatment!</li>
            <li> They leave hair soft, shiny and frizz free.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sorry I purchased, because I will get the Brazilian Blowout Zero Plus this Summer.</li>
            <li> same product better price.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner seem to work pretty well.  </li>
            <li> My first Brazilian Blowout</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty useful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the price , I expected to see some kind of results.</li>
            <li> They clearly just used the bottle and put in a cheap shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> price was good - have been using shampoo for a few years, and like it.</li>
            <li> When I ran out I researched and found that this is the exact same product my stylist sold me for a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other sodium free, sulfate free shampoos</li>
            <li> After washing and &amp;#34;detangling&amp;#34;, using the deep conditioning masque is incredible, especially when left on overnight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past that I bought at a beauty supply store &amp; loved how it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li> The takes care of any remaining frizz and makes my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> (yes, I was certain to fully rinse out the shampoo and conditioner every time).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fine shampoo for regular hair, but the thing that makes this get 5 stars from me is that it leaves my hair soft, shiny, and lengthens the keratin treatment more significantly than when I use other shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Using a knock off or a cheaper brand will only ruin your treatment and make you need to get it done again--and Brazilian Blowouts aren&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li> It does make my blowout last longer and keeps my hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Love the product....makes my thick curly hair very shiny and smooth....</li>
            <li> I have very oily hair and even though it does not specify any type of hair usage</li>
            <li> I think shampoo is really gentle to prevent faded Brazilian blow out.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, but when it arrived there was conditioner everywhere inside the package.</li>
            <li> This is not the real product.  </li>
            <li> I had my hair treatment 2 months ago and my hair is very curly</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this stuff is real.</li>
            <li> Well I read the reviews AFTER I purchased the product AND used it and ready to reorder and was wondering why my hair was STILL frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I really like these products a lot.</li>
            <li> SO GENTLE ON THE HAIR</li>
            <li> FAST  SHIPPING,  </li>
            <li> works really well.</li>
            <li> was fast.</li>
            <li> Gentle on colored hair and soooo smoothing.</li>
            <li> Very impress with the service I got it with in2 days of order.</li>
            <li> I must note the fact that the flip top lids were sealed closed.  </li>
            <li> You really have to force it out.</li>
            <li> I get an off-brand keratin treatment, but this shampoo/conditioner combo really prolongs the life of it.</li>
            <li> not the real thing</li>
            <li> Would also recommend the intense mask.</li>
            <li> this is not the real stuff....</li>
            <li> I like the product and it was reasonably priced and arrived in a timely matter.</li>
            <li> it make you hair much softer and shinier.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference until I used this product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really like the way it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li> Not the real thing.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making my Blowout maintenance so affordable.  </li>
            <li> Salon prices are way to high, always use Amazon to buy these products!</li>
            <li> I have been told it holds the treatment much longer.</li>
            <li> Gentle on the hair and phosphate-free.</li>
            <li> and I can tell it has really protected my keratin treated hair.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny for my frizzy wild hair.</li>
            <li> The Anti-Frizz Shampoo &amp; Conditioner really helps prolong the blowout at a fraction of the salon price.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy hair and thus combo really gets it under control.</li>
            <li> Looks and smells like the real deal.</li>
            <li> Since it seemed to do the job I didn&#x27;t think much.</li>
            <li> (I had highlights and a brazillian blowout) and really like the product.  </li>
            <li> I expected a better result.    </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> These are NOT the real Brazilian Blowout Acai shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Thank you for fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I really like the Brazilian Blowout Anti Frizz Shampoo and Conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Product works well and does keep the hair straight and frizz-less longer.</li>
            <li> but it IS NOT the real shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Not too heavy &amp; moisturizes nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice and love it so far.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is okay, and smells fantastic, but doesn&#x27;t leave my hair totally &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34;, which other products have done.  </li>
            <li> In the past, the product always has seemed authentic, but I do not thing the most recent shampoo is the real thing.  </li>
            <li> I will say it did make a huge difference when washing, blow drying &amp; flat ironing my hair.</li>
            <li> Price is definitely better on Amazon over other online vendors and salons.</li>
            <li> I will never use any other shampoo or conditioner - this stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was more affordable than other options, and I just had a Keratin treatment and wanted to get a specialized shampoo and conditioner to protect</li>
            <li> This is my personal experience with this product, but it doesn&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t work great for someone else which apparently it does due to all the good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not sure of the reason, but there is a big difference between the results I experienced with this product before and now.</li>
            <li> Really, probably deserves two stars because of the high price.</li>
            <li> It didnt offer any special quality and especially not for the money.</li>
            <li> Unlike any previous bottles or what I know is the real thing from salons, my latest bottle has a grainy texture.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly hair normally.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without these!</li>
            <li> Hers is a protein treatment that delivers, shine, smoothness, ease of styling, and less heat needed for good styling results when flat ironed...similar to a BB or Keratin treatment, without the chemicals or heat.</li>
            <li> originally bought at salon, but this saves me a few dollars, and getting the same Salon product I love.</li>
            <li> If you had the Brazilian Blow Dry Treatment, this products realy help to maintain your hair frizz free.</li>
            <li> For even better results I use this same brand&#x27;s Daily Smoothing Serum.</li>
            <li> Left my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I wrote a review at the time, but said I had to try the products longer to see if they were better than Keratin shampoo (with a different brand color saving conditioner) which I had been using before I got the actual Brazilian treatment.    </li>
            <li> Highly recommend to people with curly hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product even if you don&#x27;t have the Brazilian Blow out.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend them as they are both the price they charge.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My expectations were too high for these products.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and very manageable.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised how fast this came.  </li>
            <li> i noticed the more i kept using these everyday</li>
            <li> Maybe I have to use it a few times more.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the right brand.</li>
            <li> I have ordered so many shampoo and conditioners trying to tame my hair&#x27;s frizzies and nothing has truly worked until this.</li>
            <li> Worth the money as a little goes a long way and you&#x27;ll love the feel of your hair.  </li>
            <li> Then I&#x27;ll update my results with this product versus other sulfate free products,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I buy new bottles just as soon as I&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without Brazilian blowouts or the accompanying products.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> shipped and sealed like new.</li>
            <li> and I have new hair since doing them and using these products.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I should have spent the extra money for a better quality product.</li>
            <li> Very soft, no friz.  </li>
            <li> The results are not as long lasting as an instense protein treatments, but her treatment is easy and  made in the comfort of your kitchen.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I use it with the brazilian blowout every 3-4 months and my hair is so soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> It Is are the same exact products.  </li>
            <li> My hair has never been so soft and frizz-free with these products!</li>
            <li> After using this product for years I am pretty sure whomever is behind this listing  is now selling knockoffs.</li>
            <li> It really extends the life of the BB treatment and helps keep my very frizzy hair undercontrol even when I go too long between processes!</li>
            <li> Its soft and shiny and not dead!</li>
            <li> how heavy it is on my fine hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It left my hair feeling MORE dry and coarse.</li>
            <li> It keeps your hair soft and silky, and it doesn&#x27;t ruin the treatment.</li>
            <li> I have natural curls</li>
            <li> Used it for a month so far</li>
            <li> Use enough but not too much.</li>
            <li> I had a brazilian blowout done professionally at a salon and the package included the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> my hair was soft and shiny again,</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt so soft and looks shiny.  </li>
            <li> and they leave my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this again, but from a different seller as it wasn&#x27;t available from the same seller on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My hair is worn naturally.</li>
            <li> …my hair is naturally wavy</li>
            <li> Three days after I started using the shampoo and conditioner, I developed dandruff which I&#x27;ve never had in my life.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li> No trouble blow drying my hair</li>
            <li> Now I have to send the whole order back.</li>
            <li> keeps my hair shiny and soft after blow drying and straightening.</li>
            <li> My wife has naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> You hear that the product could be old or a knock off.</li>
            <li> Wow what a difference.  </li>
            <li> , my hair didn&#x27;t feel soft and it wasn&#x27;t as manageable.  </li>
            <li> Make your Brazillian Blowout last much longer.</li>
            <li> My opinion changed completely after using the product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other sulfate free shampoo and conditioner but always come back to BB brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other sulfate free products before that left my hair feeling greasy after about a week.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, getting a brazilian blowout can cause hair to break leaving you with shorter pieces of hair and a less full head of hair.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend  it especially if you use keratin it Brazilian blowout treatments!</li>
            <li> It really works on the frizz and as long as you rinse it out</li>
            <li> After using a clarifying shampoo my hair was back to normal.</li>
            <li> This product really makes my Brazilian blowout last longer which is the only thing that has truly removed my frizz in this humidity.  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft, shiny and I have no fly aways :)</li>
            <li> im not sure if the product is original or not....</li>
            <li> Now I use no other product and I can go a month longer between getting another Brazilian Blowout.</li>
            <li> This proves to keep my hair down!</li>
            <li> compared to other conditioners i think this washes out easier than some of the other sodium free shampoos</li>
            <li> Keeps your hair extra smoothe and soft.  </li>
            <li> First time ai got a blowout I used my regular shampoo and conditioner and it didn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> Just recently I had my hair salon order product direct from the Brazilian blowout company.</li>
            <li> the shampoo is thick so it lasts too a long time :)</li>
            <li> a little hard to lather but other than that they were great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so strong to discourage using it, but it&#x27;s not good.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t use any other anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of trying new products especially when there are such rave reviews.</li>
            <li> I have been only using these products that I bought online since I got my Brazilian Blowout only two months ago, and it has already faded considerably</li>
            <li> It does nothing special to my hair and it&#x27;s hard to lather.</li>
            <li> the way, I have kinky curly hair, very tight zig-zag curl pattern in the back and loose waves on top, spiral curls on sides, so a combination of African American hair.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m so surprised its lasted this long.</li>
            <li> but I made my hair feel really weighed down.</li>
            <li> Best of all it is so much less expensive to buy this product on Amazon!!</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy hair, due to years of flat ironing my hair.  </li>
            <li> Shampoo is super thick when you go to pour it out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I used to constantly search for and try new shampoos and conditioners and hair serums; spent TONS of money and years on my search.  </li>
            <li> So to pay a little extra for products that will help it along is the smart thing to do.  </li>
            <li> Using other sulfate-free shampoo, I feel like I need a new blowout after about 8 weeks.</li>
            <li> Money well spent, particularly if you are 40+ and want to keep your hair long.</li>
            <li> Not worth the high price tag.</li>
            <li> No other shampoo will make your blowout last as long.</li>
            <li> I use sulfer free shampoo all the time, but for some reason this left my hair feeling heavy with residue and not clean.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had spent twice as much on the shampoo + conditioner at the mall from the beginning--the blowout is much more expensive!</li>
            <li> my hair seemed normal but slightly poofier and frizzy.</li>
            <li> as well the other products this brand offers.</li>
            <li> Since spending the all that money for the Brazilian Blowout I wanted to use the correct shampoo and conditioner to make the process last as long as possible and have purchased this shampoo and conditioner from local salons and beauty supply stores and paid this price for each,</li>
            <li> Flat ironing is a breeze now and doesn&#x27;t take so long nor do I have to go back over more difficult sections of my hair.</li>
            <li> but it dint last me long enough.....</li>
            <li> and this really tames it down and makes it not look frizzy and dry!!</li>
            <li> The shampoo left my hair feeling dirty and the conditioner is no different than any other regular Kind I can get at a drugstore.  </li>
            <li> not sure if this is the real stuff</li>
            <li> but my hair treatment dint last long....</li>
            <li> However, after using it and drying my hair, I almost don&#x27;t need to flat iron my hair (almost).</li>
            <li> Even when I don&#x27;t flat iron, my hair resists tangles and styling time is decreased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I stopped using the flat iron, but the friz is still there.  </li>
            <li> In fact my hair was left feeling dry and in need of a detangler which never happens.</li>
            <li> I have far less frizz them before.</li>
            <li> Recently, I have had some trouble getting my naturally wavy hair to cooperate.</li>
            <li> I will continure to purchase it as long as I continue getting the Brazilian blowout</li>
            <li> As long as this is sold on Amazon I will purchase from this seller.</li>
            <li> I have straight thick hair</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and a lot less expensive here than in the salon.</li>
            <li> No different from any other product</li>
            <li> These products were recommended by my hair stylist and they work extremely well, especially the hair conditioner.</li>
            <li> expensive, but worth it if you have unsightly frizzy hair like I do!</li>
            <li> After I had a Brazilian blowout I bought this shampoo &amp; conditioner along with several other products.</li>
            <li> So spend a little extra and get from an actual salon.</li>
            <li> Two months later, I bought this shampoo (and other products) on line from Amazon to try to prolong the effects.</li>
            <li> I purchased thinking it is original but received fake the products do not buy</li>
            <li> so by the 4th day my hair was DRY</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner cured the dry hair problem I had been dealing with for over 6 months.</li>
            <li> While this shampoo doesn&#x27;t dry out the hair, and the conditoner is moisturizing,  Deva Curl Zero shampoo and \\&quot;Organic</li>
            <li> My hair is so dry</li>
            <li> If your hair is feeling dry and &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; give these products a try</li>
            <li> After using it my hair looks dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> After I straightened my hair it was very shiny (but a little stiff and tangly)</li>
            <li> It took an expensive hair appointment on a cruise to finally find the right products for my curly/wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> Not really sure if it is old or if it may be expired (if shampoo has an expiration date).  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it girls, aging has it&#x27;s challenges and hair can fall victim to your years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled it works on my hair and if keratin treatments were a lot less expensive, I&#x27;d get one, but since they&#x27;re not, I&#x27;m satisfied with the results I&#x27;ve gotten just using this shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product smells different, makes my hair frizzy now, and my hair feels greasy/oily less than 24 hours after using.</li>
            <li> I have never had less frizz or anything different with my hair.  </li>
            <li> The reason is that I have had several Brazillian Blowouts in the past and they always last 12-16 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I decided to look online and found the set for almost HALF the price I would have paid in the salon but still the same quality product.</li>
            <li> The consistency was different along w a slight difference in the smell.</li>
            <li> Only need small amounts of each; they last me 2.5 months or so.</li>
            <li> It almost looks greasy afterwards and I have very dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Shampoo came very dry, like a glue</li>
            <li> Bought it to make my Brazilian Blowout last a little longer</li>
            <li> It only takes a little bit though.  </li>
            <li> still need to flat iron and style but the process takes much less time</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even brush my hair and eventually i had to force my hair loose with a brush and my hair TORE!</li>
            <li> I have terrible frizz issues, but this stuff keeps my hair looking great for months.  </li>
            <li> I have the professional Brazilian Blowout treatment performed on my hair at least once a year.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo a few years back</li>
            <li> Product expected arrived.</li>
            <li> Monies invested in this product is well spent.</li>
            <li> My hair last for days  between shampoos, even in heavy humid conditions.  </li>
            <li> I have had a blowout for a few years now, and I know from experience if you use the shampoo and conditioner it will last longer.</li>
            <li> I realized this after spending a few minutes in the shower trying with all my might to open the bottles.  </li>
            <li> treatment done to my hair a few weeks prior too.</li>
            <li> conditioner doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;lather effect&amp;#34; to it…and mentally some people need that</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product from this same supplier a few times.  </li>
            <li> A few months later I had a Keratin treatment.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend to people with thick and coarse hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is not that thick or coarse, so the blowout was supposed to last 4 months.</li>
            <li> Delivered earlier than expected and it&#x27;s HALF the cost my salon sells it for!  </li>
            <li> This is the exact same product sold at my stylist salon but less expensive.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It gives a little dry texture before you dry your hair</li>
            <li> This is not a pure BB product.  </li>
            <li> I used this once and noticed it made my hair frizzy when air dried (before flat ironing).</li>
            <li> but I like these sulfate-free products for my crazy dry hair and scalp (areas of different textures: wavy, curly, straight and frizzy).  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> No sulfates, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> the only thing is that the bottles contain very little product</li>
            <li> Seems like any other shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> my hair was extremely greasy looking.</li>
            <li> These product swill make your hair feel like it did when you were 20!</li>
            <li> I use every other time I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> I would not use any other shampoo or conditioner.  </li>
            <li> and I can see the difference compared with the other shampoo brands out there.</li>
            <li> have tried other keratin treatments</li>
            <li> Buyers be aware THIS STUFF IS FAKE.</li>
            <li> Is the first time I don&#x27;t recommend a seller, but this shampoo is really expensive</li>
            <li> When my hair stylist told me how expensive a keratin treatment would be, I decided I would try products like this first before paying such a ridiculous amount of money on a treatment.</li>
            <li> And it lasts a long time because you need very little,</li>
            <li> Helps with the frizz but not worth the yuck feeling.</li>
            <li> Expensive but gentle on chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li> is working really well for me (unfortunately because of the price)</li>
            <li> Plus, it makes the life of my brazilian treatment last longer, at least 3 months.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair oily greasy and weighed down.</li>
            <li> Half the price from the salon.</li>
            <li> Stripped my Brazilian blowout faster than the previous ones.</li>
            <li> They were on time, half the price of salons, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Half of what it is in the salons</li>
            <li> I find the combo for the half the price..</li>
            <li> This one is gone after less than 8 weeks.  </li>
            <li> They are less than half the price of purchasing them at the salon.</li>
            <li> This was half the price I paid in the salon</li>
            <li> Less than half the price of my hair salon</li>
            <li> I just wish it cost less.</li>
            <li> I previously reviewed this product just based on the delivery.  </li>
            <li> Not a true product.</li>
            <li> But, they tend to be heavy on my hair and weigh it down.</li>
            <li> dry frizzy and/or thick hair.  </li>
            <li> THERE WAS NO CONDITIONER BOTTLE, SO HALF OF MY ORDER IS MISSING..</li>
            <li> If too much is used though, it weighs my hair down and makes it feel dirty.</li>
            <li> My little sister loves this shampoo</li>
            <li> I wish I didn&#x27;t buy it because I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel greasy and heavy.</li>
            <li> Surprised it is so expensive in salons.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all been a rediculous waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wash everyday, and I always use the BB products.</li>
            <li> I fete both products made my hair curtly and wavy not smooth.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Half the cost you would pay in salon!</li>
            <li> Root Stimulator Replenishing conditioner\\&quot; works just as well (if not better) for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> However, I found this on Amazon and the cost was MUCH less!.  </li>
            <li> I have bought the product from Target and other places-exact same product and helps preserve your expensive hair treatment.</li>
            <li> I have read other reviews from different sellers that say the products are fake, so I stay away from them, but the products from Beauty</li>
            <li> After that my hair seemed to have almost a permanent build-up in it and got the greasy/ dirty hair feeling MUCH faster than usual.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really helps tame frizz, even months after your blowout.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it, because its very fake, the bottles look like the real shampoo and conditioner bottles made  by La brazilian blowout</li>
            <li> , seems very old, i am too busy to deal with refund, but I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Usually, I buy each for 40$, but got both of them for that price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Not a big issue since the tops can be twisted off</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if its because of the shampoo &amp; conditioner or from the blowout itself.</li>
            <li> I would still get the blowout done and use this because I would rather have greasy hair than crazy frizzy wild curly hair.</li>
            <li> I am not sure, but I will not reorder this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is or not</li>
            <li> I purchased the same items from the salon and paid double :(&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
            <li> Really expensive considering damaged and half empty bottle.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair so dry and difficult to comb.</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my hair look dull and lifeless.</li>
            <li> And my Brazilian blowout lasts at least four months.  </li>
            <li> Seems to extend the life of my Blowout by at least a month.</li>
            <li> Both products are thick</li>
            <li> It made me get itchy bumps all over my scalp, neck, upper back, shoulders and worst of all</li>
            <li> Way less expensive here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not the real thing, dried out my hair terribly.  </li>
            <li> Thick shampoo, very thick conditioner</li>
            <li> hated the shampoo immediately - it felt like it left a slick film on my hair.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is very very thick</li>
            <li> The cap was broken.</li>
            <li> the worse my hair was getting.</li>
            <li> so to this day i still have these broken hairs that curl up and explode off my scalp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, one must remember shampoos and conditioners that work really well for one person may be awful for another.</li>
            <li> approximately every 2/ 6 months max.</li>
            <li> Although my hair was silkier from the shampoo, the conditioner was not great</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the results I&#x27;m used to when I buy it at my salon were not the same :(</li>
            <li> I like the very subtle citrusy fragrance.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner made my hair tangle up so bad that little pieces of my hair kept coming out.</li>
            <li> My hair also felt very weak and thin after using these products.</li>
            <li> Anti frizz brands, but in real these products which are  listed here is bad fake, and it  turned my hair  so dry ,as bad as,so complicated to brush after taking a shower!!!!</li>
            <li> The shampoo is grainy, like there is something weird in it.</li>
            <li> So thankful after spending lots of money on the wrong products.</li>
            <li> I believe I was sold a fake product.  </li>
            <li> I decided to give this product a chance, although it was insanely expensive</li>
            <li> They are expensive.  </li>
            <li> Is it quality control issue or fake products?  </li>
            <li> Expensive.</li>
            <li> Either they were mediocre, or my hair built up built up a tolerance.  </li>
            <li> Hair feels dirty.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel my hair oily or dirty yet shine and freezless.</li>
            <li> When I purchased it I was very skeptical of buying it on amazon.</li>
            <li> I broke out in BAD hives on my forehead.</li>
            <li> Our Bad.</li>
            <li> even though its a bit pricey (the amazon price isnt that bad)</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s comment: Very disappointed in Amazon Prime.  </li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> However this shampoo and conditioner was especially disappointing.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Amazing products.  Highly recommend to people with curly hair.</li>
            <li> Works great for frizz esp with humidity</li>
            <li> I had a brazillian blow out and purchased this product for after use. It worked great on my hair. Shampoo for scalp and condition the longer parts of your hair for the best results.</li>
            <li> Truly work as advertised! my Brazilian blow out still looks good after 2 months and I can say it&#x27;s greatly because of the shampoo and conditioner. I don&#x27;t use anything else and my hair is frizz free!</li>
            <li> Best shampoo &amp; conditioner for Brazilian blowout or any straightening treatment. Not too heavy &amp; moisturizes nicely.</li>
            <li> Works great and keeps my daughter&#x27;s blow out looking fresh.  The price was almost 50% cheaper than any where else.</li>
            <li> Wow!  The products I need to keep my Blow-out activated at a FRACTION of the cost!</li>
            <li> Or trust after spending lots on a Brazilian Blow out.  I highly recommend this product even if you don&#x27;t have the Brazilian Blow out.  It is fantastic stuff.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the right brand. It works wonders. If you&#x27;ve had a Brazilian Blowout, use this. It keeps your hair soft and silky, and it doesn&#x27;t ruin the treatment. It&#x27;s expensive, but it&#x27;s worth it. Using a knock off or a cheaper brand will only ruin your treatment and make you need to get it done again--and Brazilian Blowouts aren&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li> I get Brazilian Blowouts religiously every 3 months. I&#x27;ve tried other sulfate free shampoo and conditioner but always come back to BB brand. It does make my blowout last longer and keeps my hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li> This is the true product!!! Half the cost you would pay in salon! My Brazilian Blowout has lasted even LONGER than my stylist said it would if I bought the product from her! You will not be disappointed. So glad I checked Amazon first!!</li>
            <li> Love it.  Half the price from the salon.</li>
            <li> The shampoo &amp; conditioner is great for any hair types if you want soft hair without paying high prices at the salon that use the same products</li>
            <li> this did n othing for my frizz in florida did  not straighten out anything but the thickness of my wallet</li>
            <li> The shampoo does what it is supposed to do.  It prolongs your Brazilian blowout. I was surprised by how many suds you get. I used this shampoo a few years back and it didn&#x27;t lather.  Happy with the product</li>
            <li> Excellent product &amp; seller!!!!</li>
            <li> Great products at reasonable price</li>
            <li> I got a Brazilian Blowout and afterward the stylist said I needed to be sure to use parafin and sulfate free shampoo/conditioner so I should use this. It made me get itchy bumps all over my scalp, neck, upper back, shoulders and worst of all I broke out in BAD hives on my forehead. My forehead swelled to almost twice it&#x27;s size and I got burning itchy bumps all over! This did not happen the first time, it seems to have been a compounding affect.</li>
            <li> I did not have the brazilian done to my hair, but a friend recommended it anyway. I like the product, but was hoping for more. I&#x27;m sure it works better when you have the brazilian done.</li>
            <li> I have brazilian blowout keratin treated hair, and this shampoo/conditioner work the best. Usually, I buy each for 40$, but got both of them for that price on Amazon. Great deal.</li>
            <li> I use this event when I don&#x27;t have keratin.  It always makes my hair feel great and super smooth.  Love.</li>
            <li> Simply love it to help hair under control. It is good for sleekness. Have been using it for over 6 month</li>
            <li> Keeps hair smooth and frizz free.</li>
            <li> I loved using this after my blowout.  My hair is very unruly and it worked great for me!</li>
            <li> Real thing, great price. I love my Brazillian Blow out. You really can&#x27;t get a better deal on this shampoo anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Great product for hair treated with Keratin/Brazilian Blowout products; was half the price the salon wanted.</li>
            <li> Horrible. I don&#x27;t like it.  Leaves hair oily greasy and weighed down. Helps with the frizz but not worth the yuck feeling. Hair feels dirty.</li>
            <li> This is an investment in the hair treatment done. No other shampoo will make your blowout last as long.</li>
            <li> Love the product....makes my thick curly hair very shiny and smooth....still need to flat iron and style but the process takes much less time</li>
            <li> I am not all that pleased. Seems like any other shampoo and conditioner. It didnt offer any special quality and especially not for the money.</li>
            <li> Product expected arrived. Excellent products wold recommend to anyone. I have very oily hair and even though it does not specify any type of hair usage I don&#x27;t feel my hair oily or dirty yet shine and freezless. Loved them still after  10mo of usage.</li>
            <li> It is a good product,, I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Not the stuff I bought in the salon - don&#x27;t buy it.  Might be a knock-off.  Did not have the same effect on my hair.</li>
            <li> Love both the shampoo and conditioner. I use both of them daily! I would highly recommend them as they are both the price they charge.</li>
            <li> I have ordered so many shampoo and conditioners trying to tame my hair&#x27;s frizzies and nothing has truly worked until this. I am so pleased with this product that it will now be a staple in my shower. My hair is soft, shiny and I have no fly aways :)</li>
            <li> Delivered earlier than expected and it&#x27;s HALF the cost my salon sells it for!  Very happy with the product as I made a considerable investment in getting the Brazilian hair straightening process done at my salon and this product protects that investment.  Very happy I bought this product!</li>
            <li> This is amazing I have natural curls and this really tames it down and makes it not look frizzy and dry!! I&#x27;m hooked on this product!!</li>
            <li> After using this product for years I am pretty sure whomever is behind this listing  is now selling knockoffs. The shampoo is grainy, like there is something weird in it. Also, it has been damaging my hair. Buy it elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Love this product. So awesome! I will continure to purchase it as long as I continue getting the Brazilian blowout</li>
            <li> I use sulfer free shampoo all the time, but for some reason this left my hair feeling heavy with residue and not clean.  I currently have the Brazilian blow out in my hair and will give it another try but do not see a future purchase of this anti frizz shampoo.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent for those who have received the brazilian blowout treatment. It helps you maintain that look for ever. Monies invested in this product is well spent.</li>
            <li> I am going to get a masque too! I think shampoo is really gentle to prevent faded Brazilian blow out.</li>
            <li> I was planning on spending tons of money on a Brazilian Blowout and decided to purchase the shampoo and conditioner offered instead. My hair last for days  between shampoos, even in heavy humid conditions.  I&#x27;ve only used it twice and love it so far. I&#x27;m ready to order more just in case they stop offering it on Amazon</li>
            <li> I really like this product, but when it arrived there was conditioner everywhere inside the package. The cap was broken. Besides that I was happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is not the real product.  I have been using the BB products from the salon for 4 years now.  The shampoo is not supposed to lather like regular shampoo and the the product brought from Amazon did that. This is not a pure BB product.  Do not use this if you have the treatment as this will ruin your blowout.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, great price, speedy delivery</li>
            <li> Like many others, I found the Brazilian Blowout treatment and decided I should take good care of my hair. This exact shampoo and conditioner is pretty expensive at my salon, so I did some Amazon sleuthing and found this listing. I&#x27;m glad I found this price because I&#x27;m not planning on buying it anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Hmmm...a mixed review for me. The shampoo and conditioner smell great, and the shampoo has a nice rich lather, which I appreciate. But, they tend to be heavy on my hair and weigh it down. It almost looks greasy afterwards and I have very dry hair.  I&#x27;ll finish the bottles and just wear my hair up, but I probably won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo to use after my Brazilian blowout treatment. The first month or 2 the shampoo and conditioner seemed to work well. After that my hair seemed to have almost a permanent build-up in it and got the greasy/ dirty hair feeling MUCH faster than usual. I switched out this product and went back to a clarifying shampoo because I was convinced the shampoo was leaving build up or proteins in my hair (yes, I was certain to fully rinse out the shampoo and conditioner every time). After using a clarifying shampoo my hair was back to normal. Would recommend mixing this shampoo up every once in a while.</li>
            <li> Bought these for the wife.  $37 for both when she was paying $37 for just one of them at the local place she gets her hair done.  Will be a repeat buyer now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past that I bought at a beauty supply store &amp; loved how it made my hair feel. This product I bought through amazon does not give me the same results which makes me think this is not the same thing.</li>
            <li> Used it for a month so far and it&#x27;s extending the time my blowout should last. I had my hair treatment 2 months ago and my hair is very curly so I&#x27;m so surprised its lasted this long.</li>
            <li> fast shipping good price</li>
            <li> The shampoo definitely helps  my Brazilian blowout last longer.  I can have it last about 12 weeks now.  Using other sulfate-free shampoo, I feel like I need a new blowout after about 8 weeks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this stuff is real. It does nothing special to my hair and it&#x27;s hard to lather. I get the Brazilian blowout every eight weeks and this stuff doesn&#x27;t make it last longer. This shampoo makes my hair look dull and lifeless. Opposite of what everyone else says. I wish I didn&#x27;t buy it because I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Shampoo and conditioner turned my frizz into manageable hair in the heat and humidity. Especially important if you&#x27;ve had the brazilian straightening treatment.</li>
            <li> It took an expensive hair appointment on a cruise to finally find the right products for my curly/wavy hair.  Worth the money as a little goes a long way and you&#x27;ll love the feel of your hair.  So thankful after spending lots of money on the wrong products.</li>
            <li> Smells great and keeps hair soft and smooth, but I do not recommend using this product repeatedly as it causes scalp build-up. Price is definitely better on Amazon over other online vendors and salons.</li>
            <li> great price for both products, I can only use this product being that I have the brazillian blowout in my hair.</li>
            <li> Great product and price...thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Well I read the reviews AFTER I purchased the product AND used it and ready to reorder and was wondering why my hair was STILL frizzy.  NOW I know, it was a knockoff.</li>
            <li> Take a lot more conditioner than Shampoo (normal)</li>
            <li> The BBO Shampoo has some type gritty granules in it.  Not really sure if it is old or if it may be expired (if shampoo has an expiration date).  Unfortunately the results I&#x27;m used to when I buy it at my salon were not the same :(</li>
            <li> I think the shampoo and conditioner help to make my Brazilian treatment last longer.  I really like these products a lot.</li>
            <li> Did nothing special. Just like cheap shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC PRODUCTS, SO GENTLE ON THE HAIR AND YET NOURISHING</li>
            <li> This is the exact same product sold at my stylist salon but less expensive.  She tried to tell me not to buy from Amazon because it will be a replica and not the same shampoo and conditioner, well, she lied.  This is the same shampoo and conditioner she use and I love it.  It makes my hair so soft and smooth.  As long as this is sold on Amazon I will purchase from this seller.</li>
            <li> It was what I wanted and came on time I would go back and get more  Ian happy with the products</li>
            <li> FAST  SHIPPING,  GREAT  QUALITY</li>
            <li> i had the treatment done by a good saloon.....but it dint last me long enough.....im not sure if the product is original or not....cuz havent compared it with saloon bought stuff.....but my hair treatment dint last long....so next time i might go with a saloon bought stuff</li>
            <li> Great hair cleansing products. Expensive but gentle on chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner to keep&lt;br /&gt;Brazilian blow out lasting longer and even without one&lt;br /&gt;Great products and leaves hair silky sodt</li>
            <li> works really well. Use enough but not too much. Probably different for every head of hair.</li>
            <li> Shampoo had granules or something similar to sand in it. Stripped my Brazilian blowout faster than the previous ones. Stick with the products that your salon sells.</li>
            <li> The price of these products is phenomenal, practically have of what you should expect to pay in the salon. I fel secure with the transaction &amp; the delivery was fast. Thank you.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s comment: Very disappointed in Amazon Prime.  This is the 2nd time I have purchased this product thru Amazon Prime and the 2nd time I question the validity of the product.  Purchasing this product thru Amazon Prime, the shampoo has a totally different consistency than the shampoos purchased thru a reputable salon.  The 1st time I purchased the shampoo thru Amazon Prime, I question the consistency of the shampoo.  The 2nd purchase, the shampoo has a grit texture - similar to that of a face scrub used for exfoliation.  I will not be purchasing this product again thru Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> Lightning fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Excellent Shampoo. Gentle on colored hair and soooo smoothing. My hair has never felt so good after a shampoo and in humid weather!!! A must try... It smells good too!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it, because its very fake, the bottles look like the real shampoo and conditioner bottles made  by La brazilian blowout Anti frizz brands, but in real these products which are  listed here is bad fake, and it  turned my hair  so dry ,as bad as,so complicated to brush after taking a shower!!!!</li>
            <li> Makes my Brazilian Blowout last 6 months. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love this Shampoo and Cream rinse make my hair so silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Works well with the brazilian blowout treatment and keeps hair smooth longer.</li>
            <li> I have had a blowout for a few years now, and I know from experience if you use the shampoo and conditioner it will last longer. Why spend that kind of money on your hair and not take care of it?</li>
            <li> The product was not authentic.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought this shampoo/conditioner from the salon for years, until I decided to try the convenience of Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The texture, scent is all off and different and lathers (unlike authentic BB sulfate free shampoo).&lt;br /&gt;***BEWARE-NO NOT BUY***</li>
            <li> I have ordered these several times now and I am never disappointed. I think it helps extend my blowout for longer than the 3 month period. Comes packaged well.</li>
            <li> Not a true product. I believe I was sold a fake product.  After using this shampoo for two weeks my keratin/Brazilian treatment was just about ruined.</li>
            <li> It works great and fast shipping</li>
            <li> My wife loves this shampoo!!</li>
            <li> I decided to give this product a chance, although it was insanely expensive (I purchased before it was on sale). I purchased it 6+ months ago and I rarely use it. I don&#x27;t like the smell or how heavy it is on my fine hair. I&#x27;m sure, for some, it&#x27;s an amazing product. But, for me, I&#x27;ll stick with Kenra and Infusium 23.</li>
            <li> Great!  Bought both shampoo and conditioner. They were on time, half the price of salons, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I originally posted a one star bc the product didnt arrive. But I got it today. And it was an error from USPS. It was lost ... for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im excited to try the new product!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo works wonder</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two Brazilian blow outs.  They are expensive.  So to pay a little extra for products that will help it along is the smart thing to do.  I love these products because they make my hair feel and look healthy.  I use it even when I&#x27;m between blowouts!</li>
            <li> Shampoo came very dry, like a glue, seems very old, i am too busy to deal with refund, but I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> In August 2014 I tried the brazilian blowout treatment at a salon and I bought this shampoo and conditioner. The treatment wore off by november but even now in Feb 2015 I still do use the shampoo and conditioner and I buy new bottles just as soon as I&#x27;m out. My hair used to be curly and frizzy but now its more of a calmed curly/wavy type. and i LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;d recommend this even if you haven&#x27;t had the brazilian blowout keratin treatment.</li>
            <li> Stopped getting the Brazilian Blowout but still use the shampoo and conditioner. Keeps the frizz controlled and hair is manageable.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, a little goes a long way. Though still pricey, it&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great buy and arrived just in time!</li>
            <li> This a great shampoo and conditioner duo. I love the smell and the feel of my hair after it is washed.</li>
            <li> After having Brazillian Blowout this the perfect shampoo. Smell is great and don&#x27;t have to use a lot.</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel greasy and heavy. Didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Conditioner bottle damaged and spilled out. Really expensive considering damaged and half empty bottle. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> My little sister loves this shampoo</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without Brazilian blowouts or the accompanying products.</li>
            <li> I had a brazilian blowout done professionally at a salon and the package included the shampoo and conditioner. I was so happy with my brazilian blowout my hair was so healthy and soft the first day i used these in the shower my hair seemed normal but slightly poofier and frizzy. i noticed the more i kept using these everyday the worse my hair was getting. so by the 4th day my hair was DRY and TANGLED I couldn&#x27;t even brush my hair and eventually i had to force my hair loose with a brush and my hair TORE! my brazilian blowout and hair was RUINED! so to this day i still have these broken hairs that curl up and explode off my scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done he Brazilian Blowout and bought the shampoo and Conditioner from the salon for about $50 dollars more. When I ran out I researched and found that this is the exact same product my stylist sold me for a more reasonable price. I even did a good bar scan on the previous bottles and compared to the bar scan on the items I received and they are indeed the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We must all remember that out stylist add cost to their product to make money ... I told my stylist about that after my 2nd blowout and she told me she buys them and adds $ to her cost to make money. She even accidentally admitted she got them from Amazon. Oopps!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of trying new products especially when there are such rave reviews. However this shampoo and conditioner was especially disappointing. I have straight thick hair and it did nothing to leave my hair feeling conditioned. In fact my hair was left feeling dry and in need of a detangler which never happens.</li>
            <li> my fave shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> Works great. Hair is smooth</li>
            <li> great deal on both.  Half of what it is in the salons</li>
            <li> I had the Brazilian blowout done about two weeks ago. I used this once and noticed it made my hair frizzy when air dried (before flat ironing). After I straightened my hair it was very shiny (but a little stiff and tangly) but it&#x27;s been shiny after the BB keratin treatment anyway. I really wanted to like it and thought it would be the best for me since it is supposed to go well with the BB treatment. I thought it smelled and felt like cheap drugstore shampoo, nothing special at all. Surprised it is so expensive in salons. Shampoo lathers well though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, one must remember shampoos and conditioners that work really well for one person may be awful for another. This is my personal experience with this product, but it doesn&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t work great for someone else which apparently it does due to all the good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is working really well for me (unfortunately because of the price) is the Oribe line of shampoos and conditioners. All of them are keratin safe, I&#x27;ve tried the gentle line and the moisture and control and both are great. When BB made my hair frizzy I thought the BB treatment was starting to wear off already. Then the next washing I went back to Oribe and my hair was soft and shiny again, no frizz even when air dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to try to see what works for you. My salon gave me Oribe samples so I could see which combo works best for me before committing to the hefty price they carry. It is a luxurious line and worth the splurge if it works well for you.</li>
            <li> i love it, hair felt so smooth and clean. I would recommend this product to anyone with the keratin or brazilian</li>
            <li> Same as what my wife paid $75 at the hair dresser</li>
            <li> I use both daily and love it.  My hair has never felt so soft and looks shiny.  I also purchased the deep conditioner and love it as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my daughter got the Brazilian Blowout. it is an amazing shampoo and conditioner not only did it work for her hair but it works for mine as well and I don&#x27;t have a Brazilian Blowout.I have far less frizz them before.</li>
            <li> Purchased after a Brazilian Blowout to make it last and I love the product,  My hair is shiny and so easy to comb thru</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without these! I have received Keratin a few times and this is the best shampoo/conditioner to keep my hair in tip/top shape.  Thick shampoo, very thick conditioner and they leave my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I love this product and can&#x27;t go without it. Very impress with the service I got it with in2 days of order.</li>
            <li> I must note the fact that the flip top lids were sealed closed.  I realized this after spending a few minutes in the shower trying with all my might to open the bottles.  Not a big issue since the tops can be twisted off but it explains the lower price on this product. If I could find the same product at a comparable price from another seller I would buy from them instead.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 3-4 weeks now and this is what I have found.... Shampoo is super thick when you go to pour it out of the bottle. You really have to force it out. It does make my hair smooth and since I had the blowout done to my hair I&#x27;m sure it helps in keeping it silky. My hair seems to be more greasy than before. I&#x27;m not sure if its because of the shampoo &amp; conditioner or from the blowout itself. Either way its still greasy. I would still get the blowout done and use this because I would rather have greasy hair than crazy frizzy wild curly hair. I think this is a good product.</li>
            <li> I have been using these products for over  a year. My hair salon sells it for more then twice the amount this merchant is selling it for. Will keep on buying from them. THE PRODUCT IS AMAZING...can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Your hair gets softer and the smell is wonderful. My entire family loves this product, and all the ladies want to buy it now.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t attest to the authenticity of this product as I have never purchased this from a salon. Also, I have never had a keratin treatment done on my hair. Recently, I have had some trouble getting my naturally wavy hair to cooperate. Flat ironing was becoming a battle and my waves were almost winning. When my hair stylist told me how expensive a keratin treatment would be, I decided I would try products like this first before paying such a ridiculous amount of money on a treatment. I&#x27;m big on scent and I do prefer anything going on my body smell good, but in this case, I can make an exception. I do find the smell of this to be pretty offensive. It&#x27;s not so strong to discourage using it, but it&#x27;s not good. However, after using it and drying my hair, I almost don&#x27;t need to flat iron my hair (almost). It really is anti-frizz! Flat ironing is a breeze now and doesn&#x27;t take so long nor do I have to go back over more difficult sections of my hair. My hair finally looks so much better after trying so many different products over the years. I&#x27;m thrilled it works on my hair and if keratin treatments were a lot less expensive, I&#x27;d get one, but since they&#x27;re not, I&#x27;m satisfied with the results I&#x27;ve gotten just using this shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*edit* I recently purchased this again, but from a different seller as it wasn&#x27;t available from the same seller on Amazon. I am not sure of the reason, but there is a big difference between the results I experienced with this product before and now. The product smells different, makes my hair frizzy now, and my hair feels greasy/oily less than 24 hours after using. Is it quality control issue or fake products?  I am not sure, but I will not reorder this product.</li>
            <li> I have not had the Brazilian blow out  procedure but I like these sulfate-free products for my crazy dry hair and scalp (areas of different textures: wavy, curly, straight and frizzy).  Both products are thick so I would say they&#x27;re best for folks with dry frizzy and/or thick hair.  I like the very subtle citrusy fragrance.  I recently purchased the mask to use on my ends until I run out of the regular conditioner, at which time I will use the mask as my regular conditioner.  I also use this line&#x27;s heat protectant balm for those days when I use heat styling tools.</li>
            <li> favorite product and more cheaper that in stores</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I wanted and at a great price.</li>
            <li> shipped and sealed like new. happy with the product and results of the shine in hair. Great stuff... I loved it.</li>
            <li> I get an off-brand keratin treatment, but this shampoo/conditioner combo really prolongs the life of it. The takes care of any remaining frizz and makes my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> If you get the Brazillian Blowout, why not get the products meant to go with it. Money well spent, particularly if you are 40+ and want to keep your hair long. Let&#x27;s face it girls, aging has it&#x27;s challenges and hair can fall victim to your years.  But you do t have to when their are products like this on the market!</li>
            <li> This is a great deal for both.  I got a Brazilian Blowout 7 months ago, and even though that is all gone, I still use this shampoo and conditioner.  Whenever I use another shampoo or conditioner, my frizz factor multiplies.  I will stick with these so I don&#x27;t have to worry about frizz anymore.  I like that there are no sulfates.</li>
            <li> I got it really fast and in a good condition also it was a great price I recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> Makes frizzy hair straighter. Works well after a Brazilian Blowout. Paid 30 bucks a bottle at the salon! Way less expensive here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, getting a brazilian blowout can cause hair to break leaving you with shorter pieces of hair and a less full head of hair. The shampoo, however, does not cause hair to break.</li>
            <li> horrible...damaged my 299.00 treatment. not the real thing</li>
            <li> Best for keeping hair healthy, shinny and manageable.</li>
            <li> Using these products let&#x27;s me go for weeks longer between colorings.  And my Brazilian blowout lasts at least four months.  I will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Keeps your hair extra smoothe and soft.  I have terrible frizz issues, but this stuff keeps my hair looking great for months.  I get the Brazilian Blowout done at my hair stylist and then use the shampoo/conditioner to maintain the look.  And an extra bonus is the price of the shampoo/conditioner!  It&#x27;s much cheaper than most quality product lines.</li>
            <li> First time ai got a blowout I used my regular shampoo and conditioner and it didn&#x27;t last as long. Now I use no other product and I can go a month longer between getting another Brazilian Blowout. Would also recommend the intense mask.</li>
            <li> I love these products. Good price here</li>
            <li> The company I purchased this from was very quick in sending it out to me! Thank you!!! I also have the Brazilian Blowout Treatment on my hair, and I&#x27;m very satisfied with that and the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I got the Brazilian Blowout treatment last year.  I continued to use the shampoo and conditioner and have found that it makes my hair more manageable even without the treatment.</li>
            <li> Please, don&#x27;t bother reviewing if you havent&#x27; had the Brazilian Blowout or Keratin treatment done.  It&#x27;s a fine shampoo for regular hair, but the thing that makes this get 5 stars from me is that it leaves my hair soft, shiny, and lengthens the keratin treatment more significantly than when I use other shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other sodium free, sulfate free shampoos but they are not as good as this one.  Wish it was cheaper though.</li>
            <li> I started using this shampoo about 5 months ago and now my hair is so healthy. I get compliments on my hair and how shiny and healthy it looks. It also seems like my color holds longer because my hair is healthy.</li>
            <li> I love this Brazilian blow out shampoo and conditioner. I tried this after my first brazilian blow out hair treatment. It makes my hair soft and very manageable.  Plus, it makes the life of my brazilian treatment last longer, at least 3 months.  Also it smells soooo good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reading all the reviews that day this is not the real stuff....I&#x27;m not sure if it is or not but I can say it has made my hair a little more tamer for sure!</li>
            <li> I like the product and it was reasonably priced and arrived in a timely matter.</li>
            <li> However, we needed 2 Shampoos, not 1 and 1.  We thought it was 2 Shampoos.  Our Bad.</li>
            <li> OK -- nothing great.  I had a BB Zero, and am using this shampoo and conditioner since then.  If I use another sulfate free shampoo and conditioner, I don&#x27;t notice any difference.  So, I&#x27;m just giving them 3 stars.  Really, probably deserves two stars because of the high price.</li>
            <li> I have the Brazillian Blowout treatment done to my hair every 3 months and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else for shampoo and conditioner. My hair has never been so smooth and silky, not even when I was a kid. I use all of the Brazillian Blowout products.</li>
            <li> Great lather with shampoo. Conditioner leaves hair soft and easy to manage. Will buy again when product is gone. Great value</li>
            <li> Works great after I got the Brazilian Blowout from a salon.  I went from fuzzy hair that took 3 hours to straighten to beautiful hair that takes 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> This product keeps my Brazilian blow out looking good. it make you hair much softer and shinier. I would recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> THE BEST and THE ONLY shampoo I will use now.</li>
            <li> I bought most of the products they sell after having a Brazilian Blowout.  I love the way these products leave my hair feeling silky and soft.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Arrived quickly</li>
            <li> I get keratin and blowout treatments. This proves to keep my hair down!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. And it lasts a long time because you need very little,</li>
            <li> It has a nice citrus smell and makes my hair looks shiny. I got Brazilian blowout 2 weeks ago and have been using these products since.&lt;br /&gt;It gives a little dry texture before you dry your hair but once you blow dry and then you will have a shiny, smooth and healthy looking hair!!</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo ever! Makes your hair so smooth, healthy and shiny! Highly recommend  it especially if you use keratin it Brazilian blowout treatments!</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner cured the dry hair problem I had been dealing with for over 6 months. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Fabulous! Much better than other sulfate free shampoos (even Bumble and Bumble!) silky shiny hair! Love both products</li>
            <li> A must buy if you had the brazilian blowout. I have been using it for two years, by far the best product that help the blowout last longer.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Product works great on my hair, very satisfied!  Shipping was pleasing as well.</li>
            <li> If you had the Brazilian Blow Dry Treatment, this products realy help to maintain your hair frizz free.</li>
            <li> bought this product for my mom and she liked it alot . the only thing is that the bottles contain very little product</li>
            <li> I have the professional Brazilian Blowout treatment performed on my hair at least once a year.  This product is key to helping to maintain and extend the life of that treatment.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use this product and see how it worked.&lt;br /&gt;UNFORTUNATELY, it did not meet my hopes and expectations.&lt;br /&gt;It left my hair feeling MORE dry and coarse. I had the brazillian&lt;br /&gt;blowout treatment done to my hair a few weeks prior too. I would&lt;br /&gt;NOT recommend this product to most people. I feel as if it is&lt;br /&gt;poor quality and there are better products out there.</li>
            <li> This stuff just doesn&#x27;t seem to work.  I don&#x27;t know if its the brazilian blowout that I got in the first place.  I have never had less frizz or anything different with my hair.  It&#x27;s all been a rediculous waste of money.  I got a brazilian blowout a year or so ago... didn&#x27;t use this shampoo afterwards, and it was great and lasted 3 mos.</li>
            <li> Great product. Seller is great.</li>
            <li> This shampoo &amp; conditioner works great on my hair.  I love it!!  I recently had a blowout but I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference until I used this product.</li>
            <li> Same thing I got from the salon just cheaper! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I needed.  Works great.  It was shipped quickly and received in great condition.</li>
            <li> If you care about your hair, you need to use these products.</li>
            <li> originally bought at salon, but this saves me a few dollars, and getting the same Salon product I love. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Expensive. No different from any other product</li>
            <li> definitely recommend to people with thick and coarse hair!&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has the best pricing for this set.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy and share you experience</li>
            <li> Cheapest price I can find and product is awesome</li>
            <li> This is a good product but it&#x27;s pricey.</li>
            <li> Nice thing about this product, for my naturally curly (but not wiry) hair, is I get the effect of a Blowout, without the cost of a Blowout. For even better results I use this same brand&#x27;s Daily Smoothing Serum. It&#x27;s a really good line of products with a nice, non offensive smell.</li>
            <li> does what its says it suppose to do</li>
            <li> Recommended by my hairdresser. Excellent upkeep for the Brazilian Blowout. Seems to extend the life of my Blowout by at least a month.</li>
            <li> Great value good product</li>
            <li> Product delivered on time ,and as advertised.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner really do prolong the life of a keratin treatment! It&#x27;s great to be able to buy them outside of the salon, the price is much more reasonable.</li>
            <li> I treat my mane to a brazillian blowout and my hair stylist recommends that I use the BB products to ensure the hair stays in style for longer.. I don&#x27;t regularly see these shmapoos in stores (or have never bothered to look) as I buy them from my hair stylist itself and she charges be 60 dollars for the Shampoo and Conditioner Combo..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was running out of the supply and thought of looking it up on Amazon and Voila I find the combo for the half the price.. I ordered it. The products are already great and now I get it for a great price. This Shampoo and Conditioner will make your frizz go away in a way that you wont believe it..</li>
            <li> Just as described! I love this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent was delivered in a couple of days.</li>
            <li> After a Brazilian blowout treatment, this is the best way to keep your smooth sleek hair! I don&#x27;t wash everyday, and I always use the BB products. It works. I get compliments all the time on my hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner made my hair tangle up so bad that little pieces of my hair kept coming out. A lot of hair came out! I had to take each hair, strand by strand, just to keep my hair from breaking off. My hair also felt very weak and thin after using these products.</li>
            <li> These are perfect to use if you have a Brazilian Blowout.  They leave hair soft, shiny and frizz free.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really like the way it made my hair feel. Bought it to make my Brazilian Blowout last a little longer but I made my hair feel really weighed down.</li>
            <li> This has help me extend the life of my Brazilian Blowout. Will buy again as soon as I need more.</li>
            <li> Again-not to be used without actually getting a Brazilian Blowout (not a keratin treatment-if they told you to not wash your hair for 48-72 hrs you did not actually get a brazilian blowout).  I have bought the product from Target and other places-exact same product and helps preserve your expensive hair treatment.</li>
            <li> Best deal!  Using the correct shampoo really does matter, and buying thru Amazon makes it more affordable.</li>
            <li> Not the real thing. Today I bought the bottles of these products from the beauty supply store at the mall and they are visibly different! I have been only using these products that I bought online since I got my Brazilian Blowout only two months ago, and it has already faded considerably so I got suspicious. My hair is not that thick or coarse, so the blowout was supposed to last 4 months. I wish I had spent twice as much on the shampoo + conditioner at the mall from the beginning--the blowout is much more expensive!</li>
            <li> I purchased shampoo and conditioner from my local stylist and it was $90 for both.  Thanks for making my Blowout maintenance so affordable.  My hair and wallet thank you!</li>
            <li> Not worth the high price tag.</li>
            <li> I will never use any other shampoo or conditioner - this stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a BB yet. I purchased these products based on someone&#x27;s recommendation for a really good anti frizz shampoo and conditioner. While it may work marvelously with the Brazilian Blowout, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s anything but average for those who don&#x27;t have the treatment. That was my experience. While this shampoo doesn&#x27;t dry out the hair, and the conditoner is moisturizing,  Deva Curl Zero shampoo and \\&quot;Organic Root Stimulator Replenishing conditioner\\&quot; works just as well (if not better) for a lot less money. My expectations were too high for these products. I purchased the duo along with their heat styling serum. I found all of them to be okay. There are products I like better. I like Chi&#x27;s Iron Guard  and Silk Fusion better than the Brazilian Blowout dimethicone based heat serum. Admittedly, I am a reformed product and hair junkie. I don&#x27;t recommend for anyone who doesn&#x27;t have the Blowout.  No sense spending the extra money if it&#x27;s not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sorry I purchased, because I will get the Brazilian Blowout Zero Plus this Summer. Then I&#x27;ll update my results with this product versus other sulfate free products,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I won&#x27;t be getting a Blowout. I don&#x27;t need it.  I&#x27;ve found \\&quot;The Cherry Lola Treatment\\&quot;. She&#x27;s on youtube. Hers is a protein treatment that delivers, shine, smoothness, ease of styling, and less heat needed for good styling results when flat ironed...similar to a BB or Keratin treatment, without the chemicals or heat. The results are not as long lasting as an instense protein treatments, but her treatment is easy and  made in the comfort of your kitchen. \\&quot;Sit\\&quot; time on the hair is only 30 minutes. I am no longer transistioning. My hair is worn naturally. After her treatment, I can wash and go, without the need for any curl defining products. My hair dries shiny, smooth and defined.  Initially, I used while still in transistion, so I know it benefits of the Cherry Lola treatment on relaxed hair as well.  I believe ths protein treatment is effective and beneficial on human hair from 1A to 4C. For information on her treatment, just type Cherry Lola in youtube&#x27;s search bar. I highly recommend. The only con in all the pros I listed; one person said she lost color from her hair dye after using. I didn&#x27;t have that problem, but something to consider.</li>
            <li> it smells good…but in my opinion its way too much for what it is…I really liked the balm for straightening your hair…so I bought the shampoo and conditioner….the conditioner doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;lather effect&amp;#34; to it…and mentally some people need that…my hair is naturally wavy so I need a good conditioner and detangler…this didn&#x27;t cut it for me…I think panteen conditioner is way better for my hair type…I will continue to use the hair balm but I won&#x27;t be buying the shampoo and conditioner again…it could possibly stop frizz…but the balm does that just fine too…that you put on after your hair is already washed…so why waste the money on the shampoo and conditioner…when I don&#x27;t leave the shower feeling wonderful</li>
            <li> this is the best hair care ever!!!!  I&#x27;m so glad to be able to purchase it at an affordable price :)</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product from this same supplier a few times.  In the past, the product always has seemed authentic, but I do not thing the most recent shampoo is the real thing.  Unlike any previous bottles or what I know is the real thing from salons, my latest bottle has a grainy texture.  I also think it has sulphates though is supposed to be sulphate free.  The reason is that I have had several Brazillian Blowouts in the past and they always last 12-16 weeks.  This one is gone after less than 8 weeks.  Sulphates reverse the effects. Will not buy again and advise others not to.</li>
            <li> I ONLY RECEIVED THE SHAMPOO BOTTLE AND IT WAS NOT SEALED! THERE WAS NO CONDITIONER BOTTLE, SO HALF OF MY ORDER IS MISSING.. AND THE PRODUCT DOESNT SMELL LIKE THE ORIGINAL ONE, IT SMELLS DIFFERENT... I DONT KNOW WHAT IS IN THAT BOTTLE</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner combo. I purchased the same items from the salon and paid double :(&lt;br /&gt;From now on I will be purchasing them from Amazon :)</li>
            <li> Have used it for a couple of weeks.  Hair feels nice. I use it to maintain my Rusk smoothing I had done.</li>
            <li> I have keratin product in my hair and before I was using a vegan shampoo/conditioner but since I&#x27;ve gotten this as well as the thermal balm my hair is cleaner a lot softer straighter and more shiny. It&#x27;s been about three months so I need a touch up . But it still keeps my hair frizz free. This is meant for brazilian keratin treatment only . If you have un treated hair you won&#x27;t see any results</li>
            <li> Perfect half the price of salon</li>
            <li> great product, the purchase was super easy!</li>
            <li> Great product to keep your hair from fizzing . I can go out in the rain and not have to worry!!!</li>
            <li> After receiving the BB I wanted the best products to help make it last but I didn&#x27;t want to pay the salon prices for it. I looked all over town and even tried a different kind of sulfate free shampoo that I didn&#x27;t like. I decided to look online and found the set for almost HALF the price I would have paid in the salon but still the same quality product. It smells great and feels nice and my hair is soft, shiny, and smooth!</li>
            <li> I like the product. It has a great scent and makes my hair so manageable.  It is a bit pricey, but has worked well to maintain my Brazilian blowout application.  So?</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was more affordable than other options, and I just had a Keratin treatment and wanted to get a specialized shampoo and conditioner to protect it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hated the shampoo immediately - it felt like it left a slick film on my hair. By that night (I washed in the morning) my hair was extremely greasy looking. Three days after I started using the shampoo and conditioner, I developed dandruff which I&#x27;ve never had in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have spent the extra money for a better quality product.</li>
            <li> I had the Brazilian done on my hair a month ago and I wanted it to last, so I&#x27;ve been using this&lt;br /&gt;shampoo and Conditioner and its been amazing.  My hair is so healthy and shiny, and it cleans well.</li>
            <li> Good ingredients, works nicely with keratin-straightened hair which it helps maintain.  Have been using it for years.  No sulfates, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Excellent product when you have keratine</li>
            <li> These are essential to maintain a Brazillian blowout.  They are less than half the price of purchasing them at the salon.</li>
            <li> A price too good to be true.  Not the real thing, dried out my hair terribly.  Won&#x27;t purchase on Amazon again.</li>
            <li> Hair looks great, healthy. Products arrive on time</li>
            <li> The Brazilian Blowout Anti-frizz shampoo and conditioner enable the brazillian blowout procedure I had , to last a lot longer.  The scent is fabulous and tame my frizzies fairly well.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.  I should have known less than 1/2 price for the set, to good to be true.  This will be returned ASAP</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner! It really extends the life of the BB treatment and helps keep my very frizzy hair undercontrol even when I go too long between processes!</li>
            <li> This is a necessary shampoo is you straighten your hair with a &amp;#34;Brazillian Blow Out&amp;#34; or keratine treatment.  No phosphates, either!&lt;br /&gt;Better price here than at the salon, too~</li>
            <li> Sulfate free so does not damage hair or color. Great product, have been using it for about a year now and hair hasn&#x27;t felt or looked healthier. Recommend that those with wavy to curly hair for sure try it, as well the other products this brand offers. Salon prices are way to high, always use Amazon to buy these products!</li>
            <li> great for brazilian blowouts. same product better price. compared to other conditioners i think this washes out easier than some of the other sodium free shampoos</li>
            <li> Great product. I loved it! Left my hair soft and smooth. I will continue to use this product. My hair is so dry but this product help to make it look healthy.</li>
            <li> Using on my hair that currently has the Brazilian Blowout. Works well and smells good. No trouble blow drying my hair</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner seem to work pretty well.  I&#x27;m not really sure they work better than sulfate free products I have purchased in the store, but they seem to be fine.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair great! I use it with the brazilian blowout every 3-4 months and my hair is so soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> An excellent product, especially if you have a brazillian blowout on your hair.  Love the smell and leaves my hair soft and smooth</li>
            <li> great product and quick shipping</li>
            <li> If you have invested in a keritan treatment by Brazilian Blowout, you must use their shampoo and conditioner.  Therefore, based on that I find no problem with both products.  I have been told it holds the treatment much longer.</li>
            <li> I purchased the shampoo , conditioner &amp; thermal balm combo. Awesome savings in products. The savings gave me the funds to get the combo. The products are just like @ the salon. But with a savings! It arrived in the time frame given.</li>
            <li> These products were recommended by my hair stylist and they work extremely well, especially the hair conditioner. Gentle on the hair and phosphate-free. If you&#x27;ve had a Brazilian Blowout make sure to always use phosphate-free products so you don&#x27;t prematurely strip the BB treatment out of your hair.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and I can tell it has really protected my keratin treated hair.</li>
            <li> I got two conditioners instead of one shampoo and one conditioner. Now I have to send the whole order back.</li>
            <li> I got this because I got a Brazilian blowout at my salon. Great price I found on Amazon and works really well helping me maintain my hair also smells nice.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is very very thick so you have to use a lot of the product to get a lather worked up.</li>
            <li> Since spending the all that money for the Brazilian Blowout I wanted to use the correct shampoo and conditioner to make the process last as long as possible and have purchased this shampoo and conditioner from local salons and beauty supply stores and paid this price for each,</li>
            <li> These product swill make your hair feel like it did when you were 20! If your hair is feeling dry and &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; give these products a try</li>
            <li> I use these products daily. I receive a blowout treatment about every three months and this shampoo and conditioner keep my hair shiny and healthy looking. Nice light scent that does not overpower. Great price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!! Couldn&#x27;t be happier😊</li>
            <li> Worth every penny for my frizzy wild hair. keeps my hair shiny and soft after blow drying and straightening. Smells like lemon :)</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and excellent products!!!</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner if you&#x27;ve had a Brazilian blowout.</li>
            <li> Works great with the Brazillian blow-out treatment. Product helps maintain longer results. I get Brazillian blow outs maybe.. approximately every 2/ 6 months max. depending on Texas weather, but overall great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how fast this came.  The product is amazing goes perfect with my treatment.  It works much better than the matrix sulfate free shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my hair specialist that does my Brazilian Blowout. It has worked well.  I use every other time I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair in great condition and keeps my color from fading, which happens to be a vibrant red. Love these products.</li>
            <li> This product is works well with the Brazilian Blowout...love it! Leaves your hair feeling healthy and frizz free at a cheaper price than the salon!</li>
            <li> Such a great deal!  My first Brazilian Blowout and I didn&#x27;t want to spend $90 on the product at the salon.  Phew!!  A saviour!!</li>
            <li> I fete both products made my hair curtly and wavy not smooth. Maybe I have to use it a few times more.</li>
            <li> This was half the price I paid in the salon</li>
            <li> Is this product good for stripping out relaxers,haven&#x27;t purchase yet?</li>
            <li> My wife has naturally curly hair so she gets a Brazillian blowout every six months. The Anti-Frizz Shampoo &amp; Conditioner really helps prolong the blowout at a fraction of the salon price.</li>
            <li> I tried this at a friends house and my hair was instantly moisturized. even though its a bit pricey (the amazon price isnt that bad) i decided to buy it. The shampoo and conditioner leave my hair like it never has before. Its soft and shiny and not dead! love love love this product.</li>
            <li> Superb product-great price from this vendor!</li>
            <li> The  best shampoo and Conditioner for hair that has had Brazilian Blowout!</li>
            <li> expensive, but worth it if you have unsightly frizzy hair like I do!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have frizzy hair and thus combo really gets it under control. I thought at first the conditioner was going to be too heavy - but don&#x27;t be fooled! It leaves your hair with body and shiny.</li>
            <li> Started using this after getting the treatment and now I won&#x27;t use anything else on my hair.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  It makes my hair smooth and shiny.  I get regular Brazilian Blowouts (every 12-16 weeks) and I have new hair since doing them and using these products.  I used to constantly search for and try new shampoos and conditioners and hair serums; spent TONS of money and years on my search.  I tried a Brazilian Blowout, and these products about a year ago and I haven&#x27;t switched since!!  I would only recommend buying these products from &amp;#34;Beauty It Is&amp;#34; store on Amazon......I originally bought the Brazilian Blowout shampoo and conditioner from the salon, and the products from Beauty It Is are the same exact products.  I have read other reviews from different sellers that say the products are fake, so I stay away from them, but the products from Beauty It Is are legit!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Brazilian Blowout shampoo and conditioner since my hairdresser introduced me to the product about a year ago.  I like how it  relaxes the frizz in my hair.  Happy to know I can buy it thru Amazon.  I will keep ordering.</li>
            <li> I saved about $10 for the two products as compared to purchasing at the hair salon..This is a good value.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s good. Looks and smells like the real deal.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the product! It keeps my hair smooth and shiny. Helps maintain the Brazilian Blowout. The merchandise came very quickly. I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
            <li> Purchased after receiving the Brazilian Blowout service in salon. The shampoo conditioner system kept my hair moisturized and smooth for 4 months, extending the effects of the smoothing. Will buy again after next service.</li>
            <li> After I had a Brazilian blowout I bought this shampoo &amp; conditioner along with several other products. I will say it did make a huge difference when washing, blow drying &amp; flat ironing my hair. I have very curly hair normally. When I purchased it I was very skeptical of buying it on amazon. You hear that the product could be old or a knock off. Since it seemed to do the job I didn&#x27;t think much. Just recently I had my hair salon order product direct from the Brazilian blowout company. It was double the cost but I did notice a difference. The consistency was different along w a slight difference in the smell. I also noticed a difference in how my hair felt and blew out. So spend a little extra and get from an actual salon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other sulfate free products before that left my hair feeling greasy after about a week.  I never wanted to purchase this in the salon b/c of the expense and went to over the counter.  However, I found this on Amazon and the cost was MUCH less!.  I&#x27;ve used for a month now (I had highlights and a brazillian blowout) and really like the product.  I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Recently purchased this product &amp; I love it! It works great and would definitely recommend it to anyone out there!!</li>
            <li> Terrific product especially with 95% humidity</li>
            <li> This is a great price for these products.  The shipment was super fast.  I can look forward to shopping for my Brazilian products here.</li>
            <li> Last time I got a brazilian blowout (the real branded kind) i used coppola keratin shampoo for color treated hair and I thought that was nice.  This time around I found a great deal here on amazon for the brazilian blowout shampoos.  Wow what a difference.  I also got the leave in.</li>
            <li> I had an actual Brazilian Blowout done. Two months later, I bought this shampoo (and other products) on line from Amazon to try to prolong the effects. Although my hair was silkier from the shampoo, the conditioner was not great (I really liked the masque) and I was disappointed. I expected a better result.    I wrote a review at the time, but said I had to try the products longer to see if they were better than Keratin shampoo (with a different brand color saving conditioner) which I had been using before I got the actual Brazilian treatment.    A few months later I had a Keratin treatment. So I switched back to the Keratin Shampoo. I added a Keratin Conditioner, bought from the beauty salon where I received the treatment. My hair is easy to manage now, and it dries faster. Go for the Keratin Products.I would recommend buying them in a salon if you can.    My Brazilian Blowout was better than the Keratin treatment; my hair was straighter from the Brazilian Blowout. So I can only attribute my easier day-to-day upkeep to the Keratin products.</li>
            <li> If you had the Brazilian blowout treatment, you should get this product to play it safe.  I am happy with the way my hair turned out and I am not sure this product makes it better but I know it maintains the treatment well.</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve used to date:  I ordered these based on the praise I saw in my online research, and they turned out to be the very same product recommended by my stylist, after I had a Brazilian Blow-out. I would have felt foolish if she was pushing something else that turned out to be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve tried most of the popular Keratin and Blowout products (depending on the straightening treatment) and none of them worked very well. Either they were mediocre, or my hair built up built up a tolerance.  This shampoo is effective, doesn&#x27;t require a lot to be used well, smells good, and leaves the hair fairly soft.  The conditioner is okay, and smells fantastic, but doesn&#x27;t leave my hair totally &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34;, which other products have done.  Like most conditioners, it&#x27;s mainly a detangler, so it&#x27;s pretty useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when these anti-frizz products are used with the &amp;#34;after-wash&amp;#34; products for deep conditioning and styling, they can be combined to create great results!  After washing and &amp;#34;detangling&amp;#34;, using the deep conditioning masque is incredible, especially when left on overnight.</li>
            <li> I love my hair after a Brazilian Blowout. My stylist told me to use these products to lengthen the life of the Brazilian and I follow her directions. After fighting my curls all my life I was thrilled when I was introduced to the Brazilian. I love it! Although I don&#x27;t like the SMELL of the shampoo and conditioner I have no doubt they are the right products to use. The results of the Brazilian are so wonderful, of course I&#x27;m going to do everything possible to preserve it. I showed these products to my stylist and she couldn&#x27;t believe the price and said buy them. At her salon the shampoo alone is $34, so $40 for both - yay! Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> loved this products!!! the shampoo is thick so it lasts too a long time :)&lt;br /&gt;the hair gets super silky and strong!</li>
            <li> The best for my hair!</li>
            <li> Super quick delivery. Excellent product and price!</li>
            <li> great shampoo &amp; conditioner</li>
            <li> I follow some recommendations and after my treatment this product help my hair to stay smooth and straight. Good price. It smell good.</li>
            <li> very satisfied with the product and the way it was package thanks.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair so dry and difficult to comb. I had to stop using it. It was taking me 20 minutes to comb my hair out after the shower.</li>
            <li> For the price , I expected to see some kind of results. The shampoo left my hair feeling dirty and the conditioner is no different than any other regular Kind I can get at a drugstore.  Also, doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as the serum</li>
            <li> Loves the way it leaves, hair shinny and frizz free !</li>
            <li> Love my brazillian blow out and the best way to keep it from frizzing back so fast is to use this shampoo and conditioner.. thank you ..exactly what i ordered super fast ship time.</li>
            <li> These are NOT the real Brazilian Blowout Acai shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I am a stylist who is certified to perform the treatment and Brazilian Blowout does not make this product!!&lt;br /&gt;If in question check out their website on line and call customer service.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be fooled, Counterfit is everywhere!</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t use any other anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really helps tame frizz, even months after your blowout. It&#x27;s been a year since my blowout, and I still use it.</li>
            <li> I suggest you purchase this for your Brazilian Blowout products. My stylist is not carrying the products in the salon, so she suggest I used a paraben free shampoo and conditioner, which I had on hand. I didn&#x27;t like the end result, my hair didn&#x27;t feel soft and it wasn&#x27;t as manageable.  Once I purchased the Brazilian Blowout products, my hair felt like it did when I left the salon. Even when I don&#x27;t flat iron, my hair resists tangles and styling time is decreased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I have kinky curly hair, very tight zig-zag curl pattern in the back and loose waves on top, spiral curls on sides, so a combination of African American hair.</li>
            <li> I have never found anything that compares.  This product really makes my Brazilian blowout last longer which is the only thing that has truly removed my frizz in this humidity.  Thank you for fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Love these products! Make your Brazillian Blowout last much longer. Great service from this shipper too.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner is great!  I have very frizzy hair, due to years of flat ironing my hair.  I stopped using the flat iron, but the friz is still there.  This product leaves my hair feeling and looking great!  Very soft, no friz.  I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Best price. Less than half the price of my hair salon and I love these products.</li>
            <li> If you have keratin (or Brazilian) straightened hair, these are the best hair care products.  The conditioner is especially helpful to reduce tangling.  I would not use any other shampoo or conditioner.  And the price is the best!!</li>
            <li> Brazilian blowout shampoo and conditinor is the best sulfate free shampoo I have ever used, my hair was really damaged and I was going to have to cut it all off , then I started using this shampoo and conditinor and with in a week it had smooth out my rough ends and helped so much with my frizzy hair and just made it feel Better all over .</li>
            <li> Great shampoo.  I&#x27;m going to keep using it even after the blowout is gone from my hair.</li>
            <li> Great for the price!!! Love it</li>
            <li> Best hair care product line I ever used!</li>
            <li> The product works to reduce frizz. I just wish it cost less. This product has made my hair easier to manage. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Product is great, much cheaper than buying from the salon, thanks!</li>
            <li> This shampoo/conditioner set did *wonders* with my Brazilian Blowout! My hair has never looked so great. Perfect addition.</li>
            <li> Great product, works great in humid weather!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great price</li>
            <li> a little hard to lather but other than that they were great</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this shampoo and conditioner! Makes my hair so smooth and soft! My salon sold this to me for $50 but I was so happy to find it on amazon for less than that.. I will probably always buy these products as long as they are available :)</li>
            <li> This is good stuff to use if you&#x27;ve had a straightening treatment done on your hair.  It controls frizz without a straightening treatment. It only takes a little bit though.  If too much is used though, it weighs my hair down and makes it feel dirty.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a very good shampoo product for my wife and this is the one recommended by the stylist who did her brazilian blow out. My wife was very satisfied with the result even after several months of havng the brazilian blow-out treatment. Happy wife- happy life!!  I also tried using it and I can see the difference compared with the other shampoo brands out there. I already bought this product twice and will be buying again before we ran out of this shampoo. Many thumbs up!!!</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair soft and freeze free! In love.</li>
            <li> one of my favorite shampoos and conditioners, works great and keeps the frizz to a minimum</li>
            <li> Smells awesome and lathers great.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to use this product unless you require a sulfate free product (keratin or smoothing blow out).</li>
            <li> not sure if this is the real stuff but if it is it shouldn&#x27;t beâ€¦. it is not hydrating or smoothing  â€¦ I will never purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Brazilian Blowout products for 2 years. I absolutely love it, and my clients do too! Which is of course the most important part ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other keratin treatments but I continue to use Brazilian Blowout. I also think that the clients who come in to get it done love it more than other brands. No restrictions, which makes it easier for them!</li>
            <li> I really like the Brazilian Blowout Anti Frizz Shampoo and Conditioner.  It really works on the frizz and as long as you rinse it out well it makes your hair feel and look healthy.</li>
            <li> These are products that I already use, they are fantastic. Definitely I recommend them. I suggest that they can be send in a more economis way.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been so soft and frizz-free with these products! Also my hair isn&#x27;t greasy at all with these products!</li>
            <li> Need to use if you have a BB- smells wonderful( orange smell) and works great!</li>
            <li> Buyers be aware THIS STUFF IS FAKE. I purchased thinking it is original but received fake the products do not buy</li>
            <li> Love it, it works perfectly with the treatment that I had with the beauty saloon</li>
            <li> No problems whatsoever. Delivery came as scheduled to.</li>
            <li> Great to be able to order more at once.</li>
            <li> this product dries out my hair. After using it my hair looks dry and brittle. Not for me</li>
            <li> This is a great product for Brazilian Blow Outs.&lt;br /&gt;Reasonably priced</li>
            <li> this is amazing! i love it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and a lot less expensive here than in the salon. Only need small amounts of each; they last me 2.5 months or so.</li>
            <li> 2nd bottle purchased and this time used from the start of my brazillian treatment. Product works well and does keep the hair straight and frizz-less longer. Worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I like it work nice for my</li>
            <li> price was good - have been using shampoo for a few years, and like it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff if you get the blowout.  Best of all it is so much less expensive to buy this product on Amazon!!</li>
            <li> I previously reviewed this product just based on the delivery.  My opinion changed completely after using the product.  The shampoo was altered, probably with water but it IS NOT the real shampoo.  This is a very specific product, consistency is very different to any shampoo and is not a science to notice the difference.  Is the first time I don&#x27;t recommend a seller, but this shampoo is really expensive and I am still using it because I need to wash my hair.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY. Bought this at a salon and it smelled completely differently and the one from the salon was sealed. They clearly just used the bottle and put in a cheap shampoo and conditioner. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Great price for a salon product! I have used the Brazilian Blowout products for my Blow-Outs for a couple years.  Never realized these products were available on Amazon!</li>
            <li> good price -great product- have already reorderd- I would recommend to anyone that has invested in a Brazilian Blowout procedure.</li>
