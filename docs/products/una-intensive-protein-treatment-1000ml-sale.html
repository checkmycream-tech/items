            <li> So definitely it&#x27;s worth the money (considering that it is much more expensive in salons) and it works on my thick, long and curly hair!</li>

            <li> I NEVER REALLY TRIED AN ITALIAN TREATMENT BEFORE.</li>
            <li> I use this product on an on-going basis but I rotate - one week using this product and the other week using a deep conditioner</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair and need deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> I have Very long curly and course hair</li>
            <li> I try to stay away from hair care products that have a lot of silicone in them because it tends to way my hair down, but this makes your hair soft and shiny without making it heavy at all.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and I use it instead of the conditioner every other day after shampooing.  </li>
            <li> Or at least it didn&#x27;t feel moisturized, yet again, once I started styling my hair, it actually became moisturized.</li>
            <li> ITS EXPENSIVE ON THE HIGH END SIDE, BUT</li>
            <li> After rising the treatment out i blow dried my hair.</li>
            <li> , so I leave it at least for 60 min wrapped around with a towel, at least once a week or twice a month.</li>
            <li> I also like that the treatment does not contain Dimethicone which is not good for hair health.</li>
            <li> The container was broken when I got it</li>
            <li> 1000ml lasts me for at least 3-5 months and I use allot!!</li>

            <li> This is an amazing product that leaves your hair soft and healthy.....I have been using this for some time and I&#x27;m really pleased with the results</li>
            <li> UNA Intensive Protein and Rebuild therapy is wonderful for damaged,dry or colored hair!  My hair was so damaged from blowdrying and coloring my hair with highlights, it lost it&#x27;s shiny bouncy healthy look. I am so happy my hair salon used this on my hair... I knew I could find it cheaper on line and sure enough, it is much cheaper, so i will order lots!!  Thanks UNA for making such an awesome product!!</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this product is a protein treatment and my hair seems healthier after using it. I also like that the treatment does not contain Dimethicone which is not good for hair health. I use this product on an on-going basis but I rotate - one week using this product and the other week using a deep conditioner (Miss Jessie&#x27;s Sweetback Treatment Deep Conditioner).  The UNA Intensive Treatment is in a big container so it lasts several months. Overall, I like the product and I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> The container was broken when I got it and I can&#x27;t even open it from the top. I&#x27;m still using it however and I just hope it works in the long run for me.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this product online.  I bought it in NYC when I was visiting. I gave this product three stars because, I thought it was going to make my hair strong. It was making my hair fall out even more then what it does.  But, on a good note it did make my hair soft, shiny and it smells great.</li>
            <li> I thoroughly enjoy this product as far as how it makes my hair feel and look really healthy.  It doesn&#x27;t have an overbearing smell at all and the consistency of it is so rich and thick.  The only downside is that my jar arrived busted open in the bottom so I had to transfer it to another container.  I would highly recommend this protein treatment to others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since 2008 when my hair dresser first introduced it to me. In order for you to have shiny and healthy hair, you need to deep condition your hair (leave it in your hair for at least 30-60min depending on the length and volume) in my case I have Very long curly and course hair, so I leave it at least for 60 min wrapped around with a towel, at least once a week or twice a month. I use it as a regular conditioner as well! 1000ml lasts me for at least 3-5 months and I use allot!! So definitely it&#x27;s worth the money (considering that it is much more expensive in salons) and it works on my thick, long and curly hair! I definitely recommend this product to Everyone!!</li>
            <li> I NEVER REALLY TRIED AN ITALIAN TREATMENT BEFORE. UNA IS WONDERFUL. IT DID WHAT IT CLAIMED IT CAN DO. IT MAKES THE HAIR SILKY, SOFT, STRONG, SHINY, MOVEMENT, AND VERY SEXY. ITS EXPENSIVE ON THE HIGH END SIDE, BUT WELL WORTH IT. IT GIVES YOU PROFESSIONAL RESULTS AT HOME. I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT AND THE WHOLE UNA HAIR CARE LINE TO EVERYONE. ITS ONE OF THE BEST.</li>
            <li> The service was very quick. an the product is for a shiny and smooth hair. I will definitely will buy another one.</li>
            <li> Thankk you very much ....everything is okk....</li>
            <li> You might get it a cracked jar or might not. Mine was cracked at the bottom and conditioner leaked through to the plastic bag it was wrapped in. I believe for the price that the seller charges they could of have a decency to pack it well.</li>
            <li> I tried this product at a hair saloon as an intensive hair treatment. I loved the way my hair felt after the treatment and decided to buy it. I bought it and I use it instead of the conditioner every other day after shampooing.  The product smells like fresh pineapple and makes the hair soft yet bouncy (not flat and oily).&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product especially if you can use a steamer for 15-20 minutes before rinsing it.</li>
            <li> the best , l used over and over , sinse l live in Dominican republic</li>
            <li> This is una of the best Products ever, lol.. I lovr How it Leaves my fine, frizzy Hair feeling soft and smooth,  it brought shine back to my Hair.</li>
            <li> When at a salon, the stylist used this on my hair after shampooing so I purchased it and used it at home.  Wow!  You can use it as a rinse out or deep conditioner.  I used it both ways and my hair was so soft, shiny and bouncy.  This is a keeper.</li>
            <li> Great product my wife loves it</li>
            <li> Great product. Leave hair vigorous and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I had very very damage and dry hair my hair stylist introduce me to una and when I tried it once I instantly fell, in love with it my hair had moisture,balance and smooth. Now since I order his product i take this with me to the hair dresser every time I go and I recommend this this to women with dry,damage hair to try this</li>
            <li> I love this product. I washed my hair with Carols Daughter&#x60;s \\&quot;Monoi\\&quot; shampoo and conditioner. Then I applied this treatment. I instantly seen good results. After rising the treatment out i blow dried my hair. It looked so healthy. My hair is natural and everything ive used before cant compare to this. When i flat ironed my hair it was so bouncy. I recommend this to ppl with natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day two:&lt;br /&gt;I cant keep my hands out of my head!! It feels as if i have a perm but its way softer, shinier, and healthier than a perm. If you are natural i suggest you get this for your hair. Especially is you rock a cute fro. This will most definitely proctect your ends. I&#x27;ll keep you guys updated on my results!</li>
            <li> Trust me when I tell you that this product is the best protein treatment, especially after a relaxer. It makes your hair super soft, healthy, and manageable. A little goes a long way. Plus I love how it smells too. I know it&#x27;s pricey but really worth it.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used this product once so far, but from what I have seen, it did a noticeable job to my hair. At first I thought it didn&#x27;t really do a thing, but as I started to style my hair, I noticed a significance in strength. This was all I needed. Its been about two to three weeks and I am still experiencing the strengthening results. Oh and let&#x27;s not forget the smell. AMAZING! Smells like a candied paradise. I&#x27;m tempted to eat it at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;The only con I have about this product is it gives the idea that it leaves your hair strong AND moisturized. It didn&#x27;t quite make my hair moisturized. Or at least it didn&#x27;t feel moisturized, yet again, once I started styling my hair, it actually became moisturized. It was just so strong that I couldn&#x27;t feel the moisture previously. I may be protein sensitive....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: GREAT PRODUCT. :)</li>
            <li> Great product! Highly recommend</li>
            <li> smelled really good had my hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> My hair feels stripped after use.</li>
            <li> Great treatment works best with shampoo and tree oil love it worth every penny make sure to get deluxe size hard to find litter shampoo and large deep conditioner</li>
            <li> This is great conditioner. I sometimes mix it with Una&#x27;s vitamin conditioning treatment and my hair feels great and is so much more manageable. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I over bleached my bangs a couple months ago and most of them fell off. Shortly after that happened I started using this hoping it would help heal the bangs that I had left. let me tell you this stuff is awesome! It smells like pineapples and instantly makes your hair feel amazing. I have extremely curly hair and need deep conditioning. I try to stay away from hair care products that have a lot of silicone in them because it tends to way my hair down, but this makes your hair soft and shiny without making it heavy at all. The price might seem high but the tub you get is HUGE and you only need to use a small amount. It is definitely worth the money! If you are on the fence about it go for it I promise you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
