            <li>Have tried more than my fair share and this one takes the cake.</li>
            <li>I have tried many brands and custom blend makeup.</li>
            <li>If you have problems with this makeup I would make sure you have the correct blend.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this makeup.</li>
            <li>I love this brand of make up.</li>
            <li>Love this makeup, been using it for years.  </li>
            <li>Love this make up.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this foundation.</li>
            <li>I also love that it does have sunscreen in it, but it does not have an odor like makeup with sunscreen often does.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this powder foundation.  </li>
            <li>You will love it.</li>
            <li>A great way to save some money on a decent product.</li>
            <li>Love this light cover</li>
            <li>This mineral foundation is one of the best coverages for acne and other skin problems.</li>
            <li>I am so happy on Amazon finally.</li>
            <li>I mix light beige with bisque, and I dab it on lightly with a flocked sponge.</li>
            <li>but i was happily surprised great price and as always fast delivery from amazon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since it is a pressed powder it does not leave a mess, and the light beige color is perfect for my fair skin with pink undertones.</li>
            <li>Most plastic surgeons or high end spas carry this product.</li>
            <li>Super happy I can save a few bucks on amazon.</li>
            <li>The coverage is so much better than bare minerals, and I don&#x27;t have to use nearly as much.  </li>
            <li>I have rosacea, very oily skin, deep pores, 40 something fine lines...  </li>
            <li>I really like this makeup.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I love all Jane Iredale products but when this foundation arrived it was too dark for my skin color</li>
            <li>This product is the only thing I have found that works and does not rub off like Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>When I wear this makeup, I get full coverage of the red spider veins and less pooling on my oily skin than other mineral powders.  </li>

            <li> Every time I buy it, I have a hard time spending so much.</li>
            <li> One thing is that the color I normally choose for the over the counter brands did not match what I was given or told to use - so before I was actually not looking natural as I had the wrong color.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> It goes on well, doesn&#x27;t look powdery and is much less messy than loose mineral makeup.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the item was that large as I thought it was a refill for my small compact</li>
            <li> This is definitely the least expensive place to purchase.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>

            <li> I love all Jane Iredale products but when this foundation arrived it was too dark for my skin color so I sent it back over 2 weeks ago.  Haven&#x27;t heard anything from the seller as to whether or not they received it and there has been not credit to my account.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> A great way to save some money on a decent product. Came quickly and in perfect shape. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and acne. This product is the only thing I have found that works and does not rub off like Bare Minerals. I have tried many brands and custom blend makeup. Most plastic surgeons or high end spas carry this product. One thing is that the color I normally choose for the over the counter brands did not match what I was given or told to use - so before I was actually not looking natural as I had the wrong color. If you have problems with this makeup I would make sure you have the correct blend. I have been using this product for 5 years. I am so happy on Amazon finally.</li>
            <li> I really like this makeup.  It was recommended to me by a dermatologist.  It goes on well, doesn&#x27;t look powdery and is much less messy than loose mineral makeup.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Super happy I can save a few bucks on amazon.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this makeup. Stays on perfect all day and has sunscreen too! This is the only makeup I will buy.</li>
            <li> Love this light cover</li>
            <li> Another great product form Jane Iredale. I love this brand of make up. I have dry skin and it does not flake up on me.</li>
            <li> My favorite face powder! Have tried more than my fair share and this one takes the cake.</li>
            <li> Love this makeup, been using it for years.  This is definitely the least expensive place to purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this make up. I didnt think I would like a pressed powder but i was happily surprised great price and as always fast delivery from amazon.</li>

            <li> Great product. Just don&#x27;t drop it like I did.</li>
            <li> The Best make-up powder compact!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this powder foundation.  It has wonderful coverage and is easy to use.  The only reason I give it 4 stars is the price.  Every time I buy it, I have a hard time spending so much.</li>

            <li> This mineral foundation is one of the best coverages for acne and other skin problems. It does not feel cakey and it lets your skin breathe. You will feel great wear this product. It&#x27;s expensive but this product is very well worth it and it is great for you skin. You will love it.</li>
