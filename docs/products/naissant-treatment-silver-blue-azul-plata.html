            <li> this is a very good conditioner and also it really nourished your hair but for the white and like really light blond hair</li>
            <li> The product performed exactly as hoped.  It highlighted and brightened my graying hair at the temples and the yellowing is gone.  Recommend this for men.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Really turns the yellow brassy color into a platinum blonde. Would totally recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> Recently started to let my hair go &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; which is grey. This conditioner keeps my hair a beautiful tone and in great condition. This company provides super quick service. I have ordered this and the same brand shampoo and i always receive their shipments super quick. Thanks.</li>
            <li> AWFUL. As I write this after only one use, I am contemplating where to buy color corrector. It did not remove the brassiness, only turned the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; color GREEN. I couldn&#x27;t give no stars or I would have. I had such high hopes with all the glowing testimonials. It&#x27;s being returned.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I can get the trendy &amp;#34;granny&amp;#34; hair without putting ammonia on my hair. No commitment. Washes out.</li>
            <li> I am beyond disappointed in this product, especially because I LOVE the purple formula. I would never repurchase this though. It turmed my white blonde hair to a dark dingy, dirty looking muddy grey. I would not recommend for anyone! If you want that ashy blonde hair go with the purple formula in the yellow bottle.</li>
            <li> Its alright.  My hair is super dry when I use this. However, the color is nice and bright after using it.</li>
            <li> I love my  naissant treatment ! I been using it for quite long time now and I don&#x27;t change it for any other product. (Nothing works as well as this)  It takes out that orange or ginger tone from my highlights ! It worked really well on my hair! The color looks really great after I use it. I definitely recommend it if you want to have silver or platinum highlights !</li>
            <li> This is a really great product . I had silver hair and I used this every once in a while (like every other week ) to keep my hair from turning yellowish or any other color . But the color is highly pigmented. So make sure you don&#x27;t leave it on to long if you only want mild color .</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product. It made my hair even MORE brassy after just one use. If you&#x27;re looking for a great violet shampoo to help remove brassy tones, I suggest the Clairol Shimmer Lights.</li>
            <li> I started out to swim and my hair was getting greenish from the chlorine. My stylist said naissant purple silver shampoo would be the stronger one. It worked for me, I recommend it!!!!! :) :</li>
            <li> I tried this product as one of my friend recommend for me, as my hair is really dry. I just used for like a week, and i can see it improve the look and the feel of my hair. Great Shampoo!!</li>
            <li> I love this for my silver hair! It really helps maintain my color longer!!</li>
            <li> I go back and forth between the silver blue treatment and the pearl treatment. They&#x27;re both so pigmented and definitely the best toning treatment I have used, especially for the price. The only downside to using it (and any other blue-conditioner/shampoo) is the drying effects of it. I have naturally very dark brown hair, which I have been bleaching to about a level 2 at the ends and level 4 at the roots. I like my hair very ashy and this product is the definite cause of it in between toning sessions. I would definitely recommend it, but don&#x27;t use it every wash unless you are looking for a totally silver look. (:</li>
            <li> I have some whites &amp; grays which were a little brassy. I hate brassiness so I tried this. After leaving it in as directed my whites had a very noticeable purplish tint. It wasn&#x27;t bad but it was definitely noticeable. My friends even asked if I had purple put in my hair.</li>
            <li> If I could give 0 stars I would. Turned my blonde hair blue in 2 minutes. Took a lot of work to get the blue out. Wish I had listened to the one bad review. Live &amp; learn. Will never purchase again-please beware.</li>
