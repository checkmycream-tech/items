    <ol>
            <li>Perfect size for bringing along on my backpack trips.</li>
            <li>They arrived within days and were perfect.</li>
            <li>excellent for the price.</li>
            <li>These are just great!  </li>
            <li>They are very good and also inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Incredible turnaround.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I found these bath mitts here on Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Otherwise, great product.</li>
            <li>Great find.</li>
            <li>Just a great product.</li>
            <li>This was the best of the best to find these mitts, great quality, reasonably priced all seamed up with even stitched in loop to hang.&lt;br /&gt;Yep</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with these!</li>
            <li>Just returning from a lovely trip to France and was so happy to find these great washcloths.</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>So good</li>
            <li>Quality is fair.</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>Love these.!</li>
            <li>Very happy with product but would like a more elegant &amp;#34;gant&amp;#34; with a better terry cloth.</li>
            <li>It was great to find them available and within an acceptable price range.</li>
            <li>The cotton terry is a bit thicker than I&#x27;m used to, which makes the mitts not as effective for exfoliation.</li>
            <li>(would be nice</li>
            <li>My mom is thrilled with them.</li>
            <li>These soap pockets are good but huge.  </li>
            <li>These were perfect and arrived so quickly; I don&#x27;t know how my order got here so fast!  </li>
            <li>just ordered another set of them, so I won&#x27;t have to be without them again. :)&lt;</li>
            <li>The more they&#x27;re used the softer they get.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>Quality seems good, shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li>I like the hanging loop that makes it easy to hang on a hook.</li>
            <li>Just gave these as gifts; haven&#x27;t washed them yet, but they are exactly what we were looking for, and we have high hopes for great performance.</li>
            <li>This package of 12 is a fabulous deal.</li>
            <li>Such a great invention.</li>
            <li>its primary use will be to clean the soot from my backpacking wood stove.</li>
            <li>Many thanks!</li>
            <li>Nice bath mitts, very soft and held up well in the washing machine and kept their shape.</li>
            <li>The price per mitt is great, but being single, I wish I didn&#x27;t have to buy 12 at a time.</li>
            <li>The number of mitts is a also another tremendous value.  </li>
            <li>I could easily put ten or more full bars of soap in one if I could keep them inside while I was showering.  </li>
            <li>I really like how easy it is to keep these mitts on my hand in the shower, since I often drop things.</li>
            <li>I have continued to sew up wash cloths for 27 years for my son, who developed the love of the mitts while living in the UK.</li>
            <li>A bit pricey but worth it I think.</li>
            <li>These particular ones are huge,  probably twice the size of others.  </li>
            <li>The size of the mitts make it wonderful for bigger male hands because most of the other mitts I have used are more for smaller hands.</li>
            <li>The loop is nice, so I can hang them up to dry</li>
            <li>The simple white cotton is very nice.</li>
            <li>Love these just like the French ones</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are of high quality and are just the right texture to wash with.</li>
            <li>these mitts are perfect for holding hot and cold ;packs.</li>
            <li>vendor ships extremely fast.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Package arrived promptly with a special human touch. . .</li>
            <li>Could not believe I was finally able to find these mitts and cannot understand why they are not readily available or advertised in America.</li>
            <li>Finally found some at very reasonable pricing.</li>
            <li>so they are slightly exfoliating for the body which is fine with me.</li>
            <li>In 2013 I had ordered the real thing (Sysco Guest Supply Sold by: French Presents Emporium) and when I clicked &amp;#34;Buy</li>
            <li>These are not that soft</li>
            <li>Spend the extra for the full terry mitts -- the quality will be remembered long after the price has been forgotten.</li>
            <li>one side thick, one side thin, brilliant!</li>
            <li>100% cotton, rinses easily, allows you to hang to dry quickly thanks to the little loop.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to give a few away as gifts with some fine French soap.</li>
            <li>Big enough for a man&#x27;s hands, but not so large that they&#x27;ll fall off a woman&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a full terry bath mitt, this is NOT what you want -- they have a terry section in the middle of the &amp;#34;front&amp;#34; side, and the other side is bare threads.  </li>
            <li>They were larger than expected, but shrunk down a little and were a good size in the end.</li>
            <li>Not very plush but very practical.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Only one side is partially terrycloth.</li>
            <li> They wash and dry well.</li>

            <li> In the past, I have had to sew a wash cloth in effort to adapt them for the purpose of independent training and longtime use.</li>
            <li> I would recommend them for any small children and definitely for individuals with challenges.</li>
            <li> The other side is some type of material that probably can be used to exfoliate.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find European style washcloths in the USA.</li>
            <li> She loves the European style mitts &amp; they&#x27;re so hard to find.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong in buying these; I highly recommend them.</li>

            <li> Hard to find in the States.</li>
            <li> Hard to find product in USA.</li>
            <li> I bought some in France at least 10, maybe 15 years ago and needed to replace them.</li>
            <li> The material of the cloth is thick and works so well in maintaining suds.  </li>
            <li> (hard to find!)</li>
            <li> All my son requested for Christmas was a couple of wash mitts; his was worn thin!</li>

            <li> I am so happy I found these bath mitts here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been looking for years to replace the worn out ones I brought with me from Germany. I couldn&#x27;t believe, when I could not find anything like these in the stores here in the US. Only the square wash cloths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are of high quality and are just the right texture to wash with. The loop is nice, so I can hang them up to dry quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered another set of them, so I won&#x27;t have to be without them again. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vendor ships extremely fast. Incredible turnaround.</li>
            <li> Love these.! The more they&#x27;re used the softer they get.</li>
            <li> They were larger than expected, but shrunk down a little and were a good size in the end. Good value.</li>
            <li> Just gave these as gifts; haven&#x27;t washed them yet, but they are exactly what we were looking for, and we have high hopes for great performance.</li>
            <li> Just returning from a lovely trip to France and was so happy to find these great washcloths. Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> What you see is what you get. Not too thick or thin; these bath mitts will probably last a long time. I bought some in France at least 10, maybe 15 years ago and needed to replace them. (hard to find!) Finally found some at very reasonable pricing. Good quality. Fast shipping. Many thanks!</li>
            <li> Perfect size for bringing along on my backpack trips. While I have one for my body parts I also bing one extra... its primary use will be to clean the soot from my backpacking wood stove. The towel will tuck inside for cleanliness afterwards too.</li>
            <li> The cotton terry is a bit thicker than I&#x27;m used to, which makes the mitts not as effective for exfoliation. Otherwise, great product.</li>
            <li> These have worked well and have held up to daily use without any tearing or problems. Big enough for a man&#x27;s hands, but not so large that they&#x27;ll fall off a woman&#x27;s. May be a bit too large for children, but you would use them as a pouch for the soap and it would help to keep it from slipping out of  their little hands. (would be nice it it had a drawstring around the opening for this purpose.) The price per mitt is great, but being single, I wish I didn&#x27;t have to buy 12 at a time. I&#x27;ll have to give a few away as gifts with some fine French soap.</li>
            <li> Buyer beware!  If you&#x27;re looking for a full terry bath mitt, this is NOT what you want -- they have a terry section in the middle of the &amp;#34;front&amp;#34; side, and the other side is bare threads.  In 2013 I had ordered the real thing (Sysco Guest Supply Sold by: French Presents Emporium) and when I clicked &amp;#34;Buy It Again&amp;#34; I ended up with this Beauticom item instead.  Spend the extra for the full terry mitts -- the quality will be remembered long after the price has been forgotten.</li>
            <li> All my son requested for Christmas was a couple of wash mitts; his was worn thin! I have continued to sew up wash cloths for 27 years for my son, who developed the love of the mitts while living in the UK. This was the best of the best to find these mitts, great quality, reasonably priced all seamed up with even stitched in loop to hang.&lt;br /&gt;Yep, I got &amp;#34;best gift ever&amp;#34; award, and all I did was order them and wrap them up!!</li>
            <li> I ordered these bath mitts to assist parents of disabled individuals in teaching independence in personal hygiene. They arrived within days and were perfect. Manipulating a typical wash cloth is difficult for individuals with intellectual and physical limitations. In the past, I have had to sew a wash cloth in effort to adapt them for the purpose of independent training and longtime use. It was great to find them available and within an acceptable price range. I would recommend them for any small children and definitely for individuals with challenges.</li>
            <li> Too long and only one side is terry cloth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d expect to see these in a 5 star hotel! Nice bath mitts, very soft and held up well in the washing machine and kept their shape. I would reccomend and will buy again.</li>
            <li> After sojourns in Europe I became a fan of bath mitts and on my return to the states I had my washcloths converted into bath mitts. There has been no turning back. This package of 12 is a fabulous deal. The simple white cotton is very nice.</li>
            <li> These bath mitts were just what I was looking for. They&#x27;re well made and work well in the bath or shower.</li>
            <li> It is a quality product. A bit pricey but worth it I think. A dozen of these should last you a while.</li>
            <li> Great find. Hard to find European style washcloths in the USA.</li>
            <li> I love these. They are longer then the ones I used to have and they are easier to wash your back with.</li>
            <li> They work well and have a convenient little hook. Hard to find in the States. Could be thicker. Got a bit thinner after 2 years of constant washing.</li>
            <li> These soap pockets are good but huge.  I could easily put ten or more full bars of soap in one if I could keep them inside while I was showering.  I think the design is not well thought out.</li>
            <li> Bought these and smaller ones. Could not believe I was finally able to find these mitts and cannot understand why they are not readily available or advertised in America. Such a great invention. Easier to use than any washcloth and a dream to bathe children, not to mention using to wash my face. 100% cotton, rinses easily, allows you to hang to dry quickly thanks to the little loop. Just a great product. Four stars because the smaller ones I ordered were fluffier. So good I had to share with a couple of friends.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my mom.  She loves the European style mitts &amp; they&#x27;re so hard to find.  These particular ones are huge,  probably twice the size of others.  Quality seems good, shipping was fast.  My mom is thrilled with them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been so difficult for me to find bath mitts (as opposed to washcloths) in this country like the ones I used in France.  These were perfect and arrived so quickly; I don&#x27;t know how my order got here so fast!  I am thrilled with these!</li>
            <li> I like these mitts. I like having two in the shower for face and body plus a third by the sink. I really like how easy it is to keep these mitts on my hand in the shower, since I often drop things. I like the hanging loop that makes it easy to hang on a hook. They wash and dry well. A substitute for flat washcloths, well made.</li>
            <li> Used to my European background, these wash mitts were just what I wanted!  Nice quality (not too thin, not too thick) with hanging loop.  Package arrived promptly with a special human touch. . . thank you!</li>
            <li> excellent for the price. one side thick, one side thin, brilliant!</li>
            <li> Hard to find product in USA. I used them in France. Very happy with product but would like a more elegant &amp;#34;gant&amp;#34; with a better terry cloth.</li>
            <li> Only one side is partially terrycloth. The other side is some type of material that probably can be used to exfoliate.  Item description does not mention that only one side is terrycloth. Quality is fair.</li>
            <li> These are not that soft so they are slightly exfoliating for the body which is fine with me. Good value.</li>
            <li> Love these just like the French ones</li>
            <li> these were delivered at promised.  They are basic washcloth mitts.  Not very plush but very practical.  They wash well and the loop for hanging is convenient.</li>
            <li> Just like I used in france</li>
            <li> This is to corre the summary which went in earlier with a zero rating.  these mitts are perfect for holding hot and cold ;packs.</li>
            <li> They are very good and also inexpensive.</li>
            <li> These are just great!  The material of the cloth is thick and works so well in maintaining suds.  The size of the mitts make it wonderful for bigger male hands because most of the other mitts I have used are more for smaller hands. The number of mitts is a also another tremendous value.  You can&#x27;t go wrong in buying these; I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Bigger than I wanted But I will keep anyway. Will find a use for them.</li>
