    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I will continue to hope for the best!</li>
            <li>Oh and the price was great too!</li>
            <li>i read the reviews and fell for it, ordered it even though i was reluctant because of the price for a 0.5 oz, but i gave it a go, and i am really impressed.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed with this eye cream since it did everything that it advertised.</li>
            <li>Very pleased!</li>
            <li>packaging is nice too, acrylic and sturdy with a pump, keeps it sanitary and product comes out gently in a perfect amount.</li>
            <li>I was happy I stopped when I did the damage</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>The pump and bottle design are very nice</li>
            <li>its perfect under your concealer Be sure to nab your share of beauty history with this soon-to-be cult miracle.</li>
            <li>I see some improvement in the darkness under my eyes, but it seems to have reached its optimum effectiveness after two weeks.  </li>
            <li>but i was researching a good eye cream and this came up, and</li>
            <li>Not a cure, but definitely a good fix.</li>
            <li>Good product for retaining moisture under the eye, at the crows feet area, also on the lids.  </li>
            <li>had to contact their customer service on another product I ordered along with this cream from this seller, and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>By applying Revagin every morning and evening, I&#x27;ve noticed more tightness under my eyes and the puffiness has improved greatly.</li>
            <li>It feels very good on my skin, absorbs quickly, and moisturizes well.</li>
            <li>and I really liked the packaging too.</li>
            <li>I love the price as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love the cream itself, and its price too (see review on Neuvaderm (1.7 fl Oz.)</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product and hope it continues to work and get  better.  </li>
            <li>It penetrates the top layer of your skin, the epidermis, to get to the dermis where elastin is formed.</li>
            <li>I was so so pleased with this eye cream and the results I saw.</li>
            <li>but I think you need to definitely try it to find out since I am HAPPY!</li>
            <li>and I am able to pull the wand out and get some of the eye nourishing cream off that.  </li>
            <li>I keep mine in the fridge and love using after a night out.  </li>
            <li>This product is much better and works in conjunction with Eye Revival.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product, definitely makes a difference!</li>
            <li>I first tried Super Bright Eyed Flawless Eye Treatment with melon Carotenoids by Dr. Nicholas Perricone, but at a high price, found it did not work.  </li>
            <li>This product is nice, smells good, no allergic reaction (and I am ultra sensitive and a contact lens wearer).  </li>
            <li>And it goes on smooth as silk, so</li>
            <li>I enjoy the light, non-greasy texture which also wears well under makeup.  </li>
            <li>The cream goes on nice and smooth and dries fast.</li>
            <li>The research for top 10 products in 2013 were right, this works.  </li>
            <li>Also now any kind of decent eye cream</li>
            <li>Wonderful product, you use very little at a time</li>
            <li>Oh well, small potatoes really, it is a great product and I am super glad I have found this!</li>
            <li>and ive never seen results like this, and the ingredients didnt seem interesting either at first, like jojoba?</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find a product that consistently worked for me like Revagin does.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product from Amazon.com because the price was much lower than purchasing it from my local beauty store and was very satisfied with the fast results I experienced.</li>
            <li>It is OK, results are not that much quick and it caused allergy on my eye lid the first week I used.</li>
            <li>i was impressed because ive tried so many expensive brand name creams</li>
            <li>I have tried other supposedly effective drugstore brands without any results, so this product is definitely better than any of those.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to use my eye concealer for the dark circles and the puffiness under my eyes was greatly reduced as well.</li>
            <li>It is by far the best product I have tried to get rid of dark circles.</li>
            <li>Being a contact lens wearer, I can honestly say and that I haven&#x27;t had any eye irritation problems with daily use.  </li>
            <li>I rarely rate items</li>
            <li>I purchased this eye cream after a friend of mine has success with it.</li>
            <li>I am fortunate not to have deep wrinkles around my eyes, but found that Revagin has helped reduce the appearance of the fine lines significantly.  </li>
            <li>If we don&#x27;t try things, how can we find the right one?</li>
            <li>Fast results!</li>
            <li>I have used this product consistently for three weeks now and don&#x27;t see any results yet.  </li>
            <li>okay i usually dont write many reviews on amazon</li>
            <li>but when a product really works i just have to brag about it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used various eye creams in the past, but Revagin Eye Nourishing Cream is the best by far.  </li>
            <li>The only slight ammount I did notice I think is more of a result in the tint in the cream that worked more like a cover.  </li>
            <li>Even though I still need to use a light concealer for under eye coverage, I would definitely recommend this product for what it delivers and at a fraction of the price in comparison to department store brands.</li>
            <li>I could REALLY tell the difference in photos.  </li>
            <li>Did not notice much, if any, change.  </li>
            <li>This cream was reasonable price and there was no smell to it.</li>
            <li>I have also used a product called Vita K a few years ago and it works as well for those that want something cheaper, but I must be honest this product works better,faster, and is much lighter.</li>
            <li>Revagin works as well as or better than any other products I have used for reducing my puffy eyes.  </li>
            <li>my slight fine lines are still there, but then again theyve always been there it may be genetic, or dehydration, but i feel like they too will improve as i continue to use this!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have tried this product, but so far I like the moisturizing effect.  </li>
            <li>but I wish I could tell how much is left in the container without having to open the top.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this cream to anyone who has under eye puffiness.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream to others who have under eye problems.</li>
            <li>The puffiness under my eyes got less and less with each passing day and now my eyes look great.</li>
            <li>I am 57 yrs old and have inherited my bags and dark circles, so it is an uphill battle for sure.  </li>
            <li>I am a middle aged woman and always on the lookout for good facial skin care products that promote anti-aging.</li>
            <li>Revagin applied to my baggy eyes right after routine face washing makes my under-eye bags disappear almost entirely.</li>
            <li>Restoring this process that diminishes after puberty is key to bringing back healthy, it really gives you younger looking skin.</li>
            <li>Did nothing to improve hydration or appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, or dark circles.  </li>
            <li>after 1 and a half week of using this stuff, i notice that the bags are pretty much gone, the darkness is reduced, i can tell because the same concealer i use i am using less of it now, i dont need to layer it on as i used to, and it blends more easily, the skin feels tighter under my eyes, like the cream just glides on like melted butter effortlessly instead of having to rub it in, the skin doesnt move around anymore, and overall this has improved my eyes!</li>
            <li>This cream did not cause itching in the slightest bit or any burning and I am very sensitive.</li>
            <li>and it dried easily.</li>
            <li>so I cannot comment on that problem, but if you have dark circles beneath your eyes this product works and it is worth the money!</li>
            <li>There is no bad smell like some other creams have.</li>
            <li>This is one of the better ones around causing no irritation or itching for me and should be tried at least.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 54 year&#x27;s old and have been experiencing issues with puffiness under my eyes for some time.  </li>
            <li>being it cost so much for a tiny bottle and does not work for me.....</li>
            <li>The eye cream made no difference at all so far.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no way of knowing how much of the product is left in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Once I stopped my dark circles seemed to go back to my original color before using product.  </li>
            <li>My shadows seem to be the result of just aging with things pulling away from itself such as lessing of collagen and not dark skin underneath.</li>
            <li>It did not dry t</li>
            <li>and it just might work for you if you don&#x27;t already have genetic tendencies towards plugging of the pores with other eye creams which I certainly did not have when I was younger.</li>
            <li>in my 20s, i had dark circles and just loose skin overall under my eyes, not puffiness but more like a dark indent, and</li>
            <li>The only reason why I&#x27;m not giving a five star rating is because there hasn&#x27;t been much improvement in fading dark circles under my eyes.  </li>

            <li> I saw some other great reviews and some bad reviews and my conclusion is that it might not work for everyone</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 months and my dark circles have diminished considerably.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Might work for for some, but apparently not for me.</li>
            <li> It did not last long for the $ either.  </li>
            <li> Tapping into the same repair and protect technology featured in Dermatology Times, Revagin&#x27;s Eye Nourishing Cream w/ Liposomes is an age-fighting elastin booster which gives you the much needed hydration for the delicate under eye area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and a half and so far nothing.</li>
            <li> I have had some puffiness under my eyes lately and the eye cream was very soothing for me.</li>
            <li> This product is a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> No reason to make this long winded...</li>
            <li> This product is definitely a must, if you have dark circles.</li>
            <li> The only problem was that the box it came in was a little tough to get open but who really complains about that?  </li>
            <li> With that being said, it&#x27;s a lot of money for something that doesn&#x27;t work, and not very much product in the container.</li>
            <li> I am a black female and 2 months  </li>
            <li> I have found only one other eye cream that works for my dark eye bags and this is another one.</li>
            <li> I am not giving up and will continue to use it until the bottle is empty.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much cream in this container either.  </li>
            <li> so may be thats whats working, but other than that</li>
            <li> my skin like other eye creams did.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products with no success.  </li>
            <li> The claim that it lessens the dark circles around the eyes may be overrated; I haven&#x27;t seen any difference as yet and have been using it for about three weeks.</li>
            <li> Hopefully by then I will see some change in my dark circles.</li>
            <li> Added ingredients combat dark circles and late night puffiness, all while strengthening the fragile eye area.</li>
            <li> I never had dark circles till I turned 45 or so.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it for dark circles under my eyes and I am proof that it does work.</li>
            <li> Not worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I used this everyday in the morning and night on under my eyes puffiness for a month or so, and saw absolutely no difference at all.</li>
            <li> Did it depend on the lighting in my case or was it the slight skin tint in the lotion?</li>
            <li> I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive because it will only last about 2 1/2 to 3 months.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for less than a month</li>
            <li> I hope this helps someone like the previous reviews have helped me.</li>
            <li> It took a few days to see some results but the puffiness did start to go down and diminish.</li>
            <li> but there is so little in the bottle</li>
            <li> I used this product for one month with little improvement on the shadows but when I checked in the car mirror, they seemed improved.</li>
            <li> The puffiness wwent don within days and the darkness took a little longer but it did go away too.</li>
            <li> so there is a lot that gets wasted.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had issues with puffy eyes for a few years.  </li>
            <li> After using it for a few days it did help reduce the puffiness.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this since the only other creams that worked for me were very expensive or had a bad smell to them.</li>
            <li> This should be less expensive or there should be a larger amount.  </li>
            <li> The cream has very little smell which i like</li>
            <li> I would give this 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t so pricey but needless to say, it actually DOES work.  </li>
            <li> I used this product for almost a month before realizing it was making my dark circles worse.  </li>
            <li> Not good because this requires always buying in advance or risking being out of moisturizer until another bottle is purchased.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this item at all.</li>
            <li> my bags were so bad lately</li>
            <li> Unfortunately increased bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried this product, but so far I like the moisturizing effect.  The claim that it lessens the dark circles around the eyes may be overrated; I haven&#x27;t seen any difference as yet and have been using it for about three weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for three weeks now twice a day. It feels very good on my skin, absorbs quickly, and moisturizes well. The bags under my eyes are much smaller. The cream doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes at all. Hopefully the results will last and improve over time. I love the price as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to contact their customer service on another product I ordered along with this cream from this seller, and am very pleased with the results. I love the cream itself, and its price too (see review on Neuvaderm (1.7 fl Oz.) Rejuvenating Anti-Aging, Anti-Wrinkle &amp; Moisturizing Cream).</li>
            <li> I use this product once in the morning and then again at night.  I see some improvement in the darkness under my eyes, but it seems to have reached its optimum effectiveness after two weeks.  I have tried other supposedly effective drugstore brands without any results, so this product is definitely better than any of those.  I will continue to use this product and hope it continues to work and get  better.  You get alot of this product for the money, also a benefit compared to drugstore brands. I am 57 yrs old and have inherited my bags and dark circles, so it is an uphill battle for sure.  I will continue to hope for the best!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, you use very little at a time but I wish I could tell how much is left in the container without having to open the top. Oh well, small potatoes really, it is a great product and I am super glad I have found this!</li>
            <li> Fast results! I have been using this product for about 2 months and my dark circles have diminished considerably.  I am a black female and 2 months  ago I literally looked like a raccoon.  I have tried other products with no success.  This product is definitely a must, if you have dark circles.</li>
            <li> This product is a complete waste of money.  I have used Revagin cream for almost four weeks.  I did not experience any improvement in my eye puffiness.</li>
            <li> I have used this product consistently for three weeks now and don&#x27;t see any results yet.  I am not giving up and will continue to use it until the bottle is empty.  Hopefully by then I will see some change in my dark circles.</li>
            <li> Finally a product that does what it claims to do! I purchased this product from Amazon.com because the price was much lower than purchasing it from my local beauty store and was very satisfied with the fast results I experienced. I didn&#x27;t have to use my eye concealer for the dark circles and the puffiness under my eyes was greatly reduced as well. Oh and the price was great too!</li>
            <li> Sun exposure, cigarette smoke, and stress can all deplete the skin of its elastin - and its resiliency.  Tapping into the same repair and protect technology featured in Dermatology Times, Revagin&#x27;s Eye Nourishing Cream w/ Liposomes is an age-fighting elastin booster which gives you the much needed hydration for the delicate under eye area. It penetrates the top layer of your skin, the epidermis, to get to the dermis where elastin is formed. Restoring this process that diminishes after puberty is key to bringing back healthy, it really gives you younger looking skin. Added ingredients combat dark circles and late night puffiness, all while strengthening the fragile eye area. And it goes on smooth as silk, so its perfect under your concealer Be sure to nab your share of beauty history with this soon-to-be cult miracle. And at this price, why stop at one?  It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> okay i usually dont write many reviews on amazon but when a product really works i just have to brag about it! i never heard of this brand before but i was researching a good eye cream and this came up, and i read the reviews and fell for it, ordered it even though i was reluctant because of the price for a 0.5 oz, but i gave it a go, and i am really impressed. I kept the receipt and packaging too in case it didnt work so i can return it, but this stuff is a keeper! my bags were so bad lately, i dont know if i wasnt getting enough sleep or i was dehydrated, but i felt like i had crows feet, and im in my 20s, i had dark circles and just loose skin overall under my eyes, not puffiness but more like a dark indent, and after 1 and a half week of using this stuff, i notice that the bags are pretty much gone, the darkness is reduced, i can tell because the same concealer i use i am using less of it now, i dont need to layer it on as i used to, and it blends more easily, the skin feels tighter under my eyes, like the cream just glides on like melted butter effortlessly instead of having to rub it in, the skin doesnt move around anymore, and overall this has improved my eyes! my slight fine lines are still there, but then again theyve always been there it may be genetic, or dehydration, but i feel like they too will improve as i continue to use this! i was impressed because ive tried so many expensive brand name creams and ive never seen results like this, and the ingredients didnt seem interesting either at first, like jojoba? i notice it has ginko extract in it so may be thats whats working, but other than that i dont know what theyre putting in here but its working. packaging is nice too, acrylic and sturdy with a pump, keeps it sanitary and product comes out gently in a perfect amount. has a peachy color to it, and no smell.</li>
            <li> After one bottle, my puffy eyes remain the same.  This product does not work.  I will not buy again &amp; would not recommend it</li>
            <li> This product did nothing of it&#x27;s claims.  Save your money, no results.  You could use shortening and get the same result.</li>
            <li> I used this product for almost a month before realizing it was making my dark circles worse.  Once I stopped my dark circles seemed to go back to my original color before using product.  I was happy I stopped when I did the damage may have been permanent</li>
            <li> I was seeing a noticable difference when using this but there is so little in the bottle and it&#x27;s a pump and you cant take the lid off so there is a lot that gets wasted.  This should be less expensive or there should be a larger amount.  I won&#x27;t order again because I can not afford to keep this up.</li>
            <li> I was so so pleased with this eye cream and the results I saw. I have not been able to find a product that consistently worked for me like Revagin does. The cream goes on nice and smooth and dries fast. There is no bad smell like some other creams have. The pump and bottle design are very nice and I really liked the packaging too. This seems like it should be a $100 eye cream for its appearance alone! The puffiness under my eyes got less and less with each passing day and now my eyes look great. I HIGHLY recommend this cream to anyone who has under eye puffiness. I saw some other great reviews and some bad reviews and my conclusion is that it might not work for everyone but I think you need to definitely try it to find out since I am HAPPY!</li>
            <li> It is OK, results are not that much quick and it caused allergy on my eye lid the first week I used.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference.  The pump doesn&#x27;t work which makes it very frustrating.  I keep unscrewing the cap and I am able to pull the wand out and get some of the eye nourishing cream off that.  There&#x27;s not much cream in this container either.  With that being said, it&#x27;s a lot of money for something that doesn&#x27;t work, and not very much product in the container. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> Four months of using this religiously twice a day, and i see no difference. Feel like i&#x27;ve been duped.  Next!</li>
            <li> I used this product for one month with little improvement on the shadows but when I checked in the car mirror, they seemed improved. Go figure. Did it depend on the lighting in my case or was it the slight skin tint in the lotion? My shadows seem to be the result of just aging with things pulling away from itself such as lessing of collagen and not dark skin underneath. If you are younger, it may work for you. I never had dark circles till I turned 45 or so.  I am over 60 now. Also now any kind of decent eye cream and I have intensified plugging of eye pores. This cream did not cause itching in the slightest bit or any burning and I am very sensitive. From my research in my case, I should use only gels now.  I shall miss how this cream stayed moist but not greasy all day and night and it just might work for you if you don&#x27;t already have genetic tendencies towards plugging of the pores with other eye creams which I certainly did not have when I was younger. This is one of the better ones around causing no irritation or itching for me and should be tried at least. If we don&#x27;t try things, how can we find the right one?</li>
            <li> I used this everyday in the morning and night on under my eyes puffiness for a month or so, and saw absolutely no difference at all. I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with this eye cream since it did everything that it advertised. I have found only one other eye cream that works for my dark eye bags and this is another one. The cream has very little smell which i like and it dried easily. It did not dry t my skin like other eye creams did. The puffiness wwent don within days and the darkness took a little longer but it did go away too. I like this cream and recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this item at all. I will never buy again or tell anyone to buy it. If it were possible I would get my money back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various eye creams in the past, but Revagin Eye Nourishing Cream is the best by far.  I&#x27;m 54 year&#x27;s old and have been experiencing issues with puffiness under my eyes for some time.  By applying Revagin every morning and evening, I&#x27;ve noticed more tightness under my eyes and the puffiness has improved greatly. I enjoy the light, non-greasy texture which also wears well under makeup.  I am fortunate not to have deep wrinkles around my eyes, but found that Revagin has helped reduce the appearance of the fine lines significantly.  Being a contact lens wearer, I can honestly say and that I haven&#x27;t had any eye irritation problems with daily use.  The only reason why I&#x27;m not giving a five star rating is because there hasn&#x27;t been much improvement in fading dark circles under my eyes.  Even though I still need to use a light concealer for under eye coverage, I would definitely recommend this product for what it delivers and at a fraction of the price in comparison to department store brands.</li>
            <li> The research for top 10 products in 2013 were right, this works.  Not a cure, but definitely a good fix.</li>
            <li> did not do anything for my</li>
            <li> Revagin works as well as or better than any other products I have used for reducing my puffy eyes.  This condition runs in my family, and I have tried everything, including tea bags and cucumbers.  Revagin applied to my baggy eyes right after routine face washing makes my under-eye bags disappear almost entirely.</li>
            <li> No reason to make this long winded...I rarely rate items but I can tell you this cream does not work...I would not recomend it and just had to add my 2 cents, being it cost so much for a tiny bottle and does not work for me.....</li>
            <li> Good product for retaining moisture under the eye, at the crows feet area, also on the lids.  I keep mine in the fridge and love using after a night out.  This product is nice, smells good, no allergic reaction (and I am ultra sensitive and a contact lens wearer).  The liposomes aid in eye bag swelling.  I first tried Super Bright Eyed Flawless Eye Treatment with melon Carotenoids by Dr. Nicholas Perricone, but at a high price, found it did not work.  This product is much better and works in conjunction with Eye Revival.  Very pleased!</li>
            <li> I would give this 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t so pricey but needless to say, it actually DOES work.  I&#x27;ve had issues with puffy eyes for a few years.  I started using this in July and it took a few weeks to really see a difference. I could REALLY tell the difference in photos.  I&#x27;ll probably purchase this again.  I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive because it will only last about 2 1/2 to 3 months.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for less than a month and I can already see the difference. I&#x27;m using it for dark circles under my eyes and I am proof that it does work. I have also used a product called Vita K a few years ago and it works as well for those that want something cheaper, but I must be honest this product works better,faster, and is much lighter. It is by far the best product I have tried to get rid of dark circles. I do not have bags or puffiness so I cannot comment on that problem, but if you have dark circles beneath your eyes this product works and it is worth the money! I hope this helps someone like the previous reviews have helped me.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, definitely makes a difference!</li>
            <li> The eye cream made no difference at all so far.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and a half and so far nothing.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Didn&#x27;t cause skin to break out or itch&lt;br /&gt;- Didn&#x27;t irritate my skin&lt;br /&gt;- Didn&#x27;t smear my make-up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Pump bottle is opaque.  There&#x27;s no way of knowing how much of the product is left in the bottle.  Not good because this requires always buying in advance or risking being out of moisturizer until another bottle is purchased.&lt;br /&gt;- Did nothing to improve hydration or appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, or dark circles.  Unfortunately increased bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used for a month but had to quit since it was causing bags to increase in size, not decrease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Might work for for some, but apparently not for me.</li>
            <li> I used this daily.  Did not notice much, if any, change.  It did not last long for the $ either.  Mid 40s guy with bags under eyes btw.  The only slight ammount I did notice I think is more of a result in the tint in the cream that worked more like a cover.  Not worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this eye cream after a friend of mine has success with it. I applied the cream to my problem area (puffy under eyes) two times per day. One in morning and one at night. It took a few days to see some results but the puffiness did start to go down and diminish. I was really excited about this since the only other creams that worked for me were very expensive or had a bad smell to them. This cream was reasonable price and there was no smell to it. I highly recommend this cream to others who have under eye problems.</li>
            <li> I am a middle aged woman and always on the lookout for good facial skin care products that promote anti-aging. I have had some puffiness under my eyes lately and the eye cream was very soothing for me. After using it for a few days it did help reduce the puffiness. The only problem was that the box it came in was a little tough to get open but who really complains about that?  lol</li>
