            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing product!  </li>
            <li>Love it and got a wonderful deal.</li>
            <li>Got this product and looked good on television</li>
            <li>all i can say is it was good but after 1 week it turns of   for some reason</li>
            <li>She borrowed her sisters and loved it.</li>
            <li>you gotta start with good quality shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>and it doesnt even straighten my hair that good</li>
            <li>This product works great for straightening, okay for curling.</li>
            <li>I love the Instyler!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and produces great results.</li>
            <li>I bought this product and was waiting to be dazzeled by all the amazing things it could do to frizzy untamed hair like mine.  </li>
            <li>I got the InStyler Deluxe for Christmas this year</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s since moved out on her own</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair nicely styled and shiny, not burnt or damaged at all.</li>
            <li>The deluxe kit includes the Instyler, the instructional DVD, the protective training guard, the comb, the handy combination heat protective rest pad/storage bag, and two quality spray products.</li>
            <li>The shine spray provided is nice, but I prefer to use Biosilk silk therapy</li>
            <li>You get everything in the Instyler Deluxe kit to very easily and quickly be able to do salon styling to your own hair at your convenience.</li>
            <li>You get more value buying the deluxe kit.</li>
            <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this Instyler.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it about 3 weeks and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>but I like mine better.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s OK because I don&#x27;t need it now.</li>
            <li>Probably could curve it more as I get the hang of using the InStyler.</li>
            <li>but this works better as the rolling \\&quot;iron\\&quot; keeps from burning your hair and the top part brushes and heats the top side as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments on my hair since I started using both.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough great things about it!</li>
            <li>I have tried every product on the planet to make my hair more manageable, from leave-in treatments to curlers to revolving brushes, but NOTHING comes close to the Instyler.  </li>
            <li>I love this thing.   </li>
            <li>Pull all hair up on top of your head.</li>
            <li>(working the bottom layers to the top)   </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a life-saver for me! :)</li>
            <li>I just love the instyler</li>
            <li>And I was a hair stylist for many years</li>
            <li>and she fell in love with it too, and</li>
            <li>Even though this unit costs more than a curling iron, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>She said to make sure the iron is ceramic.</li>
            <li>My hair looks better after using it.</li>
            <li>i love my instyler.</li>
            <li>The instyler works better than I thought it would.</li>
            <li>I was able to use it MAYBE 20 times, and that&#x27;s generous.</li>
            <li>Shine spray was pretty good, but I have yet to use the hair spray.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!!</li>
            <li>The explaination was accurate, shipping was fast, and the price was great.</li>
            <li>i love it and it is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>My wife love it because is really easy to use.</li>
            <li>Might be a better product if the barrel was made of ceramic to allow the Instyler to glide easily.  </li>
            <li>i have never been able to style my hair really well before, but since i got this, i can make my hair look just as good as the stylist.</li>
            <li>This is the MOST important part.</li>
            <li>For me, the best part of this set is the wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li>I am not dissatisfied with my purchase, but I would not recommend it to a friend either as there must be better options available.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>its really easy to learn and a made a perfect/convenient gift</li>
            <li>Mine is fine, so I use in on the lowest heat setting.</li>
            <li>It does add a nice shine and gets plenty hot, but it&#x27;s not as fantastic as I hoped.</li>
            <li>I paid A LOT of money for a glorified curling iron/straightener, however I would have been fine with that.</li>
            <li>In fact, reading a lot of these reviews, I found that you are lucky if it lasts more than a year.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and this little machine is awesome.</li>
            <li>You cannot expect it to straighten your hair in huge bunches.</li>
            <li>After a year of daily use, there is no visible damage to my hair, and it has great shine.</li>
            <li>I watched the video and followed the directions precisely.</li>
            <li>I feel that it works better for me, and it smells lovely, I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>be sure you put it on the right setting.</li>
            <li>I was excited at getting a great price on Cyber Monday, and when it arrived I ripped it open and tried it out.  </li>
            <li>It was well built and came as expected with propmt delivery and in excellent condition, however don&#x27;t expect it to work any better than a normal iron.</li>
            <li>It was super easy to straighten my hair and</li>
            <li>I love this Instyler straightener, it doesn&#x60;t leave my hair dry and damaged and with some practice you can curl the ends under and give lift to the crown, it does take practice though to get good at doing it.</li>
            <li>And it was love at first straightened lock.</li>
            <li>- she was so excited.  </li>
            <li>My (two year) experience with the InStyler is that you need to start with clean hair.   </li>
            <li>Since using the Instyler my hair is salon perfect everyday, it actually makes your hair look shiny and healthy!</li>
            <li>I have never been able to wear it straight, now I can.  </li>
            <li>If you get one that never heats to full capacity, it will not work correctly.</li>
            <li>I have used all sorts of styling tools to get the salon look everyday, my hair came out good but not like it does now!</li>
            <li>i have said good bye to my flat iron and tossed it away.</li>
            <li>that you watch the DVD it comes with or read the quick 2 page pamplet that shows you how to do lots of diferent styles.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my mother and her  hair is pretty curly, often frizzy and still the instyler works pretty well :)</li>
            <li>Sent this back, got them all Chis, and now everyone is happy and straight...</li>
            <li>This product is everything it&#x27;s presented to be and the instructional DVD with videos and links to further information makes using this product a very satisfying experience.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t as fast and easy as shown on the demo.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been so excited by a hair appliance since 1968 when I got my first \\&quot;hot rollers\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t think this product is good for thick hair since it doesn&#x27;t even get hot enough to get good results faster and better.</li>
            <li>this product is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Considering the price of the Instyler, I think getting the extended warranty is well worth</li>
            <li>He said it wouldn&#x27;t work, and he was right.  </li>
            <li>Problem I have is it&#x27;s made for right handed people and</li>
            <li>In less than 10 minutes, my hair is smooth, straight, styled, shiny and gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>After my initial use I still had to pull out the good, old, handy dandy ceramic flat iron to get the look I was trying to achieve which made me think, what&#x27;s the point in using the InStyler?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Just a little heat protector and hairspray and my hair is so soft and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>First, you must read the instructions before using the InStyler.</li>
            <li>The first time, I just turned it on and used it on the highest heat setting...</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t tell, I love this product and might pick up a second one here just for insurance purposes.</li>
            <li>When I first heard of the Instyler, I had to have it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my Instyler for 2 years now, and I absolutely adore it!  </li>
            <li>When I first heard about the Instyler</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why so many have given this product a poor review unless they got one of the many fakes that are available.</li>
            <li>First time I used The Instyler, it shut off while using it.</li>
            <li>i baught this a week ago and the first time i used it it took 10 min to heat up then</li>
            <li>better than all the others we have bought over the years that only do one thing...</li>
            <li>It is HOT  MNB</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!</li>
            <li>I am glad that I got this instead of a flat iron or curling iron!</li>
            <li>Not wild about their styling spray, it&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li>i really love this , it does not not take long to get your hair done.</li>
            <li>Review by Scott&#x27;s wife: I fell in love with it and it didn&#x27;t take long for me to get used to it and how it works.  </li>
            <li>there is no place for them to hold onto the top to steady it, and no way to get close enough to their scalps to straighten ALL their hair without burning themselves.</li>
            <li>This product certainly did not work like it shows on the infomercials.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and dry, and its normal state is frizzy.  </li>
            <li>You can make a gentle flip or page.</li>
            <li>I have color-treated, shoulder-length, straight and curly hairs and this tames them all--straightening the too curly ones and curving the straight ones.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is so much quicker than blow drying and styling.</li>
            <li>I have very frizzy, curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It is rather loud while you&#x27;re using it but worth it.</li>
            <li>I really hope you give the Instyler a try.</li>
            <li>Beware this maaay burn hair if you use it too much</li>
            <li>It takes me minutes to do my hair and it gives it so much body and shine.</li>
            <li>This thing is an absolute menace.</li>
            <li>Really wish it had worked.</li>
            <li>Who wants straight ends and kinky roots?</li>
            <li>I thought that it looked nice and would be better for my hair than my flat iron, but this thing was a complete waste of my money.</li>
            <li>It really falls short of what kind of smoothness I can get from my flat iron.  </li>
            <li>It straightens my hair so much better than my old flat iron</li>
            <li>It creates very soft, straight hair for me that lasts up to four days!   </li>
            <li>The instyler does a fine job in straightening my hair, but it&#x27;s not a big difference compared to my normal straightening iron.</li>
            <li>It does a fair job of straightening hair, but the power constantly shuts off if even a little too much hair is in between the rollers.  </li>
            <li>I generally blow dry my curly, course hair with a straightening brush and then use a ceramic flat iron to smooth and add shine... if you are trying to get to your roots, this takes much more time to do with the Instyler and</li>
            <li>(they less hair with each run, the better)   </li>
            <li>I highly dont recomend waisting your money.</li>
            <li>I have looked at reviews on this Chi flat iron, which can be found around the same price, and read much better customer reviews.</li>
            <li>I have had curling irons poop out in a little more than a year of use.</li>
            <li>I could not believe how soft &amp; straight my hair was.</li>
            <li>So I blow dry my hair until it still feel slightly cool.</li>
            <li>I bought the Instyler through the infomercial about a year ago and got the one free which in actuality you pay for because the price is doubled from what they sell for other places.</li>
            <li>so i bought a new one from the instyler website</li>
            <li>just got it about 2 months ago after getting  a new hairstyle.</li>
            <li>It is very soft and I don&#x27;t have to put tons of product in it</li>
            <li>With this product it is done in one seamless step!</li>
            <li>I go from shampoo to style in under 20 minutes by just blow drying my hair into a fright wig, then pulling it up into a ponytail on top of my head styling small sections with the Instyler into my desired hairdo.</li>
            <li>It works better than ur ordinary straightner.</li>
            <li>The only reason that I gave it 2 stars was because it did straighted hair, but I could not use it to curl ends under or up because it was too hot to have close to my ears or neck.</li>
            <li>It did not tame my hair; in fact it seems to do nothing at all.</li>
            <li>I keep one on my bathroom counter at all times for quick styling and touch-ups, and keep the other one in my suitcase for traveling.  </li>
            <li>If this product had been invented prior to the flat iron, I&#x27;d think it was the bomb, but I&#x27;ve been using high quality flat irons for more than a decade, so this is a step back in beauty revolution.  </li>
            <li>I have this old iron for 1 1/2 year</li>
            <li>Instead, my hair hung like tufts of old sofa stuffing, not a look I wanted.  </li>
            <li>tool makes your hair touch-ably soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Also, sometimes the Instyler has a habit of not heating up completely or losing heat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a flaw, but so far fixable.   </li>
            <li>This was a gift for my 13year old daughter.</li>
            <li>she&#x27;s a picky 18 year old.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s loud.    </li>
            <li>Not only did it not heat up as fast as advertised, but it would shut itself off during use.</li>
            <li>There is some truth to this save for the fact that the rotating iron burns your scalp and forehead if you try to get it anywhere near your roots.</li>
            <li>I would be think twice about purchasing this product if there are young children in the home</li>
            <li>and it loud</li>
            <li>I dry my hair first.</li>
            <li>A coworker of mine recommended this product to me after it worked wonders on her naturally curly hair (which she always wore straight through liberal use of a flat iron).</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair, and when i first tryed straightening it with the InStyler, if you do little pieces of hair at a time, it works so</li>
            <li>It does come with a \\&quot;thermal shield\\&quot; to protect you from this but the shield only protects one small &lt;1\\&quot; area on top of the rotator... which if you are straightening/ lifting your roots, it is the side of the rotator that burns you.  </li>
            <li>I had to buy a new one today for the sheer fact</li>
            <li>Then, dry it straight.</li>
            <li>So I had always seen late night tv commercials offering the Instyler for so many low payments a month--added up it was something like $150-$160.</li>
            <li>Overall, I really enjoy using the Instyler, but the \\&quot;deluxe\\&quot; is not worth the extra price.</li>
            <li>The wand become so hot that it has to be very carefully placed on a surface that can handle the heat and would never put in on a counter after use.  </li>
            <li>And it does get the frizz out with less effort, less heat and my hair looks better.</li>
            <li>It gets very hot, and it&#x27;s not easy to keep if off your head and not burn yourself.  </li>
            <li>I bought from a different site - it would turn off all of a sudden and finally it became too much of a pain to deal with as it kept shutting off.</li>
            <li>Within the next month, my daughter&#x27;s developed a groove in the barrel and would stop turning while she was using it.   </li>
            <li>Last summer, I found one at my local Walmart for $95 and bought it since I was needing a new straightener anyway.</li>
            <li>If you are used to a traditional ceramic flat iron, you must use this more slowly.</li>
            <li>This product does not work nearly as well as a flat iron.</li>
            <li>my old one had accidentally gotten wet on the way home from the holidays and it wouldn&#x27;t turn on--and I had that bugger for something near to 8-9 months.</li>
            <li>and there is no place to put the hot wand out of reach of little fingers.</li>
            <li>I bought them around November and of course by the time they developed problems, the warranty was long expired.    </li>
            <li>&quot; This lead me to think it was ceramic coated (which is much safer and less damaging to your hair...</li>
            <li>I have long, poker straight, thick hair that doesn&#x27;t hold curl very well.</li>
            <li>I have thin fine hair</li>
            <li>If you have thin fine hair skip it</li>
            <li>After a year of daily use, a part on the end has fallen off and a ring near the handle comes loose.</li>

            <li> Love it and got a wonderful deal.</li>
            <li> Got this product and looked good on television</li>
            <li> all i can say is it was good but after 1 week it turns of   for some reason</li>
            <li> She borrowed her sisters and loved it.</li>
            <li> you gotta start with good quality shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> and it doesnt even straighten my hair that good</li>
            <li> This product works great for straightening, okay for curling.</li>
            <li> I love the Instyler!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and produces great results.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and was waiting to be dazzeled by all the amazing things it could do to frizzy untamed hair like mine.  </li>
            <li> I got the InStyler Deluxe for Christmas this year</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s since moved out on her own</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair nicely styled and shiny, not burnt or damaged at all.</li>
            <li> The deluxe kit includes the Instyler, the instructional DVD, the protective training guard, the comb, the handy combination heat protective rest pad/storage bag, and two quality spray products.</li>
            <li> The shine spray provided is nice, but I prefer to use Biosilk silk therapy</li>
            <li> You get everything in the Instyler Deluxe kit to very easily and quickly be able to do salon styling to your own hair at your convenience.</li>
            <li> You get more value buying the deluxe kit.</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this Instyler.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it about 3 weeks and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> but I like mine better.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s OK because I don&#x27;t need it now.</li>
            <li> Probably could curve it more as I get the hang of using the InStyler.</li>
            <li> but this works better as the rolling \\&quot;iron\\&quot; keeps from burning your hair and the top part brushes and heats the top side as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments on my hair since I started using both.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough great things about it!</li>
            <li> I have tried every product on the planet to make my hair more manageable, from leave-in treatments to curlers to revolving brushes, but NOTHING comes close to the Instyler.  </li>
            <li> I love this thing.   </li>
            <li> Pull all hair up on top of your head.</li>
            <li> (working the bottom layers to the top)   </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a life-saver for me! :)</li>
            <li> I just love the instyler</li>
            <li> And I was a hair stylist for many years</li>
            <li> and she fell in love with it too, and</li>
            <li> Even though this unit costs more than a curling iron, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> She said to make sure the iron is ceramic.</li>
            <li> My hair looks better after using it.</li>
            <li> i love my instyler.</li>
            <li> The instyler works better than I thought it would.</li>
            <li> I was able to use it MAYBE 20 times, and that&#x27;s generous.</li>
            <li> Shine spray was pretty good, but I have yet to use the hair spray.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!!</li>
            <li> The explaination was accurate, shipping was fast, and the price was great.</li>
            <li> i love it and it is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> My wife love it because is really easy to use.</li>
            <li> Might be a better product if the barrel was made of ceramic to allow the Instyler to glide easily.  </li>
            <li> i have never been able to style my hair really well before, but since i got this, i can make my hair look just as good as the stylist.</li>
            <li> This is the MOST important part.</li>
            <li> For me, the best part of this set is the wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li> I am not dissatisfied with my purchase, but I would not recommend it to a friend either as there must be better options available.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> its really easy to learn and a made a perfect/convenient gift</li>
            <li> Mine is fine, so I use in on the lowest heat setting.</li>
            <li> It does add a nice shine and gets plenty hot, but it&#x27;s not as fantastic as I hoped.</li>
            <li> I paid A LOT of money for a glorified curling iron/straightener, however I would have been fine with that.</li>
            <li> In fact, reading a lot of these reviews, I found that you are lucky if it lasts more than a year.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and this little machine is awesome.</li>
            <li> You cannot expect it to straighten your hair in huge bunches.</li>
            <li> After a year of daily use, there is no visible damage to my hair, and it has great shine.</li>
            <li> I watched the video and followed the directions precisely.</li>
            <li> I feel that it works better for me, and it smells lovely, I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> be sure you put it on the right setting.</li>
            <li> I was excited at getting a great price on Cyber Monday, and when it arrived I ripped it open and tried it out.  </li>
            <li> It was well built and came as expected with propmt delivery and in excellent condition, however don&#x27;t expect it to work any better than a normal iron.</li>
            <li> It was super easy to straighten my hair and</li>
            <li> I love this Instyler straightener, it doesn&#x60;t leave my hair dry and damaged and with some practice you can curl the ends under and give lift to the crown, it does take practice though to get good at doing it.</li>
            <li> And it was love at first straightened lock.</li>
            <li> - she was so excited.  </li>
            <li> My (two year) experience with the InStyler is that you need to start with clean hair.   </li>
            <li> Since using the Instyler my hair is salon perfect everyday, it actually makes your hair look shiny and healthy!</li>
            <li> I have never been able to wear it straight, now I can.  </li>
            <li> If you get one that never heats to full capacity, it will not work correctly.</li>
            <li> I have used all sorts of styling tools to get the salon look everyday, my hair came out good but not like it does now!</li>
            <li> i have said good bye to my flat iron and tossed it away.</li>
            <li> that you watch the DVD it comes with or read the quick 2 page pamplet that shows you how to do lots of diferent styles.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my mother and her  hair is pretty curly, often frizzy and still the instyler works pretty well :)</li>
            <li> Sent this back, got them all Chis, and now everyone is happy and straight...</li>
            <li> This product is everything it&#x27;s presented to be and the instructional DVD with videos and links to further information makes using this product a very satisfying experience.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as fast and easy as shown on the demo.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been so excited by a hair appliance since 1968 when I got my first \\&quot;hot rollers\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t think this product is good for thick hair since it doesn&#x27;t even get hot enough to get good results faster and better.</li>
            <li> this product is worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Considering the price of the Instyler, I think getting the extended warranty is well worth</li>
            <li> He said it wouldn&#x27;t work, and he was right.  </li>
            <li> Problem I have is it&#x27;s made for right handed people and</li>
            <li> In less than 10 minutes, my hair is smooth, straight, styled, shiny and gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> After my initial use I still had to pull out the good, old, handy dandy ceramic flat iron to get the look I was trying to achieve which made me think, what&#x27;s the point in using the InStyler?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Just a little heat protector and hairspray and my hair is so soft and beautiful.  </li>
            <li> First, you must read the instructions before using the InStyler.</li>
            <li> The first time, I just turned it on and used it on the highest heat setting...</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t tell, I love this product and might pick up a second one here just for insurance purposes.</li>
            <li> When I first heard of the Instyler, I had to have it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Instyler for 2 years now, and I absolutely adore it!  </li>
            <li> When I first heard about the Instyler</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why so many have given this product a poor review unless they got one of the many fakes that are available.</li>
            <li> First time I used The Instyler, it shut off while using it.</li>
            <li> i baught this a week ago and the first time i used it it took 10 min to heat up then</li>
            <li> better than all the others we have bought over the years that only do one thing...</li>
            <li> It is HOT  MNB</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!</li>
            <li> I am glad that I got this instead of a flat iron or curling iron!</li>
            <li> Not wild about their styling spray, it&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li> i really love this , it does not not take long to get your hair done.</li>
            <li> Review by Scott&#x27;s wife: I fell in love with it and it didn&#x27;t take long for me to get used to it and how it works.  </li>
            <li> there is no place for them to hold onto the top to steady it, and no way to get close enough to their scalps to straighten ALL their hair without burning themselves.</li>
            <li> This product certainly did not work like it shows on the infomercials.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and dry, and its normal state is frizzy.  </li>
            <li> You can make a gentle flip or page.</li>
            <li> I have color-treated, shoulder-length, straight and curly hairs and this tames them all--straightening the too curly ones and curving the straight ones.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is so much quicker than blow drying and styling.</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It is rather loud while you&#x27;re using it but worth it.</li>
            <li> I really hope you give the Instyler a try.</li>
            <li> Beware this maaay burn hair if you use it too much</li>
            <li> It takes me minutes to do my hair and it gives it so much body and shine.</li>
            <li> This thing is an absolute menace.</li>
            <li> Really wish it had worked.</li>
            <li> Who wants straight ends and kinky roots?</li>
            <li> I thought that it looked nice and would be better for my hair than my flat iron, but this thing was a complete waste of my money.</li>
            <li> It really falls short of what kind of smoothness I can get from my flat iron.  </li>
            <li> It straightens my hair so much better than my old flat iron</li>
            <li> It creates very soft, straight hair for me that lasts up to four days!   </li>
            <li> The instyler does a fine job in straightening my hair, but it&#x27;s not a big difference compared to my normal straightening iron.</li>
            <li> It does a fair job of straightening hair, but the power constantly shuts off if even a little too much hair is in between the rollers.  </li>
            <li> I generally blow dry my curly, course hair with a straightening brush and then use a ceramic flat iron to smooth and add shine... if you are trying to get to your roots, this takes much more time to do with the Instyler and</li>
            <li> (they less hair with each run, the better)   </li>
            <li> I highly dont recomend waisting your money.</li>
            <li> I have looked at reviews on this Chi flat iron, which can be found around the same price, and read much better customer reviews.</li>
            <li> I have had curling irons poop out in a little more than a year of use.</li>
            <li> I could not believe how soft &amp; straight my hair was.</li>
            <li> So I blow dry my hair until it still feel slightly cool.</li>
            <li> I bought the Instyler through the infomercial about a year ago and got the one free which in actuality you pay for because the price is doubled from what they sell for other places.</li>
            <li> so i bought a new one from the instyler website</li>
            <li> just got it about 2 months ago after getting  a new hairstyle.</li>
            <li> It is very soft and I don&#x27;t have to put tons of product in it</li>
            <li> With this product it is done in one seamless step!</li>
            <li> I go from shampoo to style in under 20 minutes by just blow drying my hair into a fright wig, then pulling it up into a ponytail on top of my head styling small sections with the Instyler into my desired hairdo.</li>
            <li> It works better than ur ordinary straightner.</li>
            <li> The only reason that I gave it 2 stars was because it did straighted hair, but I could not use it to curl ends under or up because it was too hot to have close to my ears or neck.</li>
            <li> It did not tame my hair; in fact it seems to do nothing at all.</li>
            <li> I keep one on my bathroom counter at all times for quick styling and touch-ups, and keep the other one in my suitcase for traveling.  </li>
            <li> If this product had been invented prior to the flat iron, I&#x27;d think it was the bomb, but I&#x27;ve been using high quality flat irons for more than a decade, so this is a step back in beauty revolution.  </li>
            <li> I have this old iron for 1 1/2 year</li>
            <li> Instead, my hair hung like tufts of old sofa stuffing, not a look I wanted.  </li>
            <li> tool makes your hair touch-ably soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Also, sometimes the Instyler has a habit of not heating up completely or losing heat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a flaw, but so far fixable.   </li>
            <li> This was a gift for my 13year old daughter.</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s a picky 18 year old.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s loud.    </li>
            <li> Not only did it not heat up as fast as advertised, but it would shut itself off during use.</li>
            <li> There is some truth to this save for the fact that the rotating iron burns your scalp and forehead if you try to get it anywhere near your roots.</li>
            <li> I would be think twice about purchasing this product if there are young children in the home</li>
            <li> and it loud</li>
            <li> I dry my hair first.</li>
            <li> A coworker of mine recommended this product to me after it worked wonders on her naturally curly hair (which she always wore straight through liberal use of a flat iron).</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair, and when i first tryed straightening it with the InStyler, if you do little pieces of hair at a time, it works so</li>
            <li> It does come with a \\&quot;thermal shield\\&quot; to protect you from this but the shield only protects one small &lt;1\\&quot; area on top of the rotator... which if you are straightening/ lifting your roots, it is the side of the rotator that burns you.  </li>
            <li> I had to buy a new one today for the sheer fact</li>
            <li> Then, dry it straight.</li>
            <li> So I had always seen late night tv commercials offering the Instyler for so many low payments a month--added up it was something like $150-$160.</li>
            <li> Overall, I really enjoy using the Instyler, but the \\&quot;deluxe\\&quot; is not worth the extra price.</li>
            <li> The wand become so hot that it has to be very carefully placed on a surface that can handle the heat and would never put in on a counter after use.  </li>
            <li> And it does get the frizz out with less effort, less heat and my hair looks better.</li>
            <li> It gets very hot, and it&#x27;s not easy to keep if off your head and not burn yourself.  </li>
            <li> I bought from a different site - it would turn off all of a sudden and finally it became too much of a pain to deal with as it kept shutting off.</li>
            <li> Within the next month, my daughter&#x27;s developed a groove in the barrel and would stop turning while she was using it.   </li>
            <li> Last summer, I found one at my local Walmart for $95 and bought it since I was needing a new straightener anyway.</li>
            <li> If you are used to a traditional ceramic flat iron, you must use this more slowly.</li>
            <li> This product does not work nearly as well as a flat iron.</li>
            <li> my old one had accidentally gotten wet on the way home from the holidays and it wouldn&#x27;t turn on--and I had that bugger for something near to 8-9 months.</li>
            <li> and there is no place to put the hot wand out of reach of little fingers.</li>
            <li> I bought them around November and of course by the time they developed problems, the warranty was long expired.    </li>
            <li> &quot; This lead me to think it was ceramic coated (which is much safer and less damaging to your hair...</li>
            <li> I have long, poker straight, thick hair that doesn&#x27;t hold curl very well.</li>
            <li> I have thin fine hair</li>
            <li> If you have thin fine hair skip it</li>
            <li> After a year of daily use, a part on the end has fallen off and a ring near the handle comes loose.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t pull at my hair the way the traditional ceramic flat iron did.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy hair and have tried flat irons and have several.</li>
            <li> My hair is long in the front and sides, but my back is relatively short.  </li>
            <li> I have curly hair and this product doesn&#x27;t straighten hair at the scalp nor does it straighten as well as a flat iron.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended that I go to a beauty supply store or look into buying a ceramic Chi flat iron online.</li>
            <li> In a pinch I would use the Instyler in the event that my flat iron or curling iron broke.  </li>
            <li> I would use it to straighten out my unruly curls but then go over it with a flat iron for a polished and sleek look.</li>
            <li> I have dry, coarse hair, and it seemed to work so well on women who had hair like mine.  </li>
            <li> As soon as I would hit humidity or get my hair wet, it would curl &amp; frizz back up.</li>
            <li> &amp; I used to take that long just to straighten it with a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I have watched the TV advertising for this product and have wanted it for a long time.  </li>
            <li> When I used a curlng iron, it didn&#x27;t take long for dry, split ends to develop.</li>
            <li> If your hair is frizz, dry, damaged, etc.. then this will product will help hair the way you want.</li>
            <li> I actually looked everywhere in the instructions, on the box, and even searched the internet to find out what the barrel was comprised of... no success.</li>
            <li> far less time (cut the straightening time in half).</li>
            <li> The only down side is that there is no where to hold the end of the Instyler while using like you would a curling iron</li>
            <li> the *shine results are less with it than with a ceramic flat iron.</li>
            <li> so you have to be careful.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not at all wet, but damp.</li>
            <li> and I continue to use it before the flat iron because it gives me a little bit of peace knowing that my hair isn&#x27;t being entirely crushed between to 450 degree metal plates.</li>
            <li> I did as the instructions said and took very small pieces of my freshly washed hair and had go over that one section of hair at least 30 times before I started to get results.</li>
            <li> I notice I have save the time because my other flat iron is waste of time for me.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed with  this product and wish I had spent my money on something worthwhile.</li>
            <li> I still have waves under the other hair.    </li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL!  </li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, african-american hair that gets extremely poufy.</li>
            <li> Maybe the company has made improvements in the product since then, but I would think long and hard before I spent money on this product.</li>
            <li> Then, let another section down all the way around.   </li>
            <li> My hair drying/straightening process can take upwards of 2 hours, so when she informed me that this product cut her time down to 15 minutes</li>
            <li> Her hair is hyper/crazy thick..and down to her waist.  </li>
            <li> My hair is really curly and flat irons just don&#x27;t cut it, especially with my annoying curls at my temples</li>
            <li> It cuts my styling time in half.</li>
            <li> And, my chin length bob is smoother and I can even get the ends to turn under slightly.</li>

            <li> Previously to getting the Instyler, I used curling irons to try to get some lift and body curl into my hair.</li>
            <li> thought I might also mention that I have found the curl and body lasts longer if my hair is slightly damp when I curl it.</li>

            <li> I always think that if something is expensive, it is well made and will last long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product few times and it isn&#x27;t that bad - as long as my hair is dry and not wet or damped.  </li>
            <li> When it turns on, which is few and far between, it will do a weird sputtering noise like it&#x27;s trying to turn and then turn itself off.</li>

            <li> It wasa waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I began using my Instyler the day I recieved it and have used everyday since.  </li>
            <li> and I HAD to buy her one for Christmas as she was really missing it</li>
            <li> It took a few times to get the \\&quot;hang\\&quot; of using it, but it does give my hair body and some curl at the ends the way I like it.</li>
            <li> I never liked any other straighteners because they damage your hair.</li>
            <li> so I was prepared for the loud noise and extreme heat; however, I didn&#x27;t take into account that the device&#x27;s design makes it virtually impossible to get close to your roots.</li>

            <li> Not sure the \\&quot;Deluxe\\&quot; should have a bearing on the price since the bottles are small</li>
            <li> and it is almost past my shoulders</li>

            <li> (not perfect, just run the brush through while you blow dry)   </li>
            <li> Sadly though this product did not live up to it&#x27;s claims.</li>

            <li> I have this Instyler few month ago. I love it. I notice I have save the time because my other flat iron is waste of time for me. I have this old iron for 1 1/2 year and it take almost hour to get my hair done. Instyer does my hair great and it take 15 minutes to get it done. I recommed this to friend who want save time and money with this product. If your hair is frizz, dry, damaged, etc.. then this will product will help hair the way you want.</li>
            <li> I love the Instyler! It cuts my styling time in half. I used to straighten my hair, and then curl it. With this product it is done in one seamless step! I have thick curly hair, and it takes me about 20 minutes to a half hour to get a finished look compared to the hour I used to spend!</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m hooked!  I love this Instyler.  I never liked any other straighteners because they damage your hair. My sister got this a month ago for X-mas &amp; tried it on me shortly after. I could not believe how soft &amp; straight my hair was. I have always had curly, frizzy hair.  I always tried to straighten it, but gave up. As soon as I would hit humidity or get my hair wet, it would curl &amp; frizz back up. This is great!  It only takes about 20 minutes &amp; I used to take that long just to straighten it with a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Instyler after watching the infomercial and a tv show that was selling it.  I have dry, coarse hair, and it seemed to work so well on women who had hair like mine.  Mistake!!! It didn&#x27;t straighten and it didn&#x27;t curl my hair.  Instead, my hair hung like tufts of old sofa stuffing, not a look I wanted.  I would have sent it back, but the directions that came with it said I had to return it to the manufacturer and didn&#x27;t know if I would get my money back.  I should have listened to my husband.  He said it wouldn&#x27;t work, and he was right.  I hate when that happens!</li>
            <li> First, you must read the instructions before using the InStyler. The first time, I just turned it on and used it on the highest heat setting...wrong. There are specifics based on your hair type. Mine is fine, so I use in on the lowest heat setting. Also, you must use it with the rotating roller nearest your head. Finally, and the instructions are specific...move it SLOWLY through your hair. If you are used to a traditional ceramic flat iron, you must use this more slowly. But it doesn&#x27;t pull at my hair the way the traditional ceramic flat iron did. And it does get the frizz out with less effort, less heat and my hair looks better. I&#x27;ve been using it about 3 weeks and absolutely love it. I dry my hair first. Then use the inStyler. Not wild about their styling spray, it&#x27;s OK but I like mine better. Can&#x27;t use leave in conditioners, which I used to use. That&#x27;s OK because I don&#x27;t need it now. And, my chin length bob is smoother and I can even get the ends to turn under slightly. Probably could curve it more as I get the hang of using the InStyler.</li>
            <li> I have watched the TV advertising for this product and have wanted it for a long time.  Finally I ordered two - one for me and one for my daughter.  IT DOES NOT WORK.  Very poor product and costs a chunk of change!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been so excited by a hair appliance since 1968 when I got my first \\&quot;hot rollers\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tool makes your hair touch-ably soft and shiny. You can make a gentle flip or page. I have color-treated, shoulder-length, straight and curly hairs and this tames them all--straightening the too curly ones and curving the straight ones. I used to use my curling iron to \\&quot;straighten\\&quot; areas I wanted straighter but this works better as the rolling \\&quot;iron\\&quot; keeps from burning your hair and the top part brushes and heats the top side as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is so much quicker than blow drying and styling. I go from shampoo to style in under 20 minutes by just blow drying my hair into a fright wig, then pulling it up into a ponytail on top of my head styling small sections with the Instyler into my desired hairdo. The best value before this was at ULTA when they have a 20% off coupon but you don&#x27;t get the additional comb, mat and style and shine liquids. If you can&#x27;t tell, I love this product and might pick up a second one here just for insurance purposes. This and WEN conditioning cleanser are my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; hair products/tools.  I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments on my hair since I started using both.</li>
            <li> I have thin fine hair and I could not get the in styler to work.  Curls were slight and di not stay in.  I tried over and over again. I watched the video and was using it correctly.   I am returning it. It wasa waste of money.  If you have thin fine hair skip it</li>
            <li> I got the InStyler Deluxe for Christmas this year and I love it! I have very curly hair, and when i first tryed straightening it with the InStyler, if you do little pieces of hair at a time, it works so so so well! My aunt tryed curling her hair with the InStyler, and it&#x27;s also a great curler. But i recomend for curling, fliping, ect. that you watch the DVD it comes with or read the quick 2 page pamplet that shows you how to do lots of diferent styles.</li>
            <li> When I first heard of the Instyler, I had to have it. It works great. I even use it on my daughters&#x27; hair. It works better than ur ordinary straightner. You can flip it under or over and even curl it if u want. It also gives my hair some extra volume, which we all want. Two thumbs up!!!</li>
            <li> Love the Instlyer!! I have very frizzy, curly hair.  I have never been able to wear it straight, now I can.  It is very soft and I don&#x27;t have to put tons of product in it like I used to.  Just a little heat protector and hairspray and my hair is so soft and beautiful.  Can&#x27;t say enough great things about it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Instyler for 2 years now, and I absolutely adore it!  I&#x27;ve lived my entire life with unruly, curly, frizzy hair.  My hair is very fine and dry, and its normal state is frizzy.  I have tried every product on the planet to make my hair more manageable, from leave-in treatments to curlers to revolving brushes, but NOTHING comes close to the Instyler.  In less than 10 minutes, my hair is smooth, straight, styled, shiny and gorgeous.  I have never looked so \\&quot;put together,\\&quot; sleek and under control before!  10 minutes, and I&#x27;m out the door with great hair!  It&#x27;s an amazing product!  I bought 2, have had them both for 2 years without any issues.  I keep one on my bathroom counter at all times for quick styling and touch-ups, and keep the other one in my suitcase for traveling.  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Got my instyler from Amazon. Love it and got a wonderful deal. Would recomend getting it from Amazon. This is a great product. Does my hair and my moms wonderful!!!</li>
            <li> This product works great for straightening, okay for curling. Problem I have is it&#x27;s made for right handed people and I am soooo not! Because of that I have a hard time using it for curling my hair. It is rather loud while you&#x27;re using it but worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had an instyler for almost two years. I love this thing.   The expensive (and less expensive) flat irons do not work as well as this does. (if used correctly)   I have curly hair and this little machine is awesome. It creates very soft, straight hair for me that lasts up to four days!   Let me say, however, that you MUST not use it on dirty hair that you&#x27;ve worn curly for a day or two. You won&#x27;t get the best results.   My (two year) experience with the InStyler is that you need to start with clean hair.   I usually wash and condition my hair. Then, dry it straight. (not perfect, just run the brush through while you blow dry)   Now, you need to straighten your hair in sections. This is the MOST important part. You cannot expect it to straighten your hair in huge bunches. It doesn&#x27;t work that way. (they less hair with each run, the better)   Pull all hair up on top of your head. Then keep a thin section down all the way around your head.   Start on one side and work your way around.   Then, let another section down all the way around.   Continue this until done. (working the bottom layers to the top)   This is the best way to see results.   Also, sometimes the Instyler has a habit of not heating up completely or losing heat. (I&#x27;ve found this on all models)   Simply turn it off, wait a second or two and turn it back on.   It&#x27;s a flaw, but so far fixable.   If you get one that never heats to full capacity, it will not work correctly. Send it back for a replacement.   I really hope you give the Instyler a try. It&#x27;s been a life-saver for me! :)</li>
            <li> I began using my Instyler the day I recieved it and have used everyday since.  It is easy to use.  It straightens my hair so much better than my old flat iron plus it allows me to curl the ends at the same time!  The only down side is that there is no where to hold the end of the Instyler while using like you would a curling iron so you have to be careful.  After a couple of uses, I was using it like a pro.  Great product, everyone should have one!</li>
            <li> i really love this , it does not not take long to get your hair done.I just love the instyler</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my 13year old daughter. She loves it. It is easy to use and produces great results.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and was waiting to be dazzeled by all the amazing things it could do to frizzy untamed hair like mine.  Sadly though this product did not live up to it&#x27;s claims. It did not tame my hair; in fact it seems to do nothing at all. I followed all the instructions and viewed the enclosed video on how to tips. I am extremely disappointed with  this product and wish I had spent my money on something worthwhile. I advise others with hair like mine to not throw away your money on this crappy product.</li>
            <li> Got this product and looked good on television but when I used it on my granddaughters hair it didn&#x27;t work like on t.v. it took numerous time just to get one section to straighten her hair. She got tired after about an hour at it. And I was a hair stylist for many years so I know what I was doing and it sucked. Wasn&#x27;t as fast and easy as shown on the demo.</li>
            <li> So I had always seen late night tv commercials offering the Instyler for so many low payments a month--added up it was something like $150-$160. Bit expensive for my tastes for straightening my hair. Last summer, I found one at my local Walmart for $95 and bought it since I was needing a new straightener anyway. And it was love at first straightened lock. It was super easy to straighten my hair and far less time (cut the straightening time in half). My hair is really curly and flat irons just don&#x27;t cut it, especially with my annoying curls at my temples that I thought nothing would ever straighten those short of chemically doing so--yet the Instyler made short work of those curls. I had to buy a new one today for the sheer fact my old one had accidentally gotten wet on the way home from the holidays and it wouldn&#x27;t turn on--and I had that bugger for something near to 8-9 months.</li>
            <li> Beware this maaay burn hair if you use it too much [lets say every day or every 2 days] But it works! I bought it for my mother and her  hair is pretty curly, often frizzy and still the instyler works pretty well :) its really easy to learn and a made a perfect/convenient gift</li>
            <li> all i can say is it was good but after 1 week it turns of   for some reason so i bought a new one from the instyler website</li>
            <li> Review by Scott&#x27;s wife: I fell in love with it and it didn&#x27;t take long for me to get used to it and how it works.  It takes me minutes to do my hair and it gives it so much body and shine. Even on the days I don&#x27;t wash my hair I can use my Instyler and my hair always looks great and gives it great body.  I did run into a problem with an Instyler I bought from a different site - it would turn off all of a sudden and finally it became too much of a pain to deal with as it kept shutting off. I did return it and then bought one from Target and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with this one AT ALL and i&#x27;ve had this one for 9 months or so.  I think i just encountered a knock-off or something. My daughter started using it and she fell in love with it too, and she&#x27;s a picky 18 year old. She&#x27;s since moved out on her own and I HAD to buy her one for Christmas as she was really missing it - she was so excited.  Definitely worth the money!!</li>
            <li> I was excited at getting a great price on Cyber Monday, and when it arrived I ripped it open and tried it out.  It gets very hot, and it&#x27;s not easy to keep if off your head and not burn yourself.  It&#x27;s hard to get close to your roots.  It&#x27;s loud.    I&#x27;m wishing I didn&#x27;t buy it, and will probably wind up selling it.   I feel like it was an expensive waste.</li>
            <li> This thing is an absolute menace. Both my girls and wife burned themselves to varying drgrees from 1-2... there is no place for them to hold onto the top to steady it, and no way to get close enough to their scalps to straighten ALL their hair without burning themselves. No way I would recommend this product to anyone. Not only did it not heat up as fast as advertised, but it would shut itself off during use. Sent this back, got them all Chis, and now everyone is happy and straight...</li>
            <li> this product is worth the money.  i love it and it is so easy to use.  i have said good bye to my flat iron and tossed it away.</li>
            <li> When I first heard about the Instyler I thought that it looked nice and would be better for my hair than my flat iron, but this thing was a complete waste of my money. I bought the Instyler because it advertised to work on all types of hair but this does not work on African- American hair. Since I have very thick hair I did as the instructions said and took very small pieces of my freshly washed hair and had go over that one section of hair at least 30 times before I started to get results. I just don&#x27;t think this product is good for thick hair since it doesn&#x27;t even get hot enough to get good results faster and better. Really wish it had worked.</li>
            <li> This product certainly did not work like it shows on the infomercials.  It was well built and came as expected with propmt delivery and in excellent condition, however don&#x27;t expect it to work any better than a normal iron.</li>
            <li> This product does not work nearly as well as a flat iron. I have curly hair and this product doesn&#x27;t straighten hair at the scalp nor does it straighten as well as a flat iron. Also, the closer you get to the end of your hair, the hair just seems to \\&quot;slide out\\&quot; of the barrel.  If I could do it over again, I would not purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I bought the Instyler through the infomercial about a year ago and got the one free which in actuality you pay for because the price is doubled from what they sell for other places. I have long, poker straight, thick hair that doesn&#x27;t hold curl very well. Previously to getting the Instyler, I used curling irons to try to get some lift and body curl into my hair. It took a few times to get the \\&quot;hang\\&quot; of using it, but it does give my hair body and some curl at the ends the way I like it. After a year of daily use, there is no visible damage to my hair, and it has great shine. When I used a curlng iron, it didn&#x27;t take long for dry, split ends to develop. After a year of daily use, a part on the end has fallen off and a ring near the handle comes loose. Even though this unit costs more than a curling iron, I can&#x27;t complain. I have had curling irons poop out in a little more than a year of use. Since I gave my daughter the 2nd Instyler for Christmas last year, I just bought 2 more from the infomercial because I didn&#x27;t want to take a chance on getting a fake. I tried going back to the curling iron, and it just doesn&#x27;t work as well. I don&#x27;t know why so many have given this product a poor review unless they got one of the many fakes that are available. When ordering this time, I got the extended warranty for 4 years for $9.99. Considering the price of the Instyler, I think getting the extended warranty is well worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I might also mention that I have found the curl and body lasts longer if my hair is slightly damp when I curl it. So I blow dry my hair until it still feel slightly cool. It&#x27;s not at all wet, but damp.</li>
            <li> I bought this rotating iron because:  - it was supposed to add shine and volume at the root. There is some truth to this save for the fact that the rotating iron burns your scalp and forehead if you try to get it anywhere near your roots. It does come with a \\&quot;thermal shield\\&quot; to protect you from this but the shield only protects one small &lt;1\\&quot; area on top of the rotator... which if you are straightening/ lifting your roots, it is the side of the rotator that burns you.  - the box says it \\&quot;styles in 1/2 the time!\\&quot; It does not do this at all. I generally blow dry my curly, course hair with a straightening brush and then use a ceramic flat iron to smooth and add shine... if you are trying to get to your roots, this takes much more time to do with the Instyler and the *shine results are less with it than with a ceramic flat iron.*  - it said \\&quot;410 degrees F ceramic heat.\\&quot; This lead me to think it was ceramic coated (which is much safer and less damaging to your hair... giving you less breakage and split ends.) That was a foolish assumption on my part. The rotating barrel is not ceramic coated. I actually looked everywhere in the instructions, on the box, and even searched the internet to find out what the barrel was comprised of... no success. Although, I do hope that after I write this, the facts will come forward.  - it was expensive! I always think that if something is expensive, it is well made and will last long. This is not the case with the product here. In fact, reading a lot of these reviews, I found that you are lucky if it lasts more than a year. My hair stylist recommended that I go to a beauty supply store or look into buying a ceramic Chi flat iron online. She said to make sure the iron is ceramic. I have looked at reviews on this Chi flat iron, which can be found around the same price, and read much better customer reviews. Some customers even say that their Chi iron lasted them 6+ years. This may be my next purchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased two InStylers for myself and my daughter.  Within a month, mine would shut itself off while in use.  Within the next month, my daughter&#x27;s developed a groove in the barrel and would stop turning while she was using it.   Both of our InStylers were puchased last Christmas.  I bought them around November and of course by the time they developed problems, the warranty was long expired.    Maybe the company has made improvements in the product since then, but I would think long and hard before I spent money on this product. I would definitely not recommend an InStyler to anyone.</li>
            <li> You get everything in the Instyler Deluxe kit to very easily and quickly be able to do salon styling to your own hair at your convenience. This product is everything it&#x27;s presented to be and the instructional DVD with videos and links to further information makes using this product a very satisfying experience. I am glad that I got this instead of a flat iron or curling iron! It leaves my hair nicely styled and shiny, not burnt or damaged at all. My hair looks better after using it. The deluxe kit includes the Instyler, the instructional DVD, the protective training guard, the comb, the handy combination heat protective rest pad/storage bag, and two quality spray products. You get more value buying the deluxe kit.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the Instyler. It does a fair job of straightening hair, but the power constantly shuts off if even a little too much hair is in between the rollers.  The wand become so hot that it has to be very carefully placed on a surface that can handle the heat and would never put in on a counter after use.  I would be think twice about purchasing this product if there are young children in the home and there is no place to put the hot wand out of reach of little fingers. I could not travel with this which was one of the reasons that I bought it because I could not pack it away in a suitcase until it had cooled.  I would not purchase this product again and would not recommend it. The only reason that I gave it 2 stars was because it did straighted hair, but I could not use it to curl ends under or up because it was too hot to have close to my ears or neck.</li>
            <li> First time I used The Instyler, it shut off while using it. I have to continue to press on the power button through each individual section of hair. I watched the video and followed the directions precisely. Still, I continue to have the same issue. What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> She borrowed her sisters and loved it. I bought her one and she uses it all the time and her hair looks great.</li>
            <li> Delivery on time and Excelent product. My wife love it because is really easy to use. She get her hair done in less than she spected and save some money to do it by herself and not to go to the hairstylist.</li>
            <li> I love this Instyler straightener, it doesn&#x60;t leave my hair dry and damaged and with some practice you can curl the ends under and give lift to the crown, it does take practice though to get good at doing it. I would definately recommend this product!</li>
            <li> i love my instyler. just got it about 2 months ago after getting  a new hairstyle. i have never been able to style my hair really well before, but since i got this, i can make my hair look just as good as the stylist. you gotta start with good quality shampoo and conditioner. i also use a heat protecting shine spray on my hair. i section it, and go. be sure you put it on the right setting. i use the medium setting. it took a couple days to get the hang of it, but now i can do my hair in under 10 minutes and i get compliments all the time. also go to their website. they have lots of tips on there.</li>
            <li> The explaination was accurate, shipping was fast, and the price was great. The instyler works better than I thought it would.</li>
            <li> The shipment arrived, but when opened, the plastic was sticky where the hair spray had leaked.  Maybe the bottle needs to have a lid to pull open.  Not sure the \\&quot;Deluxe\\&quot; should have a bearing on the price since the bottles are small but the comb would be maybe $1.00, but I already had one.    Overall, I really enjoy using the Instyler, but the \\&quot;deluxe\\&quot; is not worth the extra price.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, african-american hair that gets extremely poufy. The instyler does a fine job in straightening my hair, but it&#x27;s not a big difference compared to my normal straightening iron. It does add a nice shine and gets plenty hot, but it&#x27;s not as fantastic as I hoped. Still, great product (:</li>
            <li> The concept is impressive, however the product is not.  In a pinch I would use the Instyler in the event that my flat iron or curling iron broke.  It really falls short of what kind of smoothness I can get from my flat iron.  Might be a better product if the barrel was made of ceramic to allow the Instyler to glide easily.  If this product had been invented prior to the flat iron, I&#x27;d think it was the bomb, but I&#x27;ve been using high quality flat irons for more than a decade, so this is a step back in beauty revolution.  For me, the best part of this set is the wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li> A coworker of mine recommended this product to me after it worked wonders on her naturally curly hair (which she always wore straight through liberal use of a flat iron). My hair drying/straightening process can take upwards of 2 hours, so when she informed me that this product cut her time down to 15 minutes I knew I&#x27;d have to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some of the reviews before purchasing so I was prepared for the loud noise and extreme heat; however, I didn&#x27;t take into account that the device&#x27;s design makes it virtually impossible to get close to your roots. Who wants straight ends and kinky roots? After my initial use I still had to pull out the good, old, handy dandy ceramic flat iron to get the look I was trying to achieve which made me think, what&#x27;s the point in using the InStyler?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;m gonna sell mine on Ebay.</li>
            <li> I have used all sorts of styling tools to get the salon look everyday, my hair came out good but not like it does now! Since using the Instyler my hair is salon perfect everyday, it actually makes your hair look shiny and healthy! The shine spray provided is nice, but I prefer to use Biosilk silk therapy [[ASIN:B000H0SCCG Biosilk Silk Therapy 12 oz.]] I feel that it works better for me, and it smells lovely, I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> So this product is not what is advertised. i baught this a week ago and the first time i used it it took 10 min to heat up then when it did it would need to heat up again every 5 min and it doesnt even straighten my hair that good and it loud I highly dont recomend waisting your money.</li>
            <li> ...my daughter still loves it!!!  Her hair is hyper/crazy thick..and down to her waist.  She swears that this is the best hair utensil ever...better than all the others we have bought over the years that only do one thing... she gives it an AAAAAAAA++++++++.</li>
            <li> I have had the styler about a year. I have frizzy hair and have tried flat irons and have several. I saw this commercial on t.v. and one of the American Idol winners who is African American was having her hair done.  I was SOLD!  I am letting my hair grow out and it is almost past my shoulders so it takes a while to do my hair, but I section it off and do hunks at a time... the hardest part for me is the back...  If I dont get the styler close enough to my scalp I still have waves under the other hair.    BTW:  It will BLISTER your ears if you get too close!  BE CAREFUL!  It is HOT  MNB</li>
            <li> You have short hair, don&#x27;t get this product!  My hair is long in the front and sides, but my back is relatively short.  I&#x27;ve used this product few times and it isn&#x27;t that bad - as long as my hair is dry and not wet or damped.  Shine spray was pretty good, but I have yet to use the hair spray.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me and I am happy to pass along the recommendation.  It works well on my hair to straighten it.</li>
            <li> I paid A LOT of money for a glorified curling iron/straightener, however I would have been fine with that. After three months, THREE MONTHS!!!, it quit working. When it turns on, which is few and far between, it will do a weird sputtering noise like it&#x27;s trying to turn and then turn itself off. I was able to use it MAYBE 20 times, and that&#x27;s generous. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair and the instyler just did not cut it. I would use it to straighten out my unruly curls but then go over it with a flat iron for a polished and sleek look. The instyler is great for touch ups and I continue to use it before the flat iron because it gives me a little bit of peace knowing that my hair isn&#x27;t being entirely crushed between to 450 degree metal plates. I am not dissatisfied with my purchase, but I would not recommend it to a friend either as there must be better options available.</li>
