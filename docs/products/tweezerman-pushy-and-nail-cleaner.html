            <li>This is one of the best tools to have as a nail technician.  </li>

            <li>They are the best.</li>
            <li>This is a great item, but I still find myself using my fingernail sometimes instead of picking up this tool.  </li>
            <li>, this is a great tool.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is another Tweezerman tool that I got now that works great.</li>
            <li>The flat/sharpish edge isn&#x27;t a great design.</li>
            <li>This cuticle pusher is sturdy and it works great</li>

            <li>Good quality product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t think of a  good use for this scraper tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great, quality it really nice.</li>
            <li>The rounded end is tilted to clean under your nails and the squared end is perfect for cuticles.</li>

            <li>In my experiences, Tweezerman products are the best and worth looking for.</li>
            <li>ALWAYS handy and nearby on my desk.  </li>

            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Pleased with this product!&lt;br</li>
            <li>You should have more than one.  </li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>LOVE this tool.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several brands, and I think Tweezerman has the best design.  </li>
            <li>These are great highly recommend!~Tweezerman</li>
            <li>Each has nice, quality construction, and each has been quite useful to me.  </li>
            <li>Using a good product really does make a difference.</li>
            <li>Easy to sterilize in alcohol.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine has a pair of cuticle pushers that are much thinner on the ends, and there is no comparison, they work much better and more easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d think about if you need it before you purchase, but as usual Tweezerman is the best brand for nail care.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great little tool.  </li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;s a great little product.</li>
            <li>This is a heavy duty pusher which does a great job.</li>
            <li>Worth the money in ways you could never conceive.   </li>
            <li>It is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth what it cost.</li>
            <li>these items may cost more than stuff you would pick up at a drug store, but they will last forever if you treat them right.     </li>
            <li>I was a bit apprehensive over using a hard metal cuticle pusher, but the Tweezerman pusher worked great.</li>
            <li>i wanted a solid grooming tool that would be able to remove gunk under my fingernails and toenails between cuttings.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be holding up pretty well over the test of time.  </li>
            <li>This is not a complicated</li>
            <li>The pusher is wide and has a good edge but is not sharp.</li>
            <li>I get gel manicures and the flat side works really well for getting gel polish off, the other end is great for gentle cleaning.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This totally works fine.</li>
            <li>Fast forward to 2009 when I lost it on a road trip.</li>
            <li>I really like this one as it does not have any plastic or rubberized parts on it.</li>
            <li>It works very well and is my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; pushy when doing home manicures and shellac.</li>
            <li>I would love to have the old version back.</li>
            <li>In order to be able to scrape the corners of toe nails (or any other nails) it would have to be much thinner.</li>
            <li>This is clean and simple.</li>
            <li>i believe that you should maintain your nails using high quality grooming tools.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Feels like its made out of a high quality steel.  </li>
            <li>This nail product seems to be high quality construction and it does the job quite well.  </li>
            <li>However, that said real hang nails sometimes require professional Podiatrist treatment for a permanent fix.</li>
            <li>The cleaner is fairly broad and not sharp so it does not have the utility of some other tools that might be able to fit into smaller spaces.</li>
            <li>The push side is nothing special, as expected.</li>
            <li>it feels solid in your hands and cleans effortlessly under hot water when you&#x27;re done.  </li>
            <li>It would lift the nail bed too high when I tried to clean under the nail, and I would really have to push the cuticle back harder then necessary in order for it to lift.</li>
            <li>/&gt;As the old saying goes, &amp;#34;they don&#x27;t make &#x27;em like they used to.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>The only con (if it even matters) is that the black lettering on it comes off easily, but it&#x27;s not like that affects the performance though.</li>
            <li>Solid, high quality product.</li>
            <li>; The old model had a nice thin cleaning tip which could delicately get under the nail and scrape away every last bit of dirt in such a satisfying manner, I would pull it out and use it every hour</li>
            <li>new model has a big, fat cleaning tip with a rounded edge.</li>
            <li>This is a sharp, well made product that does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>

            <li> Very pleased with this one. I was a bit apprehensive over using a hard metal cuticle pusher, but the Tweezerman pusher worked great. It even gets the tough cuticle underneath. The only con (if it even matters) is that the black lettering on it comes off easily, but it&#x27;s not like that affects the performance though.</li>

It would lift the nail bed too high when I tried to clean under the nail, and I would really have to push the cuticle back harder then necessary in order for it to lift. A friend of mine has a pair of cuticle pushers that are much thinner on the ends, and there is no comparison, they work much better and more easily.</li>
            <li> I like the Tweezerman product line; this was one of three implements I recently purchased.  Each has nice, quality construction, and each has been quite useful to me.  I am quite a fan.</li>
            <li> ALWAYS handy and nearby on my desk.  Terrific instrument.</li>
            <li> This is a must-have.   Worth the money in ways you could never conceive.   It will last you the rest of your life.</li>
            <li> This is a great item, but I still find myself using my fingernail sometimes instead of picking up this tool.  I&#x27;d think about if you need it before you purchase, but as usual Tweezerman is the best brand for nail care.</li>
            <li> i wanted a solid grooming tool that would be able to remove gunk under my fingernails and toenails between cuttings.  this tool fits the bill and does the job painlessly.  it feels solid in your hands and cleans effortlessly under hot water when you&#x27;re done.  the cuticle pusher also works well is versatile and can be used for other things.    bottom line, this is a great tool. i believe that you should maintain your nails using high quality grooming tools.  besides this, i recommend buying the seki nail cutter, seku toenail cutter, tweezerman porcelain nail file, tweezerman nail brush, and the tweezerman v-cuticle nipper. these items may cost more than stuff you would pick up at a drug store, but they will last forever if you treat them right.     hope this helps.</li>
            <li> These are great highly recommend!~Tweezerman Pushy and Nail Cleaner...works well and heavy duty like at a spa salon....I bought several one for myself and then for my  daughter.  Update I just put 2 more I love this product.</li>
            <li> Rusted after a few months in my dop kit.... They do indeed rust.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great little tool.  I get gel manicures and the flat side works really well for getting gel polish off, the other end is great for gentle cleaning.</li>
            <li> Pleased with this product!&lt;br /&gt;Exactly What I Wanted!!</li>
            <li> I bought Tweezerman&#x27;s nail cleaner at a store back in 2006 or so. I absolutely loved it and used it every day. Fast forward to 2009 when I lost it on a road trip. Calamity. I had to order another from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the old saying goes, &amp;#34;they don&#x27;t make &#x27;em like they used to.&amp;#34; The old model had a nice thin cleaning tip which could delicately get under the nail and scrape away every last bit of dirt in such a satisfying manner, I would pull it out and use it every hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new model has a big, fat cleaning tip with a rounded edge. It can&#x27;t get all the way under the nail and does a poor job of getting the dirt out due to the rounded edge. Unlike its ancestor, it sits in the bathroom drawer getting dust. I would love to have the old version back.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. Have ingrown toe nails. The tool is perfect for getting under the sides of the nail. Good quality product.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best tools to have as a nail technician.  You should have more than one.  I love using this item for effective manicures.</li>
            <li> This has two sides, a push side and a scraper/cleaner side. The push side is nothing special, as expected. It doesn&#x27;t need to do anything special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scraper side however it way too thick and bulky. It is hard to tell from the photo, but it isn&#x27;t flat on the back side. It is rounded and thick. In order to be able to scrape the corners of toe nails (or any other nails) it would have to be much thinner. I can&#x27;t think of a  good use for this scraper tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is another Tweezerman tool that I got now that works great. It has a flat thin side and a thin curved side.</li>
            <li> Solid, high quality product.</li>
            <li> The flat/sharpish edge isn&#x27;t a great design.</li>
            <li> best nail tool I ever bought,</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish was a little different on this product is, I wish the cleaning end was just a touch wider.  Other than that, I think it&#x27;s a great little product.</li>
            <li> Too small. Made for small hands. Tools ineffective. Returned item.</li>
            <li> I bought this tool to add to my manicure/pedicure kit.  It&#x27;s awesome quality and does a perfect job.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a sharp, well made product that does exactly what it is supposed to do. In my experiences, Tweezerman products are the best and worth looking for.</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of differnt cuticle pushers. I really like this one as it does not have any plastic or rubberized parts on it. Intially, I was buying ones with comfort grips but soon realized that when using nail polish remover or acetone that those products can react badly with fancy grips. This is clean and simple. Easy to sterilize in alcohol. It works very well and is my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; pushy when doing home manicures and shellac. I really love it. The only thing I would change is maybe a thinner edge for under nail cleaning.  Now, I have two in case I lose one. A must have for manicures.</li>
            <li> I hate the pushers where both ends are very rounded and have had a hard time finding a pusher with a square edge. The square edge makes it very easy to lift and push the cuticles for cutting. This is a heavy duty pusher which does a great job. The rounded end is tilted to clean under your nails and the squared end is perfect for cuticles. I am very happy with this!</li>
            <li> Seems to be holding up pretty well over the test of time.  Feels like its made out of a high quality steel.  Sharp.</li>
            <li> LOVE this tool.  It is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Using a good product really does make a difference.</li>
            <li> I am always going to buy Tweezerman tools. They are the best. This cleans under the nail without scraping or tearing skin.</li>
            <li> This cuticle pusher is sturdy and it works great, I use nail cleaner to take off excess nail residue that stays underneath nail bed after you file.</li>
            <li> This is not a complicated product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flat end is so squared off that it looks like a screwdriver, however, it works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I opened it, I was disappointed in how it looked, but I got used to it.  It has not shown any signs of corrosion after a few months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This totally works fine.</li>
            <li> This nail product seems to be high quality construction and it does the job quite well.  Recommend it.  However, that said real hang nails sometimes require professional Podiatrist treatment for a permanent fix.</li>
            <li> Works great, quality it really nice. Does the job!</li>
            <li> This is a specialized tool.  It is heavy duty, well designed and should last a lifetime.  The pusher is wide and has a good edge but is not sharp. The cleaner is fairly broad and not sharp so it does not have the utility of some other tools that might be able to fit into smaller spaces.</li>
            <li> I have tried several brands, and I think Tweezerman has the best design.  Worth what it cost.</li>
