            <li>I love this product... lathers nicely and smells great (almond), plus it doesn&#x27;t seem to leave a film on my body.  </li>
            <li>The scent ( almond) is so amazing that my shower time has doubled and I&#x27;ve never been cleaner.  </li>

            <li>Acure stands for clean products and safe body care which is all important.</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Really worth a try.</li>
            <li>I love the almond extract smell and the natural ingredients in this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad to have found something that isn&#x27;t riddled with chemicals, but also something that actually cleanses and moisturizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>is a pure product, well made and has no odor.</li>
            <li>too much product is coming out&amp;#34; problem with those.</li>

            <li>However, I don&#x27;t see a difference in my skin, but I have mature skin</li>
            <li>so what can I say only so much can be done.  </li>
            <li>I like it so far.</li>
            <li>Works well enough as a body wash (acne-prone back and shoulders) but the opening on the cap is very large for a fluid of this consistency.</li>
            <li>I love all the Acure products I have tried but this is hard to open.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and so I&#x27;m attempting to go organic as much as possible.  </li>

            <li> American Crew Tea Tree Body Wash. It did leave me feeling/looking clean - but would just get a little too dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like it washes any better or worse than other body washes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have to be very careful to tip it backwards as I open it and then tip it into my hand once it&#x27;s open.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews that said the same thing</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it for very long.</li>
            <li> but I have ordered a few shampoos and conditioners in similar containers</li>
            <li> Only thing, lid opens kinda hard.</li>
            <li> It washes off and doesnt leave a fragrance, something I am a little sad about.</li>
            <li> IF you ever wanted to wash up without harsh and dangerous chemicals use Acure.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Didnt like the weird smell like plastic.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this body wash!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works well enough as a body wash (acne-prone back and shoulders) but the opening on the cap is very large for a fluid of this consistency. Too much of the body wash comes out when I open it. I have to be very careful to tip it backwards as I open it and then tip it into my hand once it&#x27;s open. I wish I could just mindlessly open it and squirt a controlled amount out because I&#x27;m not always that alert and paying attention to detail when I&#x27;m trying to wash up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Acure shampoo and conditioner I have come in the same type of tube, but I think they&#x27;re both thicker because I don&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;way too much product is coming out&amp;#34; problem with those.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.  Love the product.  And it doesn&#x27;t make me itch after a shower.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this body wash! The scent ( almond) is so amazing that my shower time has doubled and I&#x27;ve never been cleaner.  It has zero chemicals, vegan, and doesnt leave a film on your body. It washes off and doesnt leave a fragrance, something I am a little sad about. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase.</li>
            <li> great smelling, not harsh, moisturizing</li>
            <li> Amazing - this was a surprise - how good it is....Really worth a try. Skin is Baby soft after one use. Acure stands for clean products and safe body care which is all important. Enjoy.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and it works nice, but I wish it came in a glass container.  I got this to lessen the chemical/toxin load on our family. I will be making my own soap when this runs out, but this was a great stepping stone.</li>
            <li> Refreshing tropical body wash</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and so I&#x27;m attempting to go organic as much as possible.  This has a great smell and feels very good when washing.  However, I don&#x27;t see a difference in my skin, but I have mature skin so what can I say only so much can be done.  LOL</li>
            <li> Does dry my skin out, but leaves it feeling clean - which is exactly what I needed. Prior to using this, I was washing with American Crew Tea Tree Body Wash. It did leave me feeling/looking clean - but would just get a little too dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this body wash is that there is a &#x27;matching&#x27; shampoo and conditioner, which I also ordered. Those are excellent, as well, and I&#x27;ve reviewed them also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be reordering these products again. I&#x27;m just glad to have found something that isn&#x27;t riddled with chemicals, but also something that actually cleanses and moisturizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Didnt like the weird smell like plastic.</li>
            <li> IF you ever wanted to wash up without harsh and dangerous chemicals use Acure.&lt;br /&gt;This is a pure product, well made and has no odor. And leaves no odor.&lt;br /&gt;You can ever wash your hair with it.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Love this body wash.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash.  It smells nice and makes your skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> I love the almond extract smell and the natural ingredients in this product.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this. It&#x27;s a really nice almond scent. I don&#x27;t feel like it washes any better or worse than other body washes I&#x27;ve used. Lathers well.</li>
            <li> The most delicious almond scent. I have super sensitive skin and this is so wonderful with my body. I&#x27;m a true believer of Acure organics!</li>
            <li> Wonderful body wash. Smells great and is non-drying!!!</li>
            <li> I love all the Acure products I have tried but this is hard to open.  I plan on transferring it to another container.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s fantastic.  I read other reviews that said the same thing but I have ordered a few shampoos and conditioners in similar containers so hoped it was a fluke.</li>
            <li> I like the feeling of it but not the smell…..</li>
            <li> Acure Organics Body Wash Stimulating Moroccan Argan Stem Cell + Argan Oil is very good. Only thing, lid opens kinda hard.</li>
            <li> I like it so far. Haven&#x27;t used it for very long.</li>
            <li> I love this product... lathers nicely and smells great (almond), plus it doesn&#x27;t seem to leave a film on my body.  However, I&#x27;ll continue to buy locally... I won&#x27;t pay this shipping from the supplier.</li>
            <li> I really love Acure Ogranics.  Most skin care products irritate my skin.  All my skin issues disappeared when I started using Acure.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves you with a fresh clean feeling</li>
