            <li>I like the Pencil liner better.</li>
            <li>This item is ok.</li>
            <li>But I love that there is a tool on each end, the line point and then the felt like tip.  </li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay for the price though.</li>
            <li>love this stuff will be ordering again and again and again</li>
            <li>I love it easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Flakes off really easily and the top (pencil eyeliner) doesn&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li>i jus got this today and its very cool.</li>
            <li>Great arived early not melted and in one peace.</li>
            <li>Did not like this eyeliner, wipes off easily or just fades off&lt;br /&gt;Would not purchase again</li>
            <li>Easy to wash off and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The texture of it is so creamy and easy to put on.</li>
            <li>Wow this is cheap but it&#x27;s very nice</li>
            <li>; fortunately it came off easily, which waterproof eyeliners shouldn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Packaging is fine, brush is fine also..</li>
            <li>It stays on fine but during the end of the day it&#x27;s all clumpy and crusted on.</li>
            <li>Super cute .</li>
            <li>Looks great but it definitely is NOT waterproof!</li>
            <li>You can get it at ultra, you&#x27;ll thank me later lol</li>
            <li>The regular eyeliner works great</li>
            <li>I was so happy to finally get it, then that happen.</li>
            <li>I felt that I would very much enjoy this purchase, but I have yet to receive it.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I was also happy with it being so jet black :)</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m pretty pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Well Worth It!</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 more after my first one..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I want &amp; love how it looks..</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for right?!</li>
            <li>just the right size and price!</li>
            <li>The best part is you do not have to rub so hard to take if off.</li>
            <li>I like so much that I reorder 10 more in case they get sold out.</li>
            <li>Not to mention the bottle is super cute..lol</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll more than likely order more of this product.</li>
            <li>i love it because it didnt cost much and its worth it</li>
            <li>Washes off easily with gentle soap and water.</li>
            <li>Liquid liner tip is so sharp good for clean lines.</li>
            <li>And casing sooooo pretty!</li>
            <li>Amazing product, I ordered one for myself let my mom use it in which she never gave it back</li>
            <li>But overall, especially with the cheap cost, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth buying</li>
            <li>Totally worth the 2.50.</li>
            <li>I Love this.... waterproof liquid eyeliner, however the pen that stick with the cup is not waterproof and very easy to make a mess on your face</li>
            <li>I even got my aunt and other friends ordering it because they loved the way it looked..</li>
            <li>this is very  cute, I really like the design on the outside</li>
            <li>and no I don&#x27;t have oily skin, the cheap wet &amp; wild liquid liner works much better than this!</li>
            <li>Although it did take a little long to come in the mail it is very useful and adorable!:)</li>
            <li>First of all it is not waterproof, I&#x27;ll put it on at 6 a.m., by my lunch time @ 11:00 it already ran and smudged no matter</li>
            <li>The product is really pretty .</li>
            <li>It came exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>Applicator Broke during first use.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like the picture</li>
            <li>Overall I love how intense the liquid liner is!</li>
            <li>The brush creates crisp lines and doesn&#x27;t fade.</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner last the whole day</li>
            <li>My new favorite eyeliner the brush doesn&#x27;t bend to smear and it goes on solid and not clumpy</li>
            <li>1 star only because it was cheap.  </li>
            <li>Works really well and came on time.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li>I like the liquid liner, but the brush on it really isn&#x27;t a brush.</li>
            <li>Too light going on and doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>So Much</li>
            <li>i would purchase again even though the delivery took quite a while and wasnt wrapped up very well</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I really like the product&#x27;</li>
            <li>, i don&#x27;t really care for the brush though.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.</li>
            <li>Perfect except the pencil liner isn&#x27;t as vibrant as the liquid, and for the liquid liner, the brush is a little stiff.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad that unlike some of the other eyeliners, you don&#x27;t have to reapply and reapply them for them to show.</li>
            <li>Greatest eyeliner doesnt look to Fake like liquid eye liner and will Not smudged like pencil liner..highly recommended !</li>
            <li>Nice rich dark black and</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It is super black and looks fresh all day.</li>
            <li>The eyeliner does not stay on thru a normal work day.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t come off easy but its not as dark as i would like.</li>
            <li>Although it takes a long time to get here its worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Its a little cheap</li>
            <li>It came today which is early because it was supposed to come February 18th .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nowhere near waterproof.</li>
            <li>The liquid eyeliner brush is harder than I expected but love it.</li>
            <li>You can get nice thin lines</li>
            <li>Sucks would not ever use if I got for free</li>
            <li>Not great but just ok.</li>
            <li>this is the first liner that doesn&#x27;t streak down my face.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good black eyeliner but the black pencil was always so chalky and hard to put on.</li>
            <li>Dries really quickly and is hard to get off after scrubbing for ten minutes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s past the maximum arrival date, and I&#x27;d very much like to receive it.</li>

            <li> just the right size and price!</li>
            <li> The best part is you do not have to rub so hard to take if off.</li>
            <li> I like so much that I reorder 10 more in case they get sold out.</li>
            <li> Not to mention the bottle is super cute..lol</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll more than likely order more of this product.</li>
            <li> i love it because it didnt cost much and its worth it</li>
            <li> Washes off easily with gentle soap and water.</li>
            <li> Liquid liner tip is so sharp good for clean lines.</li>
            <li> And casing sooooo pretty!</li>
            <li> Amazing product, I ordered one for myself let my mom use it in which she never gave it back</li>
            <li> But overall, especially with the cheap cost, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth buying</li>
            <li> Totally worth the 2.50.</li>
            <li> I Love this.... waterproof liquid eyeliner, however the pen that stick with the cup is not waterproof and very easy to make a mess on your face</li>
            <li> I even got my aunt and other friends ordering it because they loved the way it looked..</li>
            <li> this is very  cute, I really like the design on the outside</li>
            <li> and no I don&#x27;t have oily skin, the cheap wet &amp; wild liquid liner works much better than this!</li>
            <li> Although it did take a little long to come in the mail it is very useful and adorable!:)</li>
            <li> First of all it is not waterproof, I&#x27;ll put it on at 6 a.m., by my lunch time @ 11:00 it already ran and smudged no matter</li>
            <li> The product is really pretty .</li>
            <li> It came exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> Applicator Broke during first use.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly like the picture</li>
            <li> Overall I love how intense the liquid liner is!</li>
            <li> The brush creates crisp lines and doesn&#x27;t fade.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner last the whole day</li>
            <li> My new favorite eyeliner the brush doesn&#x27;t bend to smear and it goes on solid and not clumpy</li>
            <li> 1 star only because it was cheap.  </li>
            <li> Works really well and came on time.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li> I like the liquid liner, but the brush on it really isn&#x27;t a brush.</li>
            <li> Too light going on and doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> So Much</li>
            <li> i would purchase again even though the delivery took quite a while and wasnt wrapped up very well</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara.  </li>
            <li> I really like the product&#x27;</li>
            <li> , i don&#x27;t really care for the brush though.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.</li>
            <li> Perfect except the pencil liner isn&#x27;t as vibrant as the liquid, and for the liquid liner, the brush is a little stiff.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad that unlike some of the other eyeliners, you don&#x27;t have to reapply and reapply them for them to show.</li>
            <li> Greatest eyeliner doesnt look to Fake like liquid eye liner and will Not smudged like pencil liner..highly recommended !</li>
            <li> Nice rich dark black and</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is super black and looks fresh all day.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner does not stay on thru a normal work day.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t come off easy but its not as dark as i would like.</li>
            <li> Although it takes a long time to get here its worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Its a little cheap</li>
            <li> It came today which is early because it was supposed to come February 18th .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nowhere near waterproof.</li>
            <li> The liquid eyeliner brush is harder than I expected but love it.</li>
            <li> You can get nice thin lines</li>
            <li> Sucks would not ever use if I got for free</li>
            <li> Not great but just ok.</li>
            <li> this is the first liner that doesn&#x27;t streak down my face.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good black eyeliner but the black pencil was always so chalky and hard to put on.</li>
            <li> Dries really quickly and is hard to get off after scrubbing for ten minutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s past the maximum arrival date, and I&#x27;d very much like to receive it.</li>
            <li> I have used other brands such as loreal that claim they are waterproof and it comes right off with a little bit of water or just throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It is stiff and doesn&#x27;t bend much.</li>
            <li> If you wantsomething that will stay on and is not a dull grayish black try nyx liquid liner</li>
            <li> Secondly, the liquid liner sucks, it seems to be opaque even with applying the pencil first</li>
            <li> It last a long time but starts to peel after a while of wearing it.</li>
            <li> best eyeliner ive used in long time that isnt so expensive you are afraid to use it</li>
            <li> Prettier in real life then in the picture, it&#x27;s very dark, would deffinetly buy again!!</li>
            <li> I was previously a fan of the felt tip liquid eyeliner, but not only does this one work the same, but it has the stick eyeliner, is fashionable and cheaper!</li>
            <li> was using the dry one and the lead fell out of it</li>
            <li> what was expected :) the only thing is that when i got it, the eye liner was already loose when i got it :(</li>
            <li> It took so long that I forgot I had ordered it!!!</li>
            <li> Its not really waterproof</li>
            <li> Arrived alot sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> This came before the expected arrival date, and I have to say</li>
            <li> but I expected it.</li>
            <li> and it came sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li> Not very permanent, though.</li>
            <li> Stays on all day, dark, no faded.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an average product.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> As soon as water hit it started running down my face didn&#x27;t expect to look like a raccoon</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t even use it for fear it was used previously.</li>
            <li> Just shipping takes a little bit.</li>
            <li> The liquid is a little runny but with patients and practice you will get it</li>
            <li> I order a few in advance because shipping takes a while</li>
            <li> i finally received the item, and wound up the eye liner it was broken.</li>
            <li> The felt tip on the liquid part is stiff and gives a lot of cocntrol.</li>
            <li> It also smells like it could get a desperate man 2 things, high, and provide fuel to his vehicle.</li>
            <li> The actual case &amp; liner were broken!</li>
            <li> Not pleased with the eye pencil that comes with it, though.</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied.</li>
            <li> The tip is hard to work with for me because its stiff &amp; im not used to it.</li>
            <li> Shipping is very very slow.</li>
            <li> pencil eyeliner was broken, does not stay in lid.</li>
            <li> Arrived broken, took months to arrive.</li>
            <li> i would recomend this for a beginner but it came broken</li>
            <li> applicator was broken.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY, WASTE OF MONEY!!!!</li>
            <li> Either way i like it as a base for my everyday liner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s poor quality!</li>
            <li> Worst eyeliner i have ever worn and not only that it stinks!</li>
            <li> Came broken!!</li>
            <li> and i stinked really bad</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even get a chance to use...very disappointed.</li>
            <li> what base I use under, I&#x27;ve worn it at pool once</li>
            <li> Lastly, it seriously took 6 weeks to arrive!!!!</li>
            <li> Worst liquid liner ever!</li>
            <li> This product is horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love it easy to use.  Lasts all day. I will order again..</li>
            <li> loved it. especially for the price. it lasts a good amount of time and i love the eyeliner in the lid.</li>
            <li> Came broken!! The actual case &amp; liner were broken! Didn&#x27;t even get a chance to use...very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Its not really waterproof</li>
            <li> 1 star only because it was cheap.  You get what you pay for.  The idea is great BUT I would not reorder this again.  First of all it is not waterproof, I&#x27;ll put it on at 6 a.m., by my lunch time @ 11:00 it already ran and smudged no matter what base I use under, I&#x27;ve worn it at pool once and I did get &amp;#34;raccoon eyed&amp;#34; fortunately it came off easily, which waterproof eyeliners shouldn&#x27;t.  Secondly, the liquid liner sucks, it seems to be opaque even with applying the pencil first and no I don&#x27;t have oily skin, the cheap wet &amp; wild liquid liner works much better than this! Lastly, it seriously took 6 weeks to arrive!!!! It took so long that I forgot I had ordered it!!!</li>
            <li> Love that it has the liquid and non liquid in one!</li>
            <li> This really is the best stuff for the price! It stays on all day until I wash it off. Washes off easily with gentle soap and water. I order a few in advance because shipping takes a while but it&#x27;s so worth it. Buy it! It&#x27;s awesome! I also use the fiber lash mascara made by this company and love that too!</li>
            <li> Works really well and came on time.</li>
            <li> The product is really pretty . I haven&#x27;t used it yet but i&#x27;m sure it works. It came today which is early because it was supposed to come February 18th .</li>
            <li> Very good make-up product. wears well and last. Not to mention the bottle is super cute..lol</li>
            <li> Sucks would not ever use if I got for free</li>
            <li> kinda need alot of coats to get desired look, i will try younqiue and see if theres a differnece but  for the price i love it</li>
            <li> I love it. Nice rich dark black and the felt tip is awesome. You can get nice thin lines</li>
            <li> Arrived alot sooner than expected. Packaging is fine, brush is fine also.. No complaints! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner combo. I&#x27;ll more than likely order more of this product.</li>
            <li> Great product-especially for the price. I only need to apply this once and it stays on.</li>
            <li> Good liquid  eyeline.. the pencil  not to good</li>
            <li> This came before the expected arrival date, and I have to say, I&#x27;m pretty pleased with it. It came exactly as pictured. The felt tip on the liquid part is stiff and gives a lot of cocntrol.</li>
            <li> My product arrived open I won&#x27;t even use it for fear it was used previously.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner! I was previously a fan of the felt tip liquid eyeliner, but not only does this one work the same, but it has the stick eyeliner, is fashionable and cheaper! I love it.</li>
            <li> bought this without reading the reviews but i had no idea that it was two different eyeliners. The tip is hard to work with for me because its stiff &amp; im not used to it. Doesn&#x27;t come off easy but its not as dark as i would like. I dont use pencil so i haven&#x27;t used the pencil. Either way i like it as a base for my everyday liner. it looks better.</li>
            <li> Product works well ! And casing sooooo pretty! Prettiest mascara i own.</li>
            <li> Love this product a lot.</li>
            <li> This and the mascara cause irritation to my eyes and cause them get matted.  I purchased several tubes of the mascara but threw them all away.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is great! Especially for how inexpensive it is.</li>
            <li> like the product but didn&#x27;t last , product broke</li>
            <li> The liquid is more runny then I was expecting</li>
            <li> best eyeliner ive used in long time that isnt so expensive you are afraid to use it lol.&lt;br /&gt;will deffinatly buy this product again fro this seller</li>
            <li> this is very  cute, I really like the design on the outside and it does works as a regular eyeliner. I like the  fact that it has a liquid eyeliner and a kind of pencil  too.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.  I like having the choice between pencil or liquid.  I think i like the liquid more it doesn&#x27;t fade.</li>
            <li> I like the liquid liner, but the brush on it really isn&#x27;t a brush. It is stiff and doesn&#x27;t bend much. Dries really quickly and is hard to get off after scrubbing for ten minutes. Not pleased with the eye pencil that comes with it, though. Too light going on and doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I have gotten many compliments on this eyeliner when I wear it. It is super black and looks fresh all day.</li>
            <li> IT IS NOT WATERPROOF!!!  IT STARTS FLAKING OFF AS SOON AS IT DRIES!!!  DO NOT BUY, WASTE OF MONEY!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this item!! Works very good and is waterproof for sure. The best part is you do not have to rub so hard to take if off.</li>
            <li> Great arived early not melted and in one peace.I would most deffinetly recomend to any one.I love it a lot.</li>
            <li> I Love This Product. I Love It So Much I Bout Six More Just So I Wont Run Out!! Well Worth It!</li>
            <li> Love this product goes on easily and stays on all day! Will order again, great price for the quality of this product!</li>
            <li> pencil eyeliner was broken, does not stay in lid.</li>
            <li> the eyeliner itself is good, but the bottle is VERY cheap and flimsy! i like having both products in one though. i would purchase again even though the delivery took quite a while and wasnt wrapped up very well</li>
            <li> I love felt tip eyeliners. This one was great! It last a long time but starts to peel after a while of wearing it.</li>
            <li> Applicator Broke during first use. Had to glue it together . The eyeliner does not stay on thru a normal work day. Not at all happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I Love this.... waterproof liquid eyeliner, however the pen that stick with the cup is not waterproof and very easy to make a mess on your face</li>
            <li> Inexpensive product, great value!</li>
            <li> I like so much that I reorder 10 more in case they get sold out.</li>
            <li> As soon as water hit it started running down my face didn&#x27;t expect to look like a raccoon</li>
            <li> Love this. Didn&#x27;t find out untold way after I had been using it that there was liquid and pencil, so now it&#x27;s twice as good! I was kind of sketchy about buying makeup off amazon but it&#x27;s good quality and it works as good as the pro stuff</li>
            <li> Amazing product, I ordered one for myself let my mom use it in which she never gave it back so I ended up buying another. I love it and will be getting more soon as Christmas gifts for all my sisters.</li>
            <li> This has to be made of the shadiest ingredients known on earth. It gave my eye a stye like immediately after wearing it. It also smells like it could get a desperate man 2 things, high, and provide fuel to his vehicle. Jesus take the wheel. Do not purchase this.</li>
            <li> Did not like this eyeliner, wipes off easily or just fades off&lt;br /&gt;Would not purchase again</li>
            <li> This was so wonderful :)</li>
            <li> Prettier in real life then in the picture, it&#x27;s very dark, would deffinetly buy again!!</li>
            <li> Arrived broken, took months to arrive. When I opend the  liner, it smelled so rotten I had to toss it.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner!!! I ordered 2 more after my first one..I even got my aunt and other friends ordering it because they loved the way it looked.. FYI it takes about 1month to come in so order an extra one..</li>
            <li> smears and doesn&#x27;t last. liquid liner peels off</li>
            <li> Looks great but it definitely is NOT waterproof!</li>
            <li> Amazing! I love it it&#x27;s worth buying</li>
            <li> Wife loved it and will buy more of this</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful! Totally worth the 2.50. I have used other brands such as loreal that claim they are waterproof and it comes right off with a little bit of water or just throughout the day. with this eyeliner, it lasted all day without having to reapply or without it bleeding and having to wipe under your eyes. I was also happy with it being so jet black :)</li>
            <li> My new favorite eyeliner the brush doesn&#x27;t bend to smear and it goes on solid and not clumpy I am ordering 3 more .</li>
            <li> Stays on all day, dark, no faded. The liquid part does not run. However, the pencil does. Easy to wash off and easy to apply. I am giving 4 stars because of packaging. Only in envelope and I guess to shipping, the handle was cracked when I received. But I will be ordering more. Shipping is very very slow. Order 2 or whatever to have back up.</li>
            <li> i like that it was sent to me earlier then what was expected :) the only thing is that when i got it, the eye liner was already loose when i got it :(</li>
            <li> This is not water proof</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara.  It took a while to get here but I expected it. Its a little cheap so I wouldn&#x27;t wear it all day and expect it to look great all day. I will order again.</li>
            <li> i would recomend this for a beginner but it came broken and i stinked really bad and so i wouldnt recommend this for profesionals in my opinion</li>
            <li> Worst liquid liner ever! It&#x27;s nowhere near waterproof. It&#x27;s poor quality! I used it once and threw it away. You get what you pay for right?! If you wantsomething that will stay on and is not a dull grayish black try nyx liquid liner it&#x27;s only $6! You can get it at ultra, you&#x27;ll thank me later lol</li>
            <li> I change from  4 to 5 now that I have used it a while. My eyes tear all the time. this is the first liner that doesn&#x27;t streak down my face. I love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an average product.</li>
            <li> It stays on fine but during the end of the day it&#x27;s all clumpy and crusted on.</li>
            <li> I never got to use it because when I got it the eyeliner was busted.</li>
            <li> Liquid eyeliner is my favorite so I had to buy it. It looks exactly like the picture and it came sooner than I expected. The liquid eyeliner brush is harder than I expected but love it. The regular eyeliner works great, well they both do and I&#x27;m glad that unlike some of the other eyeliners, you don&#x27;t have to reapply and reapply them for them to show.</li>
            <li> Perfect except the pencil liner isn&#x27;t as vibrant as the liquid, and for the liquid liner, the brush is a little stiff. Overall I love how intense the liquid liner is!</li>
            <li> applicator was broken. eyeliner is not pigmented enough</li>
            <li> Not worth the price. And mine showed up exploded..</li>
            <li> Awesome eyeliner! I love how it includes both a pencil eyeliner and a liquid. Perfect! Not very permanent, though. You may have to re-apply once throughout the day. But overall, especially with the cheap cost, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Took forever but I&#x27;ve found myself using it daily. I really like the product&#x27;</li>
            <li> I like the Pencil liner better. The texture of it is so creamy and easy to put on. I was looking for a good black eyeliner but the black pencil was always so chalky and hard to put on. Now i have a great pencil eyeliner! The liquid eyeliner is alright, i don&#x27;t really care for the brush though.</li>
            <li> This item is ok. Not great but just ok.</li>
            <li> Took forever to arrive.when i finally received the item, and wound up the eye liner it was broken. So upsetting! I was so happy to finally get it, then that happen. Will not buy again. The price was too good to be true! Fiber lash mascara isn&#x27;t good either.</li>
            <li> Super cute . Loved the two eyeliners in one option. Liquid liner tip is so sharp good for clean lines. I ordered 3 more immediately !</li>
            <li> Arrived on time but applicator broke after 3 uses</li>
            <li> I received my item today and to be honest I like it</li>
            <li> i jus got this today and its very cool. i love it because it didnt cost much and its worth it</li>
            <li> I felt that I would very much enjoy this purchase, but I have yet to receive it. It&#x27;s past the maximum arrival date, and I&#x27;d very much like to receive it.</li>
            <li> Wow this is cheap but it&#x27;s very nice</li>
            <li> I received it faster than the estimate date. It&#x27;s exactly what I want &amp; love how it looks.. I wish I could post a pic of how it looks on me lol :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my 1st try with eye liner so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to. But I love that there is a tool on each end, the line point and then the felt like tip.  Everything looks ok thank you</li>
            <li> I love it. It doesn&#x27;t smudge or run. Good price. Although it takes a long time to get here its worth the wait.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible. Worst eyeliner i have ever worn and not only that it stinks!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.... Just shipping takes a little bit.</li>
            <li> So far so good. The brush creates crisp lines and doesn&#x27;t fade. Although it did take a little long to come in the mail it is very useful and adorable!:)</li>
            <li> Flakes off really easily and the top (pencil eyeliner) doesn&#x27;t stay on. It&#x27;s okay for the price though.</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied. It is not waterproof as they indicated.</li>
            <li> Works nice,  has both types of eye liner. This is a nice versatile make up that gives you two options.</li>
            <li> Loved this eyeliner so much I ordered two more!! One of the best products I&#x27;ve used. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> really nice having the combo liner with pencil! cute packaging! just the right size and price!</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner last the whole day</li>
            <li> love this stuff will be ordering again and again and again</li>
            <li> Best eyeliner I have ever purchased. Very pleased with shipping, arrival, and product.</li>
            <li> Greatest eyeliner doesnt look to Fake like liquid eye liner and will Not smudged like pencil liner..highly recommended !</li>
            <li> For the price I like it, convenient for travel all in one liquid and glide on eye liner. The liquid is a little runny but with patients and practice you will get it</li>
            <li> I loved it until it fell apart. It has 2 Eye liners in it.&lt;br /&gt;I was using the dry one and the lead fell out of it&lt;br /&gt;and would not go back in it. It&#x27;s of no use now.</li>
