            <li>this mascara is great</li>

            <li>This goes on very nicely and is not clumpy at all.</li>
            <li>This mascara is amazing!</li>
            <li>Great product, good price.</li>
            <li>This was okay, and the price was very good</li>
            <li>The brush does a good job separating, lengthening, and adding volume (after two coats).</li>

            <li>A good deal for the money.</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s definitely worth a try if your in the market for awesome lashes without the pesky flaking!.....note to user, twirl the wand as your applying.</li>
            <li>Great price my favorite mascara</li>
            <li>Great lash coverage, great color, lasts all day long - give great lash length!!</li>

            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>stuff is amazing</li>
            <li>The brush is amazing.</li>
            <li>but this stuff is truly amazing.</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely and stays on all day.  </li>
            <li>good though :)</li>
            <li>This one is the absolute best.  </li>
            <li>it dries its nice and doen&#x27;t flake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>Works great but nothing special.</li>
            <li>This mascara is pretty good when trying to curve your eye lashes!</li>
            <li>I guess the wand is a matter of preference as I read many reviews where people liked it</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about it is the brush.</li>
            <li>The wand and brush is flimsy so make sure to remove any excess mascara into the the tube before applying otherwise</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.</li>
            <li>Love love love this mascara.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara and applicator in a while.</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Not going to be my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I will try to use this more often.</li>
            <li>Better than Cover Girl and Loreal products, and I am happier than I was when I went out and bought Lancome for $25.</li>
            <li>It is mostly a trial by error procedure to find the one that works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I have had many people ask what mascara I use, and I am glad to share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What I really love about rimmel mascara is that it doesn&#x27;t run at all.</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li>Love this for bottom lashes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good</li>
            <li>Just perfect, long, separated lashes.  </li>
            <li>I try new mascara about every 3 weeks, always on the search for one that is great for my needs.</li>
            <li>Too easily.  </li>
            <li>At first I really liked this mascara.</li>
            <li>I only have to work it onto my lashes and voila curled, beautiful, defined lashes.</li>
            <li>This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve used hands down</li>
            <li>The mascara is fine</li>
            <li>This mascara is my absolute favorite!  </li>
            <li>Brush seems flimsy, but it works--applies smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li>It has a rubber applicator that has some bend, which I now enjoy.</li>
            <li>so its clump free.</li>
            <li>It takes me a good 3 or 4 washes with hand soap or 2-3 applications of professional makeup remover.</li>
            <li>love the brush on this mascara - it holds just the right amount of product and the mascara</li>
            <li>Perfect for those little bottom lashes!</li>
            <li>I hope that they never discontinue this item because it is in my own personal bag of favorite things.</li>
            <li>Better for extension, not so much for a fuller/thicker appearance.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t clump like all my others and I really like the cute design of the package.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara, it does an amazing job for my eyes when it comes to making my eye lashes long!</li>
            <li>color is dark, looks great &amp; does not clump.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is one of those great finds because of the high quality of the product, but a low out-of-pocket cost.</li>
            <li>When you apply, it is very goopy and clumps easily.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin/allergies and have been able to use Rimmel with no irritation.  </li>
            <li>Arrived perfectly and earlier than expected!</li>
            <li>right out of the tube it is.  </li>
            <li>My usual mascara was discontinued, and this is a great replacement.</li>
            <li>I love the applicator, but the product does seem to get a bit flakey later in the day.&lt;br /&gt;looks</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>First I don&#x27;t think there is one catch all mascara for everyone.</li>
            <li>Really lengthening and no clumps!</li>
            <li>Fantastic product,  makes my skimpy lashes look long and full.  </li>
            <li>good cheap mascara, makes my lashes long and dark</li>
            <li>well, so it allows me to control exactly how much mascara I want on any given day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The extension on the lashes is nice with little clumping.</li>
            <li>Very chic.</li>
            <li>Really separates the lashes and lengthens too.</li>
            <li>The flexible plastic bristles on the brush are wide and help separate lashes better than many other mascaras I have tried.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on why it goes on so much more evenly than all other drug store mascaras (including those that call themselves clump busters)</li>
            <li>This is a nice, dark mascara, coats completely, but is not thick and clumpy, as some mascaras are.</li>
            <li>This is hands down my favorite &amp;#34;drug store&amp;#34; mascara</li>
            <li>To get the most out of the mascara, rotate the brush as you apply so that as you sweep your lashes, the short and the long bristles take turns making contact.  </li>
            <li>I usually put on 2 coats for full effect, I don&#x27;t know of any mascara where one quick coat works anyway</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do much for my lashes in general, I mainly use it for</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona, so</li>
            <li>The bristles never bend like other brands so, so you can get a lot more use out of it than traditional mascaras.</li>
            <li>And i have stick straight asian lashes btw.</li>
            <li>soft of lashes</li>
            <li>Wow ive never had a mascara that works</li>
            <li>They key to making it work is to take ones time and really coat your lashes by coming it in and lengthening your lashes with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is better than Stiletto, Covergirl Flamed Up and a few others that i have tried recently;</li>
            <li>It really lengthens and defines and makes my lashes look long and neat.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s so thick, it&#x27;s really easy to get it elsewhere than on your eyelashes</li>
            <li>I think this type of brush just needs some practice so that it doesn&#x27;t clump, but i would highly recommend it if you are trying to find one to make your eye lashes long.</li>
            <li>This brand doesn&#x27;t generally produce quality products.&lt;br /&gt;Avoid.&lt;br /&gt;T</li>
            <li>Makes my lashes long and lush without clumping.  </li>
            <li>I was not at all happy with this mascara, it made my lashes crazy clumpy and it tended to flake off during the day leaving black all under my eye.</li>
            <li>dramatic color, easy to apply</li>

            <li> I was not at all happy with this mascara, it made my lashes crazy clumpy and it tended to flake off during the day leaving black all under my eye.</li>
            <li> dramatic color, easy to apply</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t see the results try rotating/twirling the brush while applying so that the short and long bristles alternate on the lashes.</li>
            <li> The wand has short and long \\&quot;bristles\\&quot; on opposite sides.  </li>
            <li> It is a little on the too thick side, tends to clump more than others I&#x27;ve used, and my least favorite thing about it is that it is VERY hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> It is also lasting much longer than others, but i think that is largely due to the fact that it wasn&#x27;t dried out at delivery.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get clumping, but it takes a long time to dry.</li>
            <li> (the only problem is it&#x27;s becoming nearly impossible to find in drug stores...)</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> At first I really liked this mascara. My favorite thing about it is the brush. The brush does a good job separating, lengthening, and adding volume (after two coats). However the mascara itself could use some improvement. It is a little on the too thick side, tends to clump more than others I&#x27;ve used, and my least favorite thing about it is that it is VERY hard to wash off. It takes me a good 3 or 4 washes with hand soap or 2-3 applications of professional makeup remover. This could be a pro for some people, but not for me.</li>
            <li> Brush seems flimsy, but it works--applies smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li> This mascara is my absolute favorite!  It is almost impossible to find in the area where I live so I was extremely happy to find it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the brush on this mascara - it holds just the right amount of product and the mascara actually makes my puny little eyelashes pop and look fuller and longer.</li>
            <li> 3.5 stars:  The wand and brush is flimsy so make sure to remove any excess mascara into the the tube before applying otherwise it gets all over the place.  The extension on the lashes is nice with little clumping. If you don&#x27;t see the results try rotating/twirling the brush while applying so that the short and long bristles alternate on the lashes. Some flaking at times. Better for extension, not so much for a fuller/thicker appearance.</li>
            <li> This has to be the best mascara I have ever used! It seperates each lash, and last all day! I get complements on my lashes all the time....it&#x27;s definitely worth a try if your in the market for awesome lashes without the pesky flaking!.....note to user, twirl the wand as your applying. It catches every angle.</li>
            <li> dramatic color, easy to apply</li>
            <li> Clumps.  Flakes.  Too easily.  I do the &amp;#34;warm-your-mascara&amp;#34; trick and it isn&#x27;t so clumpy, but right out of the tube it is.  And ether way, it flakes.  But it does lengthen.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. It only needs to be applied once &amp; causes no irritation or stinging like some do.&lt;br /&gt;The color is dark, looks great &amp; does not clump.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good but I&#x27;m still looking....</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t flake and looks gorgeous!</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with Rimmel mascara.  I have sensitive skin/allergies and have been able to use Rimmel with no irritation.  It goes on nicely and stays on all day.  The tube seems to last quite awhile and I use the product daily.</li>
            <li> This mascara is pretty good when trying to curve your eye lashes! I love the brush! It really is a good mascara!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product,  makes my skimpy lashes look long and full.  Great transaction too.</li>
            <li> I love the applicator, but the product does seem to get a bit flakey later in the day.&lt;br /&gt;looks good though :)</li>
            <li> Formula does not lengthen lashes.</li>
            <li> I was not at all happy with this mascara, it made my lashes crazy clumpy and it tended to flake off during the day leaving black all under my eye. Worst mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. It doesn&#x27;t flake, it stays on all day with no raccoon eyes and it doesn&#x27;t take a chisel to remove it!</li>
            <li> Love love love this mascara. I have always have a hard time putting mascara on my lower lashes but this mascara does the trick. I dont even have to wipe off excess when using it. I only have to work it onto my lashes and voila curled, beautiful, defined lashes. And i have stick straight asian lashes btw.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, dark mascara, coats completely, but is not thick and clumpy, as some mascaras are. I&#x27;ll definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara and applicator in a while. It is better than Stiletto, Covergirl Flamed Up and a few others that i have tried recently; all of which I bought on Amazon, and all of which seemed to be delivered in an already drying state. I live in Arizona, so I don&#x27;t know at what point this happens en route, but with this one, there was no drying at all. It has a rubber applicator that has some bend, which I now enjoy. I think this will be my go to mascara. It is also lasting much longer than others, but i think that is largely due to the fact that it wasn&#x27;t dried out at delivery. I was losing hope on buying mascara from Amazon, but it has now been restored.</li>
            <li> This mascara is the best. I hope that they never discontinue this item because it is in my own personal bag of favorite things.</li>
            <li> Perfect! This mascara gives the IDEAL look and shape for my lashes, just wish it were hypoallergenic!!! : (( no hypoallergenic ones like this. For using mascara everyday i need hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> great mascara for the price</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara.  soft of lashes so they don&#x27;t break off.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do much for my lashes in general, I mainly use it for my bottom lashes cause I like the brush.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! The flexible plastic bristles on the brush are wide and help separate lashes better than many other mascaras I have tried. The bristles never bend like other brands so, so you can get a lot more use out of it than traditional mascaras. This is one of those great finds because of the high quality of the product, but a low out-of-pocket cost. I don&#x27;t use any other mascara!</li>
            <li> Great lash coverage, great color, lasts all day long - give great lash length!!</li>
            <li> Love this. My usual mascara was discontinued, and this is a great replacement. Twist the brush as you apply.</li>
            <li> Wow ive never had a mascara that works sooooo well!&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve used hands down &amp; I worked at a cosmetic counter in a retail store for years. Separates &amp; lengthens, I get compliments all the time, I even had the eye doctor ask if I get artificial lashes put on because they looked so nice. I usually put on 2 coats for full effect, I don&#x27;t know of any mascara where one quick coat works anyway</li>
            <li> good cheap mascara, makes my lashes long and dark</li>
            <li> Not going to be my favorite.  Wand causes clumping and then the clumps fall off the lashes. Won&#x27;t buy again. Color was good however.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have tried several different brands and kept coming back to this!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all. Lancôme, Dior, Revlon, etc. This one is the absolute best.  You don&#x27;t even need to curl your lashes. Just apply to the tips first and then sweep from base to end. No flaking, no raccoon eyes. Just perfect, long, separated lashes.  I&#x27;ll never buy another brand of mascara again.</li>
            <li> Love it. Great product, good price.</li>
            <li> The price is unbeatable. I was very happy with the product. I will try to use this more often. Thanks!</li>
            <li> AWESOME.......AWESOME PRODUCT....RIMMEL ROCKS !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great price my favorite mascara</li>
            <li> this mascara is great it doesn&#x27;t clump like all my others and I really like the cute design of the package. Very chic.</li>
            <li> Perfect for those little bottom lashes!</li>
            <li> Definitely not the worst mascara I have ever used. A good deal for the money. Better than Cover Girl and Loreal products, and I am happier than I was when I went out and bought Lancome for $25. I don&#x27;t get clumping, but it takes a long time to dry. My biggest complaint is that it flakes quite a bit. After a few hours, I glance in the mirror and I have black specks all over. I like the brush and I plan to save it after I use of the product. I might buy again, but I am still looking for the</li>
            <li> I finally found an inexpensive mascara that&#x27;s not clumpy!  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> This goes on very nicely and is not clumpy at all.</li>
            <li> Arrived perfectly and earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> I try new mascara about every 3 weeks, always on the search for one that is great for my needs. This was okay, and the price was very good ( I usually pay from $7 to $9 for drugstore brands) but I didn&#x27;t experience anything really great about it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t remember how I started using this mascara, but so grateful that I found it. First I don&#x27;t think there is one catch all mascara for everyone. It is mostly a trial by error procedure to find the one that works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me this just works.  The brush that it uses is key. It really lengthens and defines and makes my lashes look long and neat. I have had many people ask what mascara I use, and I am glad to share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the brush helps comb out and disperse product evenly so its clump free. They key to making it work is to take ones time and really coat your lashes by coming it in and lengthening your lashes with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once it dries its nice and doen&#x27;t flake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff</li>
            <li> What I really love about rimmel mascara is that it doesn&#x27;t run at all. It flakes if you rub your eyes a lot but otherwise you don&#x27;t have to worry about smearing mascara everywhere.</li>
            <li> This mascara is amazing! The mascara brush is perfect and goes on each lash so there are NO clumps.</li>
            <li> It separates my lashes making them look fake. The brush is amazing. Will defiantly re-order !</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, it does an amazing job for my eyes when it comes to making my eye lashes long! However in my opinion it did clump a little bit, but not a lot that it looked bad. I think this type of brush just needs some practice so that it doesn&#x27;t clump, but i would highly recommend it if you are trying to find one to make your eye lashes long.</li>
            <li> Rimmel Glam&#x27; Eyes Mascara ...the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;couldn&#x27;t believe when I saw it on subscribe and save...walgreens&lt;br /&gt;was always out of stock.</li>
            <li> Works great but nothing special.</li>
            <li> Great mascara!  Really separates the lashes and lengthens too.</li>
            <li> Disappointed....should have known.  This brand doesn&#x27;t generally produce quality products.&lt;br /&gt;Avoid.&lt;br /&gt;T</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara.  Makes my lashes long and lush without clumping.  Best brush.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Love this for bottom lashes</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s a mascara and it works, but I won&#x27;t buy this again. I bought it for the price and I don&#x27;t hate it so much that I&#x27;ll return it or never use it again. When you apply, it is very goopy and clumps easily. Because it&#x27;s so thick, it&#x27;s really easy to get it elsewhere than on your eyelashes and it&#x27;s very very dark so it ends up being a mess. Won&#x27;t buy again, but I will use it up since I can wipe the brush off before applying and de-clump with another mascara that I like... I hope.</li>
            <li> what?  There&#x27;s no application wand, no way to apply the mascara.</li>
            <li> Best mascara ever.  Really lengthening and no clumps! Has the best brush.</li>
            <li> This is hands down my favorite &amp;#34;drug store&amp;#34; mascara (the only problem is it&#x27;s becoming nearly impossible to find in drug stores...) I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on why it goes on so much more evenly than all other drug store mascaras (including those that call themselves clump busters) but this stuff is truly amazing. It goes on thinly but also layers well, so it allows me to control exactly how much mascara I want on any given day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hoping this stuff never goes out of stock!!</li>
            <li> The mascara is fine but I do not like the applicator wand.  I guess the wand is a matter of preference as I read many reviews where people liked it but it is certainly not for me.  I will not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> I read all the comments and no one seems to understand how to use the wand.  The wand has short and long \\&quot;bristles\\&quot; on opposite sides.  To get the most out of the mascara, rotate the brush as you apply so that as you sweep your lashes, the short and the long bristles take turns making contact.  This thickens, separates, and lengthens.</li>
