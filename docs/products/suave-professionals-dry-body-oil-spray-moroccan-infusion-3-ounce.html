    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This has to be massage into the skin for best results.</li>
            <li>so I thought it would be perfect for me.</li>
            <li>The smell is delightful and I always get compliments by my husband after it&#x27;s applied.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, the directions/description – the ones that I remember reading – state that it is “best” for</li>
            <li>The spray Moroccan oil is the best!</li>
            <li>Great for summer!</li>
            <li>is a perfect after-shower oil.</li>
            <li>idea, but not the greatest execution.</li>
            <li>this makes your skin feel &amp; look so good!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy and a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It is an oil, so if you are not a fan of oils you might not be happy with it.</li>
            <li>I thought this was a hair product, and guess what it works great as a hair product...</li>
            <li>but it just isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li>; I think it&#x27;s a glow that looks great when accent by skirts and dresses.</li>
            <li>Great fragrance, and not oily.  </li>
            <li>On the body, this is a great product though.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff!!  </li>
            <li>I often buy more &#x27;high-end&#x27; body products, but this body oil is excellent.</li>
            <li>It smells great and feels good on skin.</li>
            <li>This is so awesome, I love this stuff it works immediately</li>
            <li>I used to use, but not as pleasant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing without being too greasy &amp; smells pleasant.  </li>
            <li>While the scent is pleasant, it does not smell like Moroccanoil.</li>
            <li>Suave makes quality products for a fair price and this is one of them.</li>
            <li>Maybe, if I could get it at a really good price, but I will have to check around to see if my concoction could be made cheaper.</li>
            <li>Works just as good as the $20 variety for me.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the scent and find it very pleasant.</li>
            <li>The scent of this body oil spray is just beautiful and rather exotic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After having tried the Infusion for over a month, I&#x27;m very satisfied with its ability to moisturize my skin</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>a try!ou&#x27;ll enjoy it because it works; it&#x27;s lasts; it&#x27;s easy to use; and it smells wonderful, but the smell is not overpowering at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using the aerosol spray version of this body oil and loving it.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product.</li>
            <li>The transparent bottle this product comes in is nice because I can see how soon I&#x27;d be needing to pick up another.</li>
            <li>but I really have to admit that this product makes a wonderful hair product.</li>
            <li>I especially love the speed at which I can moisturize my whole body with spray-on oil.</li>
            <li>Lastly,it has a light pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>The oil comes out in a stream, not a mist, so it&#x27;s best to apply to your palms and then spread it rather than directly to your legs or arms or wherever else you intend to use it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While it&#x27;s not made for this purpose, I often use it as a type of perfume and spray it on my wrists and neck for a light, pleasant, exotic</li>
            <li>It is absorbs quickly and does a good job moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the smell of Suave&#x27;s Moroccan Infusion line.</li>
            <li>but it you get it on the clothes you&#x27;re wearing that day, you might not be able to get it out by cleaning it by hand.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s the exotic scent that does it, but</li>
            <li>This spray body oil has a lovely scent.</li>
            <li>I suppose that&#x27;s not the most glowing review ever</li>
            <li>I prefer using this oil on damp skin as it seems to absorb better.</li>
            <li>Nice light oil spray.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, the oil absorbs rapidly and doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe I might try it for its intended use but for now I love it for my hair.</li>
            <li>I works better for me to spray the oil into my palm, since I&#x27;m going to have to wash my hands after using this anyway, and spread the oil where I want</li>
            <li>I also wanted to be able to show off some color when the weather gets 30 F</li>
            <li>I sure didn&#x27;t notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I sure didn&#x27;t notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice lightly scented, does not overpower perfume.</li>
            <li>Suave Moroccan oil smells really nice and sprays a light oil mist, but costs quite a bit more than the JR Watkins-which is why I took off one star.</li>
            <li>I should have paid more attention to the ingredients before ordering.</li>
            <li>Although they haven&#x27;t been manufactured for many years, there used to be a product called Sardoettes.</li>
            <li>product worked best for me when used in the same manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Moisturizes well but could absorb better.</li>
            <li>I got this hoping it would have the same awesome fragrance as the Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion shampoo, conditioner, and hair styling oil.  </li>
            <li>Which is okay, since I prefer to dispense into my hand and then apply to my legs and arms</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s more fragrance than argan oil in this oil spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s just okay.  </li>
            <li>but then I love the way it makes my legs feel.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this oil on my feet, elbows and cuticles.  </li>
            <li>that I was reading another reviewer&#x27;s comment about the oil going on warm rather than cool like most creams.</li>
            <li>This product reminds me of my Neutrogena Sesame Oil, which I have loved and used for years,  The dry body oil spray is good for when I am on my way out the door and just want to give a nice sheen to my arms and legs.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also found it excellent for use in foot massages after long days of standing.</li>
            <li>Suave Professionals Dry Body Oil is a wonderful multi-use spray oil.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell, it&#x27;s a clean sort of warm scent that is pleasant and not heavy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up mixing it up with some other lotion I had and this was the perfect solution.</li>
            <li>However, this is easy to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do have to thank them for giving the bottle a shape with a “waist” so that it is easily held with slippery hands.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very quick and easy to spray this on and rub it in after a shower.</li>
            <li>The oil does not pent rate my skin easily and leaves a greasy film on my skin.</li>
            <li>That said, it is a strong, musky smell that not everyone will enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a very nice body oil with a lovely scent.</li>
            <li>- it allows you to apply more evenly without getting your hands full of it.  </li>
            <li>just fine</li>
            <li>Instead of a fine stream, you sometimes get a clump.  </li>
            <li>The oil is a bit thicker than some kind of pure oil, and, for me, it leaves my skin feeling refreshed &amp; hydrated but not overly oily, or that feeling  of “oily” like some pure/natural oils can leave (if over-applied).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It sprays on and then you smooth it on with your hands.  </li>
            <li>whatever the reason, I enjoy the feeling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The spray head on this bottle has more of a direct shot than a spray liked</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>oh well), so, I HIGHLY recommend exercising great caution when trying to apply and either slowly &amp; gently press on the “spray head”</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a nice benefit in the winter when most people need extra</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It has been great for my poor winter skin, it goes on clean, absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue and smells good.</li>
            <li>But if you like oils and/or are open to another type of product to relieve dry skin, then I think you&#x27;ll enjoy it because it works; it&#x27;s lasts; it&#x27;s easy to use; and it smells wonderful, but the smell is not overpowering at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the look of it on bare legs instead of a more ashy lotion.</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad and it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>Super value for the price.  </li>
            <li>It does absorb quickly.</li>
            <li>It soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my arms and legs feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The suave spray oil with Moroccan oil infusion is adequate.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and moisturizes well.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t feel at all greasy.  </li>
            <li>Certainly a dry skin oil that is pleasant to use.</li>
            <li>And the spray bottle makes it quick and easy to apply over large areas of my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Suave makes some excellent products and offers them at a lower price than other brands.</li>
            <li>The scent is not unpleasant but I wish it were unscented so it wouldn&#x27;t clash with my perfume.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still satisfied with the Infusion as it was super easy to use (spray, apply, rub, repeat) and, as advertised, left no streaks or indication that I&#x27;m using product on my face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still satisfied with the Infusion as it was super easy to use (spray, apply, rub, repeat) and, as advertised, left no streaks or indication that I&#x27;m using product on my face.  </li>
            <li>Good for winter dry skin</li>
            <li>If that is not true, I&#x27;d be happy to know</li>
            <li>I then add my body lotion on top and rub it all in and my legs feel so hydrated and soft!  </li>
            <li>It has a light scent and sprays on nicely and, in this very dry winter weather, absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>From the start, I liked the design of the bottle; it curves in at the center of the bottle, which makes it easy to grasp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the light scent and the quick absorbing quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He and I tend to be quite sensitive to many smells and fragrances causing adverse allergic reactions than often start with sneezing fits but have had zero issues with this</li>
            <li>I wouldn’t promote/advertise, but if someone was set on purchasing a body oil [spray…..or no spray] or some kind of product similar to this one, I’d support the purchase and use of this one.ct out there on the market.</li>
            <li>I wouldn’t promote/advertise, but if someone was set on purchasing a body oil [spray…..or no spray] or some kind of product similar to this one, I’d support the purchase and use of this one.</li>
            <li>The scent was kind of off, and the oil had no lasting quality for</li>
            <li>My skin was also significantly softer and more hydrated after several days of using this product.</li>
            <li>It absorbs pretty quickly</li>
            <li>So I bought some of this and put it on right after my shower while my legs are still damp.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a slight scent to the oil, and I find it rather pleasant.</li>
            <li>I know this is probably mind over matter, but I feel a little more confident when I use this spray.</li>
            <li>This dry body oil is really nice.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I like this product and am happy to have found it and will definitely keep using it on my legs.</li>
            <li>, I suggest you take an extra moment to make sure you&#x27;ve got the right bottle in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s funny</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I used this, I applied it to just one leg and did a side-by-side comparison.</li>
            <li>The spray bottle works pretty well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more white than a Trent Lott Christmas party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After reading the ingredients (the first being mineral oil) I have to wonder if I could create a comparable mixture with a trip to the drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Apparently my skin is a whole lot drier than that of those reviewers, because my skin just drinks this stuff in and asks for more.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience using any type of body oil spray, so I had no expectations going in.</li>
            <li>First ingredient in the list is mineral oil...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a variety of lotion products and have found several I like, but I was interested to try an oil spray and see if it would work any better.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for heavy duty moisture like this, then that&#x27;s a good thing.  </li>
            <li>It is a fair price if you like the scent of it and need the heavy, oily moisture that this provides.</li>
            <li>And it does a great job moisturizing my dry skin, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li>love the idea of this dry oil spray, but the execution wasn&#x27;t what I had hoped for.</li>
            <li>Once again, as with the other products in the Suave Professionals line, the first thing I noticed is the intoxicating, exotic smell.</li>
            <li>The main thing I have learned to do is to spray both of my legs first, THEN rub my legs.</li>
            <li>Shine without weight and if you only use a little great moisturizer without a creasy feel.</li>
            <li>The aerosol spray goes on light and absorbs almost instantly with zero greasy feel after.</li>
            <li>You can apply it much faster than a cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>highly recommend you give this product a try!</li>
            <li>I found this to work very well.</li>
            <li>I find rubbing the oil in helps it to absorb into my skin much quicker.</li>
            <li>I really like is the fact this hydrates my skin and the silkiness that follows after it being applied.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very anti-humidity.</li>
            <li>I bought this without really reading the bottle all the way.</li>
            <li>tried using this exclusively on my skin and even with a light misting, I did feel like it left a residue.</li>
            <li>We denizens of this frozen land stay indoors most of the time with the occasional sprint to our vehicles and rare masochistic display of craziness by ice fishing and snowmobiling in weather that would REALLY make southern states panic.  </li>
            <li>and I felt comfortable enough to wear shorts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a real difference in color as I&#x27;m still whiter than Vanilla Ice in Ninja Turtles 2.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do much of anything to help with dryness on my arms.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re rushing to get ready at 5am</li>
            <li>My four year old son likes it too and requested me to apply it (unusual!).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These are the actual ingredients taken from the label, with my explanation in parentheses:  mineral oil, dicaprylyl ether (moisturizer from coconut or palm kernel oil), fragrance, argania spinosa kernel (argan) oil, hydrogenated coconut oil, prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond)</li>
            <li>I would prefer that it not have any added fragrance and rely only on the coconut, argan, and sweet almond oils for scent.</li>
            <li>I have fairly dry itchy skin especially in the winter and this light Suave Professionals Dry Body Oil Spray, Moroccan Infusion, sprays on nicely hydrates and brightens my skin.</li>
            <li>Living in North Dakota for over seven years I&#x27;ve seen my fair share of harsh, long, and very dry winters that seem to go for most of the year (no joke).  </li>
            <li>The spray mechanism  also was not to my liking, delivering a concentrated stream of product rather than a more diffuse one, causing me to have to stop and rub it in so oil was not running down my arms and legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got the moisturizing I needed with more penetration and less &amp;#34;oil slick&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I would recommend the Infusion to anyone living in the oil winter wonder land or has chronic dry skin as it eliminated my skin irritation allowing me to, comfortably, write reviews for you and insert Twilight references because I felt like it.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and left my skin moist.  </li>
            <li>Some absorbs quickly, but hours later I can touch my arm</li>
            <li>highly recommend you give this product</li>
            <li>The scent is NOT strong or overpowering, however, for someone who is more sensitive to ANY kind of smell [such as my mum], then I’d exercise caution when using this by either putting it on some time before you are around someone as such [if you are aware of someone being this sensitive] or simply not put much on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was concerned about how well this oil would be absorbed because I had seen some reviews saying it left skin oily.</li>
            <li>Feels like silk on the skin, quickly absorbed and deep hydrating.</li>
            <li>You only need a little but keep a towel handy so the oil does not get on everything.</li>
            <li>I live in the desert, so keeping my skin moisturized is a necessity unless I want to look like an alligator.</li>
            <li>So, I’m always looking for new products to keep my skin moist and add a bit of variety to my routine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes a few minutes for my skin to fully absorb the oil, but once it does, it leaves my skin feeling really soft for many hours.</li>
            <li>A little squirt of this oil rubbed into my hands helps keep the dryness from becoming uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny because I was thinking the same thing.</li>
            <li>This spray absorbs quickly and leaves my dry skin feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of lotions and while I love oils they can end up too heavy if you are not careful.</li>
            <li>Not only did the oil help my leg feel less dry, but my legs looked like they belonged on two different bodies, so great was the difference.</li>
            <li>I found very quickly that this was less of a mist and more of a puddle when I sprayed it out, so I simply adapted and squeezed a few pumps into the palm of my hand, then rubbed it into my skin.</li>
            <li>Much less expensive than salon brands, and this is awesome!  </li>
            <li>I would recommend the Infusion to anyone living in the oil winter wonder land or has chronic dry skin as it eliminated my skin irritation allowing me to, comfortably, write reviews for you and insert Twilight references because I felt like it.e from my daily tasks at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The spray helps you use just the right amount and the moroccan helps keep my dry skin hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>I originally started using it for winter dry skin, but discovered it works wonders on the reddish skin on my upper arms</li>
            <li>/&gt;MY spouse has a sensitive nose and didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>The first ingredient in this product is mineral oil, and I wonder if that accounts in part for the strange smell.</li>
            <li>though it is in oil form, it is not a heavy moisturizer.</li>
            <li>reason I&#x27;m only giving this 4 stars is that it doesn&#x27;t work very well on my face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s decently priced considering how a little goes pretty far!</li>
            <li>I expected this body oil spray to be about as effective as any lotion that I&#x27;ve used in the past, and it is.</li>
            <li>To me, that is a major plus!  </li>
            <li>This dry oil spray is very moisturizing and made my skin glow, though.</li>
            <li>I really tried different ways of using the oil by itself but inevitably I felt oily.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m just too far gone to be saved by anything but direct sunlight or that I&#x27;m distantly related to the Cullen family?  </li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m just too far gone to be saved by anything but direct sunlight or that I&#x27;m distantly related to the Cullen family?  </li>
            <li>results of the next 30 consecutive days were consistent as the Infusion helped keep my face moisturized and not feel like sandpaper or something really, REALLY dry.  </li>
            <li>(if you spray directly onto legs you&#x27;re likely to end up with some on the floor, which makes it slippery).  </li>
            <li>Anyway, it&#x27;s not potent enough to keep me from using the oil, but it would be nice if they could tone down the scent.</li>
            <li>Watch, too, that you don&#x27;t create a slippery mess on your floors, as this absorbs directly into the skin, but not so much tile flooring.</li>
            <li>I really like this oily and compared to other</li>
            <li>I do have naturally dry skin, even though I currently live in a humid, rainy</li>
            <li>far, I’ve tended to simply apply to my arms (forearm, elbow, upper arm, some of the shoulder, and the calf – knee area(s).</li>
            <li>This is not a dry body oil at all.  </li>
            <li>I cook a lot, which means I wash a lot of dishes in hot water, and my hands get dried out repeatedly throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I live in the desert and have problems during the summer and middle of winter with extremely dry skin.  </li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> This has to be massage into the skin for best results.</li>
            <li> so I thought it would be perfect for me.</li>
            <li> The smell is delightful and I always get compliments by my husband after it&#x27;s applied.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, the directions/description – the ones that I remember reading – state that it is “best” for</li>
            <li> The spray Moroccan oil is the best!</li>
            <li> Great for summer!</li>
            <li> is a perfect after-shower oil.</li>
            <li> idea, but not the greatest execution.</li>
            <li> this makes your skin feel &amp; look so good!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy and a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It is an oil, so if you are not a fan of oils you might not be happy with it.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a hair product, and guess what it works great as a hair product...</li>
            <li> but it just isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li> ; I think it&#x27;s a glow that looks great when accent by skirts and dresses.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance, and not oily.  </li>
            <li> On the body, this is a great product though.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff!!  </li>
            <li> I often buy more &#x27;high-end&#x27; body products, but this body oil is excellent.</li>
            <li> It smells great and feels good on skin.</li>
            <li> This is so awesome, I love this stuff it works immediately</li>
            <li> I used to use, but not as pleasant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing without being too greasy &amp; smells pleasant.  </li>
            <li> While the scent is pleasant, it does not smell like Moroccanoil.</li>
            <li> Suave makes quality products for a fair price and this is one of them.</li>
            <li> Maybe, if I could get it at a really good price, but I will have to check around to see if my concoction could be made cheaper.</li>
            <li> Works just as good as the $20 variety for me.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the scent and find it very pleasant.</li>
            <li> The scent of this body oil spray is just beautiful and rather exotic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After having tried the Infusion for over a month, I&#x27;m very satisfied with its ability to moisturize my skin</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> a try!ou&#x27;ll enjoy it because it works; it&#x27;s lasts; it&#x27;s easy to use; and it smells wonderful, but the smell is not overpowering at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using the aerosol spray version of this body oil and loving it.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product.</li>
            <li> The transparent bottle this product comes in is nice because I can see how soon I&#x27;d be needing to pick up another.</li>
            <li> but I really have to admit that this product makes a wonderful hair product.</li>
            <li> I especially love the speed at which I can moisturize my whole body with spray-on oil.</li>
            <li> Lastly,it has a light pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> The oil comes out in a stream, not a mist, so it&#x27;s best to apply to your palms and then spread it rather than directly to your legs or arms or wherever else you intend to use it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While it&#x27;s not made for this purpose, I often use it as a type of perfume and spray it on my wrists and neck for a light, pleasant, exotic</li>
            <li> It is absorbs quickly and does a good job moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Suave&#x27;s Moroccan Infusion line.</li>
            <li> but it you get it on the clothes you&#x27;re wearing that day, you might not be able to get it out by cleaning it by hand.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s the exotic scent that does it, but</li>
            <li> This spray body oil has a lovely scent.</li>
            <li> I suppose that&#x27;s not the most glowing review ever</li>
            <li> I prefer using this oil on damp skin as it seems to absorb better.</li>
            <li> Nice light oil spray.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more, the oil absorbs rapidly and doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe I might try it for its intended use but for now I love it for my hair.</li>
            <li> I works better for me to spray the oil into my palm, since I&#x27;m going to have to wash my hands after using this anyway, and spread the oil where I want</li>
            <li> I also wanted to be able to show off some color when the weather gets 30 F</li>
            <li> I sure didn&#x27;t notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I sure didn&#x27;t notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice lightly scented, does not overpower perfume.</li>
            <li> Suave Moroccan oil smells really nice and sprays a light oil mist, but costs quite a bit more than the JR Watkins-which is why I took off one star.</li>
            <li> I should have paid more attention to the ingredients before ordering.</li>
            <li> Although they haven&#x27;t been manufactured for many years, there used to be a product called Sardoettes.</li>
            <li> product worked best for me when used in the same manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Moisturizes well but could absorb better.</li>
            <li> I got this hoping it would have the same awesome fragrance as the Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion shampoo, conditioner, and hair styling oil.  </li>
            <li> Which is okay, since I prefer to dispense into my hand and then apply to my legs and arms</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s more fragrance than argan oil in this oil spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s just okay.  </li>
            <li> but then I love the way it makes my legs feel.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this oil on my feet, elbows and cuticles.  </li>
            <li> that I was reading another reviewer&#x27;s comment about the oil going on warm rather than cool like most creams.</li>
            <li> This product reminds me of my Neutrogena Sesame Oil, which I have loved and used for years,  The dry body oil spray is good for when I am on my way out the door and just want to give a nice sheen to my arms and legs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found it excellent for use in foot massages after long days of standing.</li>
            <li> Suave Professionals Dry Body Oil is a wonderful multi-use spray oil.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell, it&#x27;s a clean sort of warm scent that is pleasant and not heavy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up mixing it up with some other lotion I had and this was the perfect solution.</li>
            <li> However, this is easy to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do have to thank them for giving the bottle a shape with a “waist” so that it is easily held with slippery hands.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very quick and easy to spray this on and rub it in after a shower.</li>
            <li> The oil does not pent rate my skin easily and leaves a greasy film on my skin.</li>
            <li> That said, it is a strong, musky smell that not everyone will enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a very nice body oil with a lovely scent.</li>
            <li> - it allows you to apply more evenly without getting your hands full of it.  </li>
            <li> just fine</li>
            <li> Instead of a fine stream, you sometimes get a clump.  </li>
            <li> The oil is a bit thicker than some kind of pure oil, and, for me, it leaves my skin feeling refreshed &amp; hydrated but not overly oily, or that feeling  of “oily” like some pure/natural oils can leave (if over-applied).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It sprays on and then you smooth it on with your hands.  </li>
            <li> whatever the reason, I enjoy the feeling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The spray head on this bottle has more of a direct shot than a spray liked</li>
            <li> So far so good</li>
            <li> oh well), so, I HIGHLY recommend exercising great caution when trying to apply and either slowly &amp; gently press on the “spray head”</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a nice benefit in the winter when most people need extra</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It has been great for my poor winter skin, it goes on clean, absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue and smells good.</li>
            <li> But if you like oils and/or are open to another type of product to relieve dry skin, then I think you&#x27;ll enjoy it because it works; it&#x27;s lasts; it&#x27;s easy to use; and it smells wonderful, but the smell is not overpowering at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the look of it on bare legs instead of a more ashy lotion.</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad and it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> Super value for the price.  </li>
            <li> It does absorb quickly.</li>
            <li> It soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my arms and legs feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The suave spray oil with Moroccan oil infusion is adequate.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and moisturizes well.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t feel at all greasy.  </li>
            <li> Certainly a dry skin oil that is pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> And the spray bottle makes it quick and easy to apply over large areas of my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Suave makes some excellent products and offers them at a lower price than other brands.</li>
            <li> The scent is not unpleasant but I wish it were unscented so it wouldn&#x27;t clash with my perfume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still satisfied with the Infusion as it was super easy to use (spray, apply, rub, repeat) and, as advertised, left no streaks or indication that I&#x27;m using product on my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still satisfied with the Infusion as it was super easy to use (spray, apply, rub, repeat) and, as advertised, left no streaks or indication that I&#x27;m using product on my face.  </li>
            <li> Good for winter dry skin</li>
            <li> If that is not true, I&#x27;d be happy to know</li>
            <li> I then add my body lotion on top and rub it all in and my legs feel so hydrated and soft!  </li>
            <li> It has a light scent and sprays on nicely and, in this very dry winter weather, absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> From the start, I liked the design of the bottle; it curves in at the center of the bottle, which makes it easy to grasp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the light scent and the quick absorbing quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He and I tend to be quite sensitive to many smells and fragrances causing adverse allergic reactions than often start with sneezing fits but have had zero issues with this</li>
            <li> I wouldn’t promote/advertise, but if someone was set on purchasing a body oil [spray…..or no spray] or some kind of product similar to this one, I’d support the purchase and use of this one.ct out there on the market.</li>
            <li> I wouldn’t promote/advertise, but if someone was set on purchasing a body oil [spray…..or no spray] or some kind of product similar to this one, I’d support the purchase and use of this one.</li>
            <li> The scent was kind of off, and the oil had no lasting quality for</li>
            <li> My skin was also significantly softer and more hydrated after several days of using this product.</li>
            <li> It absorbs pretty quickly</li>
            <li> So I bought some of this and put it on right after my shower while my legs are still damp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a slight scent to the oil, and I find it rather pleasant.</li>
            <li> I know this is probably mind over matter, but I feel a little more confident when I use this spray.</li>
            <li> This dry body oil is really nice.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I like this product and am happy to have found it and will definitely keep using it on my legs.</li>
            <li> , I suggest you take an extra moment to make sure you&#x27;ve got the right bottle in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s funny</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I used this, I applied it to just one leg and did a side-by-side comparison.</li>
            <li> The spray bottle works pretty well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more white than a Trent Lott Christmas party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reading the ingredients (the first being mineral oil) I have to wonder if I could create a comparable mixture with a trip to the drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Apparently my skin is a whole lot drier than that of those reviewers, because my skin just drinks this stuff in and asks for more.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience using any type of body oil spray, so I had no expectations going in.</li>
            <li> First ingredient in the list is mineral oil...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a variety of lotion products and have found several I like, but I was interested to try an oil spray and see if it would work any better.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for heavy duty moisture like this, then that&#x27;s a good thing.  </li>
            <li> It is a fair price if you like the scent of it and need the heavy, oily moisture that this provides.</li>
            <li> And it does a great job moisturizing my dry skin, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> love the idea of this dry oil spray, but the execution wasn&#x27;t what I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> Once again, as with the other products in the Suave Professionals line, the first thing I noticed is the intoxicating, exotic smell.</li>
            <li> The main thing I have learned to do is to spray both of my legs first, THEN rub my legs.</li>
            <li> Shine without weight and if you only use a little great moisturizer without a creasy feel.</li>
            <li> The aerosol spray goes on light and absorbs almost instantly with zero greasy feel after.</li>
            <li> You can apply it much faster than a cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> highly recommend you give this product a try!</li>
            <li> I found this to work very well.</li>
            <li> I find rubbing the oil in helps it to absorb into my skin much quicker.</li>
            <li> I really like is the fact this hydrates my skin and the silkiness that follows after it being applied.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very anti-humidity.</li>
            <li> I bought this without really reading the bottle all the way.</li>
            <li> tried using this exclusively on my skin and even with a light misting, I did feel like it left a residue.</li>
            <li> We denizens of this frozen land stay indoors most of the time with the occasional sprint to our vehicles and rare masochistic display of craziness by ice fishing and snowmobiling in weather that would REALLY make southern states panic.  </li>
            <li> and I felt comfortable enough to wear shorts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a real difference in color as I&#x27;m still whiter than Vanilla Ice in Ninja Turtles 2.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do much of anything to help with dryness on my arms.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re rushing to get ready at 5am</li>
            <li> My four year old son likes it too and requested me to apply it (unusual!).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These are the actual ingredients taken from the label, with my explanation in parentheses:  mineral oil, dicaprylyl ether (moisturizer from coconut or palm kernel oil), fragrance, argania spinosa kernel (argan) oil, hydrogenated coconut oil, prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond)</li>
            <li> I would prefer that it not have any added fragrance and rely only on the coconut, argan, and sweet almond oils for scent.</li>
            <li> I have fairly dry itchy skin especially in the winter and this light Suave Professionals Dry Body Oil Spray, Moroccan Infusion, sprays on nicely hydrates and brightens my skin.</li>
            <li> Living in North Dakota for over seven years I&#x27;ve seen my fair share of harsh, long, and very dry winters that seem to go for most of the year (no joke).  </li>
            <li> The spray mechanism  also was not to my liking, delivering a concentrated stream of product rather than a more diffuse one, causing me to have to stop and rub it in so oil was not running down my arms and legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got the moisturizing I needed with more penetration and less &amp;#34;oil slick&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I would recommend the Infusion to anyone living in the oil winter wonder land or has chronic dry skin as it eliminated my skin irritation allowing me to, comfortably, write reviews for you and insert Twilight references because I felt like it.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and left my skin moist.  </li>
            <li> Some absorbs quickly, but hours later I can touch my arm</li>
            <li> highly recommend you give this product</li>
            <li> The scent is NOT strong or overpowering, however, for someone who is more sensitive to ANY kind of smell [such as my mum], then I’d exercise caution when using this by either putting it on some time before you are around someone as such [if you are aware of someone being this sensitive] or simply not put much on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was concerned about how well this oil would be absorbed because I had seen some reviews saying it left skin oily.</li>
            <li> Feels like silk on the skin, quickly absorbed and deep hydrating.</li>
            <li> You only need a little but keep a towel handy so the oil does not get on everything.</li>
            <li> I live in the desert, so keeping my skin moisturized is a necessity unless I want to look like an alligator.</li>
            <li> So, I’m always looking for new products to keep my skin moist and add a bit of variety to my routine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes a few minutes for my skin to fully absorb the oil, but once it does, it leaves my skin feeling really soft for many hours.</li>
            <li> A little squirt of this oil rubbed into my hands helps keep the dryness from becoming uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny because I was thinking the same thing.</li>
            <li> This spray absorbs quickly and leaves my dry skin feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of lotions and while I love oils they can end up too heavy if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> Not only did the oil help my leg feel less dry, but my legs looked like they belonged on two different bodies, so great was the difference.</li>
            <li> I found very quickly that this was less of a mist and more of a puddle when I sprayed it out, so I simply adapted and squeezed a few pumps into the palm of my hand, then rubbed it into my skin.</li>
            <li> Much less expensive than salon brands, and this is awesome!  </li>
            <li> I would recommend the Infusion to anyone living in the oil winter wonder land or has chronic dry skin as it eliminated my skin irritation allowing me to, comfortably, write reviews for you and insert Twilight references because I felt like it.e from my daily tasks at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The spray helps you use just the right amount and the moroccan helps keep my dry skin hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> I originally started using it for winter dry skin, but discovered it works wonders on the reddish skin on my upper arms</li>
            <li> /&gt;MY spouse has a sensitive nose and didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> The first ingredient in this product is mineral oil, and I wonder if that accounts in part for the strange smell.</li>
            <li> though it is in oil form, it is not a heavy moisturizer.</li>
            <li> reason I&#x27;m only giving this 4 stars is that it doesn&#x27;t work very well on my face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decently priced considering how a little goes pretty far!</li>
            <li> I expected this body oil spray to be about as effective as any lotion that I&#x27;ve used in the past, and it is.</li>
            <li> To me, that is a major plus!  </li>
            <li> This dry oil spray is very moisturizing and made my skin glow, though.</li>
            <li> I really tried different ways of using the oil by itself but inevitably I felt oily.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just too far gone to be saved by anything but direct sunlight or that I&#x27;m distantly related to the Cullen family?  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just too far gone to be saved by anything but direct sunlight or that I&#x27;m distantly related to the Cullen family?  </li>
            <li> results of the next 30 consecutive days were consistent as the Infusion helped keep my face moisturized and not feel like sandpaper or something really, REALLY dry.  </li>
            <li> (if you spray directly onto legs you&#x27;re likely to end up with some on the floor, which makes it slippery).  </li>
            <li> Anyway, it&#x27;s not potent enough to keep me from using the oil, but it would be nice if they could tone down the scent.</li>
            <li> Watch, too, that you don&#x27;t create a slippery mess on your floors, as this absorbs directly into the skin, but not so much tile flooring.</li>
            <li> I really like this oily and compared to other</li>
            <li> I do have naturally dry skin, even though I currently live in a humid, rainy</li>
            <li> far, I’ve tended to simply apply to my arms (forearm, elbow, upper arm, some of the shoulder, and the calf – knee area(s).</li>
            <li> This is not a dry body oil at all.  </li>
            <li> I cook a lot, which means I wash a lot of dishes in hot water, and my hands get dried out repeatedly throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I live in the desert and have problems during the summer and middle of winter with extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I did not find this to be any better or worse than any other spray oil I have used.  </li>
            <li> As far as the results go, I think both body lotion and this oil spray offer the same degree of relief; however, I think it takes a lot less of this spray to achieve that result.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though the bottle says “unscented” – my guess meaning there is on perfume-y added scent such as you might find at Victoria’s Secret or Bath &amp; Body Works – but there is a mild “scent” of the oil [mixture] itself.</li>
            <li> and it also last a long time no need to reapply.</li>
            <li> It does linger but doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t leave me looking or feeling greasy after application which usually last all day long.</li>
            <li> The only reason it&#x27;s not 5 stars is that the sprayer is a little erratic, so I have to spray some into my hands and rub it onto my skin, instead of spraying the product directly on the skin and then smoothing it in.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a major issue for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not major but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not major but</li>
            <li> The picture of the product and the product name are the same as mine, but the ingredient list is nothing close to the ingredients listed on my bottle of dry body oil spray.  </li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s information about the Suave Moroccan Infusion Dry Body Oil is incorrect at this time;  the product information is for a self-tanner from the same brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m guessing that Moroccan Oil is more luxurious and expensive than other body oils,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s minor</li>
            <li> thing you will want to be careful of when using this body spray is any potential splash.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I would totally recommend it!</li>
            <li> know some reviewers said it was oily but that is in fact what it is -- a dry body oil spray.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> I have curly -tendancy to be dry- hair.  </li>
            <li> And because it&#x27;s an oil, it lasted all day, eliminating the itching and irritation that often goes with dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Skin feels softer, and any dry patches are temporarily soothed.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Lotions temporarily solve the dry skin issue without any side effects, but this product seems to plug up my pores.  </li>
            <li> but it comes out as a single stream.  </li>
            <li> I usually apply directly after a shower.</li>
            <li> The Suave is not worth double the price for me.</li>
            <li> As such, I usually get really dry skin that turns a shade of white that is colloquially known as &amp;</li>
            <li> I wouldn’t rave about it, but I honestly don’t have anything negative to say, nothing to an extreme or overly bothersome or distasteful.</li>

            <li> The Moroccan Infusion Suave Professionals Dry Body Oil Spray has done wonders in re-hydrating my skin!</li>
            <li> The bottle unfortunately looks exactly like the Suave Moroccan Infusion hair styling oil&#x27;s bottle, and they&#x27;re even the same size bottle.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> love it my dry skin so bad after shower spray it thx deb</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and you only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> The scent was not too bad, but it could of been better.</li>
            <li> At least once a day I applied a simple spray to my hands and rubbed it in my face where I really get dryness from constant exposure to the cold elements of ND and only reapplied when necessary, which only happened a few times.  </li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> While you can rub it in, it never really works out evenly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;HOWEVER, there was no real discernible difference in skin color at any time while using the Infusion.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;HOWEVER, there was no real discernible difference in skin color at any time while using the Infusion.  </li>
            <li> for the bottle, the spray isn&#x27;t like a mist or a wide pattern spray, it comes out like a stream.  </li>
            <li> I wish it would spray out in a wide mist</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way when it comes to the body spray.</li>
            <li> it is made of a variety of oils and other ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products that have argon oil properties</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve been adding this to some of my lotions and cream.&lt;br /&gt;Since adding it to my other lotions</li>
            <li> the oil did absorb in quickly due to the dryness of my skin so perhaps that is the reason I did not glow.  </li>
            <li> slight scent does not bother me, and though the “spray” is more like a jet of oil (there really is not a “spray” feature to it, which, I’m disappointed, but</li>
            <li> my opinion, this is overpriced baby oil and not worth getting again.</li>
            <li> I like it, my only complaint is the way it comes out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The most annoying feature of the product was the bottle itself.</li>
            <li> I found that very little tends to go quite a long way too!</li>
            <li> The Infusion made all the difference in the world in terms of helping my dry skin and, believe me, it was irritating to the point where it began to distract me from my daily tasks at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a moderate but lasting fragrance that is a generic floral scent over a base of coconut oil, reminiscent of sunning oil and the beach.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your skin slightly moisturized but not greasy.</li>
            <li> did find there was a slight chemical under-current to the fragrance that takes away from the effect.  </li>
            <li> given the chance to try out the Suave Moroccan Infusion spray, I was all over it and anxiously awaited trying something other than other garden variety moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> This oil isn&#x27;t bad, but nothing special.</li>
            <li> I like to mix mine with a little lotion</li>
            <li> The only “negative aspect/feature is the disappointing lack of a “spray,” but I can live without that…it really isn’t too inconvenient.</li>
            <li> The only “negative aspect/feature is the disappointing lack of a “spray,” but I can live without that…it really isn’t too inconvenient.</li>
            <li> It sort of spurts out and making some spots heavily coated and some not at all.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to waste the bottle</li>
            <li> Heavily scented, but it dissipates and mellows to a noticeable but understated fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s oily and heavy.  </li>
            <li> It takes a few minuets for it to all soak in</li>
            <li> Like using it on  my split ends after towel dried hair and then again after I&#x27;m done straightening my  hair.</li>
            <li> I thought naively if I just used a little in my hair it would work.</li>
            <li> and it stays sticky, slick and greasy for hours after application.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I found it to be too greasy and left oily splotches on my work and yoga clothes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> bottle with a one-finger pump that dispenses a small drop.  </li>
            <li> usually use J.R. Watkins Grapefruit Body oil Mist.</li>
            <li> agree with some of the other reviews, I&#x27;m not a big fan of the scent but its not offensive or unpleasant.</li>
            <li> #34;Norwegian white,&amp;#34; or VERY pale.  </li>
            <li> and it still appears to hardly have been used.</li>
            <li> so I found it hard to keep it aimed properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I end up scratching so hard, that my legs hurt.  </li>
            <li> At least it has been for me.</li>
            <li> The oil is sort of thick, so it doesn&#x27;t spray out into an even coat on your skin.</li>
            <li> I found the design to be a bit awkward to hold with wet hands, and a rather small.</li>
            <li> I have chronically dry skin which is exacerbated by cold weather.</li>
            <li> Living in a cold climate dry skin is one of those things that happens every winter.</li>
            <li> I like the Suave shampoo and hair mask from the same line, but this item really disappointed me.</li>
            <li> after you get out of the shower (I understand the principle behind that), but for me, the first/one time I tried it, I just felt…</li>
            <li> This year has been particularly bad with sustained negative temperatures made worse with even harsher wind chills.  </li>
            <li> And then it&#x27;s on your palms, where it doesn&#x27;t soak into the skin well and it difficult to wash off, leaving your hands feeling greasy even though the rest of your body isn&#x27;t (from the absorption).</li>
            <li> I was horribly wrong and had greasy, stringy hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stink, but it smells weird.</li>
            <li> I found this rather mediocre.</li>
            <li> I have dry legs which cause terrible itching</li>
            <li> I used the &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; my stylist gave me, but was aghast at the price to replace it.  </li>
            <li> If it was no good she would have said she hated it.</li>
            <li> in all, it isn’t that bad of a product out there on the market.</li>
            <li> Then if I add any lotion, they sting like crazy!  </li>

            <li> Super value for the price.  Much less expensive than salon brands, and this is awesome!  I got hair extensions for a music video and my hair kept getting tangled up.  I used the &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; my stylist gave me, but was aghast at the price to replace it.  I found this on Amazon and it was just what the hair doctor ordered!</li>
            <li> I have been using the aerosol spray version of this body oil and loving it. I bought this because I thought it was the same and I wanted a pump bottle to take on the plane when I travel. This is not the same. At all. The only similarity is the scent. The aerosol spray goes on light and absorbs almost instantly with zero greasy feel after. This stuff is just gross. It&#x27;s just argan scented baby oil and it stays sticky, slick and greasy for hours after application. My friend hugged me at lunch two hours after I had used it and cracked up laughing - she said my arms felt like I had stepped out of 1974. No thanks.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product. It sprays on and then you smooth it on with your hands.  My four year old son likes it too and requested me to apply it (unusual!).  It leaves your skin slightly moisturized but not greasy. I have been using it after baths.  You can apply it much faster than a cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find there was a slight chemical under-current to the fragrance that takes away from the effect.  Also, to note, it contains some morroccan oil but isn&#x27;t 100% moroccan oil. it is made of a variety of oils and other ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY spouse has a sensitive nose and didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Suave Professionals Dry Body Oil is a wonderful multi-use spray oil.  I&#x27;ve used it for my body and hair and it works keeping my hair moisturized and shiny.  It can be oily so if you don&#x27;t need the oil, this might not work for you.</li>
            <li> I often buy more &#x27;high-end&#x27; body products, but this body oil is excellent. I originally started using it for winter dry skin, but discovered it works wonders on the reddish skin on my upper arms I have struggled with since I was a kid. It isn&#x27;t greasy and a great moisturizer. I really enjoy the scent and find it very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I have fairly dry itchy skin especially in the winter and this light Suave Professionals Dry Body Oil Spray, Moroccan Infusion, sprays on nicely hydrates and brightens my skin. Infact I just put some on after shower/shave and my skin feel silky and well soothed and it also last a long time no need to reapply. Lastly,it has a light pleasant smell. Suave makes quality products for a fair price and this is one of them.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Suave&#x27;s Moroccan Infusion line. That said, it is a strong, musky smell that not everyone will enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the idea of this dry oil spray, but the execution wasn&#x27;t what I had hoped for. The oil is sort of thick, so it doesn&#x27;t spray out into an even coat on your skin. It sort of spurts out and making some spots heavily coated and some not at all. While you can rub it in, it never really works out evenly. And then it&#x27;s on your palms, where it doesn&#x27;t soak into the skin well and it difficult to wash off, leaving your hands feeling greasy even though the rest of your body isn&#x27;t (from the absorption).</li>
            <li> Once again, as with the other products in the Suave Professionals line, the first thing I noticed is the intoxicating, exotic smell. I love it! It&#x27;s not overpowering though. I only wish it lasted longer. It does linger but doesn&#x27;t last that long. However, the moisturizing effects do last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with another reviewer that it comes out in streams or squirts rather than an even spray so you do have to even it out by spreading it around. It&#x27;s not a major issue for me. I have gotten it on my clothes and it does leave a spot but in my experience it always comes out in the wash but it you get it on the clothes you&#x27;re wearing that day, you might not be able to get it out by cleaning it by hand. However, this is easy to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know some reviewers said it was oily but that is in fact what it is -- a dry body oil spray. It does absorb quickly. And it does a great job moisturizing my dry skin, especially in the winter. It lasts all day and you only need a little bit. You don&#x27;t need to lather it on like you do sunscreen spray. So one bottle does last a while. I like how it make my skin look and feel radiant and silky. I know this is probably mind over matter, but I feel a little more confident when I use this spray. Maybe it&#x27;s the exotic scent that does it, but whatever the reason, I enjoy the feeling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it&#x27;s not made for this purpose, I often use it as a type of perfume and spray it on my wrists and neck for a light, pleasant, exotic fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s funny that I was reading another reviewer&#x27;s comment about the oil going on warm rather than cool like most creams. It&#x27;s funny because I was thinking the same thing. It&#x27;s minor but it&#x27;s a nice benefit in the winter when most people need extra moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product. It is an oil, so if you are not a fan of oils you might not be happy with it. But if you like oils and/or are open to another type of product to relieve dry skin, then I think you&#x27;ll enjoy it because it works; it&#x27;s lasts; it&#x27;s easy to use; and it smells wonderful, but the smell is not overpowering at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only suggestion to the manufacturer is to take a look at the nozzle and how it dispenses the oil. I thought it was just my bottle but I notice others find it doesn&#x27;t come out in a spray either. It&#x27;s not major but just something that I hope they address.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend you give this product a try!ou&#x27;ll enjoy it because it works; it&#x27;s lasts; it&#x27;s easy to use; and it smells wonderful, but the smell is not overpowering at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only suggestion to the manufacturer is to take a look at the nozzle and how it dispenses the oil.

            <li> I have very dry skin. I found this to work very well. This has to be massage into the skin for best results. I found it to be greasy and shiny when placed on. The scent was not too bad, but it could of been better. I used a towel to take off all the excess amount of oil. You only need a little but keep a towel handy so the oil does not get on everything.</li>
            <li> This spray body oil has a lovely scent. I have dry skin so I thought it would be perfect for me. Unfortunately I found it to be too greasy and left oily splotches on my work and yoga clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up mixing it up with some other lotion I had and this was the perfect solution. I got the moisturizing I needed with more penetration and less &amp;#34;oil slick&amp;#34; residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result I like this product just fine but it did not work as a stand alone for me.</li>
            <li> She wouldn&#x27;t make a big deal of it.  I suppose that&#x27;s not the most glowing review ever but you know women.  If it was no good she would have said she hated it.</li>
            <li> The Moroccan Infusion Suave Professionals Dry Body Oil Spray has done wonders in re-hydrating my skin! I found that very little tends to go quite a long way too! I&#x27;ve been using this 3 ounce bottle for about two weeks and it still appears to hardly have been used. The transparent bottle this product comes in is nice because I can see how soon I&#x27;d be needing to pick up another. The spray head on this bottle has more of a direct shot than a spray liked I imagined it would have. Because of this, I tend to squirt the oil into my hand and then rub into the desired area. I find rubbing the oil in helps it to absorb into my skin much quicker. The smell is delightful and I always get compliments by my husband after it&#x27;s applied. He and I tend to be quite sensitive to many smells and fragrances causing adverse allergic reactions than often start with sneezing fits but have had zero issues with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really like is the fact this hydrates my skin and the silkiness that follows after it being applied. There is definitely a glow too! It absorbs pretty quickly so there&#x27;s no need to worry of it staining anything I am wearing. I usually apply directly after a shower. I really like this oily and compared to other it doesn&#x27;t leave me looking or feeling greasy after application which usually last all day long. The fragrance isn&#x27;t overpowering though I would recommend not wearing anything else when using this product. I feel that this fragrance would clash leaving an undesirable scent if mixed with a lotion or perfume. Other than that, I would totally recommend it! It&#x27;s decently priced considering how a little goes pretty far!</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff!!  It soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my arms and legs feeling greasy.  The only reason it&#x27;s not 5 stars is that the sprayer is a little erratic, so I have to spray some into my hands and rub it onto my skin, instead of spraying the product directly on the skin and then smoothing it in.  Not a big deal, and I&#x27;ve already purchased this again!</li>
            <li> I live in the desert, so keeping my skin moisturized is a necessity unless I want to look like an alligator. So, I’m always looking for new products to keep my skin moist and add a bit of variety to my routine. The scent of this body oil spray is just beautiful and rather exotic. And the spray bottle makes it quick and easy to apply over large areas of my skin. I prefer using this oil on damp skin as it seems to absorb better. I&#x27;ve also found it excellent for use in foot massages after long days of standing. My skin was also significantly softer and more hydrated after several days of using this product. Overall, it&#x27;s a very nice body oil with a lovely scent.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of spray lotions and oils and while it is convenient to spray it on, you still have to rub it in with your hand. This dry oil spray is very moisturizing and made my skin glow, though. I love the look of it on bare legs instead of a more ashy lotion.</li>
            <li> I have curly -tendancy to be dry- hair.  Nice light oil spray.  Works well for the body as well. A little bit goes a long way.  Shine without weight and if you only use a little great moisturizer without a creasy feel.</li>
            <li> I have chronically dry skin which is exacerbated by cold weather. I expected this body oil spray to be about as effective as any lotion that I&#x27;ve used in the past, and it is. But I&#x27;d say it goes a step further in that it makes my skin feel truly hydrated. What&#x27;s more, the oil absorbs rapidly and doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this, I applied it to just one leg and did a side-by-side comparison. Not only did the oil help my leg feel less dry, but my legs looked like they belonged on two different bodies, so great was the difference. And because it&#x27;s an oil, it lasted all day, eliminating the itching and irritation that often goes with dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a slight scent to the oil, and I find it rather pleasant. It&#x27;s not perfume-y or overly coconut-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing you will want to be careful of when using this body spray is any potential splash. The oil comes out in a stream, not a mist, so it&#x27;s best to apply to your palms and then spread it rather than directly to your legs or arms or wherever else you intend to use it. Watch, too, that you don&#x27;t create a slippery mess on your floors, as this absorbs directly into the skin, but not so much tile flooring.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a hair product, and guess what it works great as a hair product...So far so good and it&#x27;s very anti-humidity. A little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve tried other products that have argon oil properties but I really have to admit that this product makes a wonderful hair product. Maybe I might try it for its intended use but for now I love it for my hair.</li>
            <li> love it my dry skin so bad after shower spray it thx deb</li>
            <li> This product is essentially baby oil (mineral oil) in a mister bottle.  And it hydrates well, as does baby oil.  However, it leaves my skin feeling oily and I wouldn&#x27;t want to get it on clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The argania spinosa oil is the third ingredient, after fragrance.  Fragrance is usually a small fraction of ingredients in most ingredients, so I have to assume that the argania oil in this product is a small portion of its ingredients.  If that is not true, I&#x27;d be happy to know otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Amazon product page at the time I write this review is a mishmash of this product and a Suave self-tanning product.  The picture of the product and the product name are the same as mine, but the ingredient list is nothing close to the ingredients listed on my bottle of dry body oil spray.  This spray is not a self-tanner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the smell of this oil.  The spray bottle works pretty well considering it is spraying oil, but the spray still has to be smoothed out with my hands, leaving my hands feeling oily.  I works better for me to spray the oil into my palm, since I&#x27;m going to have to wash my hands after using this anyway, and spread the oil where I want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, this is overpriced baby oil and not worth getting again.</li>
            <li> I bought this without really reading the bottle all the way. My mistake. I thought this had dual use for hair and skin, but it is just for skin. Trust me, do NOT put this in your hair like I did. I thought naively if I just used a little in my hair it would work. I was horribly wrong and had greasy, stringy hair. Not pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using this exclusively on my skin and even with a light misting, I did feel like it left a residue. I really tried different ways of using the oil by itself but inevitably I felt oily. I didn&#x27;t want to waste the bottle so I&#x27;ve been adding this to some of my lotions and cream.&lt;br /&gt;Since adding it to my other lotions, I don&#x27;t feel like its leaving a residue on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with some of the other reviews, I&#x27;m not a big fan of the scent but its not offensive or unpleasant. It does smell earthy, almost like a fancy patchouli oil and I suppose Suave was trying to keep the Moroccan Essence but it just isn&#x27;t great. I don&#x27;t plan on buying this again.</li>
            <li> Living in North Dakota for over seven years I&#x27;ve seen my fair share of harsh, long, and very dry winters that seem to go for most of the year (no joke).  We denizens of this frozen land stay indoors most of the time with the occasional sprint to our vehicles and rare masochistic display of craziness by ice fishing and snowmobiling in weather that would REALLY make southern states panic.  As such, I usually get really dry skin that turns a shade of white that is colloquially known as &amp;#34;Norwegian white,&amp;#34; or VERY pale.  This year has been particularly bad with sustained negative temperatures made worse with even harsher wind chills.  I&#x27;m more white than a Trent Lott Christmas party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When given the chance to try out the Suave Moroccan Infusion spray, I was all over it and anxiously awaited trying something other than other garden variety moisturizers.  I also wanted to be able to show off some color when the weather gets 30 F and I felt comfortable enough to wear shorts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having tried the Infusion for over a month, I&#x27;m very satisfied with its ability to moisturize my skin but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a real difference in color as I&#x27;m still whiter than Vanilla Ice in Ninja Turtles 2.  At least once a day I applied a simple spray to my hands and rubbed it in my face where I really get dryness from constant exposure to the cold elements of ND and only reapplied when necessary, which only happened a few times.  I noticed results almost immediately as the urge to water my face started to subside and, within minutes, didn&#x27;t notice any condition on my face at all and that feeling lasted well into the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results of the next 30 consecutive days were consistent as the Infusion helped keep my face moisturized and not feel like sandpaper or something really, REALLY dry.  The Infusion made all the difference in the world in terms of helping my dry skin and, believe me, it was irritating to the point where it began to distract me from my daily tasks at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, there was no real discernible difference in skin color at any time while using the Infusion.  Maybe I&#x27;m just too far gone to be saved by anything but direct sunlight or that I&#x27;m distantly related to the Cullen family?  Either way, if there was a difference in my skin color I sure didn&#x27;t notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, even with the lacking change in skin color I&#x27;m still satisfied with the Infusion as it was super easy to use (spray, apply, rub, repeat) and, as advertised, left no streaks or indication that I&#x27;m using product on my face.  I would recommend the Infusion to anyone living in the oil winter wonder land or has chronic dry skin as it eliminated my skin irritation allowing me to, comfortably, write reviews for you and insert Twilight references because I felt like it.e from my daily tasks at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, there was no real discernible difference in skin color at any time while using the Infusion.

            <li> Amazon&#x27;s information about the Suave Moroccan Infusion Dry Body Oil is incorrect at this time;  the product information is for a self-tanner from the same brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the actual ingredients taken from the label, with my explanation in parentheses:  mineral oil, dicaprylyl ether (moisturizer from coconut or palm kernel oil), fragrance, argania spinosa kernel (argan) oil, hydrogenated coconut oil, prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, tocopherol (vitamin E).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This body oil comes in a 3 oz. bottle with a one-finger pump that dispenses a small drop.  It is absorbs quickly and does a good job moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a moderate but lasting fragrance that is a generic floral scent over a base of coconut oil, reminiscent of sunning oil and the beach.  I would prefer that it not have any added fragrance and rely only on the coconut, argan, and sweet almond oils for scent.</li>
            <li> I like it, my only complaint is the way it comes out of the bottle.  Instead of a fine stream, you sometimes get a clump.  It smells great and feels good on skin.</li>
            <li> Asked my wife to try and this is what she said:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The suave spray oil with Moroccan oil infusion is adequate.  It has a light scent and sprays on nicely and, in this very dry winter weather, absorbs quickly.  I did not  see the “glow” that my skin was supposed to show but the oil did absorb in quickly due to the dryness of my skin so perhaps that is the reason I did not glow.  I did not find this to be any better or worse than any other spray oil I have used.  After reading the ingredients (the first being mineral oil) I have to wonder if I could create a comparable mixture with a trip to the drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest problem with the oil was the container.  I do have to thank them for giving the bottle a shape with a “waist” so that it is easily held with slippery hands.  However, the spray nozzle needs a deeper groove or something as it constantly wanted to turn around in my hand so I found it hard to keep it aimed properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this again?  Maybe, if I could get it at a really good price, but I will have to check around to see if my concoction could be made cheaper.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about how well this oil would be absorbed because I had seen some reviews saying it left skin oily. Apparently my skin is a whole lot drier than that of those reviewers, because my skin just drinks this stuff in and asks for more. I do have naturally dry skin, even though I currently live in a humid, rainy climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spray this oil on, rub it in just a bit, and don&#x27;t have oily residue left on my skin. I especially love the speed at which I can moisturize my whole body with spray-on oil. It goes a lot faster after a shower than when I have to rub in a lot of cream. I&#x27;ve also been using this oil quite a bit on my hands. I cook a lot, which means I wash a lot of dishes in hot water, and my hands get dried out repeatedly throughout the day. A little squirt of this oil rubbed into my hands helps keep the dryness from becoming uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they could do something about the smell I would definitely buy this oil in the future. It doesn&#x27;t stink, but it smells weird. The smell is somewhat like a sesame bath and body oil I used to use, but not as pleasant. The first ingredient in this product is mineral oil, and I wonder if that accounts in part for the strange smell. Anyway, it&#x27;s not potent enough to keep me from using the oil, but it would be nice if they could tone down the scent.</li>
            <li> Well, how to describe this topical body oil…let’s just say that it isn’t like pure/natural oil – such as olive oil, sesame oil, coconut oil, etc. – but it helps the skin by leaving a similar feel. Though the bottle says “unscented” – my guess meaning there is on perfume-y added scent such as you might find at Victoria’s Secret or Bath &amp; Body Works – but there is a mild “scent” of the oil [mixture] itself. The scent is NOT strong or overpowering, however, for someone who is more sensitive to ANY kind of smell [such as my mum], then I’d exercise caution when using this by either putting it on some time before you are around someone as such [if you are aware of someone being this sensitive] or simply not put much on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus far, I’ve tended to simply apply to my arms (forearm, elbow, upper arm, some of the shoulder, and the calf – knee area(s). The oil is a bit thicker than some kind of pure oil, and, for me, it leaves my skin feeling refreshed &amp; hydrated but not overly oily, or that feeling  of “oily” like some pure/natural oils can leave (if over-applied).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The slight scent does not bother me, and though the “spray” is more like a jet of oil (there really is not a “spray” feature to it, which, I’m disappointed, but oh well), so, I HIGHLY recommend exercising great caution when trying to apply and either slowly &amp; gently press on the “spray head” (is that what it’s called?) OR I’d suggest squirting a wee bit in your hand [fingers or palm] and then rub it on the area you wish to hydrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the directions/description – the ones that I remember reading – state that it is “best” for after you get out of the shower (I understand the principle behind that), but for me, the first/one time I tried it, I just felt….greasy. So, I just use it for when I need it/want it…or whenever the occasion arises that I feel the need to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it isn’t that bad of a product out there on the market. Would I personally continue to use this after my current bottle runs out???? Maybe. I wouldn’t rave about it, but I honestly don’t have anything negative to say, nothing to an extreme or overly bothersome or distasteful. The only “negative aspect/feature is the disappointing lack of a “spray,” but I can live without that…it really isn’t too inconvenient. Would I recommend this? Yes. I wouldn’t promote/advertise, but if someone was set on purchasing a body oil [spray…..or no spray] or some kind of product similar to this one, I’d support the purchase and use of this one.ct out there on the market.

            <li> This is my first experience using any type of body oil spray, so I had no expectations going in. From the start, I liked the design of the bottle; it curves in at the center of the bottle, which makes it easy to grasp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way when it comes to the body spray. I found very quickly that this was less of a mist and more of a puddle when I sprayed it out, so I simply adapted and squeezed a few pumps into the palm of my hand, then rubbed it into my skin. I like to use it after I shave and shower because of how irritated my skin can get from the razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a few minutes for my skin to fully absorb the oil, but once it does, it leaves my skin feeling really soft for many hours. I also like the shininess that it leaves on my skin; I think it&#x27;s a glow that looks great when accent by skirts and dresses.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance, and not oily.  Absorbs quickly and left my skin moist.  I like that it is a spray bottle instead of a tube - it allows you to apply more evenly without getting your hands full of it.  I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It has been great for my poor winter skin, it goes on clean, absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue and smells good.</li>
            <li> Feels like silk on the skin, quickly absorbed and deep hydrating. Nice lightly scented, does not overpower perfume.</li>
            <li> Living in a cold climate dry skin is one of those things that happens every winter. I&#x27;m not a fan of lotions and while I love oils they can end up too heavy if you are not careful. The spray Moroccan oil is the best! The spray helps you use just the right amount and the moroccan helps keep my dry skin hydrated and soft. I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> As a dark-skinned woman, I prefer to use oils as opposed to creamy lotions as oils do not leave white streaks behind.&lt;br /&gt;I usually use J.R. Watkins Grapefruit Body oil Mist. I like the light scent and the quick absorbing quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Suave Moroccan oil smells really nice and sprays a light oil mist, but costs quite a bit more than the JR Watkins-which is why I took off one star. (J.R Watkins- $9.99/ 6 ounces - Suave $11.99 for 3 ounces)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m guessing that Moroccan Oil is more luxurious and expensive than other body oils, but they felt the same to me and I like both scents. The Suave is not worth double the price for me.</li>
            <li> This dry body oil is really nice.  It&#x27;s moisturizing without being too greasy &amp; smells pleasant.  Great for summer!</li>
            <li> This spray absorbs quickly and leaves my dry skin feeling soft and hydrated. I love the smell, it&#x27;s a clean sort of warm scent that is pleasant and not heavy. It&#x27;s very quick and easy to spray this on and rub it in after a shower. I only wish it was a bigger bottle!</li>
            <li> I should have paid more attention to the ingredients before ordering. Could have poured baby oil into a spray bottle instead of spend money on this. Nothing &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; about this body oil spray.</li>
            <li> Heavily scented, but it dissipates and mellows to a noticeable but understated fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;This is a perfect after-shower oil. Although they haven&#x27;t been manufactured for many years, there used to be a product called Sardoettes. They were individually wrapped towelettes that were saturated with oil, to be used on damp skin.&lt;br /&gt;This product worked best for me when used in the same manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it is in oil form, it is not a heavy moisturizer. Skin feels softer, and any dry patches are temporarily soothed.&lt;br /&gt;This is basically a scented mineral oil.&lt;br /&gt;Suave makes some excellent products and offers them at a lower price than other brands. This oil isn&#x27;t bad, but nothing special.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes well but could absorb better.</li>
            <li> Having used Moroccanoil brand body products, I can tell you that this isn&#x27;t a dupe for the body oil.  While the scent is pleasant, it does not smell like Moroccanoil. The sprayer does not mist the oil, it squirts it out in globs.  The oil does not pent rate my skin easily and leaves a greasy film on my skin. It didn&#x27;t do much of anything to help with dryness on my arms. I like the Suave shampoo and hair mask from the same line, but this item really disappointed me. I was looking for a cheaper alternative to Moroccanoil products, this and the matching lotion aren&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> This product reminds me of my Neutrogena Sesame Oil, which I have loved and used for years,  The dry body oil spray is good for when I am on my way out the door and just want to give a nice sheen to my arms and legs.  It absorbs quickly and moisturizes well.  The scent is not unpleasant but I wish it were unscented so it wouldn&#x27;t clash with my perfume.</li>
            <li> I got this hoping it would have the same awesome fragrance as the Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion shampoo, conditioner, and hair styling oil.  However, this &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; body oil spray smells.... *different*, and milder.  Not as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the bottle, the spray isn&#x27;t like a mist or a wide pattern spray, it comes out like a stream.  Which is okay, since I prefer to dispense into my hand and then apply to my legs and arms (if you spray directly onto legs you&#x27;re likely to end up with some on the floor, which makes it slippery).  The bottle unfortunately looks exactly like the Suave Moroccan Infusion hair styling oil&#x27;s bottle, and they&#x27;re even the same size bottle.  Only the pump is slightly different.  If you have both products on your bathroom counter and you&#x27;re rushing to get ready at 5am, I suggest you take an extra moment to make sure you&#x27;ve got the right bottle in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil itself doesn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; feeling at all.  It&#x27;s oily and heavy.  Some absorbs quickly, but hours later I can touch my arm and I feel that oiliness.  If you&#x27;re looking for heavy duty moisture like this, then that&#x27;s a good thing.  I prefer a &amp;#34;dry touch&amp;#34; which I was hoping for since &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; is in the name of the product.  This is not a dry body oil at all.  First ingredient in the list is mineral oil... and there&#x27;s more fragrance than argan oil in this oil spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just okay.  It is a fair price if you like the scent of it and need the heavy, oily moisture that this provides.</li>
            <li> I have dry legs which cause terrible itching and I end up scratching so hard, that my legs hurt.  Then if I add any lotion, they sting like crazy!  So I bought some of this and put it on right after my shower while my legs are still damp. I then add my body lotion on top and rub it all in and my legs feel so hydrated and soft!  It takes a few minuets for it to all soak in but then I love the way it makes my legs feel.  Even later on in the day, my legs are still hydrated and I am not scratching them anymore.  To me, that is a major plus!  The smell is not bad and it doesn&#x27;t bother me. The only issue I have is the same thing others have said about how it comes out.  I wish it would spray out in a wide mist but it comes out as a single stream.  The main thing I have learned to do is to spray both of my legs first, THEN rub my legs. Otherwise, I will get oil from my hands on the bottle and then it is slippery.  Overall, I like this product and am happy to have found it and will definitely keep using it on my legs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this oil on my feet, elbows and cuticles.  It absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t feel at all greasy.  Certainly a dry skin oil that is pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> Meh. I found this rather mediocre. The scent was kind of off, and the oil had no lasting quality for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most annoying feature of the product was the bottle itself. I found the design to be a bit awkward to hold with wet hands, and a rather small. The spray mechanism  also was not to my liking, delivering a concentrated stream of product rather than a more diffuse one, causing me to have to stop and rub it in so oil was not running down my arms and legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good idea, but not the greatest execution. I may try this product on my hair to see if it may be multitasked.</li>
            <li> Works just as good as the $20 variety for me.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin.  I like to mix mine with a little lotion and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> this makes your skin feel &amp; look so good!</li>
            <li> This is so awesome, I love this stuff it works immediately</li>
            <li> I live in the desert and have problems during the summer and middle of winter with extremely dry skin.  I&#x27;ve tried a variety of lotion products and have found several I like, but I was interested to try an oil spray and see if it would work any better.  As far as the results go, I think both body lotion and this oil spray offer the same degree of relief; however, I think it takes a lot less of this spray to achieve that result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another aspect of this product that I like is the scent.  I personally find it quite pleasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m only giving this 4 stars is that it doesn&#x27;t work very well on my face.  Lotions temporarily solve the dry skin issue without any side effects, but this product seems to plug up my pores.  On the body, this is a great product though.  At least it has been for me.</li>
            <li> Like using it on  my split ends after towel dried hair and then again after I&#x27;m done straightening my  hair. Just use a drop or two to avoid that oily look.</li>
            <li> Look at the size. this is a tiny bottle.</li>
            <li> Good for winter dry skin</li>
    </ol>
