            <li>Most probably not.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell exotic to me, also part of the description.  </li>
            <li>I received a bottle of this hair fragrance mist free in exchange for an honest review.  </li>
            <li>Love, love love...</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>The more I smell in in my hair,</li>
            <li>the more I like it.</li>
            <li>love the idea of a spray on hair fragrance.</li>

            <li>The scent reminded more of food than anything else.</li>

            <li>make that I LOVE vanilla.  </li>
            <li>The St. Barth&#x27;s is MUCH better.</li>
            <li>but hey) Love the store</li>
            <li>This spray did give my hair a bit more shine, but the scent is heavenly.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent of vanilla and this spray did not disappoint.  </li>
            <li>It added fragrance, shine &amp; tamed the static fly-away.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>I am glad that it is a &amp;#34;light&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Lovely scent</li>
            <li>I have never used or even heard of a hair fragrance mist before, but after trying it I have to say i really love it.</li>
            <li>Im always hoping for a much more truly vanilla scent, ths isnt it.</li>
            <li>My husband, not prone to compliment, said it made my hair smell nice and clean.  </li>
            <li>but as it settles and softens up quick mixing in with your own scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;The one gripe I have is the lid/cap for it doesn&#x27;t exactly fit and is made of very cheap metal.</li>
            <li>If you like very sweet smelling scents this one may be for you.  </li>
            <li>I love Fekkai products and I like the light scent of vanilla creme spritzed on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I think it might work best when used with other Fekkai products that may work well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alright, but it&#x27;s easy to over spray and end up with a headache.  </li>
            <li>The shine and frizz control benefits are light, this stuff won&#x27;t dominate your hair for sure, but it&#x27;s there in light doses.</li>
            <li>It is a light mist and does help your hair shine, as well as it gives you a light fragrance, of a flavor most folks love,especially men.  </li>
            <li>Very, very quickly.</li>
            <li>I like strong scents</li>
            <li>The scent of vanilla is overpoweringly strong.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The fragrance isn&#x27;t perfume strong.</li>
            <li>It is strong, but not overpowering, and, it lasts until you shampoo your hair.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a vanilla that reminds me of a lip balm I loved in high school- very light and sweet.</li>
            <li>This is a very sweet vanilla cream fragrance, accurate as named.  </li>
            <li>There is only beautiful hair.</li>
            <li>This has a nice scent which stays pretty well on your hair.</li>
            <li>the fragrance - light, crisp, and not heavy at all.&lt;br /&gt;Helpful for static and fly away hairs as well, and does not seem to leave a residue.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Fekkai Hair Fragrance Mist in Creme Vanilla is a light weight perfume made for hair with the additional benefit of adding shine and frizz control.</li>
            <li>and you enjoy the vanilla scent</li>
            <li>If you want to have your hair smell terrific, use a great smelling conditioner and spritz it with your fav perfume after styling.</li>
            <li>Its ability to impart a wet and silky look makes it an ideal candidate in hair products, both rinse-off and leave-on ones.</li>
            <li>Vine Customer Review of Free Product</li>
            <li>/&gt;It says that it leaves hair shiny and frizz free</li>
            <li>People who hug you will smell it, as your hair will retain the fragrance and you won&#x27;t end up with a headache, as it is light and gives the benefit of added shine.  </li>
            <li>This Fekkai Fragrance Mist gives a much finer, more dispersed application and just makes my hair look healthy and luxurious.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, if you are looking for an added fresh smell, shine and softness to your gorgeous hair.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t get that excited about hair</li>
            <li>I enjoy getting that fresh scent after a breeze has blown through my hair.</li>
            <li>I liked the antistatic properties, but the scent is a bit too loud for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet and subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He states \\&quot;There is no bad hair.</li>
            <li>musky vanilla fragrance  is strong when it&#x27;s first sprayed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clean and fresh vanilla scent without making you smell like you just walked out of a bakery.</li>
            <li>In fact, as a volatile silicone it quickly evaporates into the air after delivering nutrients to the skin and hair..</li>
            <li>I tend to be more of a wash and wear (well, wash and then pin up while still wet) hair kind of gal</li>
            <li>That said, it fades QUICKLY.</li>
            <li>Fekkai Vanilla Cream Hair Fragrance Mist has a wonderfully light and rich vanilla scent that is very feminine.</li>
            <li>hair mist is packaged in a very pretty glass perfume-like bottle.</li>
            <li>The scent is distinctive but light and very pleasing.  </li>
            <li>It is primarily useful as a fragrance for hair.</li>
            <li>This spray is a light vanilla scented one that offers shine and makes your hair smell fabulous.</li>
            <li>I like it better than the vanilla perfume I had as a young woman.  </li>
            <li>There is the vanilla scent, which is a wee bit strong for me (but then I am sensitive), but it did dissipate maybe an hour or so after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Vine and Fekkai for giving me a chance to try something new :)</li>
            <li>While this product is touted as creating shine and preventing static as well as adding a lovely subtle scent - I found that it didn&#x27;t do much more than add the scent.</li>
            <li>In order for the scent to be user (and neighbor) friendly, one must use the product VERY sparingly.  </li>
            <li>I use it right before my waves set</li>
            <li>There is a strong undercurrent of musk underneath the vanilla scent, and that means that the product has a stronger and more persistent aroma than some people (including me and at least some of the people I work with) like, or can easily tolerate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fekkai Hair Fragrance Mist not only scents my hair with a delicious, fresh but warm vanilla (a lovely accent to my usual Stila Creme Bouquet topped with a wee dab of Angel) but it offers just enough gloss to make my coarse tresses look smooth, luminous, and bouncy.  </li>
            <li>It definitely helped prevent static and gave a nice shine to my hair but the scent didn&#x27;t stay long at all</li>
            <li>/&gt;It isn&#x27;t very strong, but does stay/linger for quite a long time on whatever you apply it to (not in the air).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You may get a better price for some of his products at Fekkai&#x27;s website or find the actual scent you prefer to use.pricing though.</li>
            <li>You may get a better price for some of his products at Fekkai&#x27;s website or find the actual scent you prefer to use.</li>
            <li>To me the scent is like French Vanilla, which I love vanilla as far as food, especially if it&#x27;s real vanilla, not artificially flavored, but as a scent like candles or this Hair Fragrance Mist, not so much, but I might like it in another scent, but this one I wouldn&#x27;t want to be smelling it on my hair all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;For those of you who do like the scent of vanilla or French Vanilla, you may just love this.</li>
            <li>product not only is said to impart shine, and reduce static.  </li>
            <li>you need something to make your hair smell pretty, this will do it.</li>
            <li>Oh, and it&#x27;s REALLY for your hair-- when it landed on my skin it just smelled like chemicals!</li>
            <li>It is not overwhelming, although it doesn&#x27;t have a long staying power, which is just about perfect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very similar to the soft scent of vanilla scented candles (the nice ones)</li>
            <li>This hair fragrance, in addition to making my hair smell nice, doesn’t weigh my hair down and adds just a touch of shine.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t the pure vanilla scent I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really just perfume.</li>
            <li>This is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>sprayed it a few times in the air, then let it settle, to see if I liked the scent, before spraying it on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to clear a room with a harsh stink, no matter how good it smells.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance, although nice, doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li>and it only takes a few light spritzes to leave hair smelling lovely and looking shiny.  </li>
            <li>The words I copied and pasted should convince you that the main ingredient is known for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t weight down my straight fine hair.</li>
            <li>Me, I&#x27;d like more shine-enhancement and a less strong (and certainly a less musk-based) fragrance.</li>
            <li>This mist is a great way to a delicate fragrance to your hair whenever you want, long after the scent from shampoos and conditioners have worn off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, but not GREAT.)</li>
            <li>I bought this product on a whim -- I have used other Fekkai products and thought they worked fine.  </li>
            <li>The package suggests it helps tame frizz and static, but I didn&#x27;t see any change there either.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Fekkai is distributed by Proctor and Gamble Prestige New York, NY.  </li>
            <li>I had hoped that this would be a product that enhanced shine and at the same time did not blitz you, or the other people nearby, in an uncomfortably strong or obtrusive cloud of fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as controlling the frizz (I don&#x27;t have frizzy hair</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not a purchase for me, but I can see if you frequently go days between washes or have environmental stinkage seeping into your hair, this could be something to look into.</li>
            <li>As far as shine?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this several times, as per instructions and really don&#x27;t see any difference one way or the other - perhaps a bit softer, but nothing that stands out and worth the price of admission.</li>
            <li>It’s particularly useful in hair conditioners because it provides a silky feel without weighing the hair down with greasy residue.</li>
            <li>The most did give my hair a slight boost in shine but the shine didn&#x27;t seem to last as long as the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t really do anything good or bad for my hair.</li>
            <li>I definitely detect coconut, which is one of my least favorite scents.  </li>
            <li>This has a Victoria&#x27;s Secret Vanilla-Lace kind of vibe, a musky vanilla reminiscent of 1970&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t imagine what it would be like, if it was a heavy fragrance right near my nose, that lingered all day.  </li>
            <li>It leaves behind a little shine and does seem to calm hair static.</li>
            <li>He offers a trial size package of the different hair fragrance mist scent varieties on his website.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a light mist that can help when the air is very dry and you hair starts to get a little staticy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>right and look less coarse, without having to cope with heated implements.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>Fekkai Hair Fragrance Mist, now a woman can enjoy the scent of her hair at any time with a few spritzes without weighing her hair down.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see how it is any different than any other high alcohol content perfume type body spray.  </li>
            <li>I was afraid it might leave a slightly oily or sticky residue on the hair, but you really can&#x27;t feel it at all, other than the hair feeling nice and soft.  </li>

            <li> I like strong scents</li>
            <li> The scent of vanilla is overpoweringly strong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The fragrance isn&#x27;t perfume strong.</li>
            <li> It is strong, but not overpowering, and, it lasts until you shampoo your hair.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a vanilla that reminds me of a lip balm I loved in high school- very light and sweet.</li>
            <li> This is a very sweet vanilla cream fragrance, accurate as named.  </li>
            <li> There is only beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> This has a nice scent which stays pretty well on your hair.</li>
            <li> the fragrance - light, crisp, and not heavy at all.&lt;br /&gt;Helpful for static and fly away hairs as well, and does not seem to leave a residue.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> Vine Customer Review of Free Product</li>
            <li> /&gt;It says that it leaves hair shiny and frizz free</li>
            <li> People who hug you will smell it, as your hair will retain the fragrance and you won&#x27;t end up with a headache, as it is light and gives the benefit of added shine.  </li>
            <li> This Fekkai Fragrance Mist gives a much finer, more dispersed application and just makes my hair look healthy and luxurious.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, if you are looking for an added fresh smell, shine and softness to your gorgeous hair.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t get that excited about hair</li>
            <li> I enjoy getting that fresh scent after a breeze has blown through my hair.</li>
            <li> I liked the antistatic properties, but the scent is a bit too loud for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet and subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He states \\&quot;There is no bad hair.</li>
            <li> musky vanilla fragrance  is strong when it&#x27;s first sprayed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clean and fresh vanilla scent without making you smell like you just walked out of a bakery.</li>
            <li> In fact, as a volatile silicone it quickly evaporates into the air after delivering nutrients to the skin and hair..</li>
            <li> I tend to be more of a wash and wear (well, wash and then pin up while still wet) hair kind of gal</li>
            <li> That said, it fades QUICKLY.</li>
            <li> Fekkai Vanilla Cream Hair Fragrance Mist has a wonderfully light and rich vanilla scent that is very feminine.</li>
            <li> hair mist is packaged in a very pretty glass perfume-like bottle.</li>
            <li> The scent is distinctive but light and very pleasing.  </li>
            <li> It is primarily useful as a fragrance for hair.</li>
            <li> This spray is a light vanilla scented one that offers shine and makes your hair smell fabulous.</li>
            <li> I like it better than the vanilla perfume I had as a young woman.  </li>
            <li> There is the vanilla scent, which is a wee bit strong for me (but then I am sensitive), but it did dissipate maybe an hour or so after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Vine and Fekkai for giving me a chance to try something new :)</li>
            <li> While this product is touted as creating shine and preventing static as well as adding a lovely subtle scent - I found that it didn&#x27;t do much more than add the scent.</li>
            <li> In order for the scent to be user (and neighbor) friendly, one must use the product VERY sparingly.  </li>
            <li> I use it right before my waves set</li>
            <li> There is a strong undercurrent of musk underneath the vanilla scent, and that means that the product has a stronger and more persistent aroma than some people (including me and at least some of the people I work with) like, or can easily tolerate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fekkai Hair Fragrance Mist not only scents my hair with a delicious, fresh but warm vanilla (a lovely accent to my usual Stila Creme Bouquet topped with a wee dab of Angel) but it offers just enough gloss to make my coarse tresses look smooth, luminous, and bouncy.  </li>
            <li> It definitely helped prevent static and gave a nice shine to my hair but the scent didn&#x27;t stay long at all</li>
            <li> /&gt;It isn&#x27;t very strong, but does stay/linger for quite a long time on whatever you apply it to (not in the air).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You may get a better price for some of his products at Fekkai&#x27;s website or find the actual scent you prefer to use.pricing though.</li>
            <li> You may get a better price for some of his products at Fekkai&#x27;s website or find the actual scent you prefer to use.</li>
            <li> To me the scent is like French Vanilla, which I love vanilla as far as food, especially if it&#x27;s real vanilla, not artificially flavored, but as a scent like candles or this Hair Fragrance Mist, not so much, but I might like it in another scent, but this one I wouldn&#x27;t want to be smelling it on my hair all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;For those of you who do like the scent of vanilla or French Vanilla, you may just love this.</li>
            <li> product not only is said to impart shine, and reduce static.  </li>
            <li> you need something to make your hair smell pretty, this will do it.</li>
            <li> Oh, and it&#x27;s REALLY for your hair-- when it landed on my skin it just smelled like chemicals!</li>
            <li> It is not overwhelming, although it doesn&#x27;t have a long staying power, which is just about perfect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very similar to the soft scent of vanilla scented candles (the nice ones)</li>
            <li> This hair fragrance, in addition to making my hair smell nice, doesn’t weigh my hair down and adds just a touch of shine.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the pure vanilla scent I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really just perfume.</li>
            <li> This is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> sprayed it a few times in the air, then let it settle, to see if I liked the scent, before spraying it on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to clear a room with a harsh stink, no matter how good it smells.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance, although nice, doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> and it only takes a few light spritzes to leave hair smelling lovely and looking shiny.  </li>
            <li> The words I copied and pasted should convince you that the main ingredient is known for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t weight down my straight fine hair.</li>
            <li> Me, I&#x27;d like more shine-enhancement and a less strong (and certainly a less musk-based) fragrance.</li>
            <li> This mist is a great way to a delicate fragrance to your hair whenever you want, long after the scent from shampoos and conditioners have worn off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but not GREAT.)</li>
            <li> I bought this product on a whim -- I have used other Fekkai products and thought they worked fine.  </li>
            <li> The package suggests it helps tame frizz and static, but I didn&#x27;t see any change there either.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Fekkai is distributed by Proctor and Gamble Prestige New York, NY.  </li>
            <li> I had hoped that this would be a product that enhanced shine and at the same time did not blitz you, or the other people nearby, in an uncomfortably strong or obtrusive cloud of fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as controlling the frizz (I don&#x27;t have frizzy hair</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not a purchase for me, but I can see if you frequently go days between washes or have environmental stinkage seeping into your hair, this could be something to look into.</li>
            <li> As far as shine?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this several times, as per instructions and really don&#x27;t see any difference one way or the other - perhaps a bit softer, but nothing that stands out and worth the price of admission.</li>
            <li> It’s particularly useful in hair conditioners because it provides a silky feel without weighing the hair down with greasy residue.</li>
            <li> The most did give my hair a slight boost in shine but the shine didn&#x27;t seem to last as long as the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t really do anything good or bad for my hair.</li>
            <li> I definitely detect coconut, which is one of my least favorite scents.  </li>
            <li> This has a Victoria&#x27;s Secret Vanilla-Lace kind of vibe, a musky vanilla reminiscent of 1970&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t imagine what it would be like, if it was a heavy fragrance right near my nose, that lingered all day.  </li>
            <li> It leaves behind a little shine and does seem to calm hair static.</li>
            <li> He offers a trial size package of the different hair fragrance mist scent varieties on his website.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a light mist that can help when the air is very dry and you hair starts to get a little staticy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> right and look less coarse, without having to cope with heated implements.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> Fekkai Hair Fragrance Mist, now a woman can enjoy the scent of her hair at any time with a few spritzes without weighing her hair down.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how it is any different than any other high alcohol content perfume type body spray.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid it might leave a slightly oily or sticky residue on the hair, but you really can&#x27;t feel it at all, other than the hair feeling nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, coarse, long hair that tends to get lovely frizzy bits which make it look dull, especially in the southwest Florida humidity.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> (I would actually like to try the other scents offered by Fekkai.</li>
            <li> is this different from other frizz serums?  </li>
            <li> when I air dry my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair will have to withstand a dry, Summer wind I guess.  </li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;perfume for the hair&amp;#34; left my long hair smelling like vanilla with a little bit of shine.</li>
            <li> Initially the scent is a bit strong when applied (some say cloy, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that bad at all)</li>
            <li> recommend, as with hairspray or spray deodorant - to keep your eyes, nose, and mouth closed during delivery.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> there are other cheaper product  </li>
            <li> Vanilla, but with other fragrance notes as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to have to continuously spray this in my hair every couple of hours due to the fact</li>
            <li> Not really a fan of this and think it is just a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t want shiny hair, without being greasy and weighed down.  </li>
            <li> Try not to get any on your face because the consistency of the liquid is slightly oily.</li>
            <li> Too bad this has some weird top and middle notes.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re not going to fill a room with scent with one little spritz.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So...at least for me, this product is of very limited usefulness.  </li>
            <li> Because the scent is Vanilla Cream, when using Fekkai Hair Fragrance Mist, I cannot help but think of Eleanor’s mom putting vanilla behind her ear in the book Eleanor &amp; Park by Rainbow Rowell, especially after my youngest son told me I smelled like birthday cake.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not overwhelming the cashier at the grocery store while I stand in the check out.</li>
            <li> but sadly it doesn&#x27;t last along time in my hair</li>
            <li> Not my usual choice</li>
            <li> the past, I&#x27;ve used products designed to add shine to my hair.</li>
            <li> It comes in a small perfume style bottle</li>
            <li> have used it a few times and do like the scent, which is subtle and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> had to spray hard, and without wasting, I sprayed my hair ends.  </li>
            <li> I found the square glass bottle and the tiny spritzer a bit awkward to use.  </li>
            <li> I honestly do not notice anything.  </li>
            <li> This smells decently but made an absolute sticky, crunchy, nasty mess of my hair :(</li>
            <li> It is a subtle scent and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Those typically make my hair look artificially and excessively  slick and almost greasy.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;However, the fragrance lasted less than 30 minutes which was disappointing.</li>
            <li> This really covered up that nasty smell so kudos for that.</li>
            <li> shine it adds is also very subtle.</li>
            <li> If you like a vanilla fragrance, then you really can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> , hate how I smell like an ashtray afterwards.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It has a similar scent to butter cream frosting. It&#x27;s alright, but it&#x27;s easy to over spray and end up with a headache.  So, sprayer beware and resist that extra 1 or 2 sprays.</li>
            <li> It definitely helped prevent static and gave a nice shine to my hair but the scent didn&#x27;t stay long at all I felt like the scent stayed a lot longer with just using the the shampoo and conditioner alone rather than all three together.  All in all I wouldn&#x27;t  recommend  there are other cheaper product  that help with static and give good shine</li>
            <li> This is amazing!  I will continue to buy this every time I run out. My husband loves it!</li>
            <li> Fekkai Hair Fragrance Mist in Creme Vanilla is a light weight perfume made for hair with the additional benefit of adding shine and frizz control. Fekkai, by Frederic Fekkai, creates luxury hair products for women. He states \\&quot;There is no bad hair. There is only beautiful hair. And I am only here to help every woman understand that.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Fekkai Hair Fragrance Mist, now a woman can enjoy the scent of her hair at any time with a few spritzes without weighing her hair down. Vanilla cream smells delightful. It&#x27;s a clean and fresh vanilla scent without making you smell like you just walked out of a bakery. Initially the scent is a bit strong when applied (some say cloy, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that bad at all) but as it settles and softens up quick mixing in with your own scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like that Fekkai hair fragrance mist lasts longer than the scent of most hair products. I enjoy getting that fresh scent after a breeze has blown through my hair. I like that it doesn&#x27;t weight down my straight fine hair. The shine and frizz control benefits are light, this stuff won&#x27;t dominate your hair for sure, but it&#x27;s there in light doses. It&#x27;s help me some with fly away hair, but it&#x27;s not my \\&quot;go to product\\&quot; for that issue. (The reason I deducted a star. It&#x27;s good, but not GREAT.) What I like most about the Fekkai hair fragrance mist is that it makes my hair smell wonderful. Would I get it again? Yes. (I would actually like to try the other scents offered by Fekkai. He offers a trial size package of the different hair fragrance mist scent varieties on his website.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My senior mother also sampled my hair mist and immediately fell in love with it for its scent, light shine, and fly away control for her hair. The lightweight formula works perfect for her fine hair without weighing it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking to add a touch of luxury to your hair and you enjoy the vanilla scent, Fekkai&#x27;s vanilla cream hair fragrance mist may appeal to you. Watch for pricing though. You may get a better price for some of his products at Fekkai&#x27;s website or find the actual scent you prefer to use.pricing though. You may get a better price for some of his products at Fekkai&#x27;s website or find the actual scent you prefer to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on a whim -- I have used other Fekkai products and thought they worked fine.  This does what it says it will -- gives your hair a nice vanilla cream fragrance for a while.  The fragrance, although nice, doesn&#x27;t last very long.  I found the square glass bottle and the tiny spritzer a bit awkward to use.  Would I purchase this item?  Most probably not.</li>
            <li> If you like very sweet smelling scents this one may be for you.  In part of the description it does say &amp;#34;sweet scent&amp;#34;.  It doesn&#x27;t smell exotic to me, also part of the description.  To me the scent is like French Vanilla, which I love vanilla as far as food, especially if it&#x27;s real vanilla, not artificially flavored, but as a scent like candles or this Hair Fragrance Mist, not so much, but I might like it in another scent, but this one I wouldn&#x27;t want to be smelling it on my hair all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the idea of this, to help make your hair shiny and to prevent static.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent is a very  personal thing, something you can&#x27;t smell online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sprayed it a few times in the air, then let it settle, to see if I liked the scent, before spraying it on my hair.  Then did the same thing awhile later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I didn&#x27;t care for the  scent and I had just washed my hair, I did not spray it onto my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who do like the scent of vanilla or French Vanilla, you may just love this.</li>
            <li> My hair smells like a bottle of vanilla cream soda, which I find delicious. The scent is very smooth and lilting. Try not to get any on your face because the consistency of the liquid is slightly oily.</li>
            <li> I had hoped that this would be a product that enhanced shine and at the same time did not blitz you, or the other people nearby, in an uncomfortably strong or obtrusive cloud of fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No such luck.  In order for the scent to be user (and neighbor) friendly, one must use the product VERY sparingly.  There is a strong undercurrent of musk underneath the vanilla scent, and that means that the product has a stronger and more persistent aroma than some people (including me and at least some of the people I work with) like, or can easily tolerate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But using the product so sparingly effectively nullifies its ability to be a shine-enhancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...at least for me, this product is of very limited usefulness.  Me, I&#x27;d like more shine-enhancement and a less strong (and certainly a less musk-based) fragrance.</li>
            <li> My wife says... I received a bottle of this hair fragrance mist free in exchange for an honest review.  This is a very sweet vanilla cream fragrance, accurate as named.  I don&#x27;t see how it is any different than any other high alcohol content perfume type body spray.  The package suggests it helps tame frizz and static, but I didn&#x27;t see any change there either.  Its a pleasant scent, and a fun item.  Its a somewhat puzzling item though.  Perhaps I am not the target audience?</li>
            <li> Review of the Vanilla Cream Mist&lt;br /&gt;Love  the fragrance - light, crisp, and not heavy at all.&lt;br /&gt;Helpful for static and fly away hairs as well, and does not seem to leave a residue.&lt;br /&gt;I did not notice that it imparted any shine to my hair&lt;br /&gt;However, the fragrance lasted less than 30 minutes which was disappointing.</li>
            <li> Because the scent is Vanilla Cream, when using Fekkai Hair Fragrance Mist, I cannot help but think of Eleanor’s mom putting vanilla behind her ear in the book Eleanor &amp; Park by Rainbow Rowell, especially after my youngest son told me I smelled like birthday cake.  The scent is distinctive but light and very pleasing.  My husband, not prone to compliment, said it made my hair smell nice and clean.  This hair fragrance, in addition to making my hair smell nice, doesn’t weigh my hair down and adds just a touch of shine.  I rather like it.</li>
            <li> This smells decently but made an absolute sticky, crunchy, nasty mess of my hair :( now it&#x27;s just a desk decoration because I don&#x27;t dare use it on my hair again</li>
            <li> Smells like a powdery perfume from the &#x27;70s.  Going in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, and isn&#x27;t drying or filmy.</li>
            <li> My daughters love this! I liked the antistatic properties, but the scent is a bit too loud for me.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t really do anything good or bad for my hair. I like strong scents so maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I couldn&#x27;t smell this at all and it didn&#x27;t seem to leave any kind of scent.  It was like I didn&#x27;t spray anything.  As far as controlling the frizz (I don&#x27;t have frizzy hair but everyone can use a bit of smoothing) it seemed to make it drier.  Not really a fan of this and think it is just a waste of money.  If you want to have your hair smell terrific, use a great smelling conditioner and spritz it with your fav perfume after styling.</li>
            <li> Wow. The scent of vanilla is overpoweringly strong. I used just one spray at the crown on my head and it was a cloud of fragrance I couldn&#x27;t escape. I had to wash my hair shortly after getting a headache from the smell. This is definitely not a product for those who have allergies or sensitivity to scent.</li>
            <li> Fekkai Vanilla Cream Hair Fragrance Mist has a wonderfully light and rich vanilla scent that is very feminine. It leaves behind a little shine and does seem to calm hair static. Do not expect this to be a hair treatment that improves the condition of your hair, however. It is primarily useful as a fragrance for hair. In that role, it delivers!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the pure vanilla scent I was hoping for.  It had a musky undertone, so I think I used it only once or twice.</li>
            <li> While this product is touted as creating shine and preventing static as well as adding a lovely subtle scent - I found that it didn&#x27;t do much more than add the scent. I think it might work best when used with other Fekkai products that may work well together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it a few times and do like the scent, which is subtle and not overwhelming. The most did give my hair a slight boost in shine but the shine didn&#x27;t seem to last as long as the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely use this product again tho!</li>
            <li> Love, love love... This is perfume for your hair and frizz control at the same time! I use it between hair wash and keeps my hair smelling &amp;#34;to die for&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> This spray is a light vanilla scented one that offers shine and makes your hair smell fabulous. It is not overwhelming, although it doesn&#x27;t have a long staying power, which is just about perfect. It&#x27;s very similar to the soft scent of vanilla scented candles (the nice ones) so if you don&#x27;t like that this is not for you. It does make you hair a bit shinier so overall that is a plus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this several times, as per instructions and really don&#x27;t see any difference one way or the other - perhaps a bit softer, but nothing that stands out and worth the price of admission. There is the vanilla scent, which is a wee bit strong for me (but then I am sensitive), but it did dissipate maybe an hour or so after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Vine and Fekkai for giving me a chance to try something new :)</li>
            <li> Vanilla creme smell. okay I guess?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Fekkai hair products and thought this would complement my hair care regimen nicely. It&#x27;s really just perfume. I&#x27;ve been using it as a room fragrance instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t very strong, but does stay/linger for quite a long time on whatever you apply it to (not in the air).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one gripe I have is the lid/cap for it doesn&#x27;t exactly fit and is made of very cheap metal.</li>
            <li> I like this hair fragrance. I like it quite a bit. The more I smell in in my hair, the more I like it. It&#x27;s not just a vanilla fragrance. It has notes of vanilla, but there are others as well. So if you&#x27;re looking for something that smells just like vanilla and nothing else, this isn&#x27;t it. Which is probably why Fekkai calls it Vanilla Cream. Vanilla, but with other fragrance notes as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance isn&#x27;t perfume strong. You&#x27;re not going to fill a room with scent with one little spritz. I put 2 or 3 sprays in my hair and my husband gets a whiff of it when he gives me a hug. But I&#x27;m not overwhelming the cashier at the grocery store while I stand in the check out. It&#x27;s sweet and subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shine it adds is also very subtle. You can put several sprays of this in your hair and you won&#x27;t make it greasy. It&#x27;s just a light mist that can help when the air is very dry and you hair starts to get a little staticy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair mist is packaged in a very pretty glass perfume-like bottle. It reminds me of the bottles of the company Philosophy uses for their perfumes. Simple and elegant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the idea of a spray on hair fragrance. While shampoos and conditioners can make hair smell great, the scent can wear off throughout the day. This mist is a great way to a delicate fragrance to your hair whenever you want, long after the scent from shampoos and conditioners have worn off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;t&#x27;s a nice luxury - treat yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair perfume smells like a musky vanilla.  I like it better than the vanilla perfume I had as a young woman.  The scent is so nice that you needn&#x27;t use perfume.  It is strong, but not overpowering, and, it lasts until you shampoo your hair.  Of course it dissipates some, but you get the idea.  This is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to spray hard, and without wasting, I sprayed my hair ends.  That is where dryness and frizz comes in to play.  I use it right before my waves set when I air dry my hair. 4-6 inches from your head makes it easier to cover more ground in one spray.  * A tiprom the Fekkai Salon it to spray in the air, and let it land in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fekkai is distributed by Proctor and Gamble Prestige New York, NY.  Do an Internet search for Mr Fekkai, as he has done a lot of stars&#x27; hair.  * A tip from the Fekkai Salon it to spray in the air, and let it land in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The predominant ingredient in this is: Cyclopentasiloxane.  I read the following from Truth and Fitness Website - &amp;#34;...Its ability to impart a wet and silky look makes it an ideal candidate in hair products, both rinse-off and leave-on ones. It’s particularly useful in hair conditioners because it provides a silky feel without weighing the hair down with greasy residue. Because of its water-thin consistency, it helps deliver heavier silicones also contained in a product; for this reason, is often used in conjunction with dimethicone. In fact, as a volatile silicone it quickly evaporates into the air after delivering nutrients to the skin and hair..&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend, as with hairspray or spray deodorant - to keep your eyes, nose, and mouth closed during delivery.&lt;br /&gt;This product not only is said to impart shine, and reduce static.  I honestly do not notice anything.  My hair will have to withstand a dry, Summer wind I guess.  The words I copied and pasted should convince you that the main ingredient is known for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the product - it is a luxury - but oh, how men respond to it!known for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the product - it is a luxury - but oh, how men respond to it!</li>
            <li> Smells mmmm..  Makes your hair look and feel great and smell even better.  I&#x27;d give it 5 stars but it&#x27;s not a very big bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;perfume for the hair&amp;#34; left my long hair smelling like vanilla with a little bit of shine. I liked the shine but the vanilla scent was just okay.  The scent reminded more of food than anything else.</li>
            <li> I love vanilla... make that I LOVE vanilla.  Too bad this has some weird top and middle notes.  I definitely detect coconut, which is one of my least favorite scents.  It seems to have some lasting strength though.  The St. Barth&#x27;s is MUCH better.</li>
            <li> Smells divine!  Just the smell I was looking for,  but sadly it doesn&#x27;t last along time in my hair😢😢😢😢😢. It does give the hair alot of shine but i wish the smell lasted longer. I don&#x27;t want to have to continuously spray this in my hair every couple of hours due to the fact it contains alcohol.</li>
            <li> Alcohol based -- I wasn&#x27;t expecting that!</li>
            <li> Vine Customer Review of Free Product (What&#x27;s this?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need something to make your hair smell pretty, this will do it. I used this after having gone into a store where the owner smokes (despite it being against city ordinance but hey) Love the store, hate how I smell like an ashtray afterwards. This really covered up that nasty smell so kudos for that. This has a Victoria&#x27;s Secret Vanilla-Lace kind of vibe, a musky vanilla reminiscent of 1970&#x27;s cologne. Not my usual choice but it does seem to cover and linger longer than just a perfume. My man thought it smelled good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says that it leaves hair shiny and frizz free but I didn&#x27;t see any kind of benefit like that from it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a purchase for me, but I can see if you frequently go days between washes or have environmental stinkage seeping into your hair, this could be something to look into. It didn&#x27;t leave any kind of residue on my clothing or hands.</li>
            <li> This spray did give my hair a bit more shine, but the scent is heavenly.  I love the scent of vanilla and this spray did not disappoint.  I sprayed it on my hair after washing it and I could still smell it at 5 pm - even after working out and sweating!  It is a subtle scent and not overpowering.  Just very nice.</li>
            <li> I never knew hair fragrance existed before I tested Fekkai Vanilla Cream Hair Fragrance Mist.&lt;br /&gt;This musky vanilla fragrance  is strong when it&#x27;s first sprayed. The strong scent dissipates in 30-60 minutes leaving your hair smelling great for the remainder of the day. (It sprays a very fine mist.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put 3 sprays in my hair &amp; brushed it through. It added fragrance, shine &amp; tamed the static fly-away.&lt;br /&gt;In the past, I&#x27;ve used products designed to add shine to my hair. They were always to &#x27;oily&#x27; for me. Fekkai Fragrance Mist added shine, but not oil.</li>
            <li> I love Fekkai products and I like the light scent of vanilla creme spritzed on my hair.  It is a light mist and does help your hair shine, as well as it gives you a light fragrance, of a flavor most folks love,especially men.  I am glad that it is a &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; fragrance, as your hair is close to your face and I can&#x27;t imagine what it would be like, if it was a heavy fragrance right near my nose, that lingered all day.  I don&#x27;t want to clear a room with a harsh stink, no matter how good it smells.  This is a go to product.  People who hug you will smell it, as your hair will retain the fragrance and you won&#x27;t end up with a headache, as it is light and gives the benefit of added shine.  Who doesn&#x27;t want shiny hair, without being greasy and weighed down.  I highly recommend this product, if you are looking for an added fresh smell, shine and softness to your gorgeous hair.  I would recommend using it with Fekkai products, as they do work together, for best results!</li>
            <li> I tend to be more of a wash and wear (well, wash and then pin up while still wet) hair kind of gal and I don&#x27;t get that excited about hair product.&lt;br /&gt;This one is perfection for my hair.  I have extremely thick, coarse, long hair that tends to get lovely frizzy bits which make it look dull, especially in the southwest Florida humidity.&lt;br /&gt;This Fekkai Hair Fragrance Mist not only scents my hair with a delicious, fresh but warm vanilla (a lovely accent to my usual Stila Creme Bouquet topped with a wee dab of Angel) but it offers just enough gloss to make my coarse tresses look smooth, luminous, and bouncy.  It makes my hair &amp;#34;move&amp;#34; right and look less coarse, without having to cope with heated implements.&lt;br /&gt;How is this different from other frizz serums?  Those typically make my hair look artificially and excessively  slick and almost greasy.  This Fekkai Fragrance Mist gives a much finer, more dispersed application and just makes my hair look healthy and luxurious.</li>
            <li> 2 1/2 stars. Lovely scent, it&#x27;s a vanilla that reminds me of a lip balm I loved in high school- very light and sweet. That said, it fades QUICKLY. Very, very quickly. This won&#x27;t add shine or anything, just a short-term scent. Oh, and it&#x27;s REALLY for your hair-- when it landed on my skin it just smelled like chemicals!</li>
            <li> I have never used or even heard of a hair fragrance mist before, but after trying it I have to say i really love it. It comes in a small perfume style bottle and it only takes a few light spritzes to leave hair smelling lovely and looking shiny.  I was afraid it might leave a slightly oily or sticky residue on the hair, but you really can&#x27;t feel it at all, other than the hair feeling nice and soft.  If you like a vanilla fragrance, then you really can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> Smells like a musky, vanillaish perfume. Im always hoping for a much more truly vanilla scent, ths isnt it. Too perfume for me to wear. As far as shine? Meh. Nothing noticable.</li>
            <li> This has a nice scent which stays pretty well on your hair. I like it but don&#x27;t think I would use it on an ongoing basis. The scent competes with whatever perfume you are wearing.</li>
