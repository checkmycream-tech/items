            <li>I make this purchase for the powder but would have liked to use the mascara too.</li>
            <li>so I started looking for the Magic Minerals products and was delighted to find them on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I like to use this Magic Minerals make up when I&#x27;m going out for an evening as it blends in nicely.  </li>
            <li>Mascara is good, less impressed with that than the powder.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>

            <li>My skin has a more even tone and silky smoothness.  </li>
            <li>Nice &amp; light coverage.  </li>
            <li>so i&#x27;m always looking for the next best thing.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I am well pleased.  </li>
            <li>Have used it for years and love it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love it..</li>
            <li>Magic Minerals are just that</li>
            <li>I love this make up.</li>
            <li>I had purchased some many years ago and found it again on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Seemed so easy.  </li>
            <li>It is technically easy, but a subpar product.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because it looked easy and convenient and was described as a product for all skin tones.</li>
            <li>the actialake up was fine.</li>
            <li>It makes a huge difference reducing age spots, and relieving the under eye darkness.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and evenly.</li>
            <li>The powder is too light for all over</li>
            <li>and it was too light on me.  </li>
            <li>It never looks caked, it looks smooth.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, covers and does not cake up on your face.  </li>
            <li>It even smells cheap.  </li>
            <li>It covers lightly and doesn&#x27;t magnify pores.  </li>
            <li>I am light complected</li>
            <li>My teenage daughters also love it!!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara, with a large brush.</li>
            <li>It really is like magic.</li>
            <li>sometimes the powder is good ,others not good..never constant...</li>
            <li>Other than that good product &amp; was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I use the brush rather than the sponge so it gives a more even &amp; natural look.</li>
            <li>I say give it a try, it&#x27;s certainly worth the $20.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s all in fun.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this mineral powder great coverage can be used with or without base foundation and still will give you excellent coverage.</li>
            <li>I think this is my first review I&#x27;ve left on Amazon, but I felt this product was deserving of it.  </li>
            <li>It is better than Bare Minerals in my opinion and will keep on buying.</li>
            <li>The only good thing is the applicator brush, which is soft.  </li>
            <li>This makeup shipped super fast.  </li>
            <li>smoother and more even color, cover discoloration, last longer,&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush could be a higher quality and the mascara is clumpy when applied</li>
            <li>your lawyers should of made you aware of this...</li>
            <li>I bought this product on a whim at Rite Aid because I needed something quick without driving to the mall and it exceeded my expectations by far!</li>
            <li>Came covered in layers of dust, mascara was so old clumpy crusty the wand would not even pull out with full force</li>
            <li>I will be hard pressed to find anything else that works and looks this good.</li>
            <li>I really like the powder  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t use it at all.</li>
            <li>you are responsible for  the product and its legal Guarantee on it.  </li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>I dd not notice much of a change in coverage, but I had noticed people having issues with the mascara.</li>
            <li>and I really have noticed when she runs out.</li>
            <li>didin&#x27;t really ike it</li>
            <li>much adn</li>
            <li>I did not repurchase this product because it really didn&#x27;t do alot to my face</li>
            <li>It covers very well.</li>
            <li>but I didn’t see that much difference.</li>
            <li>Just a normal face powder, no different than a cheap compact you can buy anywhere.</li>
            <li>LOVE this - it covers as well as much more expensive mineral makeups.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend, and in fact, just re-ordered.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using bare minerals and this is very similar.  </li>
            <li>Overall I would recomend it for people who want to have a little make up on their face to kind of even out their tone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very natural looking</li>
            <li>It is too light to use all over my face, but I can use it to cover up dark spots under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>It did look a little powdery, but used as a finishing powder, it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;no frequent touch up needed&lt;br</li>
            <li>mascara was like tar, must have been extremely old.</li>
            <li>( SIGN OF 13+ MONTHS OLD)</li>
            <li>if that is that old the powder is JUNK.  </li>
            <li>o anyways, this is old, dont know anything else.</li>
            <li>as far as coverage</li>
            <li>it was completely unusable.</li>
            <li>My 13 year old daughter believes this stuff is the do all be all of makeup products.</li>
            <li>I am 57 years old and was hoping that my skin would be a bit equalized</li>
            <li>I love the powder but this has been the 3rd time I&#x27;ve ordered this product and every single mascara that comes with my face powder is dry and can&#x27;t be used.</li>
            <li>I am staying with Bare minerals...</li>
            <li>I used to use bare minerals, but if you have oily skin the bare minerals would cake on your face.</li>
            <li>I have seen better and have seen worse.</li>
            <li>This ended up being taken right away by waste management.  </li>
            <li>first off there was a note on the box that the mascara may be dried out and it was.</li>
            <li>But the it won’t look very natural and it will not last for that long, I don’t know!</li>
            <li>The brush is cheap and like all the other reviews the mascara was dried out that I couldn&#x27;t even get it to open.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> the actialake up was fine. the mascara was dried out &amp; the powder brush had to thtow out ad the brush woild shed itself on my face</li>
            <li> This is like my favorite powder ever. Doesn&#x27;t give me a cakey look, doesn&#x27;t break out my skin and I reapply maybe once through out the day which is great.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Great coverage and evens tone. Makes your complexion look perfect.</li>
            <li> I like to use this Magic Minerals make up when I&#x27;m going out for an evening as it blends in nicely.  It&#x27;s not quite a foundation and not quite a powder - somewhere in between.  You can use the sponge or the brush to apply it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write a review unless ask by Amazon my opinion on a, product.... BUT .... this time is an exception.... I&#x27;m writing this WITHOUT being ask.... JEROME ALEXANDER ... make up is TOTALLY AWESOME!!!! I WON&#x27;T USE ANYTHING ELSE!!!!!USE IT ONCE YOU&#x27;LL BE HOOKED TOO!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the powder but this has been the 3rd time I&#x27;ve ordered this product and every single mascara that comes with my face powder is dry and can&#x27;t be used. I keep the product because I do love the face powder</li>
            <li> Nothing like in the TV ad.  Just a normal face powder, no different than a cheap compact you can buy anywhere.</li>
            <li> I really like the powder  this is the 2nd one I have had. Works great!  The mascara that came with it was broken  . The wand broke off it the tube  there was a sticker on the packaging that said it might do this&#x27;s. I was just in it for the powder!</li>
            <li> This is my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; powder.  Goes on smooth and evenly.</li>
            <li> The mascara was all dried up but there was a disclaimer on the compact as to why the product was at a reduced price.  But I do use the powder regularly.</li>
            <li> It is not a bad product but is not great. It didn&#x27;t do what is was supposed to do in my case. Maybe it works for someone else.</li>
            <li> Love the make-up..........however.........leave the mascara out. It&#x27;s useles.&lt;br /&gt;the Magic Minerals are wonderful!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 5 years. I have sun damage on my face. This product covers the redness perfectly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my 3rd set &amp; I love it. It really is like magic. I use the brush rather than the sponge so it gives a more even &amp; natural look. I got s set for my sister too &amp; she likes it as well.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Will continue to buy an use it.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  My skin has a more even tone and silky smoothness.  Hides imperfections.  Mascara leaves no clumps.  Will continue to purchase as needed.</li>
            <li> smoother and more even color, cover discoloration, last longer,&lt;br /&gt;no frequent touch up needed&lt;br /&gt;dark circles under my eyes disappear in photo...</li>
            <li> Powder great and I like the applicators too. mascara was like tar, must have been extremely old.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I think this is my first review I&#x27;ve left on Amazon, but I felt this product was deserving of it.  This product does not settle in my pores like a lot of powders do.  My teenage daughters also love it!!</li>
            <li> It works good except the mascara that came with it was literally completely dried up. It could have been empty. Other than that good product &amp; was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Nice &amp; light coverage.  But I have weird colored skin (or I think I do anyway) so i&#x27;m always looking for the next best thing.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using bare minerals and this is very similar.  The mascara is great for the top lashes.  The color blended well with my face.</li>
            <li> Received it promptly.  It was what I ordered and great as always.  Both my daughter and I use this product.</li>
            <li> It is too light to use all over my face, but I can use it to cover up dark spots under my eyes.  I really don&#x27;t use it at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed. Bought these as a gift for my sister all mascaras were so dried that they were so hard to open. Lime they were sitting in  warehouse for years. Won&#x27;t be purchasing again. Start rating I&#x27;d give(0)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> excellent powder.  I am well pleased.  Have used it for years and love it.</li>
            <li> This is the best in covering my flaws and spider veins on the side of my nose great product. Fabulous !!!</li>
            <li> I liked it, until my sister stole it for herself!</li>
            <li> The powder is too light for all over BUT it is the greatest concealer around,does not get caked under eyes and conceals very well.(red spots,circles blemishes)</li>
            <li> Good product excellent</li>
            <li> I will admit, I got sucked in via a late-night infomercial.  Seemed so easy.  It is technically easy, but a subpar product.  There is no way this fits all skin tones because I am a light-medium and it was too light on me.  It looked powdery on my skin, which I hate.  The only good thing is the applicator brush, which is soft.  I use it with my other mineral makeup.</li>
            <li> The product came with old/dry mascara that I could not use and the brush was not fully attached to the handle. Very disappointed in the product and they did not offer an option for  refund.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on a whim at Rite Aid because I needed something quick without driving to the mall and it exceeded my expectations by far! I was actually needing a finishing powder to put on over my regular foundation which is liquid and when I used this, it made my skin look so flawless.  I used the brush and not the sponge.  The next day I tried this makeup without my usual foundation and didn&#x27;t like it as much. It did look a little powdery, but used as a finishing powder, it is fantastic. Also, the mascara that came with this set is amazing as well!  I say give it a try, it&#x27;s certainly worth the $20.</li>
            <li> This is the only make up I put on my face. It&#x27;s very natural looking and I get lots of complements!</li>
            <li> first off there was a note on the box that the mascara may be dried out and it was. I thought I just ordered the kit. anyway I used it but did not look good could be me.I am staying with Bare minerals... Like I have for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I can give to my mother may look good on her.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it looked easy and convenient and was described as a product for all skin tones. I am a black woman of dark complexion and was very disappointed when I used it. I would not recommend this for women of colour with darker skin type.</li>
            <li> This is a good product which covers quite well and doesn&#x27;t sink into pores as liquid makeup does.  The brush could be a higher quality and the mascara is clumpy when applied so I don&#x27;t use it at all.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I am over 50, medium complexion. I have some age spots and under eye issues like puffiness and darkness. I use 2 ways, alone without a base, or in combination with a BB cream it it gives my makeup a perfect finish. It makes a huge difference reducing age spots, and relieving the under eye darkness. It never looks caked, it looks smooth. I highly recommend, and in fact, just re-ordered.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It is better than Bare Minerals in my opinion and will keep on buying. The mascara is awesome, too!</li>
            <li> I make this purchase for the powder but would have liked to use the mascara too. The mascara has a clay like consistency. Terribly saddening. :(</li>
            <li> Came covered in layers of dust, mascara was so old clumpy crusty the wand would not even pull out with full force ( SIGN OF 13+ MONTHS OLD) but i managed to dislocate the cap from the wand....  if that is that old the powder is JUNK.  This ended up being taken right away by waste management.  the seller \\&quot;as seen on tv products\\&quot; was very rude and does not want to listen to the customer.  seller should reference [...]  and learn something.  you are responsible for  the product and its legal Guarantee on it.  your lawyers should of made you aware of this... o anyways, this is old, dont know anything else.</li>
            <li> I used to use bare minerals, but if you have oily skin the bare minerals would cake on your face. This jerome alexander is great. Goes on smooth, covers and does not cake up on your face.  I will be hard pressed to find anything else that works and looks this good.</li>
            <li> The mascara was completely dried up.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this mineral powder great coverage can be used with or without base foundation and still will give you excellent coverage.</li>
            <li> Very low quality.  It even smells cheap.  The brush is cheap and like all the other reviews the mascara was dried out that I couldn&#x27;t even get it to open.  Junk make up. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> LOVE this - it covers as well as much more expensive mineral makeups. Mascara is good, less impressed with that than the powder.&lt;br /&gt;All arrived as scheduled. Love Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara, with a large brush. The powder makes my makeup look flawless...Love it..buy this all the time..</li>
            <li> This makeup shipped super fast.  It works really well and it is going to be the mineral makeup I use everyday.</li>
            <li> I dd not notice much of a change in coverage, but I had noticed people having issues with the mascara. well no matter how we try both myself and my husband can not open this mascara we have tried everything even pliers, so if you do want to use the mascara you might reconsider this product. as far as coverage I have seen better and have seen worse. but I do not put the blame on the seller but he might want to reconsider after reading he reviews to stop selling this</li>
            <li> It covers lightly and doesn&#x27;t magnify pores.  However, the mascara was so old and dried out it was completely unusable.</li>
            <li> Each time&lt;br /&gt;i order this the mascara is no good...i wish someone would explain why it is included.this time a note came saying the mascara doesnt do its job,thats why the price is low...it is the same price as always and I never got a note before..sometimes the powder is good ,others not good..never constant...</li>
            <li> My 13 year old daughter believes this stuff is the do all be all of makeup products. What do I know, I&#x27;m just the dad. What I do know is my daughter is happy and I really have noticed when she runs out. I make some stupid dad comment and she freaks. Like, &amp;#34;Are you still using that Minerals stuff?&amp;#34; To which she replies, &amp;#34;Are you saying my face looks bad?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s all in fun. Truth is she loves it and when she&#x27;s about halfway through it she reminds me to reorder, whcih I happiliy do!</li>
            <li> I ordered Jerome Alexander products years ago from QVC. My supply began to run low so I started looking for the Magic Minerals products and was delighted to find them on Amazon.  Magic Minerals are just that -- they are easy to use, have a marvelous way of smoothing and blending on your face and it doesn&#x27;t feel like you have anything heavy or goopy on.  Just wonderful!</li>
            <li> I bought it because it came with green little spots on it to try to hide redness on my face and as soon as I got it I used it.  It worked really good for the price.  I still have it but it&#x27;s now empty.  I still have the mascare tough and it&#x27;s not that bad I&#x27;ve had it for a year now and is still goood.  The brush was actually a bit too hard/harsh and didin&#x27;t really ike it much adn the pad I never used and got lost somewhere unless my sister took it.  I did not repurchase this product because it really didn&#x27;t do alot to my face (wich is dry and have acne.)  Overall I would recomend it for people who want to have a little make up on their face to kind of even out their tone.</li>
            <li> I love this make up. I had purchased some many years ago and found it again on Amazon. It covers very well. I am light complected so I often use it alone and it works well with my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few days ago but I have to say that I find that my face looks white so I wonder how it will look when I get a bit tanned. I also don’t think that the effect is the same you see on the photos or the videos you see in the shops. I am 57 years old and was hoping that my skin would be a bit equalized but I didn’t see that much difference. Do they apply it very thickly? But the it won’t look very natural and it will not last for that long, I don’t know! I hoped for the same effect I saw on the models.</li>
