            <li> Slick Works by Paul Mitchell is great product and it really works well with my short spiky hair cut</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years but this tube is&lt;br /&gt; more runny than usual. They have either changed the product or my tube is not up to par. I am trying to mix it by messaging the tube to mix the contents more. It has made a slight difference.</li>

            <li> This product is hard to find in the beauty stores these days!  I highly recommend this product. It controls the frizzy hair. It doesn&#x27;t leave the hair greasy. It doesn&#x27;t leave any residues and It provides a soft texture to the hair.</li>
            <li> Love how it holds the style.</li>
            <li> This is great with my thin hair.  It gives it body and style along with shine.  Great product!  Hear, hear</li>
            <li> I have shorter hair and this product gives my hair shine and the slightly &amp;#34;piece-y&amp;#34; look.  Other gels don&#x27;t give enough hold and waxes are too stiff and artificial-looking.  I&#x27;ve used this for years.</li>
            <li> Everything came as expected.</li>
            <li> Slick Works is great at creating shine while giving lift and definition to my layers, never weighs my hair down.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this product. I have curly kinky dry hair and when I blow and flat iron my hair, I use this product to tame away my flyaways...especially my hairline where the baby hairs are. I just love it!</li>
            <li> Received it. Great product. Price is bit higher than what I usually pay.</li>
            <li> I love this cream and have used it for years. It is always on my wish list. As I didn&#x27;t get any for Christmas this year, I ordered some myself. I was dismayed when I found out the shipping costs were almost as high and the cost of the 2 tubes I ordered- $9.98 for 2 tubes in an envelope?? I am sure it is available locally and will shop locally in the future. I will only pay this high a price if I can&#x27;t find it elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a number of years.  Besides giving a nice shine to the hair it also adds a bit of control like a hairspray.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all right but doesn&#x27;t hold all that well.</li>
