            <li>Besides the product itself being outstanding, I love the fact that the tub has a texture on it so it won&#x27;t slip out of your hands in the shower--even when your fingers are covered in the product!</li>

            <li>Good product, keeps my hair super soft after use, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>Worth a try and worth the money!</li>
            <li>I was expecting my hair to get super frizzy as it always did on a humid day, but it did not.</li>
            <li>Every product that Moroccanoil makes is a &amp;#34;winner&amp;#34; in my opinion but this particular product is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>i bought my first one for $40 and this one for $28 and will continue to!</li>
            <li>I LOVE dry shampoo for many things</li>
            <li>This stuff is made of all that is right in the world.</li>
            <li>I guess next time I&#x27;ll try to leave it on longer or warm first and see if that helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smart package designers!</li>
            <li>I purchased this mask to accomodate my MorrocanOil Extra Volume Shampoo &amp; Conditioner since I was getting such great results.</li>
            <li>The smell, the texture and effect!&lt;br /&gt;For fine and long hair, its is the best, ever... donÂ´t missing the shine!!</li>
            <li>It is exactly what bleached blonde hair needs to become healthy.</li>
            <li>The supplier was fast!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many products for dry colored hair and split ends, but this one really works!!  </li>
            <li>and I would recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>am very unsatisfied.</li>
            <li>I have fine, very dry hair.</li>
            <li>use it everyday now and love it.</li>
            <li>This is a must for my Hair Repair when my Hair is Dry and Frizzy i use this for a quick repair.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>If I use this too regularly this was a bit too heavy for my hair, I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li>But it does make my hair feel shiny and healthy if only using once a week or less.</li>
            <li>hair feels silky and soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t surprised when I had this product used on my hair at a spa</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It completely lived up to my hopes.  </li>
            <li>so I am an avid dry shampoo user.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping but the color and scent is a little off from my previous one I had bought in a salon and this one seems more clumpy</li>
            <li>I dont want to empty the whole bottle into a squeeze bottle and apply...</li>
            <li>Love this product for my thin hair.</li>

            <li> I dont want to empty the whole bottle into a squeeze bottle and apply...</li>
            <li> Love this product for my thin hair.</li>
            <li> I cannot use masks that are too heavy because they will cause my roots to be even oilier than normal and the cycle would be non-stop!  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and still leaves it really soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> On the day of use, my hair feels extremely silky and smooth and continues for at least a day or two after (before the dry shampoo begins to dry it out again).  </li>
            <li> This mask further helped to repair my extremely dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Second, it truly made my hair feel like new without weighing it down or being too heavy.  </li>
            <li> hair is dry, but when I use the mask it stays oily...</li>
            <li> I could not live without this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few hydrating masks, different brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed with this product does not work, IÂ´m not be able to apply it in my hair for its texture and smell.</li>
            <li> I usually swear by MorrocanOil products and use the oil religiously.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but hopeful about this working for my very damaged, bleached hair.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> No more dry ends.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, when I came home and bought it, it did work...but it didn&#x27;t leave my hair half as shiny or manageable as when it was applied in the spa.</li>
            <li> and they said that they apply it slightly warmed up through a squeeze bottle in lines on your hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is noticeably smoother and softer, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down!</li>
            <li> I waste my money.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily or heavy.</li>
            <li> I have oily hair but very little time to wash every day</li>
            <li> The smell and conditioning lasts days after I tried this...it worked wonders for my thick, cury hair.  </li>
            <li> This product left my hair horrible like oily and Fluff hair in the mean time...</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this one.</li>
            <li> Really bad....</li>
            <li> But... Smelled awful to me.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The product was sent correctly and meet my expectations. It has an excellent quality. Indico this seller.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mask to accomodate my MorrocanOil Extra Volume Shampoo &amp; Conditioner since I was getting such great results. This mask further helped to repair my extremely dry and damaged hair. My hair is noticeably smoother and softer, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down! It withstood a huge test:  I was expecting my hair to get super frizzy as it always did on a humid day, but it did not. I was pleasantly surprised! This product exceeded my expectations as I have been trying to find shampoos/conditioners/mask that actually do what the description says it does, but I will never switch again! Morrocan oil is my product of choice. Plus, it smells heavenly and the smell lingers with you until you wash again (I wash once a week).</li>
            <li> I like it this one it very good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed with this product does not work, IÂ´m not be able to apply it in my hair for its texture and smell. I waste my money.</li>
            <li> This is a must for my Hair Repair when my Hair is Dry and Frizzy i use this for a quick repair.This works excellent adds lots of Shine and repairs my Dry end and leaves me with Frizz Free Hair that i can Manage.Smells Great Also.</li>
            <li> An excellent conditioner.</li>
            <li> It gave my hair sheen and improved its texture!</li>
            <li> Perfect , best product</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing!! My hair is softer and shines more than ever!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is made of all that is right in the world. It is exactly what bleached blonde hair needs to become healthy. I&#x27;ve been bleaching my hair for over 2 years now and this stuff has saved it time and time again.</li>
            <li> Great for a deep condition once a week!</li>
            <li> If I use this too regularly this was a bit too heavy for my hair, I have very fine hair. But it does make my hair feel shiny and healthy if only using once a week or less.Smells amazing too.</li>
            <li> I put a tiny amount on my hair after washing it and leave it in.&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels silky and soft. No more dry ends.&lt;br /&gt;I use it everyday now and love it.</li>
            <li> I have fine, very dry hair. This mask is a wonderful deep conditioner. The best I&#x27;ve tried. My hair is soft and manageable. The mask is weightless, just as advertised. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily or heavy.</li>
            <li> I usually swear by MorrocanOil products and use the oil religiously. I also love the curling mousse a lot so I wasn&#x27;t surprised when I had this product used on my hair at a spa and it was AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when I came home and bought it, it did work...but it didn&#x27;t leave my hair half as shiny or manageable as when it was applied in the spa. I called to ask how they had done it and they said that they apply it slightly warmed up through a squeeze bottle in lines on your hair. I dont want to empty the whole bottle into a squeeze bottle and apply...I guess next time I&#x27;ll try to leave it on longer or warm first and see if that helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not the best Morrocan Oil Product.</li>
            <li> Really bad.... I will not buy this product and the brand Moriccan never again... This product left my hair horrible like oily and Fluff hair in the mean time...</li>
            <li> ships on time..&lt;br /&gt;my hair is dry, but when I use the mask it stays oily...&lt;br /&gt;IÂ´m still testing the mask, for me didnÂ´t supplied expactations yet..</li>
            <li> It is great for the hair, will order it again soon.  Will tell my sisters to order this item too.</li>
            <li> Love this product for my thin hair. Doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and still leaves it really soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> Another great moroccan oil product, helps with dryness and frizz,. Works well on color treated hair and it has a good frangance.</li>

            <li> Fast shipping but the color and scent is a little off from my previous one I had bought in a salon and this one seems more clumpy but I will still use it since I already paid for it.</li>
            <li> Great product and I will always buy it.</li>
            <li> Worked amazingly well! But... Smelled awful to me. It worked wonders on my hair but I will never repurchase because of the smell.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product! it does wonders to my hair!! Best thing about getting it on amazon is that it&#x27;s CHEAPER! i bought my first one for $40 and this one for $28 and will continue to!</li>
            <li> I bought this product and everything went well.&lt;br /&gt;When my mother brought it to me from USA to Brazil, I saw that the procut was expired!!!&lt;br /&gt;We bought it in february and the expiration date is 02/2013.&lt;br /&gt;I am very unsatisfied.</li>
            <li> Good product, keeps my hair super soft after use, but that&#x27;s about it. Don&#x27;t see any difference in hydration. Then again, I&#x27;ve only been using it twice a week for a month.</li>
            <li> The smell, the texture and effect!&lt;br /&gt;For fine and long hair, its is the best, ever... donÂ´t missing the shine!!</li>

            <li> Besides the product itself being outstanding, I love the fact that the tub has a texture on it so it won&#x27;t slip out of your hands in the shower--even when your fingers are covered in the product!

            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few hydrating masks, different brands. I was not impressed with this one.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product! It makes my hair feel so smooth and silky. After using it I always apply the oil (the light version of it) and I love the result! It is a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34;. The supplier was fast! Very happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but hopeful about this working for my very damaged, bleached hair.  It completely lived up to my hopes.  First, this mask smells sooooooo good and the smell lasts until you wash your hair again.  Second, it truly made my hair feel like new without weighing it down or being too heavy.  I absolutely love this product and have since ordered the shampoo and conditioner.  Worth a try and worth the money!</li>
            <li> The smell and conditioning lasts days after I tried this...it worked wonders for my thick, cury hair.  I also color my hair so this product worked well.</li>
