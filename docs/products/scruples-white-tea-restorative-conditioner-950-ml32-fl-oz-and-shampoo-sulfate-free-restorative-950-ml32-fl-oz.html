            <li>This product is FABULOUS!!!!</li>
            <li>but I came to after seeing how beautiful this woman&#x27;s (on YouTube) hair looked after using this combo.</li>

            <li>Tresemme - that made my hair the MOST frizzy and uncontrollable it has ever been !</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>and she ended up buying her own.</li>
            <li>Amazons prices are far superior to the salon price!!</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>and I consider the price a tad over the top, but will continue to use because of the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>And, it&#x27;s WAY more manageable now.</li>
            <li>I love this for my curly hair.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the way my hair feels after using this product</li>
            <li>This product tames the frizzies and allows bountiful beautiful soft curly hair to be revealed.</li>
            <li>Originally provided by my hair salon after keritan...then found it on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>This combo (along with the other things) saved me from chopping off my beautiful hair !</li>
            <li>Love the smell, love the large bottles for the shower!  </li>
            <li>Nice scent, good thick conditioner and rich shampoo.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair shine and makes my hair color more vibrant.</li>
            <li>I follow this with &amp;#34;Scruples White tea magical serum&amp;#34;.</li>

            <li>Had to do some major cleaning up to get containers out of the gooey plastic, and then clean up and off the containers.</li>
            <li>Very Highly Recommended</li>
            <li>I called my hairdresser in a pure panic ready to shave my head.    </li>

            <li>This is a high quality shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Most shampoos dry my hair out and conditioners are never thick and creamy enough for my hair.</li>
            <li>I HATE washing my own hair because it tangles (hair type: fine)</li>
            <li>I once had thick, smooth, silky hair using Pantene Pro-V my entire life (my mom bought it, I was young).</li>

            <li> It is very thick and not watered down, like most products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner as well as some other Scruple products for years</li>
            <li> It was a mess.  </li>
            <li> Too heavy and leaves my hair greasy.  </li>
            <li> I get stopped randomly in stores by women with frizzy hair who ask what I do to make my curls so soft and tamed.</li>
            <li> Also, because it is so heavy the pump does not work at all!  </li>
            <li> try some this past weekend</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> the price shocked me for 10 seconds</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE !</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and I love it. It makes my hair shine and makes my hair color more vibrant.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, love the large bottles for the shower!  You don&#x27;t have to pick them up and squeeze them!!  Nice product.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, good thick conditioner and rich shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love the product but when I opened the box it was shipped in, conditioner was everywhere!!!  It was a mess.  Had to do some major cleaning up to get containers out of the gooey plastic, and then clean up and off the containers.</li>
            <li> Best hair products money can buy!! And this size lasts for months!! I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner as well as some other Scruple products for years and I consider the price a tad over the top, but will continue to use because of the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality shampoo and conditioner.  Originally provided by my hair salon after keritan...then found it on Amazon!  Very Highly Recommended</li>
            <li> Products leak out this was 2x for me im done ordering from here</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is like aroma therapy for my hair. I love it!</li>
            <li> Too heavy and leaves my hair greasy.  Also, I bought it from the salon and it worked perfect so they changed their formula here for the product.  Also, because it is so heavy the pump does not work at all!  I would never spend money on this product again!  Not ever!</li>
            <li> Love these products, they leave my hair in great condition.</li>
            <li> And here I thought I had frizzy hair. This product tames the frizzies and allows bountiful beautiful soft curly hair to be revealed. Tons of compliments when I started using this. So happy to find it here a Amazon.</li>
            <li> I once had thick, smooth, silky hair using Pantene Pro-V my entire life (my mom bought it, I was young). I continued to use it as I grew up and it worked well UNTIL they changed their formula. It then made my hair greasy. I had to switch shampoo. HORRIBLE ! Tresemme - that made my hair the MOST frizzy and uncontrollable it has ever been ! I used it for a while and then switched to Aussie. Even their 3-minute miracle didn&#x27;t help the frizz ! I called my hairdresser in a pure panic ready to shave my head.    After one color treatment and this shampoo and conditioner plus some argan oil of morocco, my hair is back to its smooth, silky, straight self ! And, it&#x27;s WAY more manageable now. This combo (along with the other things) saved me from chopping off my beautiful hair ! DEFINITELY Recommend !</li>
            <li> shampoo &amp; conditioner I&#x27;ve ever bought - the price shocked me for 10 seconds but I came to after seeing how beautiful this woman&#x27;s (on YouTube) hair looked after using this combo. I HATE washing my own hair because it tangles (hair type: fine) so I always go to the salon. Sorry AnnMarie (my hairdresser) you won&#x27;t be seeing me in the salon every week. I had a friend of mine with thicker hair try some this past weekend and she ended up buying her own. This product is FABULOUS!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner ever in my opinion. Discovered it at my salon couple years ago and have never used anything since. Amazons prices are far superior to the salon price!!</li>
            <li> love the product very much -  but  - was dissapointed when the conditioner container arrived partically open so lost product and had a mess to clean up.</li>
            <li> I love this for my curly hair. Most shampoos dry my hair out and conditioners are never thick and creamy enough for my hair. After rinsing the conditioner out I reapply a dime size amount to the ends of my hair. I follow this with &amp;#34;Scruples White tea magical serum&amp;#34;. I get stopped randomly in stores by women with frizzy hair who ask what I do to make my curls so soft and tamed.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality shampoo and conditioner.  It is very thick and not watered down, like most products.  I would highly recommend it.  I would purchase it again in a heartbeat!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the way my hair feels after using this product</li>
