            <li>It&#x27;s okay, nothing special.</li>
            <li>after kiteboarding-  makes my fine hair easier to comb out</li>
            <li>Less than a dime size will do great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a huge change in my hair since I began to use it.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair smooth and does not leave a greasy look</li>
            <li>my hair is so soft and easier to detangles, and smells amazing</li>
            <li>Got here quickly.</li>
            <li>Do not need to use much at all!!</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>But to me buying the lot is worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything from drug store hot oil treatments, to natural remedies like coconut &amp; olive oil, to top of the line salon products &amp;</li>
            <li>The keratin is heavier and could weigh your hair down on top more than the silk conditioner.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and is easy to brush after I apply it.</li>
            <li>We like very much and also use the shampoo.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love this product.</li>
            <li>I really like this leave-in conditioner!</li>
            <li>It does make you hair very soft and it feels a lot healthier than when I first started using it!</li>
            <li>This product was much cheaper on amazon than in a salon.</li>
            <li>We have purchased this product before because we like it so much.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I use the whole line in combination now, which I figured out by experimentation</li>
            <li>This product was much heavier.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t work very well had to go buy from my salon</li>
            <li>I didnt really notice a difference as a result of this product</li>
            <li>Works great on my thick, coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft &amp; shiny!!</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t weigh down fine hair.</li>
            <li>just a dime size leaves my hair so very soft.</li>
            <li>the second day.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll go back to my original leave in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m letting my hair grow and am trying hard to keep the ends healthy.  </li>
            <li>After washing my hair with an all natural shampoo I use this conditioner and OH MY GOODNESS</li>
            <li>If your goal is soft, shiny hair</li>
            <li>My hairdresser says too many harsh products dry my hair out &amp; leave thirsty, split ends that have to be cut off.</li>
            <li>I use the keratin on the ends because they usually need more conditioning (dead ends).  </li>

            <li> a little really does go a long way!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It leaves my color-treated, dry blonde hair silly smooth and softer than anything else I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down &amp; always makes it feel soft.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, be careful not to use too much or your hair will just look greasy</li>
            <li> I use a small dime size amour after I get out of the shower and it leaves my hair so soft!</li>
            <li> It felt dry</li>
            <li> Used and recommended by my stylist, I use this every day (shampoo every other day-fine dry hair).  </li>
            <li> On those off days, was instructed to wet my hair and apply as one would after shampooing.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy like some other hair products do.  </li>
            <li> I am black and I have been trying to grow out my relaxer for a few months and my hair is starting to get really thick and at times hard to manage.</li>
            <li> Use this everyday.  </li>
            <li> Only need a small dab for my thick tangled hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to grow my hair out to waist length for the past few years but keep getting stuck around mid-back.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a dramatic increase in my hair&#x27;s health though yet.</li>
            <li> one makes my feel oily and dirty</li>
            <li> I got frustrated watching her chop inches off my hair every time I went in.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is a must have for my crazy frizzy hair!  </li>
            <li> What a disappointment!!!!!!!!!!</li>

            <li> Love tis product! Leaves hair soft &amp; shiny!!</li>
            <li> This leave in conditioner is amazing! I use a small dime size amour after I get out of the shower and it leaves my hair so soft! A little goes a long way, be careful not to use too much or your hair will just look greasy lol</li>
            <li> Great price and transaction!</li>
            <li> It says that it is supposed to control frizz, it does not. It does make you hair very soft and it feels a lot healthier than when I first started using it! Overall, I love this product.</li>
            <li> Not that great, much prefer the more pricier it&#x27;s a 10 leave in treatment.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  I use it when I get off the river after kiteboarding-  makes my fine hair easier to comb out</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is the best conditioner I have ever used. I am black and I have been trying to grow out my relaxer for a few months and my hair is starting to get really thick and at times hard to manage. My hairdresser told me about this leave in conditioner. After washing my hair with an all natural shampoo I use this conditioner and OH MY GOODNESS my hair is so soft and easier to detangles, and smells amazing and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it. I recommend this product to everyone! It is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Got here quickly. It is a great product. Leaves hair shiny and smooth! This product was much cheaper on amazon than in a salon.</li>
            <li> Works great, does not get greasy or weigh down my hair and smells great too.</li>
            <li> This line of products have my hair AMAZING!!! I CANT FIND A BETTER WORD THAN AMAZING HAIR.</li>
            <li> This did nothing for my hair!  It didn&#x27;t add any moisture at all.  It felt dry and I had to use a massive gob to even get it through my hair.  It&#x27;s a 10 styling cream is twenty times better, but I can&#x27;t find it anywhere anymore, so I tried this. What a disappointment!!!!!!!!!!</li>

This is the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever tried, even out of other &#x27;It&#x27;s a 10&#x27; product lines. If your goal is soft, shiny hair the Silk Express line is your best bet. I use the whole line in combination now, which I figured out by experimentation gives me the result I want. If you&#x27;re only going to try 1 thing I would go with the shampoo. But to me buying the lot is worth it. I&#x27;d rather spend my cash on something that actually works.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! It leaves my color-treated, dry blonde hair silly smooth and softer than anything else I&#x27;ve used! Great product.</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t tell a difference when I use this product. Maybe its just me.</li>
            <li> I use 4 products from It&#x27;s A 10, and this one is exceptionally good! My hair feels and looks like silk with shine!</li>
            <li> My beautician used it on my hair the last several times I was there and I loved the way my hair felt.  I love it!!</li>
            <li> This is a great leave in product to use. I shampoo, condition with any brand and then use this added to finish it off. Works as a great detangular as well as serum all in one. Smells great, soft hydrated hair! Must have for over processed hair. Great for summertime.</li>
            <li> good stuff make your hair more manageble</li>
            <li> Love how my hair feels!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s magic!  Works great on my thick, coarse hair.  Love it.</li>
            <li> detangles my long hair and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Best leave-in conditioner I have ever used!  Smells WONDERFUL and just a dime size leaves my hair so very soft.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist uses this product on me when I visit her every 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Just a little really does go a long way!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to anyone who wants a great conditioner and styling product.</li>
            <li> Compared to the spray (miracle leave in) This product was much heavier. I use it on occasion, but will be sticking to he miracle leave in spray!</li>
            <li> Great product!!! I love it! I&#x27;ve noticed a huge change in my hair since I began to use it. My hair feels soft and is easy to brush after I apply it. It smells fabulous too!!!</li>
            <li> This is awesome to get out tangles in your hair!!! Fast delivery and great price!</li>
            <li> Smells great, detangles better than most leave in&#x27;s, does make hair style smoother.  I don&#x27;t see a dramatic increase in my hair&#x27;s health though yet.</li>
            <li> Hair feels great! Do not need to use much at all!! Less than a dime size will do great! Very happy.</li>
            <li> I like the silk express. Came within 5 days of ordering. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> All of the 10 products are great.  I especially like the miracle silk conditioner and the conditioner with keratin.  I use the miracle silk conditioner on the top of my head and the conditioner with keratin on the ends.  The keratin is heavier and could weigh your hair down on top more than the silk conditioner.  I use the keratin on the ends because they usually need more conditioning (dead ends).  Works awesome!</li>
            <li> I really like this leave-in conditioner! It smells wonderful and leaves my hair soft!  My daughter has really curlly hair that gets snarled all the time and works awesome on her hair!</li>
            <li> This is awesome.  I&#x27;m letting my hair grow and am trying hard to keep the ends healthy.  This is a great leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Use this everyday.  Love how it makes your hair feel and smell.</li>
            <li> I prefer the spray leave in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;This one makes my feel oily and dirty the second day.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll go back to my original leave in.</li>
            <li> If you have knots in your hair, this is the product for you!!  Leaves hair smooth and does not leave a greasy look</li>
            <li> Good product for a leave-n conditioner.  Definitely would recommend the product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t work very well had to go buy from my salon</li>
            <li> i love this leave in conditioner. great product. can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I didnt really notice a difference as a result of this product</li>
            <li> Love the product. Retailer great.</li>
            <li> Used and recommended by my stylist, I use this every day (shampoo every other day-fine dry hair).  On those off days, was instructed to wet my hair and apply as one would after shampooing.  My hair is great using this product this way.  Love the product.</li>
            <li> Amazing for damaged, frizzy hair. Doesn&#x27;t weigh down fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair. My daughter&#x27;s hairstylist recommended this to us. We like very much and also use the shampoo.</li>
