            <li>It&#x27;s good to have when your job requires it</li>
            <li>but it is good for just the essentials.</li>
            <li>Even when I get to my destination it is great to be able to see where items are as you rummage through.....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Luckily I found this bag on amazon, the price was perfect for me as I didn’t want to invest very much since I don’t go to a lot of games.</li>
            <li>Love this bag!</li>
            <li>The bag was nice however the description states the bag is 7.5 inches by 8.5\\&quot; by 3\\&quot; and the bag I recieved was 7\\&quot; by 7\\&quot; by 3\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice cosmetic bag, but I carry it to ball</li>
            <li>and I keep the guest bath neat and tidy too.</li>
            <li>The bag check handlers loved it because they could see all of the contents easily.  </li>
            <li>Good luck getting all my stuff in my pockets, I can barely fit my phone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Did I spend more in the end?  </li>
            <li>It is the perfect size and can fit a considerable amount in it.</li>
            <li>The cross body strap is the perfect</li>
            <li>I love the strap across the shoulder</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>It is perfect because she won&#x27;t get hers mixed up with anyone else</li>
            <li>This is ok.</li>
            <li>I bought this item as a toiletry bag to bring to the shower, and I&#x27;m quite pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I love my bag.</li>
            <li>and I love the crossover.</li>
            <li>It fit most of my stuff.</li>
            <li>plastic seems sturdy and the zipper worked perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>Everything fit well in the bag, and was still lightweight and easy to care.</li>
            <li>Perfect for attending football games, just wish the shoulder strap was a little longer.</li>
            <li>so the bag can be comfortably worn as a cross-body satchel.</li>
            <li>I would have liked the shoulder strap to be much longer.</li>
            <li>I could barely fit a eyeshadow compact into it yet alone all my makeup.</li>
            <li>This is good if you work in a secured facility or going to a place that requires a clear bag for security.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right size and love the adjustable shoulder strap.</li>
            <li>This is a perfect small size for those who don&#x27;t need to carry in a lot of items.  </li>
            <li>and it is very convenient when passing through security/ medal detectors :)</li>
            <li>Bought this to take into NFL games for the new purse rule and love it.  </li>
            <li>I loved it for the exact same reasons...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I would purchase them again, but they have been useful.</li>
            <li>I RARELY check a bag anymore.</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>When you adjust the strap to the longest it falls right at my hip – I don’t think this could be worn crossbody, but I wanted something I could put on my shoulder.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works well &amp; is the right size for her to take on the floor or keep in her locker.</li>
            <li>Is just find for the price not bad, I used this bag for work is very portable.</li>
            <li>The quality is nice for the price, but it&#x27;s not a &#x27;lifetime&#x27; type of product-more long term disposable.</li>
            <li>Probably - but I got exactly what I wanted..  </li>
            <li>Plus I got it quickly, thanks!</li>
            <li>I did like the versatility of being able to use it as a cross body or shoulder bag or around my waist</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I never got to use it.  </li>
            <li>This bag tore the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Zipper broke with first use</li>
            <li>Perfect size for brush/comb, money, key and ID and with a shoulder strap which are hard to find.</li>
            <li>Needed a clear bag for an NFL football game and this was perfect!  </li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>All women who plan on attending NFL games should really buy this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than what I expected for the price I paid.</li>
            <li>so I feel much safer with it.</li>
            <li>Its okay .I expected the strap to be a bit longer.  </li>
            <li>Overall, these were fairly cheap and you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I like this better than other bags I&#x27;ve seen because I can wear it over the shoulder</li>
            <li>I ordered three of these and at first, they were fine, but I did have issues down the road with the plastic &amp;#34;ring&amp;#34; holding the strap on breaking for basically no reason.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item if you go to NFL games.</li>
            <li>I was able to get some wrinkles out by blowing my hair dryer on it a little.</li>
            <li>For the price I’m happy &amp; recommend if you need something to bring to a game!</li>
            <li>I may order a few more for my females friends</li>
            <li>no digging around blindly is necessary when you can see right through the bag.</li>
            <li>Way smaller than expected, very cheaply made and</li>
            <li>I bought this bag for the upcoming football season and the NFL&#x27;s new purse rule.</li>
            <li>I bought this item to meet the new NFL regulations.</li>
            <li>I also bought this bag to use for football games per the new bag rules.  </li>
            <li>(if you&#x27;re a small to medium build up top).  </li>
            <li>Nice tote bag, only problem strap not long enough for cross body bag.</li>
            <li>The bag arrived faster than expected and customer service was quick to respond to begin processing my return with no problems.  </li>
            <li>but I think it will be fine for the few times</li>
            <li>but my redskins clear came just in time</li>
            <li>My mother ordered this to keep her belongings in at work now that they have to have clear cases.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll hold your shampoos, soap bottles, and the small things, as long as you don&#x27;t mind not being able to zip it.</li>
            <li>I bought this item for working at Sears because if we keep our personal belongings with us we need to have a clear bag so they can see everything in it.</li>
            <li>Then one month later the zipper completely broke....unrepairable.</li>
            <li>Got this bag if your looking for a crossbody bag, dont get this, it barely crossed over my 5 yr olds body.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After a week of *heavy* use, there were 2 areas where the stitching had come loose from the plastic, but the bag was still usable and sound.  </li>
            <li>In other words, they are all very crumbled.  </li>
            <li>The strap is shorter than expected and wouldn&#x27;t really work as a cross body purse house.</li>
            <li>Like the material more than a similar one I have but came with a broken strap making it unusable for what I needed it for.</li>
            <li>The strap is not LONG at all.  </li>
            <li>bag is nothing fancy; but I just need it to hold my odds and ends that I want to take into the game so that is fine with me.</li>
            <li>I am very disappointed as the idea was great, price was reasonable, and delivery was prompt.  </li>

            <li> I am very disappointed as the idea was great, price was reasonable, and delivery was prompt.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it will last too long</li>
            <li> but the strap isn&#x27;t long enough,</li>
            <li> Thanks to the NFL rules I had to find a clear bag or stuff my pockets to attend an upcoming game.</li>
            <li> The strap that came with it would probably be ok for wearing under a bulky coat (or those in the south who don&#x27;t have to deal with cold weather!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I wanted a long strap to carry it \\&quot;messenger</li>
            <li> some of the bags they are now offering for this use don&#x27;t have long straps).  </li>
            <li> The strap wasn&#x27;t quite as long as I wanted it</li>
            <li> I planned to use it as a shoulder bag or around my waist for a week long vacation at Disney.  </li>
            <li> This bag was quite smaller than what I expected: however, it met the purpose.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers mentioned, the strap is not very long.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the right size to take with you inside a NFL or baseball game.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a long term fix, but it&#x27;s embarrassing when it breaks!</li>
            <li> Only complaint is the strap is short so definitely cannot be used as a shoulder bag.</li>
            <li> The plastic is pretty thin, not a lot of room</li>
            <li> The NFL&#x27;s bags were too big and bulky for the few items I need to carry into the games.</li>
            <li> Fully extended, when I wore it as a cross body bag, the top edge hit just at the base of my ribs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ended up using the clip to attach the strap back to the small fabric look that once held the ring.</li>
            <li> Purchased for use at an NFL game due to new purse policies.  </li>
            <li> They were so compactly packed that it is impossible to smooth them out.  </li>
            <li> So, you have to have a clear bag now to take into an NFL game...  </li>
            <li> game venues are asking that clear bags be used&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I wanted it long enough to go over several layers of bulky clothing/coats - it gets chilly up here in the north); but one of the reasons I bought this bag was that the strap was removable</li>
            <li> did not like this purse at all lasted less then a week until it started to rip.</li>
            <li> I would of like for it to been a little longer, but it will do the job.</li>
            <li> The vinyl is heavy duty, as are the straps and edging.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a flimsy piece of junk, though the zipper isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;d call heavy</li>
            <li> Purchased for a NFL game, (no regular purses allowed).</li>
            <li> Not too small.</li>
            <li> This bag is well made but REALLY small....</li>

            <li> Is just find for the price not bad, I used this bag for work is very portable.</li>
            <li> So, you have to have a clear bag now to take into an NFL game...  and I wanted a long strap to carry it \\&quot;messenger bag\\&quot; style (some of the bags they are now offering for this use don&#x27;t have long straps).  The strap wasn&#x27;t quite as long as I wanted it (I wanted it long enough to go over several layers of bulky clothing/coats - it gets chilly up here in the north); but one of the reasons I bought this bag was that the strap was removable - I just bought a longer strap to replace the once that came with it..  Did I spend more in the end?  Probably - but I got exactly what I wanted..  The strap that came with it would probably be ok for wearing under a bulky coat (or those in the south who don&#x27;t have to deal with cold weather!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the strap I bought: [[ASIN:B002PWWKPE 9031 CANVAS SHOULDER BAG STRAP BLACK]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bag is nothing fancy; but I just need it to hold my odds and ends that I want to take into the game so that is fine with me.</li>
            <li> This bag meets the needs that I purchased it for. I really like it and it is very convenient when passing through security/ medal detectors :)</li>
            <li> The bag was nice however the description states the bag is 7.5 inches by 8.5\\&quot; by 3\\&quot; and the bag I recieved was 7\\&quot; by 7\\&quot; by 3\\&quot;.  The bag arrived faster than expected and customer service was quick to respond to begin processing my return with no problems.  If the bag was the stated size I would be keeping it.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for working at Sears because if we keep our personal belongings with us we need to have a clear bag so they can see everything in it. It is the perfect size and can fit a considerable amount in it. The cross body strap is the perfect length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived it was folded so it took a bit to get it unwrinkled but it looks great now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good quality for the price</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for for NFL games</li>
            <li> Love that I can throw this over my shoulder, it&#x27;s the perfect size too! Plus I got it quickly, thanks!</li>
            <li> I bought this bag for the upcoming football season and the NFL&#x27;s new purse rule. I need something small and not too expensive to carry my things in the games with. I received it today and it will work perfect. Not too small. Not too big. just right. I love the strap across the shoulder so I don&#x27;t have to worry about setting my purse down during tailgating for the game. All women who plan on attending NFL games should really buy this. I may order a few more for my females friends I go to games with.</li>
            <li> I chose this bag because it pictured a clip on the strap.  I planned to use it as a shoulder bag or around my waist for a week long vacation at Disney.  The bag does not feature a clip, so I had to remove it over my head each time which was annoying.  I did like the versatility of being able to use it as a cross body or shoulder bag or around my waist (if you&#x27;re a small to medium build up top).  As other reviewers mentioned, the strap is not very long.  Fully extended, when I wore it as a cross body bag, the top edge hit just at the base of my ribs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it was a great purchase for the price.  It held my mid-sized point &amp; shoot, my phone, snacks, an altoids box that I used to hold extra camera accessories &amp; as my wallet, maps, pens, tickets, etc.  The bag check handlers loved it because they could see all of the contents easily.  I loved it for the exact same reasons...no digging around blindly is necessary when you can see right through the bag. :)  The vinyl is heavy duty, as are the straps and edging.  It&#x27;s not a flimsy piece of junk, though the zipper isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;d call heavy duty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week of *heavy* use, there were 2 areas where the stitching had come loose from the plastic, but the bag was still usable and sound.  The quality is nice for the price, but it&#x27;s not a &#x27;lifetime&#x27; type of product-more long term disposable. It&#x27;s better than what I expected for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Bought it to take to an NFL game. It&#x27;s just the right size and love the adjustable shoulder strap. Perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> Perfect bag for my wife to use when attending Football games. Fits all her belongings and its allowed in the stadium</li>
            <li> These are good for travel because you can see what you have at a glance. I gave some away and my friends also like them. I don&#x27;t think I would purchase them again, but they have been useful.</li>
            <li> I bought this bag to take to NFL games since they changed the rules about what you can and can&#x27;t take into the stadiums. I like this better than other bags I&#x27;ve seen because I can wear it over the shoulder so I feel much safer with it. The price is great also. I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> The picture and the description state that the strap is detachable.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this via Prime from eStores-LLC and the strap was NOT detachable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will be easier to replace the strap than return the bag.</li>
            <li> I thought that this bag would be bigger but it was satisfactory. It fit most of my stuff. It&#x27;s good to have when your job requires it</li>
            <li> I got for the game but my redskins clear came just in time so I didn&#x27;t have to use it for that but I will use it for something else</li>
            <li> I bought this item to meet the new NFL regulations. The NFL&#x27;s bags were too big and bulky for the few items I need to carry into the games. This item is the perfect size to carry everything I need. The strap is adjustable so the bag can be comfortably worn as a cross-body satchel. I highly recommend this item if you go to NFL games.</li>
            <li> Used as my daughters snack bag for kindergarten.  It is perfect because she won&#x27;t get hers mixed up with anyone else and she can see what she has.</li>
            <li> Needed a clear bag for an NFL football game and this was perfect!  I don&#x27;t think it will last too long but I think it will be fine for the few times I will use it and the price was great!</li>
            <li> Its okay .I expected the strap to be a bit longer.  I would suggest the bag to others if asked</li>
            <li> This bag is well made but REALLY small....I needed a bigger bag....my suggestion is to try one of their larger ones</li>
            <li> Yes I like it but the strap isn&#x27;t long enough, I though it be on my side but it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> did not like this purse at all lasted less then a week until it started to rip. do not buy.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the NFL rules I had to find a clear bag or stuff my pockets to attend an upcoming game. Good luck getting all my stuff in my pockets, I can barely fit my phone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily I found this bag on amazon, the price was perfect for me as I didn’t want to invest very much since I don’t go to a lot of games. The bag just arrived and I think it will work for my needs. When you adjust the strap to the longest it falls right at my hip – I don’t think this could be worn crossbody, but I wanted something I could put on my shoulder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic seems sturdy and the zipper worked perfectly fine. For the price I’m happy &amp; recommend if you need something to bring to a game!</li>
            <li> This is ok. I would of like for it to been a little longer, but it will do the job.</li>
            <li> the size is perfect and I like the shoulder strap&lt;br /&gt;and it was perfect for work. This was my 2nd one</li>
            <li> Purchased for use at an NFL game due to new purse policies.  This is a perfect small size for those who don&#x27;t need to carry in a lot of items.  The strap is shorter than expected and wouldn&#x27;t really work as a cross body purse house. Unfortunately I never got to use it.  The zipper was defective and wouldn&#x27;t close. The purse never even made it to the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add that the seller promptly refunded my money when contacted about the defective product.  I would not hesitate to do business with the seller again.</li>
            <li> This bag worked well for taking into the statium recently.  Everything fit well in the bag, and was still lightweight and easy to care.</li>
            <li> I bought this to take to NFL games.  I got what I paid for, I guess.  The plastic purse part works for my needs.  The strap was way short, so I took it off and exchanged it for a strap from another bag so I could wear it cross-body.</li>
            <li> Nice tote bag, only problem strap not long enough for cross body bag. Bought for NFL game and strap came to the side of my belly, otherwise made well.</li>
            <li> I bought this bag not only to use for my makeup but also to use to carry on the weekends.  It is convenient to carry to outside event where your bags are checked.</li>
            <li> I also bought this bag to use for football games per the new bag rules.  I purchased three with the intent of decorating them to give as gifts.  They were so compactly packed that it is impossible to smooth them out.  In other words, they are all very crumbled.  I am very disappointed as the idea was great, price was reasonable, and delivery was prompt.  Packaging must be improved to receive as pictured.  They are useless to me and not worth the return postage.  Will be trashed.</li>
            <li> Was not big as a thought</li>
            <li> This is a nice cosmetic bag, but I carry it to ball games.&lt;br /&gt;Many game venues are asking that clear bags be used&lt;br /&gt;to carry your contents.</li>
            <li> This item crumpled and wrinkled. I was able to get some wrinkles out by blowing my hair dryer on it a little. Then one month later the zipper completely broke....unrepairable.</li>
            <li> Perfect size. Fits everything my regular purse did. Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> This bag was quite smaller than what I expected: however, it met the purpose. I use it instead of a tote for NFL games at the stadium.</li>
            <li> I keep getting compliments about this purse when I visit CA Prisons. Perfect size for brush/comb, money, key and ID and with a shoulder strap which are hard to find. Great price as well.</li>
            <li> Got this bag if your looking for a crossbody bag, dont get this, it barely crossed over my 5 yr olds body.  Way smaller than expected, very cheaply made and Im highly disappointed in it.</li>
            <li> Purchased for a NFL game, (no regular purses allowed). the product did the trick of holding the phone, glasses, keys money etc. will never use again.</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a toiletry bag to bring to the shower, and I&#x27;m quite pleased with it. It&#x27;ll hold your shampoos, soap bottles, and the small things, as long as you don&#x27;t mind not being able to zip it. It&#x27;s got sturdy material that can take on water and hold a lot. I&#x27;m happy to have bought it.</li>
            <li> Needs an outSide pocket&lt;br /&gt;Wider</li>
            <li> this is a smaller bag than the 12 x 12 x 6 size that NFL limits for stadiums.  It looks and performs like a small purse.  about 6 x 8.</li>
            <li> Perfect for attending football games, just wish the shoulder strap was a little longer. I&#x27;m short and it still lays up under my arm when wearing it across my body.</li>
            <li> My mother ordered this to keep her belongings in at work now that they have to have clear cases. It works well &amp; is the right size for her to take on the floor or keep in her locker.</li>
            <li> I love my bag. Only complaint is the strap is short so definitely cannot be used as a shoulder bag. I use this bag for work.</li>
            <li> Bought this to take into NFL games for the new purse rule and love it.  Perfect size and I love the crossover.</li>
            <li> The strap is not LONG at all.  It&#x27;s definitely not a cross body bag at all.  I&#x27;m so disappointed!  😔</li>
            <li> The plastic is pretty thin, not a lot of room but it is good for just the essentials. This is good if you work in a secured facility or going to a place that requires a clear bag for security. I would have liked the shoulder strap to be much longer.</li>
            <li> Way smaller then I thought it was going to be. I could barely fit a eyeshadow compact into it yet alone all my makeup.</li>
            <li> This bag tore the first time I used it. It&#x27;s the right size to take with you inside a NFL or baseball game. But, it tore on my way home.</li>
            <li> Like the material more than a similar one I have but came with a broken strap making it unusable for what I needed it for. I may return it.</li>
            <li> Zipper broke with first use</li>
            <li> I ordered three of these and at first, they were fine, but I did have issues down the road with the plastic &amp;#34;ring&amp;#34; holding the strap on breaking for basically no reason. I ended up using the clip to attach the strap back to the small fabric look that once held the ring. It&#x27;s a long term fix, but it&#x27;s embarrassing when it breaks! Overall, these were fairly cheap and you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a transparent travel bag for my carry-on. This is perfect. Pack it ontop of your carry on and slip it out into the bin for TSA inspection....most of the time they never have to unzip it.....unless you&#x27;re silly enough to overpack it with shampoo and conditioner that is over the fluids limit.....I RARELY check a bag anymore. Love this bag! Even when I get to my destination it is great to be able to see where items are as you rummage through.....I hardly ever get cut on my razor  and I keep the guest bath neat and tidy too.</li>
