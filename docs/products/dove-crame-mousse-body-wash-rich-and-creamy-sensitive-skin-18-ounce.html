            <li>This is one the best body washes I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>Started using this wonderful whipped soap when I had breast cancer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The product also says, use it for three weeks for best results.</li>
            <li>This is wonderful body wash.  </li>
            <li>I shared this with my daughter when she flew out for a visit and her reaction was good but not as impressed I am.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>This is a great product to use as a subscribe and save item.  </li>
            <li>This is a great body wash</li>
            <li>Great for the skin</li>
            <li>Dove Cr&amp;egrave;me Body Wash, Visible Care Toning is a great way to moisturize skin.</li>
            <li>that isn&#x27;t floral or girly, so he&#x27;s happy with that.</li>
            <li>It is however, a great smelling body wash that improves the quality and tone of your skin.</li>
            <li>Thrilled you had this!</li>
            <li>the body wash lathers up very nicely and it smells good.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant and not heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is easily the body wash&#x27;s best attribute though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells good.</li>
            <li>The product is really good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So: four stars for a good product with noticeable benefits, but one star off for making claims that in our experience seem to be a stretch.</li>
            <li>It is a beloved brand</li>
            <li>My skin felt good afterwards.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep buying this when I can catch a good sale.</li>
            <li>Suffice it to say, this is a good body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have always loved Dove products.</li>
            <li>body wash feels good and smells good.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Dove Creme Body Wash, Visible Care Toning&amp;#34; is a good body wash, but after using it for 2 weeks, I did not see the claimed: &amp;#34;visibly more beautiful skin in just one week&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This body wash foams up wonderfully and makes for a truely relaxing experience in the shower.  </li>
            <li>We both love it!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to figure out what could be causing it, but now I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s this body wash!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Just make sure you USE A LOOFAH OR FACIAL/BODY SCRUB, because it&#x27;s meant to lather!</li>
            <li>my skin does appear to be more toned!</li>
            <li>Nice lather, cleans well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is off-putting to me -- it kind of smells like Aloe</li>
            <li>This body was is really nice.</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>But if you make it nice and sudsy like the instructions say, it works like a dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smell is nice, and it doesnt last&lt;br</li>
            <li>It lathers quite nicely</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I notice any improvement in my skin tone, but it&#x27;s great as a moisturizing body wash and moisturizers while still leaving you feeling clean</li>
            <li>What I liked best is it washes off nicely with no residue, but my skin felt soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>It has a light pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>They work the best for me so far.</li>
            <li>It is very rich and creamy and lathers up nicely.</li>
            <li>The scent on the body was is a nice pleasant fresh smell, very light.</li>
            <li>It has a mild pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>but this soap makes me feel clean and good, which is all that matters to me.</li>
            <li>It certainly does a good job as a cleaner, and it is cost effective.</li>
            <li>I love to shower with this body wash.  </li>
            <li>Each day that I used this product made me itch more than the day before.</li>
            <li>my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will make sure to never ever buy this product for myself.</li>
            <li>my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will make sure to never ever buy this product for myself.</li>
            <li>Have this on &#x27;Safe and Sub&#x27;.</li>
            <li>My 1.99 Suave Body Wash works much better than this.</li>
            <li>and I love their soaps and deodarants.</li>
            <li>I love scents, and I love neutral products with no</li>
            <li>order it with Subscribe and Save and love the convenience of never having to go to the store for body wash or running out of body wash.</li>
            <li>Maybe a more moisturized feeling.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say my skin feels more toned, though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not taking off any stars at this point, since I still don&#x27;t know for sure what is causing it.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using it, I seem more prone to break outs, but I don&#x27;t know for sure if its bc of this product.</li>
            <li>and I just love the scent.  </li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;ve squirted the wash onto your poof, it looks/feels more like conditioner or lotion rather than body wash.</li>
            <li>so we were glad to give this Dove Creme Body Wash, Visible Care Toning a try.  </li>
            <li>my family liked is that this wash was creamy and smooth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a nice body wash that does lightly moisturize.</li>
            <li>It certainly hasn&#x27;t hurt, and my skin seems very nice.</li>
            <li>I felt like I had to use more than \\&quot;normal\\&quot; to get a nice, rich lather.</li>
            <li>Not like a pregnant lady glow, but in a healthy kind of way that it hadn&#x27;t before.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good all around body wash as long as you don&#x27;t expect the bold claim that it will give you &amp;#34;visibly more beautiful skin in just one week&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The lather is lovely and soft and also, the smell is great.</li>
            <li>It rinses off clean without any greasy residue and leaves a nice, clean, refreshing, appley scent.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is large and you get a lot - a good value.  </li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t love the flip up securing mechanism on the bottom; if it&#x27;s not latched securely I can see the wash leaking everywhere.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m sure my advanced age doesn&#x27;t help in establishing this either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was gentle, and I loved the feel and smell.</li>
            <li>Like a \\&quot;I smell like heaven all the time\\&quot; kind of smell&lt;br /&gt;+It&#x27;s fun.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s nice and rich and creamy, with a mild scent.</li>
            <li>I love to be clean.  </li>
            <li>It washes off easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very mild all around.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I first got it, I sniffed it and thought it had a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>The scent is clean, light, and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, a fine product.</li>
            <li>love a lot of things about this body wash&lt;br /&gt;+It smells clean, but not like clean linens.</li>
            <li>Lathers great, pleasant subtle scent, rinses away easily.  </li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t expect a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>the \\&quot;Olay 2-In-1 Advanced Ribbons</li>
            <li>Advanced Moisture Body Wash 18 Oz</li>
            <li>They work fabulously together.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am an Amazon Vine Reviewer that gets free products in exchange for my reviews.  </li>
            <li>…it comes from free to my door</li>
            <li>I enjoy taking a shower at night now.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently become a follower of Dove products, and I am happy to report that after testing this for a month, it has not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Given that, I appreciate the smooth feeling I get when I step out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I absolutely fell in love with that body wash and have since ordered it many times under the subscribe and save program.  </li>
            <li>What I love about this body wash is the light and clean scent and the mild lather that isn&#x27;t stripping to skin.</li>
            <li>Very fresh and light.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying this body wash very much.</li>
            <li>She is generally pretty pleased and continues to use the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to love this body wash when it first came out</li>
            <li>I feel clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>I feel clean after I use it.</li>
            <li>It lathers up well and rinses clean with no residue.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t keep its promising of more toned skin in one week, but otherwise, it&#x27;s a fantastic moisturizing body wash.</li>
            <li>My first thought is that the bottle shape/size wasn&#x27;t great for those of us with smaller hands.</li>
            <li>So much, that when I run out, I&#x27;ll gladly buy it.</li>
            <li>Worked better with a luffa rather than just applying it straight to your skin.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t super sudsy, but it got us clean and didn&#x27;t leave us oily.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that it makes my skin look any better, but I haven&#x27;t ever really had problems with the way my skin looks.</li>
            <li>This body wash came out very creamy and felt like it was doing a great job of leaving me clean but not stripping every bit of moisture out of my skin at the same time.  </li>
            <li>I have used all the other Visible Care body washes and they are all great and do as they claim.</li>
            <li>and I prefer to use something that smells fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>It makes you feel clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes your skin feel clean, fresh, and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like there is some super rave you give about body wash.</li>
            <li>&quot; I&#x27;m sold, ring it up and get it to me quickly.  </li>
            <li>The scent is extremely mild.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy this again just for the scent, and mild cleaning power, but, not for the toning claim.</li>
            <li>There was a lot of lather and a mild, soapy scent.</li>
            <li>It has a very pleasant smell which isn&#x27;t overpowering, and it produces a nice lather with only a small amount.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve Tried The Other Visible Care Body Washes, But I Must say This One Is By Far The Best For My Skin.</li>
            <li>This body wash is really great and great price…at least it last a month.</li>
            <li>I immediately felt a difference in the way my skin felt after the very first use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;At only five dollars, this body wash is great for anyone looking to wash themselves with a new scent.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;d rather have something along the line of fresh or non scented.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh \\&quot;green\\&quot; scent,</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t lather it, yes, it will just wash right off.</li>
            <li>body wash creates a very nice and long lasting lather that I really enjoy.</li>
            <li>Dove Creme Body Wash is a nice alternative for those of us with dry skin.</li>
            <li>The scent is very nice as well, it is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>This body wash lathers nicely and leaves behind a very light and fresh scent.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and smells wonderful</li>
            <li>As many reviewers have said, I really can&#x27;t tell much in the sense of toning, but when it comes to moisturizing and an overall clean, this Dove body wash is the way to go.</li>
            <li>There is a difference at first.</li>
            <li>I tried to use it for 7 days to see if it \\&quot;visibly enhances skin&#x27;s beauty in one week\\&quot; but was only able to tolerate four days because it itches me.</li>
            <li>My review for the Olay product I mentioned is in the comments for those who are interested.</li>
            <li>Not much toning effect seen, but does smell nice.</li>
            <li>It was more a matter of her skin feeling nicer rather than especially looking nicer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely purchasing more.</li>
            <li>I really like this body wash!</li>
            <li>It never claimed to work miracles. ;)</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was apprehensive about it after the first week.</li>
            <li>Prior to this, I used the exfoliating Dove body wash, which was really great, but for the price, I would go through it pretty quickly, and it more just felt like dry skin prevention rather than dry skin treatment.</li>
            <li>This goes on smooth and makes my skin feel so soft and the scent lingers for awhile.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So, for me, this would be a better product with a slightly different bottle design.</li>
            <li>Overall, I didnt notice anything outstanding about it.</li>
            <li>Well much to my surprise it seems to be doing just that!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also found that I haven&#x27;t had to use as much per bottle, which is also worth something.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s more reasonably priced and seems to last longer.</li>
            <li>It suds up well, has the familiar Dove bar soapy scent, and gives my skin a great tingly feeling without leaving it dry or tight.</li>
            <li>a positive change in the moisture and tone of my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m appreciative of the package design that places the cap at the foot of the product so that there&#x27;s no need to shake the product down toward the opening as you use up the contents.</li>
            <li>She noticed less dryness and a nice feeling that she described as increased smoothness.</li>
            <li>My husband said it seemed more like a skin reaction to something as opposed to dry skin.</li>
            <li>although not a dramatic difference)</li>
            <li>It leaves a residue on my skin which I am fine with on the Olay product but am not pleased with it on this product because I do not feel as clean or smell as fresh as the Olay product makes me feel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was a nice change, I haven&#x27;t noticed any toning effects, but is super thick &amp; creamy, I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the sent, but I like the product.</li>
            <li>Nothing Really Worked.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference in my skin&#x27;s tone.  </li>
            <li>I really like the fragrance and feel of my skin after using this product.  </li>
            <li>I left the shower with smooth and silky skin that didn&#x27;t feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cost much either.</li>
            <li>There are some body washes that I&#x27;ve used that I have to really work at getting it all washed off.</li>
            <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t really need toning, not yet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for about 2 weeks straight now, and I see some moisturizing effects.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really have a problem with this since I didn&#x27;t think that it would.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t strong, and thankfully didn&#x27;t linger long after toweling off.</li>
            <li>My skin felt soft and smooth and I was able to stop using as much lotion as I had in the past.</li>
            <li>Since Dove rinses clean, it causes less gunk to clean off your shower walls.  </li>
            <li>but I also don&#x27;t like the generic &#x27;clean&#x27; that</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used this liquid soap for about a month and noticed slightly smoother, firmer, and toned skin with the added vitamin E.  Common sense dictates that most of skin/muscle tone is derived from good nutrition, daily vigorous exercise, minimizing sun/UV exposure, and using appropriate sunblocks and skin care products for individual skin requirements/preferences.  </li>
            <li>However, the itching was not bad enough to make me scratch</li>
            <li>It lathers wonderfully, I am very happy with all the Dove body washes I have tried over the past few months!</li>
            <li>It also feels smoother and more tight and tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Originally, I thought the itchy feeling was because of dry skin</li>
            <li>Originally, I thought the itchy feeling was because of dry skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth, not textured so it was a bit slippery when wet.</li>
            <li>Overall, if you&#x27;re a fan of the scent or Dove products in general, you&#x27;ll probably enjoy this body wash.</li>
            <li>This body wash is nice and thick.</li>
            <li>The bottle is a very large size as well and will last quite a while.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure of what, but it reminds me of cucumbers - fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I really like this body wash, I love dove products, we usually stick to dove sensitive body wash.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Dove body wash for several years, but this one works absolute wonders, even on my psoriasis!  </li>
            <li>Yet for me, the Toning body wash is the first one to actually make a visible difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I love this product and miss having it, but I wouldn&#x27;t spend $26 on it. :/</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I feel a noticeable difference in skin moisture after a couple of weeks of use, but the overall clean and feel is on par with the likes of Olay of Olay and similar.  </li>
            <li>Normally, my review would have the following warning in green at the top \\&quot;Customer review from the Amazon Vine(tm) Program.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>For me, the rather large cumbersome bottle shape and scent are enough of a detractor I probably won&#x27;t replace when it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li>Love this product, but hard to find.</li>
            <li>And Was Pleasantly Surprised By The Product.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feels so soft.  </li>
            <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned this creme body wash gets ZERO stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned this creme body wash gets ZERO stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Is not tacky after rinse and skin soft.</li>
            <li>Never used a product that made my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>The one thing I didn&#x27;t like was the chemical-like old fashioned smell.  </li>
            <li>This wash makes my skin feel soft and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>After multiple uses, I don&#x27;t really see any difference in how moisturized or toned my skin appears to be.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s because the packaging makes it so that it naturally wants to be squeezed from the middle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still fairly young</li>
            <li>Body washes should not be held to such high expectations</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really feel like the bottle lasts too long.</li>
            <li>This liquid soap is easily dispensed with the now common upside-down container and lathers up well on the skin.  </li>
            <li>My only real complain is that the bottle stands on the same end that it opens from.</li>
            <li>Looks good, but once the soap gets down to a certain level, it become a bit difficult to use.</li>
            <li>I noticed after only a few uses that the skin on my arms and chest was beginning to look, well, more toned, and younger overall.</li>
            <li>However, when I actually used it, I thought the fragrance was rather weak and not as good as expected.</li>
            <li>It definitely helps with making skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin, particularly in the winter.</li>
            <li>and I found that a lot of the contents was stuck to the side at the end and the only way to get it out was to completely remove the cap and scrape it out.</li>
            <li>We all have sensitive, dry skin and found this product to similar to Dove&#x27;s sensitive skin bar soap (but I prefer scentless); skin feels clean without the dried up feeling.  </li>
            <li>certainly recommend this and just about any other Dove products.</li>
            <li>Left my skin soft immediately after getting out of the shower, but no long term effects.  </li>
            <li>There are at least 80 other reviews for this product already, most of which talks about its effectiveness, scent, lather, etc., so I don&#x27;t feel I need to go into that.</li>

            <li> Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Started using this wonderful whipped soap when I had breast cancer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The product also says, use it for three weeks for best results.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful body wash.  </li>
            <li> I shared this with my daughter when she flew out for a visit and her reaction was good but not as impressed I am.</li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to use as a subscribe and save item.  </li>
            <li> This is a great body wash</li>
            <li> Great for the skin</li>
            <li> Dove Cr&amp;egrave;me Body Wash, Visible Care Toning is a great way to moisturize skin.</li>
            <li> that isn&#x27;t floral or girly, so he&#x27;s happy with that.</li>
            <li> It is however, a great smelling body wash that improves the quality and tone of your skin.</li>
            <li> Thrilled you had this!</li>
            <li> the body wash lathers up very nicely and it smells good.</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant and not heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is easily the body wash&#x27;s best attribute though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells good.</li>
            <li> The product is really good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So: four stars for a good product with noticeable benefits, but one star off for making claims that in our experience seem to be a stretch.</li>
            <li> It is a beloved brand</li>
            <li> My skin felt good afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep buying this when I can catch a good sale.</li>
            <li> Suffice it to say, this is a good body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have always loved Dove products.</li>
            <li> body wash feels good and smells good.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Dove Creme Body Wash, Visible Care Toning&amp;#34; is a good body wash, but after using it for 2 weeks, I did not see the claimed: &amp;#34;visibly more beautiful skin in just one week&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This body wash foams up wonderfully and makes for a truely relaxing experience in the shower.  </li>
            <li> We both love it!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to figure out what could be causing it, but now I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s this body wash!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Just make sure you USE A LOOFAH OR FACIAL/BODY SCRUB, because it&#x27;s meant to lather!</li>
            <li> my skin does appear to be more toned!</li>
            <li> Nice lather, cleans well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is off-putting to me -- it kind of smells like Aloe</li>
            <li> This body was is really nice.</li>
            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> But if you make it nice and sudsy like the instructions say, it works like a dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smell is nice, and it doesnt last&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lathers quite nicely</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I notice any improvement in my skin tone, but it&#x27;s great as a moisturizing body wash and moisturizers while still leaving you feeling clean</li>
            <li> What I liked best is it washes off nicely with no residue, but my skin felt soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> It has a light pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> They work the best for me so far.</li>
            <li> It is very rich and creamy and lathers up nicely.</li>
            <li> The scent on the body was is a nice pleasant fresh smell, very light.</li>
            <li> It has a mild pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> but this soap makes me feel clean and good, which is all that matters to me.</li>
            <li> It certainly does a good job as a cleaner, and it is cost effective.</li>
            <li> I love to shower with this body wash.  </li>
            <li> Each day that I used this product made me itch more than the day before.</li>
            <li> my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will make sure to never ever buy this product for myself.</li>
            <li> my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will make sure to never ever buy this product for myself.</li>
            <li> Have this on &#x27;Safe and Sub&#x27;.</li>
            <li> My 1.99 Suave Body Wash works much better than this.</li>
            <li> and I love their soaps and deodarants.</li>
            <li> I love scents, and I love neutral products with no</li>
            <li> order it with Subscribe and Save and love the convenience of never having to go to the store for body wash or running out of body wash.</li>
            <li> Maybe a more moisturized feeling.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say my skin feels more toned, though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not taking off any stars at this point, since I still don&#x27;t know for sure what is causing it.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using it, I seem more prone to break outs, but I don&#x27;t know for sure if its bc of this product.</li>
            <li> and I just love the scent.  </li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve squirted the wash onto your poof, it looks/feels more like conditioner or lotion rather than body wash.</li>
            <li> so we were glad to give this Dove Creme Body Wash, Visible Care Toning a try.  </li>
            <li> my family liked is that this wash was creamy and smooth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a nice body wash that does lightly moisturize.</li>
            <li> It certainly hasn&#x27;t hurt, and my skin seems very nice.</li>
            <li> I felt like I had to use more than \\&quot;normal\\&quot; to get a nice, rich lather.</li>
            <li> Not like a pregnant lady glow, but in a healthy kind of way that it hadn&#x27;t before.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good all around body wash as long as you don&#x27;t expect the bold claim that it will give you &amp;#34;visibly more beautiful skin in just one week&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The lather is lovely and soft and also, the smell is great.</li>
            <li> It rinses off clean without any greasy residue and leaves a nice, clean, refreshing, appley scent.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is large and you get a lot - a good value.  </li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t love the flip up securing mechanism on the bottom; if it&#x27;s not latched securely I can see the wash leaking everywhere.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m sure my advanced age doesn&#x27;t help in establishing this either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was gentle, and I loved the feel and smell.</li>
            <li> Like a \\&quot;I smell like heaven all the time\\&quot; kind of smell&lt;br /&gt;+It&#x27;s fun.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s nice and rich and creamy, with a mild scent.</li>
            <li> I love to be clean.  </li>
            <li> It washes off easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very mild all around.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I first got it, I sniffed it and thought it had a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> The scent is clean, light, and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, a fine product.</li>
            <li> love a lot of things about this body wash&lt;br /&gt;+It smells clean, but not like clean linens.</li>
            <li> Lathers great, pleasant subtle scent, rinses away easily.  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t expect a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> the \\&quot;Olay 2-In-1 Advanced Ribbons</li>
            <li> Advanced Moisture Body Wash 18 Oz</li>
            <li> They work fabulously together.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am an Amazon Vine Reviewer that gets free products in exchange for my reviews.  </li>
            <li> …it comes from free to my door</li>
            <li> I enjoy taking a shower at night now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently become a follower of Dove products, and I am happy to report that after testing this for a month, it has not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Given that, I appreciate the smooth feeling I get when I step out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I absolutely fell in love with that body wash and have since ordered it many times under the subscribe and save program.  </li>
            <li> What I love about this body wash is the light and clean scent and the mild lather that isn&#x27;t stripping to skin.</li>
            <li> Very fresh and light.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this body wash very much.</li>
            <li> She is generally pretty pleased and continues to use the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to love this body wash when it first came out</li>
            <li> I feel clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> I feel clean after I use it.</li>
            <li> It lathers up well and rinses clean with no residue.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t keep its promising of more toned skin in one week, but otherwise, it&#x27;s a fantastic moisturizing body wash.</li>
            <li> My first thought is that the bottle shape/size wasn&#x27;t great for those of us with smaller hands.</li>
            <li> So much, that when I run out, I&#x27;ll gladly buy it.</li>
            <li> Worked better with a luffa rather than just applying it straight to your skin.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t super sudsy, but it got us clean and didn&#x27;t leave us oily.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that it makes my skin look any better, but I haven&#x27;t ever really had problems with the way my skin looks.</li>
            <li> This body wash came out very creamy and felt like it was doing a great job of leaving me clean but not stripping every bit of moisture out of my skin at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I have used all the other Visible Care body washes and they are all great and do as they claim.</li>
            <li> and I prefer to use something that smells fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> It makes you feel clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes your skin feel clean, fresh, and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like there is some super rave you give about body wash.</li>
            <li> &quot; I&#x27;m sold, ring it up and get it to me quickly.  </li>
            <li> The scent is extremely mild.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy this again just for the scent, and mild cleaning power, but, not for the toning claim.</li>
            <li> There was a lot of lather and a mild, soapy scent.</li>
            <li> It has a very pleasant smell which isn&#x27;t overpowering, and it produces a nice lather with only a small amount.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve Tried The Other Visible Care Body Washes, But I Must say This One Is By Far The Best For My Skin.</li>
            <li> This body wash is really great and great price…at least it last a month.</li>
            <li> I immediately felt a difference in the way my skin felt after the very first use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;At only five dollars, this body wash is great for anyone looking to wash themselves with a new scent.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;d rather have something along the line of fresh or non scented.</li>
            <li> It has a fresh \\&quot;green\\&quot; scent,</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t lather it, yes, it will just wash right off.</li>
            <li> body wash creates a very nice and long lasting lather that I really enjoy.</li>
            <li> Dove Creme Body Wash is a nice alternative for those of us with dry skin.</li>
            <li> The scent is very nice as well, it is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> This body wash lathers nicely and leaves behind a very light and fresh scent.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and smells wonderful</li>
            <li> As many reviewers have said, I really can&#x27;t tell much in the sense of toning, but when it comes to moisturizing and an overall clean, this Dove body wash is the way to go.</li>
            <li> There is a difference at first.</li>
            <li> I tried to use it for 7 days to see if it \\&quot;visibly enhances skin&#x27;s beauty in one week\\&quot; but was only able to tolerate four days because it itches me.</li>
            <li> My review for the Olay product I mentioned is in the comments for those who are interested.</li>
            <li> Not much toning effect seen, but does smell nice.</li>
            <li> It was more a matter of her skin feeling nicer rather than especially looking nicer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely purchasing more.</li>
            <li> I really like this body wash!</li>
            <li> It never claimed to work miracles. ;)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was apprehensive about it after the first week.</li>
            <li> Prior to this, I used the exfoliating Dove body wash, which was really great, but for the price, I would go through it pretty quickly, and it more just felt like dry skin prevention rather than dry skin treatment.</li>
            <li> This goes on smooth and makes my skin feel so soft and the scent lingers for awhile.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So, for me, this would be a better product with a slightly different bottle design.</li>
            <li> Overall, I didnt notice anything outstanding about it.</li>
            <li> Well much to my surprise it seems to be doing just that!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found that I haven&#x27;t had to use as much per bottle, which is also worth something.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s more reasonably priced and seems to last longer.</li>
            <li> It suds up well, has the familiar Dove bar soapy scent, and gives my skin a great tingly feeling without leaving it dry or tight.</li>
            <li> a positive change in the moisture and tone of my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m appreciative of the package design that places the cap at the foot of the product so that there&#x27;s no need to shake the product down toward the opening as you use up the contents.</li>
            <li> She noticed less dryness and a nice feeling that she described as increased smoothness.</li>
            <li> My husband said it seemed more like a skin reaction to something as opposed to dry skin.</li>
            <li> although not a dramatic difference)</li>
            <li> It leaves a residue on my skin which I am fine with on the Olay product but am not pleased with it on this product because I do not feel as clean or smell as fresh as the Olay product makes me feel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was a nice change, I haven&#x27;t noticed any toning effects, but is super thick &amp; creamy, I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the sent, but I like the product.</li>
            <li> Nothing Really Worked.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference in my skin&#x27;s tone.  </li>
            <li> I really like the fragrance and feel of my skin after using this product.  </li>
            <li> I left the shower with smooth and silky skin that didn&#x27;t feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cost much either.</li>
            <li> There are some body washes that I&#x27;ve used that I have to really work at getting it all washed off.</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t really need toning, not yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 2 weeks straight now, and I see some moisturizing effects.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really have a problem with this since I didn&#x27;t think that it would.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t strong, and thankfully didn&#x27;t linger long after toweling off.</li>
            <li> My skin felt soft and smooth and I was able to stop using as much lotion as I had in the past.</li>
            <li> Since Dove rinses clean, it causes less gunk to clean off your shower walls.  </li>
            <li> but I also don&#x27;t like the generic &#x27;clean&#x27; that</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used this liquid soap for about a month and noticed slightly smoother, firmer, and toned skin with the added vitamin E.  Common sense dictates that most of skin/muscle tone is derived from good nutrition, daily vigorous exercise, minimizing sun/UV exposure, and using appropriate sunblocks and skin care products for individual skin requirements/preferences.  </li>
            <li> However, the itching was not bad enough to make me scratch</li>
            <li> It lathers wonderfully, I am very happy with all the Dove body washes I have tried over the past few months!</li>
            <li> It also feels smoother and more tight and tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Originally, I thought the itchy feeling was because of dry skin</li>
            <li> Originally, I thought the itchy feeling was because of dry skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth, not textured so it was a bit slippery when wet.</li>
            <li> Overall, if you&#x27;re a fan of the scent or Dove products in general, you&#x27;ll probably enjoy this body wash.</li>
            <li> This body wash is nice and thick.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a very large size as well and will last quite a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of what, but it reminds me of cucumbers - fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I really like this body wash, I love dove products, we usually stick to dove sensitive body wash.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dove body wash for several years, but this one works absolute wonders, even on my psoriasis!  </li>
            <li> Yet for me, the Toning body wash is the first one to actually make a visible difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product and miss having it, but I wouldn&#x27;t spend $26 on it. :/</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I feel a noticeable difference in skin moisture after a couple of weeks of use, but the overall clean and feel is on par with the likes of Olay of Olay and similar.  </li>
            <li> Normally, my review would have the following warning in green at the top \\&quot;Customer review from the Amazon Vine(tm) Program.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> For me, the rather large cumbersome bottle shape and scent are enough of a detractor I probably won&#x27;t replace when it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> Love this product, but hard to find.</li>
            <li> And Was Pleasantly Surprised By The Product.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feels so soft.  </li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned this creme body wash gets ZERO stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned this creme body wash gets ZERO stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Is not tacky after rinse and skin soft.</li>
            <li> Never used a product that made my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> The one thing I didn&#x27;t like was the chemical-like old fashioned smell.  </li>
            <li> This wash makes my skin feel soft and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> After multiple uses, I don&#x27;t really see any difference in how moisturized or toned my skin appears to be.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s because the packaging makes it so that it naturally wants to be squeezed from the middle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still fairly young</li>
            <li> Body washes should not be held to such high expectations</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really feel like the bottle lasts too long.</li>
            <li> This liquid soap is easily dispensed with the now common upside-down container and lathers up well on the skin.  </li>
            <li> My only real complain is that the bottle stands on the same end that it opens from.</li>
            <li> Looks good, but once the soap gets down to a certain level, it become a bit difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I noticed after only a few uses that the skin on my arms and chest was beginning to look, well, more toned, and younger overall.</li>
            <li> However, when I actually used it, I thought the fragrance was rather weak and not as good as expected.</li>
            <li> It definitely helps with making skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, particularly in the winter.</li>
            <li> and I found that a lot of the contents was stuck to the side at the end and the only way to get it out was to completely remove the cap and scrape it out.</li>
            <li> We all have sensitive, dry skin and found this product to similar to Dove&#x27;s sensitive skin bar soap (but I prefer scentless); skin feels clean without the dried up feeling.  </li>
            <li> certainly recommend this and just about any other Dove products.</li>
            <li> Left my skin soft immediately after getting out of the shower, but no long term effects.  </li>
            <li> There are at least 80 other reviews for this product already, most of which talks about its effectiveness, scent, lather, etc., so I don&#x27;t feel I need to go into that.</li>
            <li> Dove&#x27;s Visible Care Toning Creme Body Wash is thick and fluffy, so you really don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> As Long As I Continue To Get These Results</li>
            <li> Therefore, when I selected this body wash I expected a product that acted the same as the Olay body wash.</li>
            <li> is a trusted brand that I&#x27;ve used as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> Your hand (which is usually wet) just slips back up to the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cream is akin to sweet smelling clouds, and feel like you&#x27;re wrapped in a cozy (albeit thick) cloud too&lt;</li>
            <li> reading some of the other reviews about allergic reactions, I&#x27;m starting to re-think this body wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still having to use lotion after drying off, but I can&#x27;t see any acne or dry spots from using the body wash.</li>
            <li> given how dry it&#x27;s been.  </li>
            <li> I like crazy-hot showers that dry the heck out of my skin.  </li>
            <li> Ok, but once you use about half the product, it gets harder to get the product out by squeezing from the middle, and squeezing from the bottom just seems awkward, and doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> Not really worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> far as toning.....I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> It has a definite perfume-y smell, like something you would buy at the beauty counter at dept store, which is a plus for me but major negative for my husband.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, especially if you use a bath poof.</li>
            <li> My legs especially have little dry circles.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;toning\\&quot; claims sound very vague to me - that word can mean anything, really -</li>
            <li> but because I moisturize heavily I discovered it&#x27;s definitely this product.  </li>
            <li> but because I moisturize heavily I discovered it&#x27;s definitely this product.  </li>
            <li> to the claims of noticeable improvement in appearance within a week, she says that this was not really the case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really inter flowery or other types of smells -</li>
            <li> I have that problem with other brands.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s all that likely that I&#x27;d see results during winter</li>
            <li> It only takes a small bit to lather.</li>
            <li> Like the other Dove products, it does not leave a ring in the bathtub.</li>
            <li> It is non-irritating and over the course of a few weeks, I&#x27;ve seen some reduction in dry patches of skin with a combination of this body wash and lotion after a shower.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and quite a few contact allergies.  </li>
            <li> I find it hard to believe that a body wash could actually tone skin, but I gave it a try anyway, because, hey, it&#x27;s going to be body wash</li>
            <li> - I reviewed this product when it was the average price for a bottle of body wash</li>
            <li> It is not runny and watered down.</li>
            <li> I find the bottle a little hard to open, but do like the product.</li>
            <li> The previous reviewer seems to have had an alergic reaction and that&#x27;s a shame.</li>
            <li> I can say, that after using this product for a while, my legs are a lot less itchy than they have been in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And made dark spots on skin a little lighter.</li>
            <li> I appreciate less mess in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Little Bumps</li>
            <li> I like the foam, a little dab will do ya.</li>
            <li> Then about 3 weeks in I started noticing dry spots on my legs and under my breasts, and I mean spots.</li>
            <li> Reminds me a bit of Dove&#x27;s green tea and cucumber line.</li>
            <li> Feels softer after a few uses.</li>
            <li> The reason this review does not show this green warning is because Amazon canceled this order before it shipped</li>
            <li> &quot; I specifically targeted my underarm area and another spot that has a few stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I took stars off the review because I didn&#x27;t notice any visible toning in my skin after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not a big fan of false advertising</li>
            <li> Maybe buy a small test bottle first)&lt;br /&gt;+Comes out without a mess.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has really bad rough skin on his back due to lack of exfoliation and this product made it smoother.</li>

            <li> do feel like it&#x27;s helped tighten up some skin that could use it, but that seems so hard to believe.</li>
            <li> Anyone With Chicken Skin Or Tiny Whiteheads</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I like fruity scents, not soapy ones, so that was a bit of a negative for me.</li>
            <li> Another thing that I didn&#x27;t like about this Dove body wash is that it was a bit too thick</li>
            <li> I mean how can a body wash tone your skin?</li>
            <li> This results in a bit of a soapy mess at the base of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I can recommend this product, just don&#x27;t have exaggerated expectations.</li>
            <li> I was quite skeptical about the description of this body wash.</li>
            <li> Expectations should not be unrealistic for a body wash.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I find it hard to believe that a body wash could actually tone skin, but I gave it a try anyway, because, hey, it&#x27;s going to be body wash anyway, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice and rich and creamy, with a mild scent. Reminds me a bit of Dove&#x27;s green tea and cucumber line. Nice lather, cleans well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do feel like it&#x27;s helped tighten up some skin that could use it, but that seems so hard to believe. Maybe? It certainly hasn&#x27;t hurt, and my skin seems very nice. Will definitely keep using.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for two months now. I saw the commercials and thought, I&#x27;ve used Dove in the past why not try this. There is a difference at first. My skin felt soft and smooth and I was able to stop using as much lotion as I had in the past. Then about 3 weeks in I started noticing dry spots on my legs and under my breasts, and I mean spots. My legs especially have little dry circles. I tried using lotion and the spots didn&#x27;t go away. Finally, I stopped using the body wash, and changed brands. The spots are starting to fade and my skin is going back to the way it was before. I would rather used body wash and lotion than to have a body wash that caused spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for trying Dove.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like there is some super rave you give about body wash. It&#x27;s body wash. It smells good. I feel clean after I use it.</li>
            <li> This is one the best body washes I have ever used. A little goes a long way and smells wonderful</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and quite a few contact allergies.  I&#x27;ve been using Dove body wash for several years, but this one works absolute wonders, even on my psoriasis!  Helps keep the itchies to a minimum.</li>
            <li> Feels softer after a few uses. Nice product. I really don&#x27;t like the sent, but I like the product. Over all I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> No complaints at all with this creamy, luxurious body wash -- the only problem I&#x27;ve had is finding it again in my local grocery store.  What I liked best is it washes off nicely with no residue, but my skin felt soft and moisturized.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I Purchased On A Whim Because I Was Out Of My Usual Body Wash And Was Pleasantly Surprised By The Product. I Have Chicken Skin On My Arms..Little Bumps That Are Very Annoying And Sometimes Red. I&#x27;ve Bought Several Products To Make TheM Go Away, But Nothing Really Worked. I Didn&#x27;t Have Any Expectations For The Visible Care Toning To Do Anything For My Skin, But A Week Later My Bumps Are Virtually Gone!! I Don&#x27;t Think I&#x27;ll Be Using Anything Else As Long As I Continue To Get These Results. I&#x27;ve Tried The Other Visible Care Body Washes, But I Must say This One Is By Far The Best For My Skin. Anyone With Chicken Skin Or Tiny Whiteheads On Their Arms Should Definitely Give It A Try!!</li>
            <li> I love to shower with this body wash.  It makes my skin feels so soft.  I feel clean and fresh! I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess, what, I updated my comments on 10/9/2013:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to use both the Dove Creme Body Wash, Visible Care Toning, 18 Ounce&lt;br /&gt;with the \\&quot;Olay 2-In-1 Advanced Ribbons Soothing Cr&amp;egrave;me + Advanced Moisture Body Wash 18 Oz (Pack of 3.)\\&quot; The experience was both revitalizing, invigorating and rejuvenating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when \\&quot;I bathe, I find that I do Not leave a dirty, bathtub ring!\\&quot; I&#x27;m sold, ring it up and get it to me quickly.  They work fabulously together.</li>
            <li> DISCLOSURE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an Amazon Vine Reviewer that gets free products in exchange for my reviews.  Normally, my review would have the following warning in green at the top \\&quot;Customer review from the Amazon Vine(tm) Program.\\&quot;  The reason this review does not show this green warning is because Amazon canceled this order before it shipped but then several days later shipped me the product anyway. Therefore, I want the readers to know that I did not purchase this item in case that is a concern to you and because I feel like it&#x27;s stealing if I don&#x27;t review all the products I receive, I decided to submit my review anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally I am not a fan of creme or moisturizing body washes because those types of soaps always felt like I was showering with hand lotion.  However, one day I decided to try [[ASIN:B002Z7EOOE Olay Total Effects 7 in One Body Wash, Deep Penetrating Moisture, 15.2 Ounce (Pack of 2)]] because it was offered under on the Vine program.  I absolutely fell in love with that body wash and have since ordered it many times under the subscribe and save program.  Therefore, when I selected this body wash I expected a product that acted the same as the Olay body wash. Unfortunately, my experience is extremely disappointing and here is why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It lathers lightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It feels like I&#x27;m washing with body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The fragrance is off-putting to me -- it kind of smells like Aloe but there&#x27;s no Aloe in the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It leaves a residue on my skin which I am fine with on the Olay product but am not pleased with it on this product because I do not feel as clean or smell as fresh as the Olay product makes me feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I tried to use it for 7 days to see if it \\&quot;visibly enhances skin&#x27;s beauty in one week\\&quot; but was only able to tolerate four days because it itches me. Each day that I used this product made me itch more than the day before. However, the itching was not bad enough to make me scratch but it was almost getting to the point where I would be scratching soon. Originally, I thought the itchy feeling was because of dry skin but because I moisturize heavily I discovered it&#x27;s definitely this product.  I have very sensitive skin so there must be some ingredient in here that doesn&#x27;t work for me.  The only part of my body that does not itch are the soles of my feet and my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will make sure to never ever buy this product for myself. As far as I&#x27;m concerned this creme body wash gets ZERO stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS My review for the Olay product I mentioned is in the comments for those who are interested.cratch but it was almost getting to the point where I would be scratching soon.

            <li> Not much toning effect seen, but does smell nice. Does not feel that it is especially moisturising so may not re-purchase again</li>
            <li> Have used on and off for awhile. Have this on &#x27;Safe and Sub&#x27;. The product is really good. Don&#x27;t know if it &#x27;Tones&#x27; but I like the foam, a little dab will do ya. Is not tacky after rinse and skin soft. I find the bottle a little hard to open, but do like the product.</li>
            <li> Love this product, but hard to find. Thrilled you had this! Started using this wonderful whipped soap when I had breast cancer.  It was gentle, and I loved the feel and smell.</li>
            <li> I have used all the other Visible Care body washes and they are all great and do as they claim. Yet for me, the Toning body wash is the first one to actually make a visible difference in my skin. I noticed after only a few uses that the skin on my arms and chest was beginning to look, well, more toned, and younger overall. I highly recommend this product. The previous reviewer seems to have had an alergic reaction and that&#x27;s a shame. I have that problem with other brands. Dove seems to be the only one I can use.</li>
            <li> This body wash is really great and great price…at least it last a month. It’s the same price as Wal-Mart BUT don’t have to travel to get it…it comes from free to my door</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference in my skin&#x27;s tone.  Left my skin soft immediately after getting out of the shower, but no long term effects.  My 1.99 Suave Body Wash works much better than this. Its also unscented (or doesn&#x27;t have a distinguishable smell), and I prefer to use something that smells fresh and clean.  This did neither.  I also didn&#x27;t like the consistency.  I felt like I had to use more than \\&quot;normal\\&quot; to get a nice, rich lather. Not really worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> My wife used this product and reports as follows. It definitely helps with making skin soft and supple. She noticed less dryness and a nice feeling that she described as increased smoothness. She is generally pretty pleased and continues to use the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the claims of noticeable improvement in appearance within a week, she says that this was not really the case. It was more a matter of her skin feeling nicer rather than especially looking nicer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product also says, use it for three weeks for best results. She doesn&#x27;t dispute the idea of using it for three weeks, but she didn&#x27;t think there was a lot of difference between results at three weeks and results at one week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So: four stars for a good product with noticeable benefits, but one star off for making claims that in our experience seem to be a stretch. I can recommend this product, just don&#x27;t have exaggerated expectations.</li>
            <li> I really like the fragrance and feel of my skin after using this product.  I shared this with my daughter when she flew out for a visit and her reaction was good but not as impressed I am.</li>
            <li> I bought two bottles of these and my boyfriend stole one from me lol. We both love it! My boyfriend has really bad rough skin on his back due to lack of exfoliation and this product made it smoother. And made dark spots on skin a little lighter. Definitely purchasing more. Never used a product that made my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> This body wash came out very creamy and felt like it was doing a great job of leaving me clean but not stripping every bit of moisture out of my skin at the same time.  I left the shower with smooth and silky skin that didn&#x27;t feel greasy.  The bottle is large and you get a lot - a good value.  The one thing I didn&#x27;t like was the chemical-like old fashioned smell.  I&#x27;m not really inter flowery or other types of smells - but I also don&#x27;t like the generic &#x27;clean&#x27; that this one sports.  I think I&#x27;d rather have something along the line of fresh or non scented.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Dove Creme Body Wash, Visible Care Toning&amp;#34; is a good body wash, but after using it for 2 weeks, I did not see the claimed: &amp;#34;visibly more beautiful skin in just one week&amp;#34;. With that being said, I like it though. It has a very pleasant smell which isn&#x27;t overpowering, and it produces a nice lather with only a small amount. It doesn&#x27;t cost much either. It&#x27;s a good all around body wash as long as you don&#x27;t expect the bold claim that it will give you &amp;#34;visibly more beautiful skin in just one week&amp;#34;. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I know I am going to get hate for giving Dove a poor review. It is a beloved brand and I love their soaps and deodarants. But in fairness I tried this out for three weeks and saw no improvement in the \\&quot;tone\\&quot; of my skin as Dove claims \\&quot;visible improvement in one week.\\&quot; I specifically targeted my underarm area and another spot that has a few stretch marks. I would still purchase the body wash because it smells divine. The creamy texture is luxurious and it feels very expensive. I am disappointed that it didn&#x27;t improve my skin as it claims after allowing 3x the reccomended time for it to work.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, particularly in the winter. This body wash lathers nicely and leaves behind a very light and fresh scent. It is non-irritating and over the course of a few weeks, I&#x27;ve seen some reduction in dry patches of skin with a combination of this body wash and lotion after a shower. I&#x27;m appreciative of the package design that places the cap at the foot of the product so that there&#x27;s no need to shake the product down toward the opening as you use up the contents. Dove Creme Body Wash is a nice alternative for those of us with dry skin.</li>
            <li> This body was is really nice. It has a mild pleasant scent. It lathers up well and rinses clean with no residue. This body wash is not drying to my skin. My skin felt good afterwards. I like that it contains Vitamin E. This body wash is nice and thick. It is not runny and watered down.</li>
            <li> Dove Creme Body Wash.  This is wonderful body wash.  It makes you feel clean and fresh.  It does its job wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a soap and body wash person.  I love to be clean.  I love scents, and I love neutral products with no scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove is a trusted brand that I&#x27;ve used as long as I can remember.  This product is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes your skin feel clean, fresh, and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.  We will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I enjoy taking a shower at night now.  This wash makes my skin feel soft and refreshed.  It helps me sleep.</li>
            <li> This body wash foams up wonderfully and makes for a truely relaxing experience in the shower.  I like the smell of it becuase it&#x27;s not overwhelming...just simply body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I order it with Subscribe and Save and love the convenience of never having to go to the store for body wash or running out of body wash.</li>
            <li> I really like this body wash! So much, that when I run out, I&#x27;ll gladly buy it. The scent is extremely mild. It&#x27;s not perfume-like at all. It washes off easily. There are some body washes that I&#x27;ve used that I have to really work at getting it all washed off. I don&#x27;t have that problem with this body wash. It&#x27;s very mild all around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as toning.....I&#x27;m not sure. I immediately felt a difference in the way my skin felt after the very first use. Maybe a more moisturized feeling. I can&#x27;t say my skin feels more toned, though. I did just have a baby 2 weeks ago, so take that into consideration! It never claimed to work miracles. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**After reading some of the other reviews about allergic reactions, I&#x27;m starting to re-think this body wash. I&#x27;ve used it about 2 1/2 weeks now, and in that time, I&#x27;ve got dry-like patches on my body. My husband said it seemed more like a skin reaction to something as opposed to dry skin. I haven&#x27;t been able to figure out what could be causing it, but now I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s this body wash! I&#x27;m not taking off any stars at this point, since I still don&#x27;t know for sure what is causing it. I thought I would mention it in case anyone else gets similar results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this wash about 3 weeks. I can&#x27;t say I notice any improvement in my skin tone, but it&#x27;s great as a moisturizing body wash and moisturizers while still leaving you feeling clean (some others I&#x27;ve used left a film or oily residue on my skin). Since I&#x27;ve been using it, I seem more prone to break outs, but I don&#x27;t know for sure if its bc of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently become a follower of Dove products, and I am happy to report that after testing this for a month, it has not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was apprehensive about it after the first week. There was no promised difference in my skin, and trust me, I shower every day. After a month though, I have noticed that my skin almost, dare I say, glows. Not like a pregnant lady glow, but in a healthy kind of way that it hadn&#x27;t before. It also feels smoother and more tight and tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love a lot of things about this body wash&lt;br /&gt;+It smells clean, but not like clean linens. Like a \\&quot;I smell like heaven all the time\\&quot; kind of smell&lt;br /&gt;+It&#x27;s fun. The cream is akin to sweet smelling clouds, and feel like you&#x27;re wrapped in a cozy (albeit thick) cloud too&lt;br /&gt;+It&#x27;s made in the U.S.&lt;br /&gt;+No awkward residue! (I know some reviewers had a problem with it triggering skin problems, but it never did with me. Maybe buy a small test bottle first)&lt;br /&gt;+Comes out without a mess. I appreciate less mess in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I certainly recommend this and just about any other Dove products. They work the best for me so far.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if Dove Body Wash actually tones my skin. My skin doesn&#x27;t really need toning, not yet. Maybe this wash will keep it that way. What I do know is the body wash lathers up very nicely and it smells good. I&#x27;m not sure of what, but it reminds me of cucumbers - fresh and clean. Nice.</li>
            <li> I really like this body wash, I love dove products, we usually stick to dove sensitive body wash. This was a nice change, I haven&#x27;t noticed any toning effects, but is super thick &amp; creamy, I really like it.  It has a definite perfume-y smell, like something you would buy at the beauty counter at dept store, which is a plus for me but major negative for my husband.</li>
            <li> I used to love this body wash when it first came out but the price seems to just keep going up and up and I don&#x27;t really feel like the bottle lasts too long. I have since switched over to Olay where they have a body wash that&#x27;s more reasonably priced and seems to last longer. Another thing that I didn&#x27;t like about this Dove body wash is that it was a bit too thick and I found that a lot of the contents was stuck to the side at the end and the only way to get it out was to completely remove the cap and scrape it out. Worked better with a luffa rather than just applying it straight to your skin.</li>
            <li> I only use Dove body wash products.  This is a great product to use as a subscribe and save item.  Since Dove rinses clean, it causes less gunk to clean off your shower walls.  Love it!</li>
            <li> As many reviewers have said, I really can&#x27;t tell much in the sense of toning, but when it comes to moisturizing and an overall clean, this Dove body wash is the way to go. Prior to this, I used the exfoliating Dove body wash, which was really great, but for the price, I would go through it pretty quickly, and it more just felt like dry skin prevention rather than dry skin treatment. Dove&#x27;s Visible Care Toning Creme Body Wash is thick and fluffy, so you really don&#x27;t need much. Just make sure you USE A LOOFAH OR FACIAL/BODY SCRUB, because it&#x27;s meant to lather! If you don&#x27;t lather it, yes, it will just wash right off. But if you make it nice and sudsy like the instructions say, it works like a dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So give it a shot! If you&#x27;re looking for a body wash to help nourish and moisturize your skin, this one should not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 6/1/16 - I reviewed this product when it was the average price for a bottle of body wash (ie. under $10). I love this product and miss having it, but I wouldn&#x27;t spend $26 on it. :/</li>
            <li> What I love about this body wash is the light and clean scent and the mild lather that isn&#x27;t stripping to skin. Though, with continued use, I don&#x27;t see the skin toning, that they claim to be visible after 3 weeks of use. I&#x27;d buy this again just for the scent, and mild cleaning power, but, not for the toning claim.</li>
            <li> This is a great body wash and I just love the scent.  This goes on smooth and makes my skin feel so soft and the scent lingers for awhile.  I&#x27;ll keep buying this when I can catch a good sale.</li>
            <li> Great for the skin I just can&#x27;t find in stores luv it</li>
            <li> My first thought is that the bottle shape/size wasn&#x27;t great for those of us with smaller hands. It&#x27;s smooth, not textured so it was a bit slippery when wet. I also didn&#x27;t love the flip up securing mechanism on the bottom; if it&#x27;s not latched securely I can see the wash leaking everywhere. Once you&#x27;ve squirted the wash onto your poof, it looks/feels more like conditioner or lotion rather than body wash. A little goes a long way, especially if you use a bath poof. There was a lot of lather and a mild, soapy scent. I&#x27;ll admit, I like fruity scents, not soapy ones, so that was a bit of a negative for me. It wasn&#x27;t strong, and thankfully didn&#x27;t linger long after toweling off. After multiple uses, I don&#x27;t really see any difference in how moisturized or toned my skin appears to be. I&#x27;m still having to use lotion after drying off, but I can&#x27;t see any acne or dry spots from using the body wash. It certainly does a good job as a cleaner, and it is cost effective. Overall, if you&#x27;re a fan of the scent or Dove products in general, you&#x27;ll probably enjoy this body wash. For me, the rather large cumbersome bottle shape and scent are enough of a detractor I probably won&#x27;t replace when it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 2 weeks straight now, and I see some moisturizing effects. It is very rich and creamy and lathers up nicely. When I first got it, I sniffed it and thought it had a nice fragrance. However, when I actually used it, I thought the fragrance was rather weak and not as good as expected. In the mornings, I can use all the help I can get to perk me up and this fragrance doesn&#x27;t do it for me. Still, I recommend it and may just try a different fragrance next time.</li>
            <li> There are at least 80 other reviews for this product already, most of which talks about its effectiveness, scent, lather, etc., so I don&#x27;t feel I need to go into that. Suffice it to say, this is a good body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one \\&quot;con\\&quot; for me with this product is the packaging. Looks good, but once the soap gets down to a certain level, it become a bit difficult to use. That&#x27;s because the packaging makes it so that it naturally wants to be squeezed from the middle. Ok, but once you use about half the product, it gets harder to get the product out by squeezing from the middle, and squeezing from the bottom just seems awkward, and doesn&#x27;t work as well. Your hand (which is usually wet) just slips back up to the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for me, this would be a better product with a slightly different bottle design.</li>
            <li> We have always used and trusted Dove products so we were glad to give this Dove Creme Body Wash, Visible Care Toning a try.  This liquid soap is easily dispensed with the now common upside-down container and lathers up well on the skin.  It rinses off clean without any greasy residue and leaves a nice, clean, refreshing, appley scent.  We all have sensitive, dry skin and found this product to similar to Dove&#x27;s sensitive skin bar soap (but I prefer scentless); skin feels clean without the dried up feeling.  We&#x27;ve used this liquid soap for about a month and noticed slightly smoother, firmer, and toned skin with the added vitamin E.  Common sense dictates that most of skin/muscle tone is derived from good nutrition, daily vigorous exercise, minimizing sun/UV exposure, and using appropriate sunblocks and skin care products for individual skin requirements/preferences.  Don&#x27;t expect this Dove body wash to do all the work to improve your skin tone.  Overall, I would purchase this product in the future for my family.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this body wash at the gym. It suds up well, has the familiar Dove bar soapy scent, and gives my skin a great tingly feeling without leaving it dry or tight. The \\&quot;toning\\&quot; claims sound very vague to me - that word can mean anything, really - but this soap makes me feel clean and good, which is all that matters to me.</li>
            <li> The Visible Care Toning wasn&#x27;t visible to me.  But I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s all that likely that I&#x27;d see results during winter given how dry it&#x27;s been.  And I&#x27;m sure my advanced age doesn&#x27;t help in establishing this either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What my family liked is that this wash was creamy and smooth.  It wasn&#x27;t super sudsy, but it got us clean and didn&#x27;t leave us oily.  The scent is pleasant and not heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a nice body wash that does lightly moisturize.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this body wash very much. I don&#x27;t know that it makes my skin look any better, but I haven&#x27;t ever really had problems with the way my skin looks. I can say, that after using this product for a while, my legs are a lot less itchy than they have been in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This body wash creates a very nice and long lasting lather that I really enjoy. The scent is very nice as well, it is not overwhelming. I like the way I feel after getting out of the shower when I have used this. The bottle is a very large size as well and will last quite a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a couple weeks now. Overall, I didnt notice anything outstanding about it. Here are some notes:&lt;br /&gt;-&gt; Creamy type of bodywash, sort of like a body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;-&gt; Lather ability could be better&lt;br /&gt;-&gt; Smell is nice, and it doesnt last&lt;br /&gt;-&gt; Didnt notice any visible improvements to skin</li>
            <li> I have always loved Dove products. Dove Cr&amp;egrave;me Body Wash, Visible Care Toning is a great way to moisturize skin. It only takes a small bit to lather. Like the other Dove products, it does not leave a ring in the bathtub. This is a product I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Lathers great, pleasant subtle scent, rinses away easily.  I can&#x27;t say that I feel a noticeable difference in skin moisture after a couple of weeks of use, but the overall clean and feel is on par with the likes of Olay of Olay and similar.  My only real complain is that the bottle stands on the same end that it opens from. This results in a bit of a soapy mess at the base of the bottle.  Otherwise, a fine product.</li>
            <li> I was quite skeptical about the description of this body wash. I mean how can a body wash tone your skin? Well much to my surprise it seems to be doing just that! I&#x27;ve been using it daily for a couple of weeks now and my skin does appear to be more toned! The scent on the body was is a nice pleasant fresh smell, very light. It lathers wonderfully, I am very happy with all the Dove body washes I have tried over the past few months!</li>
            <li> I like crazy-hot showers that dry the heck out of my skin.  This body wash keeps me from drying out but isn&#x27;t filmy, and works so well that I constantly forget to apply my post-shower moisturizer.  My boyfriend uses it too, and he FINALLY doesn&#x27;t have flaky winter skin!  It has a fresh \\&quot;green\\&quot; scent, that isn&#x27;t floral or girly, so he&#x27;s happy with that.</li>
            <li> I took stars off the review because I didn&#x27;t notice any visible toning in my skin after a few weeks of use. I didn&#x27;t really have a problem with this since I didn&#x27;t think that it would. Body washes should not be held to such high expectations but I&#x27;m not a big fan of false advertising either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This body wash feels good and smells good. I suppose that&#x27;s what matters. I&#x27;ve also found that I haven&#x27;t had to use as much per bottle, which is also worth something. The smell is easily the body wash&#x27;s best attribute though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At only five dollars, this body wash is great for anyone looking to wash themselves with a new scent. Anyone looking for a skin toner should look elsewhere though. Expectations should not be unrealistic for a body wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still fairly young so I didn&#x27;t expect a huge difference in my skin. Given that, I appreciate the smooth feeling I get when I step out of the shower. I almost don&#x27;t need lotion. The lather is lovely and soft and also, the smell is great. Very fresh and light. I&#x27;m a Dove fan for life.</li>
            <li> PROS: It has a light pleasant scent. It&#x27;s very moisturizing. The lather is creamy and leaves your skin feeling soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: I&#x27;ve been using it each day for a week and have seen no visible toning. Because I knew I wasn&#x27;t likely to notice the difference, I took a picture of my leg before using and another after a week. There was no difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 STARS: It doesn&#x27;t keep its promising of more toned skin in one week, but otherwise, it&#x27;s a fantastic moisturizing body wash.</li>
            <li> Obviously, this is not a gym in a bottle. It&#x27;s not going to tone you up in a week. It is however, a great smelling body wash that improves the quality and tone of your skin. It lathers quite nicely and I noticed (although not a dramatic difference) a positive change in the moisture and tone of my skin. The scent is clean, light, and refreshing. My skin feels soft and smooth. I would definitely get this again.</li>
