            <li>Great product and price.</li>
            <li>If you must use an anti odor body wash to fight the funk, this is a great choice.</li>

            <li>Works great, no complaints and good price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, for the price and the smell and the great clean feeling, and the fact that it can be used in your hair too, I think it&#x27;s the best body wash I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Good smell non drying.</li>
            <li>good unobtrusive smell</li>
            <li>It does a good job of cleaning and doesn&#x27;t appear to leave any residue.  </li>

            <li>Good lather.  </li>

            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite scent!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a pleasant scent, that doesn&#x27;t clash with many colognes or deodorants.</li>
            <li>this stuff is amazing</li>
            <li>I smell amazing with this stuff.</li>
            <li>leaves an amazing smell.</li>
            <li>it has an amazing smell and is supported by prime.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and it&#x27;s a lot for your dollar.</li>
            <li>It smells nice but is not overpowering by any means.</li>
            <li>Feels nice on the skin.</li>
            <li>It smells nice without being overbearing.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t complain, it cleans well and smells nice.</li>
            <li>2 of my guys have shaved heads and one is kind of shaggy.</li>
            <li>They like it because it smells nice.</li>
            <li>The guys like having there own body wash.</li>
            <li>That just seems like the product itself should be formulated to be effective, instead of to look gray.  </li>
            <li>With this soap, I feel moisturized, clean, and I smell great</li>
            <li>Good Product, quick delivery!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best bodywash I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>A nice refreshing scent for a man</li>
            <li>You clean yourself with it and it makes you smell good.</li>
            <li>Another positive is it also is a deoderizer which seems to be a great add on, or just a marketing tequnique.</li>
            <li>I love smell &amp; my skin feels better</li>
            <li>Makes showers refreshing.</li>
            <li>and ive been temped to purchase two more.</li>
            <li>It was ok.</li>
            <li>but I prefer something that smells a bit better.</li>
            <li>Fantastic body wash with a amazing scent.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more of this.</li>
            <li>I ran our and bought two more bottles of this body</li>
            <li>I tried this product on a whim and am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>In fact, this body wash has more lather than any</li>
            <li>I love the smell on my husband.</li>
            <li>I have gone thought most of the liquid shower soaps.</li>
            <li>The magic ingredient here appears to be the silver</li>
            <li>REFRESHING AND NON SKIN DRYING</li>
            <li>My favorite body wash.</li>
            <li>Refreshing.</li>
            <li>I like most of the Nivea for Men products and the body wash doesn&#x27;t disappoint either.</li>
            <li>I was able to get rid on all that clutter in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Glad we are still able to get this product.</li>
            <li>Nivea is my favorite brand when it comes to men&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy that cares more about convenience rather than the smell/feel of the product, but man did the product deliver.</li>
            <li>(On a side note I got the orange citrus and it almost smells like a creamcicle but not as sweet, but still amazing).</li>
            <li>It does alright for taking care of smell, but given that Nivea stuff is usually pretty good, this stuff was a let-down.</li>
            <li>It has a great refreshing scent and leaves your skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Love the smell size and how easy it is to rinse off and lather up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super effective against body odor.</li>
            <li>it smells really good and makes me feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Honestly, this is the best body wash I&#x27;ve ever used, and it&#x27;s a frustration that it&#x27;s so hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li>I actually enjoyed this soap and feel clean and my wife likes the cleanliness smell.</li>
            <li>The texture is that off hand soap, which does the job, but if you are looking for a gel like substance that takes more water to rinse off and gives a deeper clean feel then this is not the product for you.  </li>
            <li>Easy to go on.</li>
            <li>Great product especially for those of looking for the most bang for the buck</li>
            <li>The smell is okay ... very synthetic and kind of medicinal.</li>
            <li>The odor is not too strong (which is a plus for me since I don&#x27;t like smelling like</li>
            <li>If you looking for something that will last and give you a great clean, this is the one for you!</li>
            <li>This is fine as a body wash.  </li>
            <li>The most positive note about this body wash is that the scent lasts longer than many others.</li>
            <li>Overall, great body wash that I prefer over others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this one.</li>
            <li>But this one is so much cheaper and can be used for many more purposes.</li>
            <li>I light it clean and light</li>
            <li>Fresh, clean scent!</li>
            <li>Having it be my first hair body/face wash, i am completely satisfied and plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li>If the prices goes up significantly, I&#x27;ll have to consider a competing product.</li>
            <li>All day long my husband smells great</li>
            <li>The smell of the body wash is very nice and light, and do not expect strong smell like on the other brands in the market.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t smell like a creamsicle), washes off cleanly, moisturizes well</li>
            <li>it is a good cost for what you get as you do not need to use much on a loofa to lather your whole body.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a 4 in 1, but I&#x27;m sure Nivea doesn&#x27;t advertise it that way so as not to detract people from buying their line of shaving products.  </li>
            <li>this stuff is kind of old school.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not only a good deodorant soap, you can shampoo and I also use it to lather my face</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not as great as the other</li>
            <li>The moderately thick gel flows nicely and lathers fairly well after a while.  </li>
            <li>The scent is mild and not over powering.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this soap seems to clean well and not leave a residue like many.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin, and still delivers a pleasant, lasting aroma.</li>
            <li>As a recently graduated college student the convenience of getting something so cheap to your house that smells pretty amazing is well worth it.</li>
            <li>The aroma is pleasant but not exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Hope you enjoy as much as I do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it was worth a try</li>
            <li>Yes they stopped selling it in the stores and that is the only kind my fiance says works</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried old spice, the dove for men (which are great), and countless others.</li>
            <li>It is thick and has rich lather and smells great.</li>
            <li>This particular &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; is fine.  </li>
            <li>This stuff smells good even after you get out of the shower unlike a lot of other 3 in 1 products.</li>
            <li>Nivea Men Platinum Protect is a good body wash, and cleans and rinses extremely well.</li>
            <li>The smell is just right - not overpowering.</li>
            <li>If you live in a dry, desert climate like I do, then this is a good solution to clean and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Spend maybe a dollar more than you usually would and use this stuff, because the bottle is manly and you smell nice for the ladies.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like most body washes do (which is important out here in the desert), and it leaves my skin feeling clean...with no residue feeling.  </li>
            <li>There is a little bit of Coconut or something along those lines that makes it smell really like the ocean (the almost salt/stale scent) which isn&#x27;t really a great thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That said, I would still buy this again - it&#x27;s decently priced and straightforward.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a rich lather that sticks to your body and is actually strong enough to get the dirt off.</li>
            <li>Okay not really the fresh clean scent I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li>Good product - it seems to leave just a little bit of a film on your skin...</li>
            <li>The smell itself is decent - kind of that generic &amp;#34;masculine&amp;#34; scent - but a bit</li>
            <li>As a shampoo, it left more residue than I like.  </li>
            <li>I was able to purchase this item at a local drug store for $4.99.</li>
            <li>Absolute keeper!</li>
            <li>Item exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>I love this stuff because I only have to buy one bottle.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product, but it simply does not stack up to competitors if you are looking to use this primarily as a body wash.</li>
            <li>The fact I can&#x27;t find this in stores because it is always sold out and am forced to buy online should tell you how great this stuff is...</li>
            <li>But as a body wash, it&#x27;s pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very convenient to be able to wash my hair and body with the same product.</li>
            <li>Really I like very much</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, pretty much every Nivea product I&#x27;ve ordered from Amazon has not been shipped correctly.</li>
            <li>For the price this cannot be beat and it smells amazing, not too strong but no too weak either.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;protect\\&quot; or smart deo is the silver citrate thats in this product.</li>
            <li>This is why i believe Nivea came up with the Smart Deo term.</li>
            <li>it leaves his skin soft and smelling amazing for a very long time even when he sweats.</li>
            <li>Its a pretty decent body wash.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend - purchased two, the first bottle has lasted quite a while</li>
            <li>and I am always on a timeline so only having to deal with one container in the shower is a HUGE time saver in of itself.  </li>
            <li>But that one isn&#x27;t readily available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nothing to really write about.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t fade fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The scent is not overpowering and I don&#x27;t really notice any intense scent after leaving the shower.  </li>
            <li>My guys really like this product.</li>
            <li>Not only was it cheap for a 16 oz bottle</li>
            <li>Since this is my first container of the new product my comments may be somewhat premature.  </li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way, smells great</li>
            <li>and yes I sneek a little too when I want to smell that clean, fresh scent!</li>
            <li>The main reason I picked this product is it doesn&#x27;t appear to have petrolatum in it.  </li>
            <li>It is super simple.  </li>
            <li>It appears that more of the product needs to be used to obtain the same amout of lather contained in the former product.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This product is highly recommended by him and me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t rinse off as cleanly as another product I reviewed recently, and seems to have a little more of a moisturizing effect, but it&#x27;s not heavy</li>
            <li>within acceptable amounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was because they both recently discovered showering daily or if it was the new soap, so I let the new new soap run out.  </li>
            <li>He was so soft and didn&#x27;t have to use as much lotion when he got out of the shower.</li>
            <li>Enjoying it everyday.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve subscribed via Amazon and receive two new bottles every month</li>
            <li>This ingredient is nothing new but in this type of application it is.</li>
            <li>Product has been repackaged and newly labeled.  </li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t sold where I live anymore:</li>
            <li>His eczema is actually better from using this because it sort of forces him to moisturize, which, apparently, isn&#x27;t a manly thing to do unless it comes in a grey and blue bottle and says &amp;#34;men&amp;#34; on the bottle.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes skin and provides fresh feeling for long time.</li>
            <li>This is different  from what most other anti odor body washes use which is triclosan.</li>
            <li>All Nivea Men body washes are great but this one is different because the scent is very subtle and this wash uses charcoal to fight odors.</li>
            <li>This review is for the Active Clean body wash.</li>
            <li>, one of my sons has eczema and this is the first deodorizing soap he&#x27;s ever been able to use without making it worse.  </li>
            <li>The bottle lasted a long time because you only need to use a little for a good amount of lather.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m talking soap EVERYWHERE in the box, all over the other contents, super</li>
            <li>I tend to have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It works really well as a deodorant for all regions of the human anatomy</li>
            <li>Axe/modern Old Spice-y; it can be overpowering at times.</li>
            <li>Not too much, just enough of a scent.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s not harsh or drying.</li>
            <li>It does not necessarily lather as much as some products but Nivea body wash does not contain so-called soap according to the packaging.</li>
            <li>contain sulfates, and probably nothing that comes naturally from the earth (aside from sunflower oil for some reason).</li>
            <li>The lather is super thin and doesn&#x27;t leave you with an impression it&#x27;s doing all that much to clean you up.</li>
            <li>Good product,  but expensive compared to others.</li>
            <li>Sorry it took me so long to discover this great product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything from super cheap to expensive.</li>
            <li>I can say, bar none, that no other body wash lathers like this one.</li>
            <li>I like it because it&#x27;s less expensive (and smells better, I think, than Axe) and gets my guys clean after baseball.</li>
            <li>It really does seem to neutralize body odors but the scent doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li>I alternate between various body wash products normally to keep things changed up.  </li>
            <li>This is because you wont be sure if you still have soap on or just the film/residue it leaves behind.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care for the ones with heavy scents like the ones marketed towards young males.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very dull and is not noticeable after drying off, whereas with Old Spice or Axe the clean scent lingers on your skin for hours.  </li>
            <li>I have very dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My husband has sensitive skin and this stuff is tough enough to un-stank, but gentle enough not to completely strip his skin.</li>
            <li>Unlike some of the traditional heavy scented men&#x27;s body washes, this has more of a cologne type of smell, not as typical as some of the other brands out there.</li>

            <li> Happy customer</li>
            <li> Smells great</li>
            <li> but it smells great and works well on my hair and as a lubricant for shaving.</li>
            <li> Great product and price.</li>
            <li> If you must use an anti odor body wash to fight the funk, this is a great choice.</li>
            <li> The search goes on, though there is a shampoo that to me seems to do great as an all-in one, reviewed separately.</li>
            <li> My wife thinks it smells great</li>
            <li> It smells great.</li>

            <li> Works great, no complaints and good price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, for the price and the smell and the great clean feeling, and the fact that it can be used in your hair too, I think it&#x27;s the best body wash I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Good smell non drying.</li>
            <li> good unobtrusive smell</li>
            <li> It does a good job of cleaning and doesn&#x27;t appear to leave any residue.  </li>

            <li> Feels good on the skin</li>
            <li> Good lather.  </li>

            <li> Smells good too.</li>

            <li> Leaves me clean and smelling good which is good for everybody!</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite scent!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a pleasant scent, that doesn&#x27;t clash with many colognes or deodorants.</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing</li>
            <li> I smell amazing with this stuff.</li>
            <li> leaves an amazing smell.</li>
            <li> it has an amazing smell and is supported by prime.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice and it&#x27;s a lot for your dollar.</li>
            <li> It smells nice but is not overpowering by any means.</li>
            <li> Feels nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> It smells nice without being overbearing.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain, it cleans well and smells nice.</li>
            <li> 2 of my guys have shaved heads and one is kind of shaggy.</li>
            <li> They like it because it smells nice.</li>
            <li> The guys like having there own body wash.</li>
            <li> That just seems like the product itself should be formulated to be effective, instead of to look gray.  </li>
            <li> With this soap, I feel moisturized, clean, and I smell great</li>
            <li> Good Product, quick delivery!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best bodywash I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> A nice refreshing scent for a man</li>
            <li> You clean yourself with it and it makes you smell good.</li>
            <li> Another positive is it also is a deoderizer which seems to be a great add on, or just a marketing tequnique.</li>
            <li> I love smell &amp; my skin feels better</li>
            <li> Makes showers refreshing.</li>
            <li> and ive been temped to purchase two more.</li>
            <li> It was ok.</li>
            <li> but I prefer something that smells a bit better.</li>
            <li> Fantastic body wash with a amazing scent.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more of this.</li>
            <li> I ran our and bought two more bottles of this body</li>
            <li> I tried this product on a whim and am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> In fact, this body wash has more lather than any</li>
            <li> I love the smell on my husband.</li>
            <li> I have gone thought most of the liquid shower soaps.</li>
            <li> The magic ingredient here appears to be the silver</li>
            <li> REFRESHING AND NON SKIN DRYING</li>
            <li> My favorite body wash.</li>
            <li> Refreshing.</li>
            <li> I like most of the Nivea for Men products and the body wash doesn&#x27;t disappoint either.</li>
            <li> I was able to get rid on all that clutter in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Glad we are still able to get this product.</li>
            <li> Nivea is my favorite brand when it comes to men&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy that cares more about convenience rather than the smell/feel of the product, but man did the product deliver.</li>
            <li> (On a side note I got the orange citrus and it almost smells like a creamcicle but not as sweet, but still amazing).</li>
            <li> It does alright for taking care of smell, but given that Nivea stuff is usually pretty good, this stuff was a let-down.</li>
            <li> It has a great refreshing scent and leaves your skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Love the smell size and how easy it is to rinse off and lather up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super effective against body odor.</li>
            <li> it smells really good and makes me feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this is the best body wash I&#x27;ve ever used, and it&#x27;s a frustration that it&#x27;s so hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I actually enjoyed this soap and feel clean and my wife likes the cleanliness smell.</li>
            <li> The texture is that off hand soap, which does the job, but if you are looking for a gel like substance that takes more water to rinse off and gives a deeper clean feel then this is not the product for you.  </li>
            <li> Easy to go on.</li>
            <li> Great product especially for those of looking for the most bang for the buck</li>
            <li> The smell is okay ... very synthetic and kind of medicinal.</li>
            <li> The odor is not too strong (which is a plus for me since I don&#x27;t like smelling like</li>
            <li> If you looking for something that will last and give you a great clean, this is the one for you!</li>
            <li> This is fine as a body wash.  </li>
            <li> The most positive note about this body wash is that the scent lasts longer than many others.</li>
            <li> Overall, great body wash that I prefer over others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this one.</li>
            <li> But this one is so much cheaper and can be used for many more purposes.</li>
            <li> I light it clean and light</li>
            <li> Fresh, clean scent!</li>
            <li> Having it be my first hair body/face wash, i am completely satisfied and plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> If the prices goes up significantly, I&#x27;ll have to consider a competing product.</li>
            <li> All day long my husband smells great</li>
            <li> The smell of the body wash is very nice and light, and do not expect strong smell like on the other brands in the market.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t smell like a creamsicle), washes off cleanly, moisturizes well</li>
            <li> it is a good cost for what you get as you do not need to use much on a loofa to lather your whole body.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a 4 in 1, but I&#x27;m sure Nivea doesn&#x27;t advertise it that way so as not to detract people from buying their line of shaving products.  </li>
            <li> this stuff is kind of old school.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not only a good deodorant soap, you can shampoo and I also use it to lather my face</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not as great as the other</li>
            <li> The moderately thick gel flows nicely and lathers fairly well after a while.  </li>
            <li> The scent is mild and not over powering.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this soap seems to clean well and not leave a residue like many.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin, and still delivers a pleasant, lasting aroma.</li>
            <li> As a recently graduated college student the convenience of getting something so cheap to your house that smells pretty amazing is well worth it.</li>
            <li> The aroma is pleasant but not exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Hope you enjoy as much as I do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it was worth a try</li>
            <li> Yes they stopped selling it in the stores and that is the only kind my fiance says works</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried old spice, the dove for men (which are great), and countless others.</li>
            <li> It is thick and has rich lather and smells great.</li>
            <li> This particular &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; is fine.  </li>
            <li> This stuff smells good even after you get out of the shower unlike a lot of other 3 in 1 products.</li>
            <li> Nivea Men Platinum Protect is a good body wash, and cleans and rinses extremely well.</li>
            <li> The smell is just right - not overpowering.</li>
            <li> If you live in a dry, desert climate like I do, then this is a good solution to clean and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Spend maybe a dollar more than you usually would and use this stuff, because the bottle is manly and you smell nice for the ladies.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like most body washes do (which is important out here in the desert), and it leaves my skin feeling clean...with no residue feeling.  </li>
            <li> There is a little bit of Coconut or something along those lines that makes it smell really like the ocean (the almost salt/stale scent) which isn&#x27;t really a great thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That said, I would still buy this again - it&#x27;s decently priced and straightforward.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a rich lather that sticks to your body and is actually strong enough to get the dirt off.</li>
            <li> Okay not really the fresh clean scent I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> Good product - it seems to leave just a little bit of a film on your skin...</li>
            <li> The smell itself is decent - kind of that generic &amp;#34;masculine&amp;#34; scent - but a bit</li>
            <li> As a shampoo, it left more residue than I like.  </li>
            <li> I was able to purchase this item at a local drug store for $4.99.</li>
            <li> Absolute keeper!</li>
            <li> Item exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> I love this stuff because I only have to buy one bottle.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product, but it simply does not stack up to competitors if you are looking to use this primarily as a body wash.</li>
            <li> The fact I can&#x27;t find this in stores because it is always sold out and am forced to buy online should tell you how great this stuff is...</li>
            <li> But as a body wash, it&#x27;s pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very convenient to be able to wash my hair and body with the same product.</li>
            <li> Really I like very much</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, pretty much every Nivea product I&#x27;ve ordered from Amazon has not been shipped correctly.</li>
            <li> For the price this cannot be beat and it smells amazing, not too strong but no too weak either.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;protect\\&quot; or smart deo is the silver citrate thats in this product.</li>
            <li> This is why i believe Nivea came up with the Smart Deo term.</li>
            <li> it leaves his skin soft and smelling amazing for a very long time even when he sweats.</li>
            <li> Its a pretty decent body wash.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend - purchased two, the first bottle has lasted quite a while</li>
            <li> and I am always on a timeline so only having to deal with one container in the shower is a HUGE time saver in of itself.  </li>
            <li> But that one isn&#x27;t readily available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing to really write about.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t fade fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> The scent is not overpowering and I don&#x27;t really notice any intense scent after leaving the shower.  </li>
            <li> My guys really like this product.</li>
            <li> Not only was it cheap for a 16 oz bottle</li>
            <li> Since this is my first container of the new product my comments may be somewhat premature.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, smells great</li>
            <li> and yes I sneek a little too when I want to smell that clean, fresh scent!</li>
            <li> The main reason I picked this product is it doesn&#x27;t appear to have petrolatum in it.  </li>
            <li> It is super simple.  </li>
            <li> It appears that more of the product needs to be used to obtain the same amout of lather contained in the former product.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product is highly recommended by him and me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t rinse off as cleanly as another product I reviewed recently, and seems to have a little more of a moisturizing effect, but it&#x27;s not heavy</li>
            <li> within acceptable amounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was because they both recently discovered showering daily or if it was the new soap, so I let the new new soap run out.  </li>
            <li> He was so soft and didn&#x27;t have to use as much lotion when he got out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Enjoying it everyday.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve subscribed via Amazon and receive two new bottles every month</li>
            <li> This ingredient is nothing new but in this type of application it is.</li>
            <li> Product has been repackaged and newly labeled.  </li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t sold where I live anymore:</li>
            <li> His eczema is actually better from using this because it sort of forces him to moisturize, which, apparently, isn&#x27;t a manly thing to do unless it comes in a grey and blue bottle and says &amp;#34;men&amp;#34; on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes skin and provides fresh feeling for long time.</li>
            <li> This is different  from what most other anti odor body washes use which is triclosan.</li>
            <li> All Nivea Men body washes are great but this one is different because the scent is very subtle and this wash uses charcoal to fight odors.</li>
            <li> This review is for the Active Clean body wash.</li>
            <li> , one of my sons has eczema and this is the first deodorizing soap he&#x27;s ever been able to use without making it worse.  </li>
            <li> The bottle lasted a long time because you only need to use a little for a good amount of lather.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking soap EVERYWHERE in the box, all over the other contents, super</li>
            <li> I tend to have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It works really well as a deodorant for all regions of the human anatomy</li>
            <li> Axe/modern Old Spice-y; it can be overpowering at times.</li>
            <li> Not too much, just enough of a scent.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not harsh or drying.</li>
            <li> It does not necessarily lather as much as some products but Nivea body wash does not contain so-called soap according to the packaging.</li>
            <li> contain sulfates, and probably nothing that comes naturally from the earth (aside from sunflower oil for some reason).</li>
            <li> The lather is super thin and doesn&#x27;t leave you with an impression it&#x27;s doing all that much to clean you up.</li>
            <li> Good product,  but expensive compared to others.</li>
            <li> Sorry it took me so long to discover this great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from super cheap to expensive.</li>
            <li> I can say, bar none, that no other body wash lathers like this one.</li>
            <li> I like it because it&#x27;s less expensive (and smells better, I think, than Axe) and gets my guys clean after baseball.</li>
            <li> It really does seem to neutralize body odors but the scent doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> I alternate between various body wash products normally to keep things changed up.  </li>
            <li> This is because you wont be sure if you still have soap on or just the film/residue it leaves behind.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for the ones with heavy scents like the ones marketed towards young males.  </li>
            <li> The scent is very dull and is not noticeable after drying off, whereas with Old Spice or Axe the clean scent lingers on your skin for hours.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My husband has sensitive skin and this stuff is tough enough to un-stank, but gentle enough not to completely strip his skin.</li>
            <li> Unlike some of the traditional heavy scented men&#x27;s body washes, this has more of a cologne type of smell, not as typical as some of the other brands out there.</li>
            <li> We have very hard water, and most body wash seems harsh and loses its lather quickly.</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of the Nivea product line and will continue to use their various types of products.</li>
            <li> Every single Nivea product I have gotten through Subscribe and Save or Prime Pantry was open and leaking all over the place when I got it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not interested in having to have separate products to do the same basic thing.  </li>
            <li> He has very dry skin especially just out of the shower</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but I like a really nice frangrance.</li>
            <li> this is harder to find my local Kmart seem to have stop carrying it</li>
            <li> Silver has been used for its antimicrobial  properties for a long time, think silver dollars in milk.</li>
            <li> Alternate with other Nivea Body 3 and 1 wash.</li>
            <li> My husband and boys use this and dont have the dry itchy skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> Does not leave that soapy feeling that you cant wash off, nor does it dry you out</li>
            <li> It seems to make the hard water feel soft - with that slight slippery feel - which some might find good and other might find bad.</li>
            <li> This will add an extra minute or so to your routine as you will need to rinse off for a little longer.</li>
            <li> So if you want a deodorizing wash with not much scent</li>
            <li> Ever since switching from soap to bodywash a few years back</li>
            <li> does not feel wet.</li>
            <li> Other Nivea Body wash in supply as well as other Nivea Products.</li>
            <li> One other side benefit is that it seems to &#x27;soften&#x27; your water.</li>
            <li> Creamy, doesn&#x27;t run out of suds like other brands.  </li>
            <li> But with other soaps and liquids we&#x27;ve ordered, they&#x27;ve been wrapped in plastic baggies with seals, and no leaks.</li>
            <li> I just hope nivea keeps making it because it&#x27;s getting hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> The lather on this is somewhat thin, but long lasting.</li>
            <li> I also live in the cold and dry northeast.</li>
            <li> Instead, even after a day of playing soccer and riding bikes for miles in the Texas heat, they smell like humans - maybe a little sweaty, but</li>
            <li> it smells a little too after shavey for me...</li>
            <li> Triclosan has come under scrutiny in the past few years due to unwanted effects on the environment</li>
            <li> I little heavy on the scenting.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.  </li>
            <li> but it does smell like deodorizer and isn&#x27;t heavily sudsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re looking for something without chemicals a spelling bee champion would have trouble with, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> A long time user of Old Spice and Axe body wash, I am thoroughly disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> After you dry yourself off it becomes unnoticeable and i believe it may be for the long-term odor control / elimination and poor cleansing.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to try these 2/3 in one shower washes for the mere convenience in not having to deal with using multiple bottles.  </li>
            <li> A small amount will lather forever.</li>
            <li> Not sure what else I could add.</li>
            <li> My skin does not get negatively effected in terms of reactions, dryness or zits etc..</li>
            <li> It is subtle and not overpowering like some.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worse than like the $0.99 Suave stuff from Safeway.</li>
            <li> However, when washing it off it leaves a thin film on.</li>
            <li> The smell is stronger out of the bottle, but very subtle after you shower.</li>
            <li> is very subtle</li>

            <li> Smells awesome, my bf loves this stuff</li>
            <li> I love smell &amp; my skin feels better</li>
            <li> You clean yourself with it and it makes you smell good. Spend maybe a dollar more than you usually would and use this stuff, because the bottle is manly and you smell nice for the ladies. They like that stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of different body washes by various different companies throughout my life. I can say, bar none, that no other body wash lathers like this one. It&#x27;s a rich lather that sticks to your body and is actually strong enough to get the dirt off. For the price this cannot be beat and it smells amazing, not too strong but no too weak either. Try this!!</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing</li>
            <li> Makes showers refreshing. However the scent isn&#x27;t as great as I wanted it to be. There is a little bit of Coconut or something along those lines that makes it smell really like the ocean (the almost salt/stale scent) which isn&#x27;t really a great thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not as great as the other Nivea Platinum Protect Deodorizing Body Wash: Citrus Explosion. But that one isn&#x27;t readily available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This still does the trick.</li>
            <li> My husband and boys use this and dont have the dry itchy skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> Good Product, quick delivery!</li>
            <li> This is fine as a body wash.  As a shampoo, it left more residue than I like.  The smell is nice and it&#x27;s a lot for your dollar.</li>
            <li> I was able to purchase this item at a local drug store for $4.99. Having it be my first hair body/face wash, i am completely satisfied and plan to continue using it. I have always wanted to try these 2/3 in one shower washes for the mere convenience in not having to deal with using multiple bottles.  It does leave &#x27;somewhat&#x27; of an slippery post wash feeling on your skin, but nothing to be discouraged about. After you dry yourself off it becomes unnoticeable and i believe it may be for the long-term odor control / elimination and poor cleansing. My skin does not get negatively effected in terms of reactions, dryness or zits etc.. In fact, i have noticed a decrease in the amount of pimples that appear on my face after using this. I highly recommend - purchased two, the first bottle has lasted quite a while and ive been temped to purchase two more.</li>
            <li> This great body wash comes with a great price. It smells nice but is not overpowering by any means. I tend to have sensitive skin but this wash hasn&#x27;t produced any sort of reaction after months of use. It&#x27;s very convenient to be able to wash my hair and body with the same product.</li>
            <li> It was ok. Nothing to really write about. Got the job done</li>
            <li> It feels very good to the skin but I prefer something that smells a bit better. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but I like a really nice frangrance.</li>
            <li> Perfect for winter. I have very dry and sensitive skin. I also live in the cold and dry northeast. With this soap, I feel moisturized, clean, and I smell great and it doesn&#x27;t make me itch. Awesome stuff. Sorry it took me so long to discover this great product. Absolute keeper!</li>
            <li> Fantastic body wash with a amazing scent. Would highly recommend. Hope you enjoy as much as I do.</li>
            <li> Good smell non drying.</li>
            <li> If you looking for something that will last and give you a great clean, this is the one for you! The bottle lasted a long time because you only need to use a little for a good amount of lather.  I will be ordering more of this.</li>
            <li> Alternate with other Nivea Body 3 and 1 wash.Other Nivea Body wash in supply as well as other Nivea Products.All are Great products.</li>
            <li> Feels nice on the skin. Does not leave that soapy feeling that you cant wash off, nor does it dry you out so you itch. I think i will stick with this for a while.</li>
            <li> Great smell. This is my husband&#x27;s favorite scent! It also doesn&#x27;t fade fast.</li>
            <li> I bought this because one of my two teenage sons was stealing my body wash regularly, but it&#x27;s had an additional benefit I didn&#x27;t anticipate.  Both of my sons use it and now neither of them smell like teenage boy!  Instead, even after a day of playing soccer and riding bikes for miles in the Texas heat, they smell like humans - maybe a little sweaty, but within acceptable amounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was because they both recently discovered showering daily or if it was the new soap, so I let the new new soap run out.  MISTAKE  Ack!  I ran our and bought two more bottles of this body wash  three days later.  Now that I&#x27;ve subscribed via Amazon and receive two new bottles every month I can even go into their bedrooms without being concerned I might faint from the overwhelming scent of locker room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, one of my sons has eczema and this is the first deodorizing soap he&#x27;s ever been able to use without making it worse.  His eczema is actually better from using this because it sort of forces him to moisturize, which, apparently, isn&#x27;t a manly thing to do unless it comes in a grey and blue bottle and says &amp;#34;men&amp;#34; on the bottle.</li>
            <li> good unobtrusive smell</li>
            <li> I tried this product on a whim and am glad I did.  The moderately thick gel flows nicely and lathers fairly well after a while.  It does a good job of cleaning and doesn&#x27;t appear to leave any residue.  It smells nice without being overbearing.  Haven&#x27;t used it as a shampoo as I prefer a product that is dedicated for hair cleansing.  The main reason I picked this product is it doesn&#x27;t appear to have petrolatum in it.  Purchased this as a subscribe and save item at $5 each.  That&#x27;s a good price for 16.9 ounces.  If the prices goes up significantly, I&#x27;ll have to consider a competing product.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have in my shower.  It&#x27;s really a 4 in 1, but I&#x27;m sure Nivea doesn&#x27;t advertise it that way so as not to detract people from buying their line of shaving products.  It works really well as a deodorant for all regions of the human anatomy</li>
            <li> This line of Nivea products is great. I use it for body wash and for shaving. I also use it for shampoo at the gym when I want to have just one bottle. The scent is mild and not over powering.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this. He has very dry skin especially just out of the shower but he loves this body wash. It is thick and has rich lather and smells great. He was so soft and didn&#x27;t have to use as much lotion when he got out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Like the smell and the soapiness of this body wash. Feels good on the skin and I often use it as a shampoo which is listed on the product. Very happy and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> The most positive note about this body wash is that the scent lasts longer than many others. It&#x27;s not like some body washes where you can&#x27;t even smell them fifteen minutes after showering. The smell itself is decent - kind of that generic &amp;#34;masculine&amp;#34; scent - but a bit Axe/modern Old Spice-y; it can be overpowering at times. That said, I would still buy this again - it&#x27;s decently priced and straightforward.</li>
            <li> Good body wash, does the job, lathers good, and has a good scent that lasts thru out the day. I&#x27;ll buy again</li>
            <li> Good lather.  I little heavy on the scenting. I don&#x27;t really care for the ones with heavy scents like the ones marketed towards young males.  This has about the same amount of scenting as those.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain, it cleans well and smells nice.</li>
            <li> Item exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> The smell is okay ... very synthetic and kind of medicinal. The lather is super thin and doesn&#x27;t leave you with an impression it&#x27;s doing all that much to clean you up. It does alright for taking care of smell, but given that Nivea stuff is usually pretty good, this stuff was a let-down. It&#x27;s worse than like the $0.99 Suave stuff from Safeway. I&#x27;ll be getting something else next go-round.</li>
            <li> Smells good, and lathers up nicely on a loofah.  As a shampoo I would only give it 3 stars... I just don&#x27;t feel like it cleans my hair all that well.  I use spike glues, so I need a shampoo that can cut through them.</li>
            <li> I have a husband and 2 teenage boys in my house. I love this stuff because I only have to buy one bottle. 2 of my guys have shaved heads and one is kind of shaggy. It works great on all 3 of their heads. They like it because it smells nice. I like it because it&#x27;s less expensive (and smells better, I think, than Axe) and gets my guys clean after baseball.</li>
            <li> I smell amazing with this stuff.</li>
            <li> This review is for the Active Clean body wash. All Nivea Men body washes are great but this one is different because the scent is very subtle and this wash uses charcoal to fight odors. It really does seem to neutralize body odors but the scent doesn&#x27;t last long at all. So if you want a deodorizing wash with not much scent this is for you.</li>
            <li> Makes you smell like a man. I actually enjoyed this soap and feel clean and my wife likes the cleanliness smell. So that always will make me buy again.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.  It is super simple.  Being a guy I like to get in and out of the shower and I am always on a timeline so only having to deal with one container in the shower is a HUGE time saver in of itself.  On top of that this product is the perfect scent for a guy.  It is subtle and not overpowering like some.  Love it!  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Fresh, clean scent! Not too much, just enough of a scent.  This is one of my husbands favortist body washes and yes I sneek a little too when I want to smell that clean, fresh scent!</li>
            <li> Moisturizes skin and provides fresh feeling for long time.</li>
            <li> Great shower body wash. The smell is stronger out of the bottle, but very subtle after you shower. A small amount will lather forever. In fact, this body wash has more lather than any I&#x27;ve ever used, so smaller doses will help this last longer. One other side benefit is that it seems to &#x27;soften&#x27; your water. We have very hard water, and most body wash seems harsh and loses its lather quickly. Not so with the Nivea (I chose Ocean Burst). It seems to make the hard water feel soft - with that slight slippery feel - which some might find good and other might find bad. Overall, great body wash that I prefer over others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like most body washes do (which is important out here in the desert), and it leaves my skin feeling clean...with no residue feeling.  I don&#x27;t have a sense of smell (shot in the grape), so I can&#x27;t personally vouch for the scent, but my girlfriend has no complaints!</li>
            <li> I love the smell on my husband. it leaves his skin soft and smelling amazing for a very long time even when he sweats. Happy customer</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this soap seems to clean well and not leave a residue like many. it is a good cost for what you get as you do not need to use much on a loofa to lather your whole body. have purchased several times and will continue..</li>
            <li> Husband loves this! Smells great</li>
            <li> I have gone thought most of the liquid shower soaps. I ALWAYS come back to the NIVEA MEN products matter of fact now I only use NIVEA products From the scrubs to the lotions. I really enjoy this one.</li>
            <li> Good product - it seems to leave just a little bit of a film on your skin...sort of a greasy feeling...but it smells great and works well on my hair and as a lubricant for shaving.</li>
            <li> It works. The odor is not too strong (which is a plus for me since I don&#x27;t like smelling like I just came out of a perfume shop) and it gets the work done.</li>
            <li> Great product and price.</li>
            <li> A long time user of Old Spice and Axe body wash, I am thoroughly disappointed with this product.  The scent is very dull and is not noticeable after drying off, whereas with Old Spice or Axe the clean scent lingers on your skin for hours.  The texture is that off hand soap, which does the job, but if you are looking for a gel like substance that takes more water to rinse off and gives a deeper clean feel then this is not the product for you.  Not a bad product, but it simply does not stack up to competitors if you are looking to use this primarily as a body wash.</li>
            <li> Its a pretty decent body wash. I like the scent only wish it was just a touch stronger. The product does leave your skin moisturized. However, when washing it off it leaves a thin film on. This will add an extra minute or so to your routine as you will need to rinse off for a little longer. This is because you wont be sure if you still have soap on or just the film/residue it leaves behind. The lather on this is somewhat thin, but long lasting. You dont need to \\&quot;recharge\\&quot; your wash cloth/loofah as i had to do often with a cheaper product that i was using. The \\&quot;protect\\&quot; or smart deo is the silver citrate thats in this product. This has anti-microbial properties. This ingredient is nothing new but in this type of application it is. This is why i believe Nivea came up with the Smart Deo term. All in all i think its a winner. **Seems like this is harder to find my local Kmart seem to have stop carrying it and i didnt see it in the CVS nearest me (although that CVS is smallish). Target has also stopped carrying it as well..</li>
            <li> The guys like having there own body wash.</li>
            <li> Works Great, Kills odors for most of the day.</li>
            <li> Ever since switching from soap to bodywash a few years back I&#x27;ve gone thru multiple brands of men&#x27;s body wash. I&#x27;ve tried everything from super cheap to expensive. This is by far the best bodywash I&#x27;ve used. A little bit goes a long way, smells great ( the orange burst or whatever they call it is very subtle You won&#x27;t smell like a creamsicle), washes off cleanly, moisturizes well and it actually does protect against smell. The magic ingredient here appears to be the silver citrate- this stuff is kind of old school. Silver has been used for its antimicrobial  properties for a long time, think silver dollars in milk. It is also used in medical equipment to prevent bacterial colonization (some catheters and wound dressings). This is different  from what most other anti odor body washes use which is triclosan. Triclosan has come under scrutiny in the past few years due to unwanted effects on the environment (dioxin production when exposed to uv), it is a possible endocrine disruptor and may contribute to antibiotic resistance . So is the silver any safer than Triclosan? From what I&#x27;ve read it appears to be. If you must use an anti odor body wash to fight the funk, this is a great choice. I just hope nivea keeps making it because it&#x27;s getting hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> Good product,  but expensive compared to others.</li>
            <li> A nice refreshing scent for a man</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that can be both shampoo and body wash in one for quite some time.  I&#x27;m not interested in having to have separate products to do the same basic thing.  The liquid is sorta gray/silver, and that makes me think it was formulated to look the same color as the bottle.  That just seems like the product itself should be formulated to be effective, instead of to look gray.  It does have a disinfectant/deodorant smell, somewhat industrial/artificial/chemical, and I can&#x27;t attest to its effectiveness as a deodorizer but it does smell like deodorizer and isn&#x27;t heavily sudsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t rinse off as cleanly as another product I reviewed recently, and seems to have a little more of a moisturizing effect, but it&#x27;s not heavy so it doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy like some body washes can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it was worth a try but I won&#x27;t be re-ordering it.  The search goes on, though there is a shampoo that to me seems to do great as an all-in one, reviewed separately.</li>
            <li> Easy to go on. does not feel wet. wife loves the scent.</li>
            <li> Product has been repackaged and newly labeled.  Since this is my first container of the new product my comments may be somewhat premature.  It appears that more of the product needs to be used to obtain the same amout of lather contained in the former product.  I am a long time user of the Nivea product line and will continue to use their various types of products.</li>
            <li> REFRESHING AND NON SKIN DRYING</li>
            <li> My favorite body wash.</li>
            <li> Love the smell size and how easy it is to rinse off and lather up. My wife thinks it smells great</li>
            <li> Okay not really the fresh clean scent I&#x27;m looking for. it smells a little too after shavey for me...I light it clean and light</li>
            <li> Doesnt smell as great as i thought it would be, kind of burns your nose for a bit..</li>
            <li> Yes they stopped selling it in the stores and that is the only kind my fiance says works</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  Enjoying it everyday.</li>
            <li> Refreshing. Cleans without stripping. If you live in a dry, desert climate like I do, then this is a good solution to clean and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> The fact I can&#x27;t find this in stores because it is always sold out and am forced to buy online should tell you how great this stuff is...leaves an amazing smell.</li>
            <li> Its good does its work</li>
            <li> Bottom line it smells really good and makes me feel clean and fresh. Not sure what else I could add.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this is the best body wash I&#x27;ve ever used, and it&#x27;s a frustration that it&#x27;s so hard to find in stores. It&#x27;s got a pleasant scent, that doesn&#x27;t clash with many colognes or deodorants. It&#x27;s super effective against body odor. And it&#x27;s not harsh or drying.</li>
            <li> I alternate between various body wash products normally to keep things changed up.  This particular &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; is fine.  It works well on hair and body as advertised.  The scent is not overpowering and I don&#x27;t really notice any intense scent after leaving the shower.  It does not necessarily lather as much as some products but Nivea body wash does not contain so-called soap according to the packaging.</li>
            <li> I like most of the Nivea for Men products and the body wash doesn&#x27;t disappoint either. It has a great refreshing scent and leaves your skin soft and moisturized. Unlike some of the traditional heavy scented men&#x27;s body washes, this has more of a cologne type of smell, not as typical as some of the other brands out there. Most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin, and still delivers a pleasant, lasting aroma.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been jumping around from body wash to body wash. I&#x27;ve tried old spice, the dove for men (which are great), and countless others. However, for the price and the smell and the great clean feeling, and the fact that it can be used in your hair too, I think it&#x27;s the best body wash I&#x27;ve used. Comparatively, the only one that competes is the dove for men. But this one is so much cheaper and can be used for many more purposes.</li>
            <li> Really I like very much</li>
            <li> My guys really like this product. It smells great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for when you are sleeping over someone&#x27;s house since you can use it as shampoo and body wash.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells good even after you get out of the shower unlike a lot of other 3 in 1 products. We will continue to buy this in the future!</li>
            <li> I have three males living in my household. They like this because it&#x27;s one product that cleans, hair and skin. Smells good too.</li>
            <li> All day long my husband smells great and he uses it constantly.  This product is highly recommended by him and me.</li>
            <li> Best body wash I&#x27;ve ever used!  Creamy, doesn&#x27;t run out of suds like other brands.  Stick with the &amp;#34;Platinum Protect&amp;#34; in the silver bottle, however, as the blue bottle is not the same product and not the same quality.</li>
            <li> Good lather, good smell, does the job. My husband has sensitive skin and this stuff is tough enough to un-stank, but gentle enough not to completely strip his skin. He does not use this as a shampoo, so I can&#x27;t speak to that. But as a body wash, it&#x27;s pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does contain sulfates, and probably nothing that comes naturally from the earth (aside from sunflower oil for some reason). So if you&#x27;re looking for something without chemicals a spelling bee champion would have trouble with, this isn&#x27;t for you. If you don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll sleep over some Yellow 5, you&#x27;re all good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, pretty much every Nivea product I&#x27;ve ordered from Amazon has not been shipped correctly. Every single Nivea product I have gotten through Subscribe and Save or Prime Pantry was open and leaking all over the place when I got it. These bottles were no exception. Buy this in a store instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We used to be subscribed to this wash, but almost every bottle we received was open and leaking all over the place when we got it. But with other soaps and liquids we&#x27;ve ordered, they&#x27;ve been wrapped in plastic baggies with seals, and no leaks. My husband likes this body wash, but we&#x27;ve unsubscribed after getting three bottles that were busted on back to back shipments. I&#x27;m talking soap EVERYWHERE in the box, all over the other contents, super messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We now purchase this in a store instead of having it shipped.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not only a good deodorant soap, you can shampoo and I also use it to lather my face so I can shave while in the shower.  I was able to get rid on all that clutter in the shower.  The smell is just right - not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Glad we are still able to get this product.</li>
            <li> Nivea is my favorite brand when it comes to men&#x27;s products. Nivea Men Platinum Protect is a good body wash, and cleans and rinses extremely well. Although it is meant to work for shaving too, I prefer to use regular Nivea Shave Gel for it. The smell of the body wash is very nice and light, and do not expect strong smell like on the other brands in the market.</li>
            <li> A great body wash, pleasant scent and long-lasting. We would recommend it to others and the price was quite good</li>
            <li> It smells very good and was a great price too.  I will definitely continue to buy it for my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> This is the best body wash! My only fear is that Nivea is discontinuing it. That&#x27;s why I bought 6 of them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy that cares more about convenience rather than the smell/feel of the product, but man did the product deliver. Not only was it cheap for a 16 oz bottle it has an amazing smell and is supported by prime. As a recently graduated college student the convenience of getting something so cheap to your house that smells pretty amazing is well worth it. (On a side note I got the orange citrus and it almost smells like a creamcicle but not as sweet, but still amazing). Great product especially for those of looking for the most bang for the buck</li>
            <li> The product does what its supposed to. The aroma is pleasant but not exactly what I was expecting. It lathers up well and once washed off it leaves a feeling of moisturized skin.</li>
            <li> No complaints.  Nice lather, excellent scent and got it on sale!</li>
            <li> Leaves me clean and smelling good which is good for everybody!</li>
            <li> Works great, no complaints and good price.&lt;br /&gt; Another positive is it also is a deoderizer which seems to be a great add on, or just a marketing tequnique.</li>
            <li> Got this for the bf, it smells really great!</li>
            <li> Best body wash I&#x27;ve ever used. Rinces clean,smells great,stops the funk and never dries me out. Isn&#x27;t sold where I live anymore:(</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff and for under $3 I&#x27;m sold! IT smells great and leaves his skin softer. It&#x27;s also 3-in-1 which is convenient.</li>
