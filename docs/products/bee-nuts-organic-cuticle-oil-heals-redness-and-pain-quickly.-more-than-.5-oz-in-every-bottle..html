            <li>Bee!~keep up the good work!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells good but doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job on cuticles and skin on the hands.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with this Cuticle Oil, it smells great and makes the skin where the oil touched extremely soft!</li>
            <li>Maybe that&#x27;s my own problem! :)</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>One of my favorite beauty products!  </li>
            <li>Will be checking out more of their products!  </li>
            <li>And being a manicurist for years, i&#x27;ve tried MANY!</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that it is organic!</li>
            <li>Love the smell of cloves on my fingers!  </li>
            <li>It does smooth out the cuticle area, smells great, and moisturizes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>It has been amazing.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t absorb into my skin at all and just kind of sat there.</li>
            <li>Also the smell is nice, doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and isn&#x27;t overly greasy - seems to sink in well.</li>
            <li>my coworker kept borrowing it and now she just bought her own.</li>
            <li>The oil is nice, but I have to say I agree with comments about the clove scent - I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>I tried this one on a whim, and honestly, if used correctly, you will see improvement with the cuticles overnight.  </li>
            <li>This is an okay cuticle oil, but it is not as good as solar oil, as it claims.</li>
            <li>This is a great natural oil that makes cuticles look great.</li>
            <li>Yes, the smell of cloves is very strong, but I like that smell.  </li>
            <li>I ABSOLUTELY LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is great stuff that really delivers!</li>
            <li>Love love love Bee Nuts</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased.</li>
            <li>I love everything about it.  </li>
            <li>Leave my nails and cuticles looking healthy.  </li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>This smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that I would agree that it is better than solar oil</li>
            <li>I love this cuticle oil.  </li>
            <li>love this.</li>
            <li>I will keep you updated on its progress but much better</li>
            <li>The product didn&#x27;t work any better than others that smell much better.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This is a lovely product.</li>
            <li>the customer service can be an important part of the buying experience too, so I thought I&#x27;d add my own.</li>
            <li>** better than Solar Oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is definitely the best cuticle oil I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>And the smell is FANTASTIC!  </li>
            <li>I chose this because I wanted to see if it was indeed better than solar oil.</li>
            <li>An application of the oil can help alleviate the sort of enticing itchy pain associated with my picking - the feeling that makes picking seem rewarding.</li>
            <li>I bought this based on someone else&#x27;s review; I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>Also the seller sent me a free sample of their body cream and a coupon which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>but this stuff seems to be better</li>
            <li>love that its organic.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think I am hooked! :)</li>
            <li>Excellent on cuticles - especially in winter.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m happy with my new found product.  </li>
            <li>This soaks in quickly and smells nice.  </li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and it helps my dry cuticles.</li>
            <li>and I find that it can really extend the life of a good manicure or pedicure by keeping the skin around the nails (and polish)</li>
            <li>good smell and really helps to relieve discomfort.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased other products from this company and ALL of their products are incredible!</li>
            <li>I also prefer not to wear it during the day at work, because the smell is rather strong.  </li>
            <li>I thought my nails were strong already</li>
            <li>Great for cuticles, too, but my primary purpose with this oil was improving the health of my bare nails.  </li>
            <li>It does smell like cloves which is fine by me.</li>
            <li>it heals quickly!</li>
            <li>Super!</li>
            <li>Oh, and my cuticles are looking mighty fine too.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>oil is fragrant with a light spiced aroma, like cloves.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The touted numbing qualities seem to be as advertised, though there is no guarantee that the ingredients are all fabulous and certified organic.</li>
            <li>I wanted a good, natural cuticle oil and this is it.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace an old tube of avon cuticle treatment cream thinking oil would be better, and I liked the fact that this is organic.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>It has a strong, although pleasant, odor of cloves (smells like the old vitamin E lotion) and absorbs rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>I bought this oil to replace my almost-empty bottle of Solar Oil - and since I&#x27;ll try anything new if it claims to be better, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try!</li>
            <li>I love how it feels and gets absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>First of all, I love the clove fragrance.</li>
            <li>I apply at night and wake up with nice soft cuticles!</li>
            <li>but since I wasn&#x27;t familiar with them, I was happy to see they offer samples at a minimal cost.</li>
            <li>but I was hoping that it really did magic.  </li>
            <li>I still have a bottle that&#x27;s 3/4 full</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all natural, smells great, and leaves my cuticles soft and pain free.</li>
            <li>I find the fragrance to be natural and warm.</li>
            <li>am a cuticle picker, and the claim that the clove has numbing/soothing properties seems to be true.</li>
            <li>I have always had nails that peel easily and are pretty weak/flexible.  </li>
            <li>It does help with cuticles to quickly heal, but it also works on any cut or bug bite.  </li>
            <li>and it seems to penetrate better than this particular product.</li>
            <li>It soaks into the skin relatively quickly so you don&#x27;t have to go around with oily hands.</li>
            <li>Not only does this product work better than any other I have tried over the last year, it smells amazing and feels wonderful.  </li>
            <li>My husband isn&#x27;t happy until he had gnawed his fingers down to the bone.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to cuticle oil but love this product.</li>
            <li>This one is highly moisturizing but what I love most is that it has clove oil in the ingredients which is a natural antiseptic.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something just a little more amazing than solar oil and this product wasn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>Great product, with a few quibbles, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s all natural oils</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, it definitely is loaded with cloves, but not overpowering.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  currently a bit cheaper on Amazon, but still kind of pricey for a cuticle treatment&lt;</li>
            <li>For $10 I would have liked a bigger bottle</li>
            <li>both my thumb and my big toe have clean healthy nails</li>
            <li>Feels really good but smells very strongly of cloves - not a great smell you want around your head if you&#x27;re about to sleep or eat.</li>
            <li>I have a nail that I caught in a door 10 years ago and it will not grow right.</li>
            <li>it goes on super smooth and soaks in completely in about 10-15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely dry cuticles and have tried numerous products  Soaks right in; cuticles look great and stay softened; and this is the first day I&#x27;ve used it!  </li>
            <li>Thanks a ton Queen Bee!</li>
            <li>The scent is great, and the oil is fairly thick so it does not run all over the place.</li>
            <li>it worked, I just went back to order two more</li>
            <li>They are not totally healed, but they are getting better.</li>
            <li>To my amazement, the condition of my skin improved within two days, and healed up pretty well by day 5.</li>
            <li>thought at first that it was a bit expensive, but I have been very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>sure enough...</li>
            <li>I really like this cuticle oil!</li>
            <li>I use it 1-2x daily, rub it in nails and cubicles and can swear it&#x27;s by far the first effective product I&#x27;ve ever tried for this</li>
            <li>This oil nicely moisturizers your cuticles which are especially  dry during the winter.</li>
            <li>&quot; was probably the best product to use for cuticles, but I had done a little research about other brands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lovely for the hands, but also for scrapes and minor cuts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not better than Solar Oil - it&#x27;s just as good.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see the tremendous improvement in my cuticles.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and absorbs easily (not &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>I bite my cuticles all the time, and this is amazing...a little oily, but just rub it in before bedtime, honestly</li>
            <li>I have very dry cuticles, especially in the winter, and so far this has done a great job of moisturizing them.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to</li>
            <li>Minimizes redness very well.</li>
            <li>This works very well to relieve discomfort and condition cuticle area.</li>
            <li>makes a real difference in the dryness of my hands.</li>
            <li>My nails are much healthier now.  </li>
            <li>I really like the clove smell.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is really darling.</li>
            <li>This oil made my cuticles seem much healthier, which was the result I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>really</li>
            <li>Just a few days later all the skin around his fingers is looking so healthy and smooth, almost healed!  </li>
            <li>I just wouldn&#x27;t want to be applying some ingredients for ethical or health concerns.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;i really thought it was just going to resplit again as it had for years, but</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really \\&quot;paint\\&quot; the oil onto my cuticles.</li>
            <li>I have a problem with a wart growing at the cuticle area of my thumb and this stuff is really working to fix it.  </li>
            <li>but after using the oil I&#x27;ve notice that my nails look much nicer when I file them and they are not brittle.</li>
            <li>Really fixes my winter cuticles.</li>
            <li>But the oil itself is the real headliner.</li>
            <li>My other nails and cuticles are in100% better shape than before I started to use it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone who has cuticle issues and normally resorts to biting them off (you know what I&#x27;m talking about!).</li>
            <li>a new staple in my nail-care routine!</li>
            <li>typically put this on before bed, so that it can spend the most time soaking in.  </li>
            <li>We think this is a clever product for traveling.  </li>
            <li>Decent cuticle oil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My nails are still on the flexible side instead of hard (meaning that polish chips off more easily because my nails bend), but they are definitely stronger.  </li>
            <li>The company also sent several samples of their other products with the order, which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised at how fast it worked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m all for organic food, but normally I find beauty supplies to be less-than-optimal when compared to the processed and chemically &amp;#34;enriched&amp;#34; products.  </li>
            <li>The smell is nice (if you like cloves), but I used this product daily for a few weeks and really did not notice a difference.</li>
            <li>Good but not great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not unpleasant, but as a young male I&#x27;d rather not have to explain to my coworkers that I&#x27;m putting Bee Nuts on my cuticles...</li>
            <li>It smells live cloves, which I like.</li>
            <li>I plan on using this for a long, long time,  and will buy the &amp;#34;Lavish&amp;#34; skin cream, a sample of which was included with oil, and has an astonishingly luxurious consistency</li>
            <li>It is all natural and smells like cloves!</li>
            <li>Better than nothing, but not better than solar oil.</li>
            <li>I have almost used the entire first bottle.</li>
            <li>My work dries them out and this helps keep them moist and keep the cuticle soft.</li>
            <li>After 3 or 4 applications, I see a marked improvement in the condition of my cuticles.</li>
            <li>It seems to soak into the cuticle and nail, leaving a soft sheen on the surface of the nail.</li>
            <li>this stuff fixed it.  </li>
            <li>This cuticle oil far outperforms this.  </li>
            <li>The skin on my hands is very dry right now - including the cuticles.  </li>
            <li>When I placed the order, I got the now familiar instant email confirmation, but this was followed up by a personal email maybe an hour later saying they had just shipped my</li>
            <li>I have very damaged, dry cuticles and I&#x27;m always looking for new products to fix them.</li>
            <li>and I have seen a major difference!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very rich, thick oil and it left my cuticles looking and feeling soft.</li>
            <li>After just a week of daily use (brushing it on my cuticles in the am or pm), any hangnails have disappeared and my normally red cuticles look much healthier.  </li>
            <li>Initially i like it, but i haven&#x27;t had it long enough to say that it is better than all the other cuticle oils out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a few times and love the way my nails look after, very nourished with less dry skin.</li>
            <li>The bottle is marked at $14.75, which seems pricey to me, especially since I don&#x27;t have a clue about the ingredients.</li>
            <li>My two biggest issues with this product are the strong clove scent which is quite overpowering if you&#x27;re used to the subtle almond smell of Solar Oil.</li>
            <li>I love this product as I have tried other &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; type cuticle oils in the past.</li>
            <li>At home, I have only used one other type of cuticle oil, really cuticle cream:  </li>
            <li>I started using this oil daily, applying it to my bare nails and cuticles, letting it soak in, rubbing it into my nails, and then wiping it off.  </li>
            <li>It has a slight numbing effect and really takes the soreness out of boo-boos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>Apparently, the scent of clove is polarizing, but I am definitely on the pro-clove side of the issue; I find clove scent to be both stimulating and soothing, and reminiscent of Christmas (orange with cloves, anyone?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> I am very impressed with this Cuticle Oil, it smells great and makes the skin where the oil touched extremely soft!</li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s my own problem! :)</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite beauty products!  </li>
            <li> Will be checking out more of their products!  </li>
            <li> And being a manicurist for years, i&#x27;ve tried MANY!</li>
            <li> and I love the fact that it is organic!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of cloves on my fingers!  </li>
            <li> It does smooth out the cuticle area, smells great, and moisturizes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> It has been amazing.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t absorb into my skin at all and just kind of sat there.</li>
            <li> Also the smell is nice, doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell and isn&#x27;t overly greasy - seems to sink in well.</li>
            <li> my coworker kept borrowing it and now she just bought her own.</li>
            <li> The oil is nice, but I have to say I agree with comments about the clove scent - I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I tried this one on a whim, and honestly, if used correctly, you will see improvement with the cuticles overnight.  </li>
            <li> This is an okay cuticle oil, but it is not as good as solar oil, as it claims.</li>
            <li> This is a great natural oil that makes cuticles look great.</li>
            <li> Yes, the smell of cloves is very strong, but I like that smell.  </li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is great stuff that really delivers!</li>
            <li> Love love love Bee Nuts</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> I love everything about it.  </li>
            <li> Leave my nails and cuticles looking healthy.  </li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> This smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that I would agree that it is better than solar oil</li>
            <li> I love this cuticle oil.  </li>
            <li> love this.</li>
            <li> I will keep you updated on its progress but much better</li>
            <li> The product didn&#x27;t work any better than others that smell much better.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely product.</li>
            <li> the customer service can be an important part of the buying experience too, so I thought I&#x27;d add my own.</li>
            <li> ** better than Solar Oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best cuticle oil I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> And the smell is FANTASTIC!  </li>
            <li> I chose this because I wanted to see if it was indeed better than solar oil.</li>
            <li> An application of the oil can help alleviate the sort of enticing itchy pain associated with my picking - the feeling that makes picking seem rewarding.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on someone else&#x27;s review; I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> Also the seller sent me a free sample of their body cream and a coupon which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> but this stuff seems to be better</li>
            <li> love that its organic.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think I am hooked! :)</li>
            <li> Excellent on cuticles - especially in winter.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m happy with my new found product.  </li>
            <li> This soaks in quickly and smells nice.  </li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and it helps my dry cuticles.</li>
            <li> and I find that it can really extend the life of a good manicure or pedicure by keeping the skin around the nails (and polish)</li>
            <li> good smell and really helps to relieve discomfort.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased other products from this company and ALL of their products are incredible!</li>
            <li> I also prefer not to wear it during the day at work, because the smell is rather strong.  </li>
            <li> I thought my nails were strong already</li>
            <li> Great for cuticles, too, but my primary purpose with this oil was improving the health of my bare nails.  </li>
            <li> It does smell like cloves which is fine by me.</li>
            <li> it heals quickly!</li>
            <li> Super!</li>
            <li> Oh, and my cuticles are looking mighty fine too.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> oil is fragrant with a light spiced aroma, like cloves.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The touted numbing qualities seem to be as advertised, though there is no guarantee that the ingredients are all fabulous and certified organic.</li>
            <li> I wanted a good, natural cuticle oil and this is it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an old tube of avon cuticle treatment cream thinking oil would be better, and I liked the fact that this is organic.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> It has a strong, although pleasant, odor of cloves (smells like the old vitamin E lotion) and absorbs rather quickly.  </li>
            <li> I bought this oil to replace my almost-empty bottle of Solar Oil - and since I&#x27;ll try anything new if it claims to be better, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try!</li>
            <li> I love how it feels and gets absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> First of all, I love the clove fragrance.</li>
            <li> I apply at night and wake up with nice soft cuticles!</li>
            <li> but since I wasn&#x27;t familiar with them, I was happy to see they offer samples at a minimal cost.</li>
            <li> but I was hoping that it really did magic.  </li>
            <li> I still have a bottle that&#x27;s 3/4 full</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all natural, smells great, and leaves my cuticles soft and pain free.</li>
            <li> I find the fragrance to be natural and warm.</li>
            <li> am a cuticle picker, and the claim that the clove has numbing/soothing properties seems to be true.</li>
            <li> I have always had nails that peel easily and are pretty weak/flexible.  </li>
            <li> It does help with cuticles to quickly heal, but it also works on any cut or bug bite.  </li>
            <li> and it seems to penetrate better than this particular product.</li>
            <li> It soaks into the skin relatively quickly so you don&#x27;t have to go around with oily hands.</li>
            <li> Not only does this product work better than any other I have tried over the last year, it smells amazing and feels wonderful.  </li>
            <li> My husband isn&#x27;t happy until he had gnawed his fingers down to the bone.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to cuticle oil but love this product.</li>
            <li> This one is highly moisturizing but what I love most is that it has clove oil in the ingredients which is a natural antiseptic.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something just a little more amazing than solar oil and this product wasn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> Great product, with a few quibbles, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s all natural oils</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, it definitely is loaded with cloves, but not overpowering.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  currently a bit cheaper on Amazon, but still kind of pricey for a cuticle treatment&lt;</li>
            <li> For $10 I would have liked a bigger bottle</li>
            <li> both my thumb and my big toe have clean healthy nails</li>
            <li> Feels really good but smells very strongly of cloves - not a great smell you want around your head if you&#x27;re about to sleep or eat.</li>
            <li> I have a nail that I caught in a door 10 years ago and it will not grow right.</li>
            <li> it goes on super smooth and soaks in completely in about 10-15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely dry cuticles and have tried numerous products  Soaks right in; cuticles look great and stay softened; and this is the first day I&#x27;ve used it!  </li>
            <li> Thanks a ton Queen Bee!</li>
            <li> The scent is great, and the oil is fairly thick so it does not run all over the place.</li>
            <li> it worked, I just went back to order two more</li>
            <li> They are not totally healed, but they are getting better.</li>
            <li> To my amazement, the condition of my skin improved within two days, and healed up pretty well by day 5.</li>
            <li> thought at first that it was a bit expensive, but I have been very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> sure enough...</li>
            <li> I really like this cuticle oil!</li>
            <li> I use it 1-2x daily, rub it in nails and cubicles and can swear it&#x27;s by far the first effective product I&#x27;ve ever tried for this</li>
            <li> This oil nicely moisturizers your cuticles which are especially  dry during the winter.</li>
            <li> &quot; was probably the best product to use for cuticles, but I had done a little research about other brands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lovely for the hands, but also for scrapes and minor cuts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not better than Solar Oil - it&#x27;s just as good.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see the tremendous improvement in my cuticles.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and absorbs easily (not &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> I bite my cuticles all the time, and this is amazing...a little oily, but just rub it in before bedtime, honestly</li>
            <li> I have very dry cuticles, especially in the winter, and so far this has done a great job of moisturizing them.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to</li>
            <li> Minimizes redness very well.</li>
            <li> This works very well to relieve discomfort and condition cuticle area.</li>
            <li> makes a real difference in the dryness of my hands.</li>
            <li> My nails are much healthier now.  </li>
            <li> I really like the clove smell.  </li>
            <li> The packaging is really darling.</li>
            <li> This oil made my cuticles seem much healthier, which was the result I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> really</li>
            <li> Just a few days later all the skin around his fingers is looking so healthy and smooth, almost healed!  </li>
            <li> I just wouldn&#x27;t want to be applying some ingredients for ethical or health concerns.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;i really thought it was just going to resplit again as it had for years, but</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really \\&quot;paint\\&quot; the oil onto my cuticles.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with a wart growing at the cuticle area of my thumb and this stuff is really working to fix it.  </li>
            <li> but after using the oil I&#x27;ve notice that my nails look much nicer when I file them and they are not brittle.</li>
            <li> Really fixes my winter cuticles.</li>
            <li> But the oil itself is the real headliner.</li>
            <li> My other nails and cuticles are in100% better shape than before I started to use it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone who has cuticle issues and normally resorts to biting them off (you know what I&#x27;m talking about!).</li>
            <li> a new staple in my nail-care routine!</li>
            <li> typically put this on before bed, so that it can spend the most time soaking in.  </li>
            <li> We think this is a clever product for traveling.  </li>
            <li> Decent cuticle oil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My nails are still on the flexible side instead of hard (meaning that polish chips off more easily because my nails bend), but they are definitely stronger.  </li>
            <li> The company also sent several samples of their other products with the order, which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised at how fast it worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all for organic food, but normally I find beauty supplies to be less-than-optimal when compared to the processed and chemically &amp;#34;enriched&amp;#34; products.  </li>
            <li> The smell is nice (if you like cloves), but I used this product daily for a few weeks and really did not notice a difference.</li>
            <li> Good but not great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not unpleasant, but as a young male I&#x27;d rather not have to explain to my coworkers that I&#x27;m putting Bee Nuts on my cuticles...</li>
            <li> It smells live cloves, which I like.</li>
            <li> I plan on using this for a long, long time,  and will buy the &amp;#34;Lavish&amp;#34; skin cream, a sample of which was included with oil, and has an astonishingly luxurious consistency</li>
            <li> It is all natural and smells like cloves!</li>
            <li> Better than nothing, but not better than solar oil.</li>
            <li> I have almost used the entire first bottle.</li>
            <li> My work dries them out and this helps keep them moist and keep the cuticle soft.</li>
            <li> After 3 or 4 applications, I see a marked improvement in the condition of my cuticles.</li>
            <li> It seems to soak into the cuticle and nail, leaving a soft sheen on the surface of the nail.</li>
            <li> this stuff fixed it.  </li>
            <li> This cuticle oil far outperforms this.  </li>
            <li> The skin on my hands is very dry right now - including the cuticles.  </li>
            <li> When I placed the order, I got the now familiar instant email confirmation, but this was followed up by a personal email maybe an hour later saying they had just shipped my</li>
            <li> I have very damaged, dry cuticles and I&#x27;m always looking for new products to fix them.</li>
            <li> and I have seen a major difference!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very rich, thick oil and it left my cuticles looking and feeling soft.</li>
            <li> After just a week of daily use (brushing it on my cuticles in the am or pm), any hangnails have disappeared and my normally red cuticles look much healthier.  </li>
            <li> Initially i like it, but i haven&#x27;t had it long enough to say that it is better than all the other cuticle oils out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times and love the way my nails look after, very nourished with less dry skin.</li>
            <li> The bottle is marked at $14.75, which seems pricey to me, especially since I don&#x27;t have a clue about the ingredients.</li>
            <li> My two biggest issues with this product are the strong clove scent which is quite overpowering if you&#x27;re used to the subtle almond smell of Solar Oil.</li>
            <li> I love this product as I have tried other &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; type cuticle oils in the past.</li>
            <li> At home, I have only used one other type of cuticle oil, really cuticle cream:  </li>
            <li> I started using this oil daily, applying it to my bare nails and cuticles, letting it soak in, rubbing it into my nails, and then wiping it off.  </li>
            <li> It has a slight numbing effect and really takes the soreness out of boo-boos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Apparently, the scent of clove is polarizing, but I am definitely on the pro-clove side of the issue; I find clove scent to be both stimulating and soothing, and reminiscent of Christmas (orange with cloves, anyone?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The consistency and fragrance are a big plus for me, and as long as I have some splurge money in my beauty budget, I am likely to buy again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it a particularly long lasting cuticle moisturizer, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to penetrate all that well.  </li>
            <li> I think it will last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Organic Cuticle Oil, I had intended to use it only on my dry cuticles.</li>
            <li> After one week there was less inflammation and a marked improvement.</li>
            <li> I ran across this product on Amazon, didn&#x27;t really have high hopes for it but was shocked at how much nicer my hands look.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;d like is for the brush bristles to be less coarse.</li>
            <li> I live in a small town where we work a lot with our hands</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any of the instant healing other folks were talking about.</li>
            <li> It lasts a very  long time too.</li>
            <li> I get hang nails and dry cuticles, so I needed some oil...</li>
            <li> you have dry cuticles, try this product out.  </li>
            <li> My nails were dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> Like I said, it conditions my cuticles beautifully, and helped a frustrating and painful dry skin condition.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, but the bottle will last a really long time.</li>
            <li> Keeps my cuticles very soft when they are usually hard in winter.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin on some of my fingers that cause my fingertips to split and crack open like tiny paper cuts, and sometimes that dryness will extend down the sides of a few fingers &amp; my thumbs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My hands get a lot of abuse and are in dishwater a lot so the nails and cuticles get very dry.  </li>
            <li> It does have a faint scent of cloves, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant</li>
            <li> but it does exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> The cuticle skin is rough and looks overgrown.</li>
            <li> I find myself picking less at the dry skin around my nails now</li>
            <li> works well and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The smell of clove was overpowering compared to other scented cuticle oils I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> so it may have a longer effect for other people).&lt;br</li>
            <li> other stumbling block I have is the price.</li>
            <li> The product works well but the smell makes it not worth using.</li>
            <li> To my amazement the skin is filling in on the base of my nail and looks much better.</li>
            <li> Not only were my nails thin, peeling &amp; chipping but my cuticles were so dry.</li>
            <li> My unscientifically verifiable experience with oil seems too indicate that the oil tones down the redness and speeds up healing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m checking out other products from this brand!</li>
            <li> Also, the slight ridges running the length of my nails noticeably smoothed out.  </li>
            <li> This oil makes the cuticles softer and less irritated after just one use.  </li>
            <li> My cubicles are incredibly dry for no discernible reason and I have tried everything including solar oil and complex with no improvement.</li>
            <li> Hands down! 😄</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few days and it seems to help.  </li>
            <li> and I use it a few times.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> ; Received this a few days ago and started using it immediately.</li>
            <li> There are quite a few products</li>
            <li> His nails looked like shit.  </li>
            <li> Just got this a few days ago</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days</li>
            <li> I apply a few times a day or as needed</li>
            <li> /&gt; Since I run through cuticle oils at a slow pace, the cost isn&#x27;t extremely problematic for me.</li>
            <li> It is stiff and not soft/flexible</li>
            <li> Spicy but not strong.</li>
            <li> I hate to wear gloves when I garden or do housework, and frequent hand washing keeps my  skin dry and cuticles a mess, a condition exacerbated by thyroid problems.</li>
            <li> I bought this product since I&#x27;m not able to have manicures until a hand injury heals.</li>
            <li> I doubt it given that that efficacy of that as a health and beauty ingredient is, I presume, not really known (I thin).</li>
            <li> There is a slight scent to it (similar to tea tree or clove oil) but it wasn&#x27;t unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer noted, don&#x27;t touch your eyes after applying -- I think that&#x27;s common sense and didn&#x27;t warrant a low-star review from the person who mentioned it;</li>
            <li> Again, common sense.</li>
            <li> negative points, for me, are cost and ingredients.</li>

            <li> I wanted a good, natural cuticle oil and this is it. I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to but it does exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Love love love Bee Nuts not only does it condition and repair your cuticles it takes the sting out of bug bites!!</li>
            <li> We have been using Queen Bee skin care products for quite a while.  Found them in Pagosa Springs on vacation.  We think this is a clever product for traveling.  It does help with cuticles to quickly heal, but it also works on any cut or bug bite.  My kids ask for it.  Takes the sting out (because of the numbing effect of clove) and speeds healing.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased. Works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something just a little more amazing than solar oil and this product wasn&#x27;t it. The smell of clove was overpowering compared to other scented cuticle oils I&#x27;ve used. I actually had someone comment that my dog smelled like cloves hours after I had last used the oil. It didn&#x27;t absorb into my skin at all and just kind of sat there. The brush that was on the bottle I had was also very stiff and it was difficult to distribute a sensible amount of oil.</li>
            <li> I love this product as I have tried other &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; type cuticle oils in the past. This one is highly moisturizing but what I love most is that it has clove oil in the ingredients which is a natural antiseptic.</li>
            <li> This oil smells yummy, softens cuticles and I find that it can really extend the life of a good manicure or pedicure by keeping the skin around the nails (and polish) moisturized and NOT peeling.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and details and purchased this product.  I am a cuticle-picker.  The company claims that this will immediately reduce redness.  It doesn&#x27;t. It does smooth out the cuticle area, smells great, and moisturizes.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good stuff, but I was hoping that it really did magic.  Maybe that&#x27;s my own problem! :)</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all for organic food, but normally I find beauty supplies to be less-than-optimal when compared to the processed and chemically &amp;#34;enriched&amp;#34; products.  Well, not with this one!  I highly recommend it to anyone who has cuticle issues and normally resorts to biting them off (you know what I&#x27;m talking about!).</li>
            <li> The product works well but the smell makes it not worth using. There are products that work as well and don&#x27;t stink!</li>
            <li> I live in a small town where we work a lot with our hands and I often find myself with horrible cuticles and cuts around my fingers. About 1 year ago, I began to use Queen Bee Skin Products, such as this one. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! I does wonders to your cuticles and fingers! My hands are now gorgeous! Thanks a ton Queen Bee!</li>
            <li> This soaks in quickly and smells nice.  You can tell it is a quality oil that will actually help your nails.  I&#x27;m checking out other products from this brand!</li>
            <li> works well and a little goes a long way. It does have an odor but I don&#x27;t mind it at all.</li>
            <li> I just received this and put on my cuticles.  It is all natural and smells like cloves!</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle. I love everything about it.  Minimizes redness very well. Leave my nails and cuticles looking healthy.  Also the smell is nice, doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. Will keep buying this product.</li>
            <li> This oil feels great on your cuticles!  I love that it&#x27;s all natural oils so I don&#x27;t need to fret while handling my newborn at the same time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not better than Solar Oil - it&#x27;s just as good. I didn&#x27;t have any of the instant healing other folks were talking about. Good but not great.</li>
            <li> The skin on my hands is very dry right now - including the cuticles.  I have been using this for a few days and it seems to help.  I just need to keep using it.  It has a nice smell and isn&#x27;t overly greasy - seems to sink in well.</li>
            <li> I get hang nails and dry cuticles, so I needed some oil... Love this. The scent is great, and the oil is fairly thick so it does not run all over the place. I keep it next to my phone at the office and apply whenever I&#x27;m on a call. Noticeable improvement in my cuticles.</li>
            <li> This oil smells heavenly and keeps my nails and cuticles in great shape.  My hands get a lot of abuse and are in dishwater a lot so the nails and cuticles get very dry.  Regular use of this clove-scented oil keeps them looking well-groomed.</li>
            <li> great cuticle balm! good smell and really helps to relieve discomfort.  I tend to be a nail biter and sometimes tear cuticles. This works very well to relieve discomfort and condition cuticle area. Great smell as well. Excellent price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this works.  I tried it ONCE and threw it away.  Yes, the smell of cloves is very strong, but I like that smell.  Problem was that I put the product on my cuticles and -- sometime later -- touched my eye.  OUCH!  You do not want to do that!  I didn&#x27;t take the chance of doing it again.  If I did, I would have donned gloves after application.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> This smells fantastic! it heals quickly! my coworker kept borrowing it and now she just bought her own. great stuff!</li>
            <li> The oil is nice, but I have to say I agree with comments about the clove scent - I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that I would agree that it is better than solar oil but it does what it says it will.</li>
            <li> I love this cuticle oil.  I have it at work and I use it a few times.  It smells wonderful and it helps my dry cuticles.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice (if you like cloves), but I used this product daily for a few weeks and really did not notice a difference. I bought this to replace an old tube of avon cuticle treatment cream thinking oil would be better, and I liked the fact that this is organic. I still have a bottle that&#x27;s 3/4 full but I think I will spring for the solar oil because that is what my salon uses and it seems to penetrate better than this particular product.</li>
            <li> Not only does this product work better than any other I have tried over the last year, it smells amazing and feels wonderful.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results!!!  My cuticles look human again! Thank you!</li>
            <li> a new staple in my nail-care routine! love this. it&#x27;s all natural, smells great, and leaves my cuticles soft and pain free. I used this to help me remove nail wraps without causing any damage to my nail. love it!</li>
            <li> This cuticle oil smells great and feels good makes a real difference in the dryness of my hands. My work dries them out and this helps keep them moist and keep the cuticle soft.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this Cuticle Oil, it smells great and makes the skin where the oil touched extremely soft! I am thrilled with the company too! When I received the package not only did I get the oil but I had a sample of another oil *AND* a $15 gift card. I will be buying from them again! That&#x27;s how you do business.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite beauty products!  I have always had nails that peel easily and are pretty weak/flexible.  I started using this oil daily, applying it to my bare nails and cuticles, letting it soak in, rubbing it into my nails, and then wiping it off.  Within days, I noticed that my nails were stronger and didn&#x27;t peel.  My nails are still on the flexible side instead of hard (meaning that polish chips off more easily because my nails bend), but they are definitely stronger.  Also, the slight ridges running the length of my nails noticeably smoothed out.  I used to buff them but they&#x27;d always return; I think they were a sign of dryness.  My nails are much healthier now.  Great for cuticles, too, but my primary purpose with this oil was improving the health of my bare nails.  I really like the clove smell.  Like another reviewer noted, don&#x27;t touch your eyes after applying -- I think that&#x27;s common sense and didn&#x27;t warrant a low-star review from the person who mentioned it; oh well.  Also, you definitely need to wipe the oil off or it will get all your stuff, well, oily.  Again, common sense.</li>
            <li> Excellent cuticle oil.  I have extremely dry cuticles and have tried numerous products  Soaks right in; cuticles look great and stay softened; and this is the first day I&#x27;ve used it!  Will be checking out more of their products!  Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> So far so good. If you don&#x27;t like the smell of clove then you may not like this.. I don&#x27;t mind it.. The packaging is really darling.</li>
            <li> This product smells heavenly, I wish it worked as well as it smelled.  I don&#x27;t find it a particularly long lasting cuticle moisturizer, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to penetrate all that well.  Better than nothing, but not better than solar oil.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I have never used cuticle oil that moisturized so well. I have purchased other products from this company and ALL of their products are incredible! Not only are the products a 10/10 but so is the service!!</li>
            <li> When Revlon, took away their cuticle repair cream years ago, I never found a cream that worked well...ever.  I tried this one on a whim, and honestly, if used correctly, you will see improvement with the cuticles overnight.  I bite my cuticles all the time, and this is amazing...a little oily, but just rub it in before bedtime, honestly, I&#x27;m happy with my new found product.  I was sad to see Revlon go, but this tops it!  Never thought I found anything as good as this!  Super!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t review many things but this stuff is awesome!  I have a nail that I caught in a door 10 years ago and it will not grow right. The cuticle skin is rough and looks overgrown. The mail occasionally will start to grow but ends up peeling off. To my amazement the skin is filling in on the base of my nail and looks much better. I will keep you updated on its progress but much better than it EVER was. My other nails and cuticles are in100% better shape than before I started to use it. Stocking up while it&#x27;s on sale and getting one for work and a friend.</li>
            <li> I have tried in vain every winter to keep my nails and cuticles from splitting and cracking, I used everything out there and nothing helped, then I saw this and decided to give it a try. it worked, I just went back to order two more bottles!!!&lt;br /&gt;this is great stuff that really delivers!</li>
            <li> Some people may like the smell, but I thought it was terrible.  The product didn&#x27;t work any better than others that smell much better.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My cubicles are incredibly dry for no discernible reason and I have tried everything including solar oil and complex with no improvement. Dryness tends to make me pick them and they just look embarrassing all the time. I ran across this product on Amazon, didn&#x27;t really have high hopes for it but was shocked at how much nicer my hands look. Give it a try, you would.t be disappointed!ordered it improvement.annoying handrails are gone. I use it 1-2x daily, rub it in nails and cubicles and can swear it&#x27;s by far the first effective product I&#x27;ve ever tried for this</li>
            <li> This oil nicely moisturizers your cuticles which are especially  dry during the winter. It lasts a very  long time too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll preface this review with &amp;#34;your mileage may vary&amp;#34; because everybody is different.  This oil made my cuticles seem much healthier, which was the result I was looking for.  The smell is nice, it definitely is loaded with cloves, but not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically put this on before bed, so that it can spend the most time soaking in.  I also prefer not to wear it during the day at work, because the smell is rather strong.  It&#x27;s not unpleasant, but as a young male I&#x27;d rather not have to explain to my coworkers that I&#x27;m putting Bee Nuts on my cuticles...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry cuticles, try this product out.  It could work well for you too.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I hate to wear gloves when I garden or do housework, and frequent hand washing keeps my  skin dry and cuticles a mess, a condition exacerbated by thyroid problems. Cuticle splits, bleeding  and infection were my &amp;#34;normal.&amp;#34; Received this a few days ago and started using it immediately. After 3 or 4 applications, I see a marked improvement in the condition of my cuticles. They are not totally healed, but they are getting better. I plan on using this for a long, long time,  and will buy the &amp;#34;Lavish&amp;#34; skin cream, a sample of which was included with oil, and has an astonishingly luxurious consistency</li>
            <li> This is a lovely product. It does have a faint scent of cloves, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant and I&#x27;d rather have that than some chemical smell. It makes my cuticles feel softer just about instantly, and it lasts for a couple of days ( and I have my hands in water a lot so it may have a longer effect for other people).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the customer service can be an important part of the buying experience too, so I thought I&#x27;d add my own. This product arrived promptly with some extra coupons for money off (fifteen bucks, not to be sneezed at).  So a couple of weeks later when I had some time I checked out their website to see what else they offered. There are quite a few products but since I wasn&#x27;t familiar with them, I was happy to see they offer samples at a minimal cost. I ordered several of these to try out with my coupon. When I placed the order, I got the now familiar instant email confirmation, but this was followed up by a personal email maybe an hour later saying they had just shipped my products!&lt;br /&gt;The items arrived in just a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;In addition to this, I also received another email saying that they noticed I had ordered samples and might like the link they provided to a chart showing how and when to use the various creams etc.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased and impressed Queen Bee!~keep up the good work!&lt;br /&gt;(They did not request that I write this review nor was the coupon dependent on writing any review)</li>
            <li> Loved it - great fragrance too</li>
            <li> Great product!  I have very dry cuticles, especially in the winter, and so far this has done a great job of moisturizing them.  I apply at night and wake up with nice soft cuticles!</li>
            <li> I had been told that \\&quot;Solar Oil\\&quot; was probably the best product to use for cuticles, but I had done a little research about other brands. I have dry skin on some of my fingers that cause my fingertips to split and crack open like tiny paper cuts, and sometimes that dryness will extend down the sides of a few fingers &amp; my thumbs.&lt;br /&gt;I had been to the dermatologist to have this condition treated. I&#x27;ve used the steroid creams &amp; ointments, taken antibiotics, have had allergy testing -- and no allergies were detected, and the medications had not worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sensitive to the chemicals used for artificial nails or the nail gels. I have gone months between manicures, wearing gloves while doing housework &amp; washing dishes, garden gloves for gardening, work gloves for heavier tasks. My fingers still got \\&quot;the crud\\&quot; despite wearing lotions at night with cotton gloves on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I purchased the Bee Nuts! Organic Cuticle Oil, I had intended to use it only on my dry cuticles. But I had split skin on one thumb, and my index fingers had tiny cuts and peeling skin. I brushed the oil on my boo-boos. To my amazement, the condition of my skin improved within two days, and healed up pretty well by day 5. (I have tried baby oils, petroleum jelly, vitamin E... so oil itself was not helping.) Oh, and my cuticles are looking mighty fine too.&lt;br /&gt;It really **IS** better than Solar Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bee Nuts! oil is fragrant with a light spiced aroma, like cloves.&lt;br /&gt;I thought at first that it was a bit expensive, but I have been very happy with this product. Like I said, it conditions my cuticles beautifully, and helped a frustrating and painful dry skin condition.</li>
            <li> My husband isn&#x27;t happy until he had gnawed his fingers down to the bone.  His nails looked like shit.  I purchased an anti nail biting polish, and used it along with this cuticle oil.  Just a few days later all the skin around his fingers is looking so healthy and smooth, almost healed!  I am pleasantly surprised at how fast it worked.</li>
            <li> I bought this product since I&#x27;m not able to have manicures until a hand injury heals. It has been amazing. My cuticles love it!!</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see the tremendous improvement in my cuticles. I rub it in at night so the smell is not a problem. Great product.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best cuticle oil I&#x27;ve used.  And the smell is FANTASTIC!  It soaks into the skin relatively quickly so you don&#x27;t have to go around with oily hands.</li>
            <li> I chose this because I wanted to see if it was indeed better than solar oil. I have almost used the entire first bottle.</li>
            <li> There is a lot to like about this cuticle oil.  The texture is silky and ever-so-slightly viscous. It seems to soak into the cuticle and nail, leaving a soft sheen on the surface of the nail. I find the fragrance to be natural and warm. It smells, as indicated, like cloves (in fact, there is a clove in the bottle, infusing the product). Apparently, the scent of clove is polarizing, but I am definitely on the pro-clove side of the issue; I find clove scent to be both stimulating and soothing, and reminiscent of Christmas (orange with cloves, anyone?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a cuticle picker, and the claim that the clove has numbing/soothing properties seems to be true. An application of the oil can help alleviate the sort of enticing itchy pain associated with my picking - the feeling that makes picking seem rewarding. I can&#x27;t say that it has cured my picking at all, but it does help control the urge to keep at it until my finger are throbbing and sore/bloody. My unscientifically verifiable experience with oil seems too indicate that the oil tones down the redness and speeds up healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negative points, for me, are cost and ingredients. To clarify the ingredients issue, I have to say that I don&#x27;t object to any of the ingredients per se, but the label lists no ingredients, so how am I going to make an informed assessment. The label claims that the product is organic, and contains \\&quot;a secret blend of clove infused nut oils.\\&quot; I can verify the clove, since I can see it in the bottle, but I can&#x27;t assess the organic quality, or have any way of knowing if the product also contains something like extract of Siberian tiger anal glands or something. I doubt it given that that efficacy of that as a health and beauty ingredient is, I presume, not really known (I thin). I just wouldn&#x27;t want to be applying some ingredients for ethical or health concerns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other stumbling block I have is the price. The bottle is marked at $14.75, which seems pricey to me, especially since I don&#x27;t have a clue about the ingredients. It&#x27;s  currently a bit cheaper on Amazon, but still kind of pricey for a cuticle treatment&lt;br /&gt; Since I run through cuticle oils at a slow pace, the cost isn&#x27;t extremely problematic for me. I like supporting small businesses, and I like the quality and scent of the oil, but its not verifiably organic, nor is it a miracle cure (if it eliminated redness, itching, and all pickable skin forever, the price would not faze me a bit). Hardcore nail oil users might balk at the price, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I like the oil a lot. The consistency and fragrance are a big plus for me, and as long as I have some splurge money in my beauty budget, I am likely to buy again. The touted numbing qualities seem to be as advertised, though there is no guarantee that the ingredients are all fabulous and certified organic. Great product, with a few quibbles, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Just got this a few days ago so i am still testing it out. Initially i like it, but i haven&#x27;t had it long enough to say that it is better than all the other cuticle oils out there. And being a manicurist for years, i&#x27;ve tried MANY!</li>
            <li> My nails were dry and brittle. As a consequence, they split. This oil restored my nails. The oil hydrates and conditions the cuticle with organic ingredients. My nails are now growing.  This is a great product.</li>
            <li> This is an okay cuticle oil, but it is not as good as solar oil, as it claims. It does not absorb or condition quite as well, and is more expensive. Save your money for the CND.</li>
            <li> I had a split fingernail on my thumb and something on my big toe nail.  My girlfriend got this for me and after a couple weeks you could see the problem growing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i really thought it was just going to resplit again as it had for years, but sure enough... this stuff fixed it.  both my thumb and my big toe have clean healthy nails now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you.  this a very good product.</li>
            <li> Smells good but doesn&#x27;t work.  Feedback was suppressed so there obviously is a problem with this cuticle oil.  Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Does a good job on cuticles and skin on the hands. Smells nice and absorbs easily (not &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;). I bought this based on someone else&#x27;s review; I&#x27;m glad I tried it. Haven&#x27;t had an opportunity to compare to the Solar Oil, but I will say I like this enough to keep it on my desk and just swab some on from time to time.</li>
            <li> I have very damaged, dry cuticles and I&#x27;m always looking for new products to fix them. A beauty blogger recommended this oil so I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days and I&#x27;m very happy with the results. It&#x27;s a very rich, thick oil and it left my cuticles looking and feeling soft. There is a slight scent to it (similar to tea tree or clove oil) but it wasn&#x27;t unpleasant. For $10 I would have liked a bigger bottle but I will probably buy this again. Also the seller sent me a free sample of their body cream and a coupon which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil to replace my almost-empty bottle of Solar Oil - and since I&#x27;ll try anything new if it claims to be better, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try! My two biggest issues with this product are the strong clove scent which is quite overpowering if you&#x27;re used to the subtle almond smell of Solar Oil. My second issue is the brush. It is stiff and not soft/flexible so I can&#x27;t really \\&quot;paint\\&quot; the oil onto my cuticles. The brush instead flicks over the surface of whatever you&#x27;re applying it to and creates a bit of a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it works the same as Solar Oil does and softens cuticles, but I don&#x27;t see myself buying it again.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with a wart growing at the cuticle area of my thumb and this stuff is really working to fix it.  The only thing I&#x27;d like is for the brush bristles to be less coarse.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, aromatic way to keep your cuticles moist . . . I keep it on my breakfast table and start each day by applying.</li>
            <li> This is a great natural oil that makes cuticles look great. It smells live cloves, which I like. I think it will last for a very long time. The company also sent several samples of their other products with the order, which was a nice surprise. I have already recommended it to others.</li>
            <li> I used to use solar oil but this stuff seems to be better and I love the fact that it is organic!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of cloves on my fingers!  Not as pricey as Solar Oil. Will stick with this product over Solar Oil.</li>
            <li> Decent cuticle oil.&lt;br /&gt;I love that its organic.&lt;br /&gt;It smells great (cloves).&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well as some others I&#x27;ve used -- but those others have tons of chemicals you may not want in or on your body.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I would recommend this cuticle oil.</li>
            <li> This oil makes the cuticles softer and less irritated after just one use.  After one week there was less inflammation and a marked improvement.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fabulous!!! After wearing acrylic nails for almost 2 years, I finally stopped.  Not only were my nails thin, peeling &amp; chipping but my cuticles were so dry. Bee Nuts! Cuticle oil has returned the moisture to my nails. Best product out there.  Hands down! 😄</li>
            <li> I have only been using this oil for about a week and I already notice a difference in my nails. I thought my nails were strong already but after using the oil I&#x27;ve notice that my nails look much nicer when I file them and they are not brittle. I think I am hooked! :)</li>
            <li> I use this oil every night.  Excellent on cuticles - especially in winter.  Keeps my cuticles very soft when they are usually hard in winter.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> At home, I have only used one other type of cuticle oil, really cuticle cream:  the Burt&#x27;s Bees lemon cream.  This cuticle oil far outperforms this.  After just a week of daily use (brushing it on my cuticles in the am or pm), any hangnails have disappeared and my normally red cuticles look much healthier.  It has a strong, although pleasant, odor of cloves (smells like the old vitamin E lotion) and absorbs rather quickly.  I am definitely going to buy this again.</li>
            <li> Feels really good but smells very strongly of cloves - not a great smell you want around your head if you&#x27;re about to sleep or eat.</li>
            <li> I just received the product yesterday.  I received a sample of orange oil.  The orange oil smells wonderful; I wish the cuticle oil smelled like the orange oil.  If you like the smell of cloves then you will like the smell of the cuticle oil.</li>
            <li> Really fixes my winter cuticles. I apply a few times a day or as needed and I have seen a major difference!</li>
            <li> First of all, I love the clove fragrance. Spicy but not strong. But the oil itself is the real headliner. I love how it feels and gets absorbed quickly. And it works so well.  Just what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I really like this cuticle oil! It&#x27;s lovely for the hands, but also for scrapes and minor cuts. I use it on my kids and it doesn&#x27;t sting at all.  It has a slight numbing effect and really takes the soreness out of boo-boos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For cuticles it goes on super smooth and soaks in completely in about 10-15 minutes.  It&#x27;s a little pricey, but the bottle will last a really long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to cuticle oil but love this product. It does smell like cloves which is fine by me. I&#x27;ve used it a few times and love the way my nails look after, very nourished with less dry skin. I find myself picking less at the dry skin around my nails now that I have this product. I feel like this will last me a longer time as well which means It&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
