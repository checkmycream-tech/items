            <li>Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>I love them and they dress up everything so quick and easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying these temporary tattoos for ~9 months now, and really enjoy them.</li>
            <li>These are so fun!</li>
            <li>ON CLEAN SKIN.</li>
            <li>Super easy instructions come along with the tattoos, and they are fun to wear.</li>
            <li>Super fun tats for Coachella!</li>
            <li>overall it&#x27;s a good fashion statement..</li>
            <li>Cool designs though.</li>
            <li>You can go subtle or bold and it&#x27;s a great accent to a night out!</li>
            <li>The tattoos stuck to the band really well and were easy to remove by pushing them off with my nails, didn&#x27;t need to use oil or anything else.</li>
            <li>Buying for teens and young adults can be challenging.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fun.</li>
            <li>Colorful and fun.  </li>
            <li>They last, but don&#x27;t look perfect after 2/3 days, but I expected that.</li>
            <li>I tried a black one and it looked good for no longer than 5 hours</li>
            <li>I think that it is the metallic that makes them more fun than traditional tattoos.  </li>
            <li>A lot of really pretty designs to chose from.</li>
            <li>So pretty and feminine.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, this is the first pack/vendor I&#x27;ve bought from where they DO NOT last more than a day or</li>
            <li>Pretty too</li>
            <li>Very cute temporary tattoos, unlike some other &amp;#34;metal&amp;#34; tattoos I have tried these ones actually have a bright vivid color and stay on nearly all day through most activities, and depending on what you do and where they are some last longer.</li>
            <li>I get lots of positive comments from people.</li>
            <li>Looks lovely, easily applied, but it doesn&#x27;t last for long..</li>
            <li>real tattoos.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it Looks very fashionable ...</li>
            <li>Such a fun temporary tattoo!</li>
            <li>This will be short and sweet....</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to get the new designs!</li>
            <li>I tried them on the white fluoroelastomer band used with the Apple watch, to make it more personal.</li>
            <li>If you have hair on your arms though, these will only last at most a day.</li>
            <li>If you treat them gently and shower/bath around them - they last a good long time - how long - I&#x27;m still finding out.</li>
            <li>But the places where my skin was clean and dry it stayed for over a week.</li>
            <li>Love the silver, gold and black designs!</li>
            <li>Lovely thin designs : it&#x27;s for my 4 year old daughter on special occasions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I BOUGHT THESE FOR NEW YEARS.</li>
            <li>My 12 year old daughter loves them too!</li>
            <li>I even put two right on my hip where my pants would rub and they STILL stayed for a long time.</li>
            <li>Given to my teenaged grand daughter for Christmas; anything to keep her out from under the tattoo needle, at least for a while.</li>
            <li>but they were completely gone after two days.</li>
            <li>added a little fun to my poolside attire !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used these on my hands and wrists so far</li>

            <li> This was a total waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I had a blast playing with these,  They stay put for a few days.</li>

            <li> These are so very pretty and the customer service was excellent.  I was so pleased that I am thinking of buying a set for myself (the two I bought were for my daughters).  Terrific company to work with!</li>
            <li> Super fun tats for Coachella!</li>
            <li> These are so cool!!! I&#x27;m not big on wearing jewelery and these are just the thing to add a little something extra to an outfit. A lot of really pretty designs to chose from. My 12 year old daughter loves them too! She&#x27;s gotten a bunch of compliments on them from her friends at school.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my teenage daughter as a &amp;#34;stocking stuffer&amp;#34; for Christmas.  They&#x27;re fun, trendy and the designs are beautiful.  Buying for teens and young adults can be challenging.  Finding this was perfect!</li>
            <li> Such a fun temporary tattoo! So pretty and feminine. Easy to apply and durable!</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THESE FOR NEW YEARS. THEY LOOK VERY NICE ON CLEAN SKIN.</li>
            <li> One of the best gifts I have ever given my nieces!!!</li>
            <li> My girls had another brand before and said these don&#x27;t stay well...</li>
            <li> These are so beautiful and so easy to use! The shipping was fast and the designs are great. I can&#x27;t wait to get the new designs! You can go subtle or bold and it&#x27;s a great accent to a night out!</li>
            <li> These are excellent however they do not compare to the quality of the original Flash tattoos. Those are amazing!  These are great for a cheaper version.</li>
            <li> Love these hip temporary tats. I get lots of positive comments from people. When girlfriends come over - I pull them out and tat them up. It&#x27;s so fun. I cleaned my arm with witch hazel or you can use alcohol. I&#x27;ve had a bangle tat on my arm going on five days - they said they&#x27;d last two days. If you treat them gently and shower/bath around them - they last a good long time - how long - I&#x27;m still finding out.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I had a blast playing with these,  They stay put for a few days.</li>
            <li> This will be short and sweet....My wife loves them!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!!!! THEY WERE SUPER FAST AND THE DESIGNS ARE BEAUTIFUL!</li>
            <li> Easy to use. I tried them on the white fluoroelastomer band used with the Apple watch, to make it more personal.

            <li> havent tried it yet, looks nice</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product does not look as authentic as I thought. It looks  more like a NOTICABLE sticker on me. Not happy with this product and will not be purchasing again. This was a total waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> My Niece loves these she says they look like real tattoos.&lt;br /&gt;I received for a review.</li>

            <li> Great quality! Very cool product.</li>
            <li> Looks lovely, easily applied, but it doesn&#x27;t last for long.. I tried a black one and it looked good for no longer than 5 hours</li>
            <li> These temp tattoos are so cool! Love the silver, gold and black designs! And they are SO easy to apply!</li>
            <li> These were gorgeous when I put them on! Just make sure you aren&#x27;t wearing any lotion or sun screen or they will immediately peel off. But the places where my skin was clean and dry it stayed for over a week. I even put two right on my hip where my pants would rub and they STILL stayed for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these temporary tattoos for ~9 months now, and really enjoy them. HOWEVER, this is the first pack/vendor I&#x27;ve bought from where they DO NOT last more than a day or two-- as compared to 1-2 weeks for some of the others.&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy these again and suggest that you look elsewhere. Sadly.</li>
            <li> They were great fun. Pretty too</li>
            <li> I like the variety but they don&#x27;t stay on nearly as long as the ones I found at the $ store for much less money.</li>
            <li> Very cool designs and great colors.  We bought this as a gift for someone else as an add-on, but this was the winner over the other gift.  Very trendy!</li>
            <li> These are so fun! Really cute, reflective and trendy metallic temporary tattoos. But just like regular tats, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend putting these in areas that get rubbed or crease often like the inside of your wrists or fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I love them and they dress up everything so quick and easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used these on my hands and wrists so far but they were completely gone after two days. I was hoping they would last a little longer</li>
            <li> Soo beautiful!!!!!!!! The patterns are gorgeous and very detailed!!! They have stayed on for 2 days nkw and show no sign of coming of soon!!</li>
            <li> Lovely thin designs : it&#x27;s for my 4 year old daughter on special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;We haven&#x27;t used it yet but it arrived in no time and my first impression is : great product!</li>
            <li> Very great ! Loved the designs. Also the business owner is great sending customer emails to follow up on the service- thank you!!!</li>
            <li> The come off too easily. Cool designs though.</li>
            <li> Very cute temporary tattoos, unlike some other &amp;#34;metal&amp;#34; tattoos I have tried these ones actually have a bright vivid color and stay on nearly all day through most activities, and depending on what you do and where they are some last longer. Also on the other hand are simple to remove in a flash if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend wearing them to your next pool party, but they are great to spice up your next night out, and would be awesome as costume jewelry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for a fair and honest review.</li>
            <li> Looks beautiful and lasts well! Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> Love it. They last, but don&#x27;t look perfect after 2/3 days, but I expected that.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift, but opened the package so I could give them a try.  I love them! Super easy instructions come along with the tattoos, and they are fun to wear. Even when I am swimming laps, they have stayed on, and look great!</li>
            <li> Gave them to my niece for Christmas and she loved them!  I think that it is the metallic that makes them more fun than traditional tattoos.  They are fun and looked beautiful.  Would definitely purchase them again!</li>
            <li> I love it. It&#x27;s moré beautifull than they apear at the site. Are awesome.</li>
