            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I like the volume it gives my hair and makes it very easy for me to syle my hair when I am blow drying it.</li>
            <li>Nice smell and light weight feel!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The product itself is perfect for my type of hair, which is super fine and straight.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and leaves more shine than others I have used.</li>
            <li>Love this product for my fine, wavy, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>I liked the fact that my hair wasn&#x27;t crunchy like it can be with gel, but the oiliness isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>This is the only thing that makes my curls look beautiful and my hair still have body.</li>
            <li>I have extremelly fine hair</li>
            <li>Quick service for a product I love.</li>
            <li>Was excited when I found that I could purchase this through Amazon.</li>

            <li>Compared to another product I&#x27;d tried that was limited release from a salon, this item is much more like moose in a can though not so tenacious in hold.  </li>

            <li>As I have gotten older, my hair is thin and this product worked great.</li>

            <li>and it comes brand new in sealed bottles, still, in 50% of cases some of it escapes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Gives the hair a very natural finish keeping it from looking frizzy.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that is hard to manage</li>
            <li>Not the best at least for my thin hair.</li>
            <li>It took me a long time, but I finally found the right routine to help my hair grow out.</li>
            <li>I live in a dry climate, so</li>

            <li> I live in a dry climate, so</li>
            <li> My hair is fairly dry, especially in the winter, and even when I used a tiny amount of this, my hair was oilier, and needed to be washed sooner.</li>
            <li> I have really dry, brittle, frizzy, curly, Jewish hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is so dry that I could probably not wash it for two weeks</li>

            <li> use it when my hair is still wet</li>
            <li> This one will give my hair some volume, but not too heavy to pull the hair flat.</li>
            <li> see that the other reviewer had problems with oily hair.</li>
            <li> The same story with small travel-size bottles...</li>
            <li> I searched for years for a product that wouldn&#x27;t weigh down my hair but would still add definition and shine to my curls.</li>
            <li> I used half of the bottle and ended up throwing the rest away.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few years now, and is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Waste for me.  </li>
            <li> Non sticky hold with delicate scent.</li>
            <li> I keep it in a ziplock baggie to prevent spreading the mess all over my things, but I just hate loosing the product in such a silly way.</li>
            <li> It is a really delicate balance!</li>
            <li> I did not like the way it made my hair feel  :(</li>

            <li> Quick service for a product I love.</li>
            <li> Works great for hair that does the poof when dry! Keeps it curly all day and no need for hairspray, I recommend it though to get those smaller hairs.</li>
            <li> I have really dry, brittle, frizzy, curly, Jewish hair. I searched for years for a product that wouldn&#x27;t weigh down my hair but would still add definition and shine to my curls. It is a really delicate balance! This stuff is amazing. I&#x27;ve strayed away from it before looking for something cheaper and regretted it. This is the only thing that makes my curls look beautiful and my hair still have body. I live in a dry climate, so I don&#x27;t know how this stuff would work on frizzy hair in a moist climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see that the other reviewer had problems with oily hair. I can&#x27;t speak to that. My hair is so dry that I could probably not wash it for two weeks and it still wouldn&#x27;t be oily. This stuff definitely works if your hair is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair routine: I use Matrix Biolage hydratherapy shampoo and Ultra-Hydrating conditioner in the tub, CHI Silk Infusion as a leave in treatment before I comb my hair out with my hair pick, and then style with AG Foam. I use Bumble &amp; Bumble Creme de Coco Masque once a week. I also take Biotin vitamins specifically along with my multi-vitamin. I avoid straightening my hair and put the Biolage conditioner in my swim cap or leave it in my hair if I am going to be out in the sun. It took me a long time, but I finally found the right routine to help my hair grow out.</li>
            <li> Love this product for my fine, wavy, frizzy hair.  Gives me body and curls.</li>
            <li> My hair is fairly dry, especially in the winter, and even when I used a tiny amount of this, my hair was oilier, and needed to be washed sooner. I used it several times, and I think it did add some body. I liked the fact that my hair wasn&#x27;t crunchy like it can be with gel, but the oiliness isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> I like the volume it gives my hair and makes it very easy for me to syle my hair when I am blow drying it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a repeat customer for this product.  Love that it provides lift without weighing hair down.</li>
            <li> Great product, makes my hair manageable and looking lovely</li>
            <li> ONe of the best and lightest volumizer.  I have extremelly fine hair and it does the trick.  I addition I also use the anti-freez from the same company.  I now buy it online and avoid the mark-up of my Salon.  Great product.</li>
            <li> The product itself is perfect for my type of hair, which is super fine and straight. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky - just right! I&#x27;ve been using it for years and will probably stay with it.  What I don&#x27;t like about it is packaging. Every time I travel and take it with me, it leaks all over. I keep it in a ziplock baggie to prevent spreading the mess all over my things, but I just hate loosing the product in such a silly way. Even when I buy it online and it comes brand new in sealed bottles, still, in 50% of cases some of it escapes. The same story with small travel-size bottles... If they figure out and fix these problems - I&#x27;d give them five stars.</li>
            <li> Helped give my hair some volume. As I have gotten older, my hair is thin and this product worked great.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few years now, and is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;I use it when my hair is still wet and then I let it air dry or sometimes I use the diffuser to keep curls. The hair doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or stiff.&lt;br /&gt;Gives the hair a very natural finish keeping it from looking frizzy.</li>
            <li> Compared to another product I&#x27;d tried that was limited release from a salon, this item is much more like moose in a can though not so tenacious in hold.  Not the best at least for my thin hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and leaves more shine than others I have used.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair. This one will give my hair some volume, but not too heavy to pull the hair flat.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised!  Love it.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that is hard to manage and this is a product that my Hairdresser used and recommended.  It works great for my hair and I was desprate to find it again.  Being stationed overseas we cannot get some American products that we are used to and would have to go through purchasing and trying products all over again.  Was excited when I found that I could purchase this through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great product... Great price . Will buy again</li>
            <li> Overall I did not like this product.  I used half of the bottle and ended up throwing the rest away.  Waste for me.  I did not like the way it made my hair feel  :(</li>
            <li> Non sticky hold with delicate scent. I have used this for several years and love it!</li>
            <li> Nice smell and light weight feel!</li>
