            <li>Great product, does not leave a oily feeling behind when used.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t believe this not so well-known brand i found on Amazon helps me so much.</li>

            <li>you found this review or any of my other reviews interesting or helpful</li>
            <li>The ingredients list in this cream is amazing - I particularly like the fact that it has Manuka honey in it, among all of the other natural stuff.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I recommend this product highly</li>
            <li>I highly dislike the smell.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I recommend this cream highly.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that is a Natural Treatment for Eczema, Irritated, Itchy, Sensitive &amp; Dry Skin and can be use in the Face, Hands &amp; Body-</li>
            <li>I do construction and work with a lot of concrete</li>
            <li>I will be a long term customer as this product truly hold true to it&#x27;s value.</li>
            <li>I started using this in this area 3 days ago, twice a day with normal face skin care since I was using it on my face also.</li>
            <li>I can see myself in a product from use, and with facts that a potential customer might find useful.</li>
            <li>and she said it immediately felt a relief like a nice thick coating on her rash</li>
            <li>In the medical field I have seen it used for diabetics with ulcers that were thought to be beyond hope and it healed them right up sometimes.</li>
            <li>Summers they are just super dry normally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this to treat a new surgery incision</li>
            <li>Still very early on to know how well it will do with negating my eczema</li>
            <li>But it has made my skin feel incredibly soft!</li>
            <li>The first jar I got, she used the entire thing!</li>
            <li>Overall it didn&#x27;t do exactly what it was described to do.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer completely beat my expectations.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any overpowering scents and it leaves my skin soft and non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t make me breakout.</li>
            <li>but I prefer this natural cream.</li>
            <li>This stuff is gentle enough for a baby</li>
            <li>this really put the moisture back in.thanks</li>
            <li>face is so sensitive.</li>
            <li>After using it for a few days, my skin is already starting to look healthy and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous to use it on my face but it leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li>In the first picture, you can see the peeling dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have two dry spots on either side of my nose that have been consistently peeling for months.  </li>
            <li>Just recently got this product because my face gets super dry along with my shoulders.</li>
            <li>I recently had a friend ask me what have I been using on my face because she noticed how vibrant my skin and beard looked.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>Even with that, you can see there is a major difference.  </li>
            <li>At first when you apply it, it smells bitter/or slightly sour.</li>
            <li>I use it as a facial moisturizer because I live in a dry climate and it provides immediate, lasting relief.</li>
            <li>I got this stuff and put it on, instantly they were not dry and stopped hurting</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great product, does not leave a oily feeling behind when used.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t believe this not so well-known brand i found on Amazon helps me so much.</li>
            <li> My skin feels softer and that is important to me as it can get pretty weathered and dry.</li>
            <li> you found this review or any of my other reviews interesting or helpful</li>
            <li> The ingredients list in this cream is amazing - I particularly like the fact that it has Manuka honey in it, among all of the other natural stuff.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I highly dislike the smell.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I recommend this cream highly.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that is a Natural Treatment for Eczema, Irritated, Itchy, Sensitive &amp; Dry Skin and can be use in the Face, Hands &amp; Body-</li>
            <li> I do construction and work with a lot of concrete</li>
            <li> I will be a long term customer as this product truly hold true to it&#x27;s value.</li>
            <li> I started using this in this area 3 days ago, twice a day with normal face skin care since I was using it on my face also.</li>
            <li> I can see myself in a product from use, and with facts that a potential customer might find useful.</li>
            <li> and she said it immediately felt a relief like a nice thick coating on her rash</li>
            <li> In the medical field I have seen it used for diabetics with ulcers that were thought to be beyond hope and it healed them right up sometimes.</li>
            <li> Summers they are just super dry normally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this to treat a new surgery incision</li>
            <li> Still very early on to know how well it will do with negating my eczema</li>
            <li> But it has made my skin feel incredibly soft!</li>
            <li> The first jar I got, she used the entire thing!</li>
            <li> Overall it didn&#x27;t do exactly what it was described to do.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer completely beat my expectations.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any overpowering scents and it leaves my skin soft and non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t make me breakout.</li>
            <li> but I prefer this natural cream.</li>
            <li> This stuff is gentle enough for a baby</li>
            <li> this really put the moisture back in.thanks</li>
            <li> face is so sensitive.</li>
            <li> After using it for a few days, my skin is already starting to look healthy and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous to use it on my face but it leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li> In the first picture, you can see the peeling dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have two dry spots on either side of my nose that have been consistently peeling for months.  </li>
            <li> Just recently got this product because my face gets super dry along with my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I recently had a friend ask me what have I been using on my face because she noticed how vibrant my skin and beard looked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> Even with that, you can see there is a major difference.  </li>
            <li> At first when you apply it, it smells bitter/or slightly sour.</li>
            <li> I use it as a facial moisturizer because I live in a dry climate and it provides immediate, lasting relief.</li>
            <li> I got this stuff and put it on, instantly they were not dry and stopped hurting</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually pretty skeptical about lotions that you can use on your whole body, but this does wonders for the face.</li>
            <li> It still left my facial eczema dry and scaly.</li>
            <li> When first smelling the cream I was a bit surprised as it has a slight sour milk scent, only slight and not off putting at all - I&#x27;m assuming that this is because it has a ferment in it&#x27;s ingredients list; I would rather have this smell than added perfumes - yuck.</li>
            <li> I have a dry skin, am a little older</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: My wife got a huge rash on her neck randomly from a necklace that must have some metal in it</li>
            <li> Well it took too long to figure out it was this lotion.</li>
            <li> so my hands are dry as .......</li>
            <li> I have horribly dry itchy acne prone skin on my face.</li>
            <li> Three days of using it on a really dry patch of skin cleared it up.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and</li>
            <li> Its also help me a lot with my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have been going through menopause, and I get reall dry patches of skin on my face, fingers, feet ,elbows and lower legs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I get easily irritated on my chest area between breasts after a bad sunburn years ago, (when I was a lot younger)</li>
            <li> ALL rashes and redness disappeared after one single use!</li>
            <li> I just always have little red raised bumps that itch no matter what I do.</li>
            <li> It was really getting bad and spreading and very itchy for her.</li>
            <li> I have a beard and my skin has slight dry patches and this cream has handled this condition.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and love how the Aloe Base works on my skin.</li>
            <li> But I still use it with my other cream Metaderm</li>
            <li> Most creams have water as their base ingredient which dries out my skin--not the case with this cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like food for your skin, what I mean is, it absorbs immediately, is not greasy and actually hydrates my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in search of products that are less harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> Cream is very thick and white, no smell at all.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it for anyone with really bad dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> I highly recommend this cream, so definitely move forward in purchasing it--you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> It beats my expensive, brand-name department store moisturizer by a mile at less than half the price!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had to do that for the past three days!  </li>
            <li> It is a very thick cream, and doesn&#x27;t immediately soak into the skin, but rather sits on it and soaks in.</li>
            <li> This lotion is quite expensive and it smells like vomit.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> My youngest daughter suffers for eczema really bad</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed in this!</li>
            <li> They both stop the itching and redness but cortisone can have nasty side effects.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> needed a cream for my hands and cuticles without preservatives or chemicals so thought I&#x27;d try this one and I really like it.  It goes on smooth and absorbs immediately and seems to give my hands moisture without being greasy or oily.. Not at all greasy so i can use it at work.  No scent and very clean looking jar so I feel good using it.  I think this is a really good product and I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this cream exceeded my expectations. It&#x27;s like food for your skin, what I mean is, it absorbs immediately, is not greasy and actually hydrates my skin. I have really dry skin and love how the Aloe Base works on my skin. Most creams have water as their base ingredient which dries out my skin--not the case with this cream. After using it for a few days, my skin is already starting to look healthy and hydrated. BUY THIS CREAM, it&#x27;s worth every cent!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer completely beat my expectations. I love this natural and organic skin treatment! This lotion is perfect for relieving my dry sensitive skin condition, whether applied to my hands, face and body. I will be a long term customer as this product truly hold true to it&#x27;s value. Don&#x27;t think twice about buying this cream--just get it!</li>
            <li> I am very picky when it comes to skin care, but have to say, this product is fantastic. I love how it moisturizes my skin. I have a beard and my skin has slight dry patches and this cream has handled this condition. I recently had a friend ask me what have I been using on my face because she noticed how vibrant my skin and beard looked. More importantly, she noticed the vanishing of my skin dryness which was very apparent. I highly recommend this cream, so definitely move forward in purchasing it--you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> What an amazing product this is. I love the fact that it is non greasy, no fragrance and make my face smooth. It feels like it goes deep into your pores. I recommend this product highly</li>
            <li> I really like this cream. It&#x27;s very moisturizing and lasts for a long time. I&#x27;ve been using it for everything. I carry it in my purse!</li>
            <li> Still very early on to know how well it will do with negating my eczema but so far it&#x27;s the very best thing I have tried. I certainly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love this wonderful cream!!! It seems like the skin blemishes and irritation I was experiencing on different parts of my body, including under my eyes has gone away! I am very happy with this product and highly recommend it to anyone with any type of skin condition. :)</li>
            <li> Excellent product .. Great value !</li>
            <li> Really happy with the level of moistute</li>
            <li> I bought this product in search of products that are less harsh on my skin. I have to say it definitely does the job. Not only can I use this as a day to day product on my skin, but I don&#x27;t have to worry about all the chemicals in most traditional products that are less ideal. Good product. I now got my friend in Boston to start using it. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> makes my skin so soft and smooth.  I got this product for review.</li>
            <li> Ok so I got this stuff because it looked legit. I do construction and work with a lot of concrete so my hands are dry as ....... And they will actually hurt from the dryness. I got this stuff and put it on, instantly they were not dry and stopped hurting I have now used it two more days and each time it instantly chills them out. Really love this stuff for what it does for my hands. I will definitely keep getting this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: My wife got a huge rash on her neck randomly from a necklace that must have some metal in it she is allergic to. It was really getting bad and spreading and very itchy for her. I thought of her using this since I already had it and she said it immediately felt a relief like a nice thick coating on her rash, this was right before bed and the next morning her huge rash was literally almost fully gone. She was so amazed she wanted me to share her pictures of before and after just 1 night usage.</li>
            <li> Please note I received a discount on this item in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I debated between four and five stars on this review for one reason only. The smell. I highly dislike the smell. But the results are worth it. I can&#x27;t really describe the smell, though I have been trying to place it. I find it unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I must apologize for my skin. I have horribly dry itchy acne prone skin on my face. In the first picture, you can see the peeling dry skin. After four days of using this product twice a day, once in the morning and once at night, I took the second picture. No peeling. In fact, I haven&#x27;t had peeling since day 2. It is a very thick cream, and doesn&#x27;t immediately soak into the skin, but rather sits on it and soaks in. But it has made my skin feel incredibly soft! I am going to start using this cream on my legs and feet as well, as it feels incredibly soothing when put on. I would definitely reccomend this product to others.</li>
            <li> This lotion is quite expensive and it smells like vomit.  At first when you apply it, it smells bitter/or slightly sour. However, leave it on and it will have you washing everything trying to get rid of the smell. We found ourselves washing sheets, burp clothes, toys skin, and couldn&#x27;t figure out what was the cause of the vomit like smell. Well it took too long to figure out it was this lotion. Regretting that I paid so much for a lotion.</li>
            <li> I Love this cream ! It doesn&#x27;t have any overpowering scents and it leaves my skin soft and non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I use it as an all over body cream because it is so pure that I don&#x27;t have to worry about toxic substances&lt;br /&gt;going into my body.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking to clean up their skin and body care regimen.</li>
            <li> This lotion is really nice. I&#x27;m usually pretty skeptical about lotions that you can use on your whole body, but this does wonders for the face. I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t make me breakout. Any redness or blemishes I had, went away. I highly recommend for anyone who has given up on finding good skin care products.</li>
            <li> I have two dry spots on either side of my nose that have been consistently peeling for months.  I tried prescription medication and that just seemed to exacerbate the situation, made it drier and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was offered the opportunity to review ruly Pure Recovery Cream at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.  Before I received it, I received an e-mail from the company...letting me know if I had any questions or skin concerns that I should feel free to write them and they would get back with me.  WHen I told them about the dry spots, I was advised to put cream on those two areas two to three time a day, that the perfect PH for skin products is 5.5, and that my cleanser might be one of the causes of this issue.  I was also advised they will be coming out with a cleanser soon, and asked if I could take before and after pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to apologize for the difference in lighting...I&#x27;m not home at the moment...and that&#x27;s the lighting I&#x27;m stuck with.  Even with that, you can see there is a major difference.  I was peeling pieces off that area almost every morning.  I haven&#x27;t had to do that for the past three days!  I just take a tiny dab of this cream in those two spots, and it has seemingly worked a miracle that prescription medication couldn&#x27;t.  It only took a matter of days for this cream to work.  I am so excited I am going to start using this as my moisturizer and see if there are any changes in texture.  I do plan to ask if i can use this in combination with rosehip oil and vitamin C serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can highly recommend True Pure Recovery cream, and will buy again when I&#x27;ve used the container up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you found this review or any of my other reviews interesting or helpful, please rate is as &amp;#34;helpful&amp;#34; and or leave a comment.

            <li> This cream is well named because it is truly pure. I use it as a facial moisturizer because I live in a dry climate and it provides immediate, lasting relief. I am prone to breaking out from creams and often have to return them; not the case with this one. It beats my expensive, brand-name department store moisturizer by a mile at less than half the price!</li>
            <li> I like this cream, but more importantly, my daughter loves this cream! The first jar I got, she used the entire thing! I am very happy knowing that my little one is using something that won&#x27;t irritate her skin. This cream has no chemicals and moisturizes well. I will continue to order it. Thanks.</li>
            <li> This skin cream is excellent for helping dry skin. Three days of using it on a really dry patch of skin cleared it up. It really locks in the moisture. I&#x27;m very happy with my skin recovery cream. I would highly recommend it for anyone with really bad dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount for sampling purposes and sharing my opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> This Cream is the best I&#x27;ve tried to help my contact dermatitis . I definitely recommend &amp; will buy again . Apply 2x a day for best results . It&#x27;s a great moisturizer for all skin types as well .</li>
            <li> This is one of the most hydrating moisturizers I have used. I can definitely tell there is honey in it, but it does not leave neither a sticky nor greasy residue. I love it!!</li>
            <li> Great cream! it handles dry skin and good for dry callused feet!! Very Nice!!!!!</li>
            <li> The ingredients list in this cream is amazing - I particularly like the fact that it has Manuka honey in it, among all of the other natural stuff.&lt;br /&gt;It has no artificial fragrance added. When first smelling the cream I was a bit surprised as it has a slight sour milk scent, only slight and not off putting at all - I&#x27;m assuming that this is because it has a ferment in it&#x27;s ingredients list; I would rather have this smell than added perfumes - yuck. The cream was absorbed evenly and readily, leaving no oily residue. I have dry skin and this cream made it feel gently hydrated and soothed. I would purchase this cream again. It&#x27;s not tested on animals and it&#x27;s made here in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a promotional sample of this product in return for testing it and compiling my genuine and objective opinion of it.</li>
            <li> The package arrived on time. I started using it right away. It still left my facial eczema dry and scaly. Also it was still irritated and raised. This product does have a smell to it. To me it smells kind of rancid. But I still use it with my other cream Metaderm it seems to do the job. Overall it didn&#x27;t do exactly what it was described to do.</li>
            <li> Great cream. Love it.</li>
            <li> Really like the cream alot as it stores easily and I can travel with it. Its also help me a lot with my dry skin. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Excellent skin cream. My dermatologist told me to always try to use products that are organic, and fragrance free. This product is simply amazing, It does not leave a oily residue or anything. It truly exceeded all my expectations. I went from rarely to never using creams to I can&#x27;t leave my house without using it. Fantastic!!!!&lt;br /&gt;- Organic&lt;br /&gt;- not oily&lt;br /&gt;- no aroma&lt;br /&gt;This product exceeds the expectations.</li>
            <li> I finally found something that works on my facial eczema.  It stops the itching almost immediately and no more crusty redness. I am now on my 2nd jar. I truly love this cream. My doctor prescribed a cortisone cream but I prefer this natural cream. They both stop the itching and redness but cortisone can have nasty side effects.</li>
            <li> My youngest daughter suffers for eczema really bad so I figure I will give this product a try. I love the fact that is a Natural Treatment for Eczema, Irritated, Itchy, Sensitive &amp; Dry Skin and can be use in the Face, Hands &amp; Body- After I put it on my daughter her skin felt very soft, light silky feeling to it too. The smell and the non greasy feel is great. I like that have Organic Ingredients like Aloe Barbadensis &amp; Olive Oil, it is very important for us that it is Fragrance Free and Paraben Free. This product is great and Safe for even Babies. You will not be disappointed in this! I received this for free for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> All around great cream!!! Love that it moisturizes  and makes my skin feel great and rejuvenated!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cream. Lightweight, soothing and very hydrating. Not greasy, works great under makeup. It quickly absorbs leaving your skin perfectly smooth. I love the fact that all the ingredients are natural and there is not scent to it. It works great even for the delicate area around the eyes. Its a great product you are going to love!!! I&#x27;m very happy I found this cream! I will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> Packaged in a generous 4 ounce white plastic tub. Cream is very thick and white, no smell at all. I read the ingredients, was instantly impressed and opened it up and tried it on my elbows. My elbows are dry and they get easily irritated almost to the point of cracking in winter. Summers they are just super dry normally. Wish I could take a picture of my elbow but I can&#x27;t. I am posting a picture of the ingredient list as I could not find it anywhere advertised and they are fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get easily irritated on my chest area between breasts after a bad sunburn years ago, (when I was a lot younger). I just always have little red raised bumps that itch no matter what I do. I started using this in this area 3 days ago, twice a day with normal face skin care since I was using it on my face also. As of tonight the area is clear as possible, not a mark one and no itch at all, completely perfect and it has not been this way is 15 years. The Manuka Honey is a miracle ingredient. In the medical field I have seen it used for diabetics with ulcers that were thought to be beyond hope and it healed them right up sometimes. Seen it used on severe burns. Manuka Honey has so many uses and healing properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for my face, it feels wonderful, soft smooth, radiant, healthy, no irritation. This stuff is gentle enough for a baby and I am just betting it would make an awesome diaper rash cream also. If you have any skin problems that nothing else has worked, I would really recommend you so try this. I will be buying more I know by winter, just wished it came in a bigger tub as I am going to have a lot of uses for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product on a promotional discount for my honest review and they are 100% my own opinions.

            <li> I have been going through menopause, and I get reall dry patches of skin on my face, fingers, feet ,elbows and lower legs. this really put the moisture back in.thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this to treat a new surgery incision and it&#x27;s fantastic.  My incision was burning and very itchy and this cream took that away immediately.  Now my scar is diminishing with the use of this and Mederna every day.  I recommend this cream highly.</li>
            <li> Needed a cream for my eczema  and this the second best I had makes my eczema soft and smoother.</li>
            <li> I have a dry skin, am a little older and I really liked the way it moisturized my skin leaving it refreshed without being greasy. My skin feels softer and that is important to me as it can get pretty weathered and dry. I am outdoors a lot and spend a lot of time in the water and sun. Thank you for the product. I am very happy and will recommend it to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Bought this cream and have had amazing results!! Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Just recently got this product because my face gets super dry along with my shoulders. I&#x27;ve used many creams to help combat this problem but they end up leaving me with oily skin or not really doing anything. I also end up just breaking out from the chemicals thats in those creams.&lt;br /&gt;This skin recovery cream is well worth it! I was a little nervous to use it on my face but it leaves my skin feeling soft and clean. Best thing about it is that it&#x27;s all natural and you dont need to apply a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Great product for sensitive skin because it has no fragrance as well.</li>
            <li> Great product, does not leave a oily feeling behind when used. Great for mornings and before bed.</li>
            <li> This cream is fantastic. I have irritated skin from chemotherapy and rosacea and this is the first cream that didn&#x27;t burn when I applied it. It has a very elegant feel, not greasy, and absorbs right away. It also has a lively light chocolate scent. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> It works sooooo great with me! ALL rashes and redness disappeared after one single use! I am not exaggerating.&lt;br /&gt;My face is so sensitive. I am allergic to Clinique, Lancome, Kiehl&#x27;s, Clarins and so on, well, which are essentially all the brands I can buy in Sephora.&lt;br /&gt;I had many rashes around my cheekbone. I tried all the way I can do to cure myself. Annnnnd, this is the first thing that worked.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe this not so well-known brand i found on Amazon helps me so much. I once thought only grandma would shop on amazon for skin care products. I was wrong. I recommend every young lady with super sensitive skin to try this~ You will love it! LOL</li>
            <li> I really like this cream! itâ€™s rich and hydrating without being greasy. Surprisingly, I used it on my face and it felt very nice. If you read ingredients, thereâ€™s nothing in there that&#x27;s harmful and when I used it, I felt like my skin was relieved. Overall I am happy and would order again!</li>
