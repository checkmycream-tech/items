            <li> Other than that.</li>
            <li> I wish that the wax would re-melt quicker (takes 90-120 mins), but other than this no problem at all with this.  </li>
            <li> Works well, buy wax refill were hard to find.</li>
            <li> Tough to get hands in to wrist.</li>
            <li> The poor woman who must suffer with tending to my feet suggested that I purchase one to keep things maintained between mani/pedi appointments.</li>

            <li> My skin is just dreadful and this paraffin not only smells wonderful (mild scent) but it keeps my hands and feet soft and moisturized.  I use it multiple times each week.  The poor woman who must suffer with tending to my feet suggested that I purchase one to keep things maintained between mani/pedi appointments.</li>
            <li> Nice but a very strong floral scent</li>
            <li> Could be improved with temp monitor and deeper bowl. Tough to get hands in to wrist. Pluses include quick melting of wax and compact size for counter storage.</li>
            <li> Everything I was hoping and expecting. Rather than paying a nail salon, I can now exfoliate and moisturize my hands at home as often as I like.</li>
            <li> Item arrived as stated.</li>
            <li> I found that it melts quickly and it has a pleasnat scent, and it is easy to use. I like it very much</li>
            <li> Takes forever forever to warm up. .. like 12 hours. Other than that. Good value and sure had made my feet happy after spending long days out on the ocean</li>
            <li> Smells good ~ works better!</li>
            <li> the best for dry nurse hands!</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this paraffin bath to help with pain, stiffness, trigger finger and carpal tunnel in my hands.  It love it!  I get relief whenever I use this.  I wish that the wax would re-melt quicker (takes 90-120 mins), but other than this no problem at all with this.  The wax also leaves my hands soft with a nice fragrance!  I immediately bought one for Mom who has arthritic hands...it helps her pain as well!</li>
            <li> i could not get my ring finger to make a fist but after 3 days of dipping i can now come VERY close to making a fist and the quality is as good as expected.  5 stars!</li>
            <li> Works well, buy wax refill were hard to find.</li>
            <li> It came quick . But must read before you buy</li>
            <li> Paraffin arrived in excellent shape as I had expected.</li>
