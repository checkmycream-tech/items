            <li> Really looks much more expensive.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using it for so long I might have a tendancy to over spritz</li>
            <li> I personally, can find lots of &amp;#34;Winter/Fall&amp;#34; perfume, but not many for the warmer seasons.</li>
            <li> Can be worn year round, all seasons.</li>
            <li> The perfume along with the body wash and lotion must be outdated because the scent totally disappears after a few hours.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s not liked, it&#x27;ll probably be re-gifted.</li>
            <li> Smells expensive on.</li>
            <li> Unhappy about this policy also.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with my purchase.  </li>

            <li> Used for the first time, love the soft scent. Compliments about great scent throughout the day. Loved the price for gift set.</li>
            <li> Lovely scent, given as a gift. ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume it has a soft fresh scent and I always get compliments on smelling good.</li>
            <li> I have been using AV for &amp;#62;30 years.  It has become my signature scent.  Even after 30 years I regularly have people come up to me and ask me what fragrance I am wearing.  Since I have been using it for so long I might have a tendancy to over spritz but the scent is not overpowering- I have even asked those who have made comments.  Works well for light in the summer and a bit of exotic for formal/evening.  I wish I could still find the talc powder from AV but it has been years since I have seen that available.</li>
            <li> The perfume along with the body wash and lotion must be outdated because the scent totally disappears after a few hours. Very disappointed with my purchase.  The seller states that it&#x27;s not returnable if opened.  Unhappy about this policy also.  How can a person know if the scent is right if it is not tried first?</li>
            <li> Love this scent. Smells expensive on. I always get complimented on it. Price is just right. Can be worn year round, all seasons.</li>
            <li> It is the only scent that I like to wear. Can,t find it in the stores any more. The gift set for this price is a great deal. ALSO A GREAT GIFT TO GIVE SOMEONE.  FREASH LIGHT SCENT</li>
            <li> I purchased  this fragrance for a friend as a Christmas gift. I liked the smell, so bought another for myself.  My friend said she loved the fragrance. Cologne is always a safe gift.  If it&#x27;s not liked, it&#x27;ll probably be re-gifted.</li>
            <li> The kit is really cheap for all the items that contain, the fragance is soft and I love it, I bought this for a friend and another friend wants the same kit, I&#x27;m going to buy this again.</li>
            <li> it as a gift and my friend loved it definetly shall buy it again</li>
            <li> Product as advertised and came in ahead of time</li>
            <li> Excellent smell, my girlfriend loves</li>
            <li> I received this gift set today and from the second I sprayed it on, it absolutely kidnapped my senses to another place! It&#x27;s absolutely AWESOME! Ladies (and gentlemen who buy for your ladies), if you like &amp;#34;fresh, clean, feminine, and slightly aquatic&amp;#34; perfume smells, you will LOVE THIS! I personally, can find lots of &amp;#34;Winter/Fall&amp;#34; perfume, but not many for the warmer seasons. Well, I have found another one!  This one is up there with Eternity Aqua and Eternity Summer. Thank you AV; this perfume is completely pure paradise toe senses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, please give this one a try!! You won&#x27;t be sorry! Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Great fragrance with a great price! this 3 piece set is a steal at this price! Ran out and was looking around to buy. someone suggested amazon.com and wow, was the price right!</li>
            <li> I used to buy this for a lot more money in stores who do not stock it anymore. I always get great compliments on this. It is especially nice to have the body wash and lotion all smelling the same. My daughter uses this as well</li>
            <li> My all time favorite. Fresh and not overpowering and it doesn&#x27;t give me a headache like most perfumes do. The price was also a plus!</li>
            <li> My mom loved it so did i.... Smells amazing, and it came super fast!! Deff worth the money , just like in the pictures. With the box &amp; everything</li>
            <li> I purchased this for 2 birthday gifts, both recipients loved it (one was in their 20&#x27;s, one in their 50&#x27;s). Both told me how wonderful, clean and light the fragrance was. It is a great gift, the bottle is huge and comes with bath products. Really looks much more expensive. I might have to buy one for myself.</li>
