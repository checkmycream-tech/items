            <li>It is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the results, my skin has not broken out,</li>
            <li>and I liked them</li>
            <li>so they just won&#x27;t grow on their own anymore even though I stopped biting them about 5 yrs ago</li>
            <li>Its grown 1inch in the three weeks which is pretty good!</li>
            <li>The product does exactly what it says-longer, stronger hair and nails and beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>Out of all of these, Purvana had the most amazing results.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the results so far .</li>
            <li>First time purchasing this product, the reviews was great</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>and I all love this product.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite products, because you can see results.  </li>
            <li>have found the 30 day supply works better than the 90 day.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I also love that this product has Vitamin B12</li>
            <li>so i FEEL better when i take them to.  </li>
            <li>but I went on Amazon to get a better price for them.</li>
            <li>and I noticed that my hair was shinier and my skin just looked healthy.</li>
            <li>Hairfinity got so many reviews as being a miracle product</li>
            <li>but with more time I&#x27;m sure it will help .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My hair felt better and it looked much better</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m also glad that I took a chance on them.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life I can walk around without makeup and feel good about myself:)&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>Now I have a full head of hair again !</li>
            <li>My skin seems to be glowing also &amp; my nails are growing strong &amp; very quickly.</li>
            <li>The vitamins were softgel and easy to dissolve.</li>
            <li>Easy to swallow pill, you would want to eat with it.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this.</li>
            <li>My nails and skin look great, but again i believe this is from the extra biotin that i am taking.</li>
            <li>Her skin looks amazing and much clearer.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my nails fantastic.  </li>
            <li>My nails grow fast and are very strong.</li>
            <li>and i decided to try it, even though i have used skin vitamins before and didn&#x27;t notice anything significant</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t notice significant results like with Purvana for me anyway.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a good hair,skin,and nail vitamin</li>
            <li>, I would truly have a full set of hair.</li>
            <li>Her hair is more beautiful than ever and seems to be growing really fast-its down to her waist</li>
            <li>First of all, because I have a problem swallowing large pills and these are very VERY easy to swallow.</li>
            <li>but i truly believe from research and personal experience that you need too take more biotin,niacin,and horsetail to achieve greater results with hair growth.</li>
            <li>but they sold out that quickly that the owner gave me Purvana Max at a discounted price.</li>
            <li>However, when using these regularly and mostly eating healthily I&#x27;ve gotten comments from friends and family that my hair has grown very fast!</li>
            <li>My hair feels more silky and i have a lot of new hair growth.  </li>
            <li>This product is highly Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>Oh my goodness, to actually see and feel hair is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I do oil my hair, drink plenty of water, and watch what I eat so that may add to my success w/ Purvana</li>
            <li>I smile everytime</li>
            <li>The hair growth vitamins that I have tried so far are biotin 7,000 mcg - 10,000 mcg, Bosley Healthy Hair Vitality Supplement For Women, Purvana Hair Skin &amp; Nails, Silica, &amp; Hairfinity.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t received that much hair growth with them, i honestly believe the hair growth that i have is from the extra biotin im taking a day.</li>
            <li>My nails r growing very fast after 3 months of taking this.</li>
            <li>I received this product exactly three weeks ago today</li>
            <li>really these people are hurrrr!</li>
            <li>My first review on a product ever.</li>
            <li>I will certainly go back for more.</li>
            <li>I am on my fourth box of these pills and I love them.</li>
            <li>These are definitely better than taking just regular biotin.</li>
            <li>I noticed for the first time that my nails were growing</li>
            <li>But just because it didn&#x27;t really work for me doesn&#x27;t meant it won&#x27;t work for you!</li>
            <li>That shows me that the product really works to strengthen my nails, and I won&#x27;t be forgetting it again!</li>
            <li>I absolutely, positively, unquestionably (get the idea?)</li>
            <li>Your skin will feel extra soft and your nails will be very strong and beautiful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As another consumer pointed out, over a year ago I purchased these and the vitamin capsule was a soft yellow and very easily dissolvable.</li>
            <li>I recently had extensions in my hair which all fell out along with my own hair and caused major hair loss.  </li>
            <li>I especially recommend it for being easy to swallow.</li>
            <li>I have waist-length hair and want it to grow longer, so I will certainly buy this product again.</li>
            <li>im not 100% certain my hair is thicker</li>
            <li>My hair has been going steadily since February 2010 when I first encountered these pills.</li>
            <li>When I was skyping my fiance (who is deployed), he even commented on how clear and pretty my skin was!</li>
            <li>Fast nail and hair growth.</li>
            <li>Purvana really works.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it has really done anything noticable to my skin and/or nails, but I think that may take longer.</li>
            <li>I really hope that amazon.com continues to carry this product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell my hair growth yet, being as though I really don&#x27;t wear my hair out much</li>
            <li>but she wants it longer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend that you try these!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really understand why.</li>
            <li>I have concluded that oils that are suppose to grow hair don&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>They moisturize the hair and make it look healthier and shinier but they don&#x27;t really grow hair.</li>
            <li>I bought another bottle today since I missed it so much.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li>High quality ingredients!</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t believe how fast purvana works  </li>
            <li>I am also seeing that my nails are growing fast too .&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am not experiencing much of a difference</li>
            <li>Eleven bucks or so for a one month supply is really a drop in the bucket!&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t fall out as much as it use to</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very please with these hair vitamins</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny, thick, and very healthy.</li>
            <li>Be sure to check with your doctor before starting these (especially if you take oral acne medicine) as they do contain vitamin A and too much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had stomach irritation with these and decided the best action was to fling these dangerous pills (ugh, vitamins...)</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend them to anyone experiencing problems growing hair, nails, or anyone with mild acne.</li>
            <li>Hair growth has to do with diet more and drinking lots of water &amp; tea and eating well and having your daily dose of essential vitamins and minerals.</li>
            <li>It thickens the hair immensely and makes it super shiny.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I usually try not to get excited too quickly about a product but this thing works</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, oils are great for your hair and they make it look beauty</li>
            <li>&quot; more growth than usual and my perm has grown out much quicker than normal.</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t normally grow hair</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Not sure what works better</li>
            <li>I first was introduced to these hair vitamins at a local heath foods store</li>
            <li>The packaging is exactly the same as what I bought at GNC.</li>
            <li>No more caking on makeup just so I can feel comfortable to go to class for this girl!</li>
            <li>First, the pills are very hard and my nails break easily.  </li>
            <li>item is only $10.77 and guess how much they charged me for shipping?</li>
            <li>actually looked healthier, clearer and her complexion was much improved.</li>
            <li>and recently I&#x27;ve noticed that my eyelashes are much fuller than I can remember them ever being in years.</li>
            <li>Will go back to paying for the higher price in my local store.</li>
            <li>Plus skin not as dry this winter and nails are much stronger too.  </li>
            <li>She has been battling weak nails most of her life and thinning hair since turning 50.  </li>
            <li>My fiance even commented on how clear my complexion is starting to look.</li>
            <li>As far as the hair growth, I have not noticed a big change at all.</li>
            <li>I have decided to go back to my old hair vitamins.</li>
            <li>I tried to be nice and give these little babies at least 4 months of consumption but to no avail, I was sold.</li>
            <li>I have been having a little too much breakage since I begin these vitamins.</li>

            <li> When I was skyping my fiance (who is deployed), he even commented on how clear and pretty my skin was!</li>
            <li> Fast nail and hair growth.</li>
            <li> Purvana really works.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it has really done anything noticable to my skin and/or nails, but I think that may take longer.</li>
            <li> I really hope that amazon.com continues to carry this product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell my hair growth yet, being as though I really don&#x27;t wear my hair out much</li>
            <li> but she wants it longer.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend that you try these!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really understand why.</li>
            <li> I have concluded that oils that are suppose to grow hair don&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> They moisturize the hair and make it look healthier and shinier but they don&#x27;t really grow hair.</li>
            <li> I bought another bottle today since I missed it so much.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li> High quality ingredients!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t believe how fast purvana works  </li>
            <li> I am also seeing that my nails are growing fast too .&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not experiencing much of a difference</li>
            <li> Eleven bucks or so for a one month supply is really a drop in the bucket!&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t fall out as much as it use to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very please with these hair vitamins</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny, thick, and very healthy.</li>
            <li> Be sure to check with your doctor before starting these (especially if you take oral acne medicine) as they do contain vitamin A and too much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had stomach irritation with these and decided the best action was to fling these dangerous pills (ugh, vitamins...)</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend them to anyone experiencing problems growing hair, nails, or anyone with mild acne.</li>
            <li> Hair growth has to do with diet more and drinking lots of water &amp; tea and eating well and having your daily dose of essential vitamins and minerals.</li>
            <li> It thickens the hair immensely and makes it super shiny.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I usually try not to get excited too quickly about a product but this thing works</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, oils are great for your hair and they make it look beauty</li>
            <li> &quot; more growth than usual and my perm has grown out much quicker than normal.</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t normally grow hair</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Not sure what works better</li>
            <li> I first was introduced to these hair vitamins at a local heath foods store</li>
            <li> The packaging is exactly the same as what I bought at GNC.</li>
            <li> No more caking on makeup just so I can feel comfortable to go to class for this girl!</li>
            <li> First, the pills are very hard and my nails break easily.  </li>
            <li> item is only $10.77 and guess how much they charged me for shipping?</li>
            <li> actually looked healthier, clearer and her complexion was much improved.</li>
            <li> and recently I&#x27;ve noticed that my eyelashes are much fuller than I can remember them ever being in years.</li>
            <li> Will go back to paying for the higher price in my local store.</li>
            <li> Plus skin not as dry this winter and nails are much stronger too.  </li>
            <li> She has been battling weak nails most of her life and thinning hair since turning 50.  </li>
            <li> My fiance even commented on how clear my complexion is starting to look.</li>
            <li> As far as the hair growth, I have not noticed a big change at all.</li>
            <li> I have decided to go back to my old hair vitamins.</li>
            <li> I tried to be nice and give these little babies at least 4 months of consumption but to no avail, I was sold.</li>
            <li> I have been having a little too much breakage since I begin these vitamins.</li>
            <li> I previously had a medical condition that left parts of my scalp completely bald and my physician prescribed this vitamin.  </li>
            <li> Hair skin, and nail vitamins usually dont have enough of the main vitamins that actually stimulate your hair growth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my hair coming out small but very noticeable amounts every time I brush out hair after showering.  </li>
            <li> vitamin A can have the adverse effect of actually making you loose</li>
            <li> It is stronger than it has been in a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, these take about a month for you to notice a change, but when you do your hair will grow long and shiny.</li>
            <li> This has been a long time coming.</li>
            <li> had some hair loss a few years ago due to taking prescription medicine that had a high dosage of vitamin A.</li>
            <li> After taking these daily for 3 months she had to reduce to every other day because they worked so well.  </li>
            <li> i have only used it for a month and already i can tell less hair is falling out</li>
            <li> My nails have not grown long since I started taking other hair growth vitamins.</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL DONT BUY FROM THIS SELLER....</li>
            <li> I leave it on my hair once a week for an hr to 2 hrs depending on how tired I am or how much I have to do that day.</li>
            <li> Eyelashes growing at alarming length...</li>
            <li> even daily combing is down to maybe a few strands.</li>
            <li> I have been using them since June of 2011 and only DRASTIC result that I have saw with my hair was very little breakage even in the wash</li>
            <li> I theorized it was the biotin in the product that caused the results, but have taken biotin suppliments, and other products for nails with no resullts.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 48 and over past several years</li>
            <li> Mayonnaise however is 1 product that improves your hair immediately due to the protein.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry and uneven toned, this product makes my skin glow</li>
            <li> You must take this vitamin for at least 30 days to begin seeing results and I highly recommend taking it for at least 60 days.</li>
            <li> and I have always had thick coarse hair, but I have just gotten a trim</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally thick and coarse.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what happen to the original vitamins but these new vitamins are horrible.  </li>
            <li> or so I noticed my nails getting stronger, my coplection smoother and less hair falling out.</li>
            <li> My nails are stronger and my hair feels thicker with less hair loss.  </li>
            <li> Can I truly say that my hair length is just a little pass my shoulders, haven&#x27;t seen that in years.</li>
            <li> BUY AND WASTE MONEY.ive learned my lesson these people take advantage of those like me out there that dont read everything before they buy.</li>
            <li> I will write again after a few weeks of try to let you know if works on me.</li>
            <li> I would truly recommend these pills to anyone who having trouble with their hair.</li>
            <li> I asked my manicurist to cut my nails down and she found it difficult to cut my nails with the traditional instrument.</li>
            <li> very little a few strands in the sink not to mention comb</li>
            <li> but I have not had one hormonal (you know the deep, red, painful pimples?)</li>
            <li> -out very little strands</li>
            <li> ,i have been taking this for the past 11 days now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why, but when I used the ones in the plastic container they didn&#x27;t work as well as the one in the box.</li>
            <li> Not sure how I feel about these hair vitamins.</li>
            <li> my nail lady commented on how hard my nails are.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to measure hair growth on yourself since the changes are incremental and over time.</li>
            <li> I have been waiting until I was on these pills for at least two months before I decided to write a review.</li>
            <li> breakout for at least two weeks now!</li>
            <li> It made my paper thin nail stronger within a couple of months.</li>
            <li> My hair was thin and breaking off</li>
            <li> Now, it is semi-hard black vitamins that do not dissolve so readily, difficult to swallow, and leaving an unpleasant after taste.</li>
            <li> I am normally so skeptical of everything sold online, but my hair was thinning</li>
            <li> Not only that, but a terrible taste &amp;#34;came</li>
            <li> I had no idea when I ordered these that they would be so difficult to swallow!</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t buy this product again  :(</li>
            <li> disappointed!</li>
            <li> have dealt with HORRIBLE acne since I was in the 6th grade.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Fast nail and hair growth. I have been using this for 4 months and I love it.</li>
            <li> It seems to work. My hair and nails both seem to grow. I also take daily vitamins that also have that affect.</li>
            <li> It made my paper thin nail stronger within a couple of months. I strongly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Purvana really works. After a week or so I noticed my nails getting stronger, my coplection smoother and less hair falling out.</li>
            <li> I received this product exactly three weeks ago today and I have been taking them with a 5,000mcg of Biotin. I haven&#x27;t received that much hair growth with them, i honestly believe the hair growth that i have is from the extra biotin im taking a day. Its grown 1inch in the three weeks which is pretty good! My nails and skin look great, but again i believe this is from the extra biotin that i am taking. Overall, this is a good hair,skin,and nail vitamin but i truly believe from research and personal experience that you need too take more biotin,niacin,and horsetail to achieve greater results with hair growth. Hair skin, and nail vitamins usually dont have enough of the main vitamins that actually stimulate your hair growth.</li>
            <li> i dont care if these product works like miracle! item is only $10.77 and guess how much they charged me for shipping? $35.95 as in really these people are hurrrr! and shipment is not even expidite. PLEASE DONT BUY AND WASTE MONEY.ive learned my lesson these people take advantage of those like me out there that dont read everything before they buy.BE CAREFUL DONT BUY FROM THIS SELLER....</li>
            <li> My hair was thin and breaking off so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. It&#x27;s AMAZING! My hair is a lot fuller, thicker and has stopped breaking off after 2 months of daily use. My nails are even growing and have stopped being brittle and breaking off as well. You must take this vitamin for at least 30 days to begin seeing results and I highly recommend taking it for at least 60 days.</li>
            <li> My nails grow fast and are very strong. I asked my manicurist to cut my nails down and she found it difficult to cut my nails with the traditional instrument. I also believe that it has helped in minimizing the breakage of my hair and helps it to grow</li>
            <li> This supplement is great for healthy hair and nails.  I even notice my eyelashes to be fuller and longer when I take this product.  It is an excellent supplement to take along with your multivitamin.  I take it every day now, and feel it is essential to my daily regimen.</li>
            <li> Saw no improvement with this product</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s and I all love this product.  We all noticed longer eyelashes and stronger nails within three weeks.  One of my daughter&#x27;s noticed a wonderful improvement in her skin as well....actually looked healthier, clearer and her complexion was much improved. We will definitely continue to use Purvana!</li>
            <li> Since I have been taking these vitamins (3months now) my hair has been getting softer and softer. I don&#x27;t think it has really done anything noticable to my skin and/or nails, but I think that may take longer. I really hope that amazon.com continues to carry this product.</li>
            <li> The product is good. I find it helpfull for hair loss reduction. I think I can see results in about 10 days to 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Purvana for a month now and recently I&#x27;ve noticed that my eyelashes are much fuller than I can remember them ever being in years. My skin seems to be glowing also &amp; my nails are growing strong &amp; very quickly. I am extremely impressed. I went to Burmans for a sale on Purvana but they sold out that quickly that the owner gave me Purvana Max at a discounted price. I can&#x27;t tell my hair growth yet, being as though I really don&#x27;t wear my hair out much and I have always had thick coarse hair, but I have just gotten a trim so I will be measuring my growth. My hair is shiny, thick, and very healthy. I do oil my hair, drink plenty of water, and watch what I eat so that may add to my success w/ Purvana but I will keep you updated. If possible, go for Purvana Max. I smile everytime I look in the mirror.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend has been using Purvana hair, skin, and nails for about 2 months now and she loves it. Her hair is more beautiful than ever and seems to be growing really fast-its down to her waist but she wants it longer. Her skin looks amazing and much clearer. She also uses clear.now products for her face but since she started using Purvana, her face looks radiant. The product does exactly what it says-longer, stronger hair and nails and beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products, because you can see results.  My nails are stronger and thicker than ever.  I theorized it was the biotin in the product that caused the results, but have taken biotin suppliments, and other products for nails with no resullts.  I don&#x27;t take the pills every day but every 2-3 days.  This is the greatest suppliment because the proof is in the results.</li>
            <li> My first review on a product ever.So i was breaking out and having skin issues this summer and went into GNC looking for some skin vitamins. The guy at the store recommended this and i decided to try it, even though i have used skin vitamins before and didn&#x27;t notice anything significant, i still felt my skin was lacking some nutrients and so i went searching for some vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;Well,i have been taking this for the past 11 days now and i have seen changes in my skin..My fiance even commented on how clear my complexion is starting to look. I usually try not to get excited too quickly about a product but this thing works and i am totally sold.I will certainly go back for more.</li>
            <li> I like this product for my hair, skin and nails. I have noticed the growth in my hair and my nail lady commented on how hard my nails are.</li>
            <li> i have been taking the vitamins religiously for over a month and I dont see any good results.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy this product again  :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using is product now for month and have hair growth already.  I previously had a medical condition that left parts of my scalp completely bald and my physician prescribed this vitamin.  Oh my goodness, to actually see and feel hair is amazing.  I will continue to use this product until all my hair has fully grown back.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally thick and coarse. I&#x27;ve used this product for one month - missed a fee days here and there and I am alreading seeing results in the thickness, elasticity and growth of my hair. I&#x27;ve notice 1/2\\&quot; more growth than usual and my perm has grown out much quicker than normal. I will also note that this is 1/5 of the daily vitamins I take for hair, skin and nails so the combination could be the root.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she loved. Her hair and skin are more beautiful now tha ever.</li>
            <li> Wow! I absolutely, positively, unquestionably (get the idea?) love these pills!!! First of all, because I have a problem swallowing large pills and these are very VERY easy to swallow. Second, because they are so affordable. I have already noticed a change in my hair. It is stronger than it has been in a long time. I have waist-length hair and want it to grow longer, so I will certainly buy this product again. I especially recommend it for being easy to swallow.</li>
            <li> My nails look amazing!!!  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> My nails r growing very fast after 3 months of taking this. I do notice hair growth which was my reason for buying product. My hair is bleach blinds and find and was falling out as a result of stress since match 2013. I have also verb taking along with pira&amp;ntilde;a 1000mcg per day of sublingual biotin. Not sure what works better but I&#x27;m never stopping either! My hair has stopped falling out and it&#x27;s growing a big too!</li>
            <li> These work, I needed some help after medication side effects caused my hair to fall. Now I have a full head of hair again !</li>
            <li> I have been using Purvana for over two years and it is absolutely amazing. The key is to buy the ones in the box, not the plastic container. I&#x27;m not sure why, but when I used the ones in the plastic container they didn&#x27;t work as well as the one in the box. Perhaps it has something to do with the freshness.&lt;br /&gt;I had some hair loss a few years ago due to taking prescription medicine that had a high dosage of vitamin A. I started taking these after I was taken off of the medicine. Be sure to check with your doctor before starting these (especially if you take oral acne medicine) as they do contain vitamin A and too much vitamin A can have the adverse effect of actually making you loose hair.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, these take about a month for you to notice a change, but when you do your hair will grow long and shiny. Your skin will feel extra soft and your nails will be very strong and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt; I highly recommend that you try these! They are life changing.</li>
            <li> This is the only nail and hair supplement that seems to make a difference!&lt;br /&gt;I have found the 30 day supply works better than the 90 day.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My skin is dry and uneven toned, this product makes my skin glow and I love it.!</li>
            <li> I recieved item as promised. My husband and I take the pill every morning and we are already seeing a difference.</li>
            <li> My Wife loves these.  In fact, they may work to well.  She has been battling weak nails most of her life and thinning hair since turning 50.  After taking these daily for 3 months she had to reduce to every other day because they worked so well.  2 years into it, she now skips taking them for a week at a time depending on the time of year.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have been using these pills for about a year on and off. I am on my fourth box of these pills and I love them. They are amazing for your face and nails. My hair has been going steadily since February 2010 when I first encountered these pills. I would definitely recommend them to anyone experiencing problems growing hair, nails, or anyone with mild acne. There are no side effects that I have seen either. These are definitely better than taking just regular biotin.</li>
            <li> I am normally so skeptical of everything sold online, but my hair was thinning and I thought i would give this a try. I have problem skin so after reading a lot of reviews about biotin i decided to go with a lower dose of 2500mcg.  I am very happy with the results, my skin has not broken out, im not 100% certain my hair is thicker but the number one thing i have noticed is my eyelashes are substantially longer!  I also love that this product has Vitamin B12 so i FEEL better when i take them to.  I would def recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to measure hair growth on yourself since the changes are incremental and over time. However, when using these regularly and mostly eating healthily I&#x27;ve gotten comments from friends and family that my hair has grown very fast! I consider it a win when my hair dresser comments on my hair growth. A+++ would buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 48 and over past several years I&#x27;ve noticed my hair coming out small but very noticeable amounts every time I brush out hair after showering.  After 30 days, I&#x27;ve had NO hair coming out and hair is a bit fuller and healthier. Plus skin not as dry this winter and nails are much stronger too.  I have hypothyroidism which affects hair, skin and nails and overall this has been best product I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> i have only used it for a month and already i can tell less hair is falling out and my hair feels healthier. i will be buying more of this product!</li>
            <li> I first was introduced to these hair vitamins at a local heath foods store and I liked them but I went on Amazon to get a better price for them. I have been using them since June of 2011 and only DRASTIC result that I have saw with my hair was very little breakage even in the wash very little a few strands in the sink not to mention comb -out very little strands even daily combing is down to maybe a few strands. Shedding- what is that! As far as the hair growth, I have not noticed a big change at all. I still take them hoping to see some growth, but if it could put my shedding to almost a halt, that speaks volumes.</li>
            <li> A clerk at GNC recommended this product to me at my local GNC store. I had excellent results. My nails have always been brittle and after taking this product I noticed for the first time that my nails were growing and I noticed that my hair was shinier and my skin just looked healthy. I was pretty impressed but since it was 25 bucks for a month supply at GNC I decided to look for a cheaper place to buy this supplement. The price here is great but ever since I started taking these I&#x27;ve noticed that my nails, hair and skin have gone back to how they used to be. I don&#x27;t really understand why. The packaging is exactly the same as what I bought at GNC. Regardless if you want to try this product I wouldn&#x27;t suggest buying it here.</li>
            <li> Not sure how I feel about these hair vitamins. I have been having a little too much breakage since I begin these vitamins. I tried to be nice and give these little babies at least 4 months of consumption but to no avail, I was sold. I have decided to go back to my old hair vitamins. But just because it didn&#x27;t really work for me doesn&#x27;t meant it won&#x27;t work for you!</li>
            <li> Purvana has helped my nails to become healthier and is helping to thicken up my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been experimenting trying different hair growth oils and vitamins. I have concluded that oils that are suppose to grow hair don&#x27;t really work. They moisturize the hair and make it look healthier and shinier but they don&#x27;t really grow hair. Hair growth has to do with diet more and drinking lots of water &amp; tea and eating well and having your daily dose of essential vitamins and minerals. I have bought a couple of oils that are suppose to grow hair and I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference. Mayonnaise however is 1 product that improves your hair immediately due to the protein. It thickens the hair immensely and makes it super shiny. I leave it on my hair once a week for an hr to 2 hrs depending on how tired I am or how much I have to do that day. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, oils are great for your hair and they make it look beauty so they are essential but they don&#x27;t normally grow hair so I take hair growth vitamins to achieve that. The hair growth vitamins that I have tried so far are biotin 7,000 mcg - 10,000 mcg, Bosley Healthy Hair Vitality Supplement For Women, Purvana Hair Skin &amp; Nails, Silica, &amp; Hairfinity. Out of all of these, Purvana had the most amazing results. My friend noticed my hair while I was taking it and bought a bottle as well. Literally, I would trim my nails 1 day and then the next I would have to trim them again. It is an amazing product. I bought another bottle today since I missed it so much. Hairfinity got so many reviews as being a miracle product but I didn&#x27;t notice significant results like with Purvana for me anyway. My nails have not grown long since I started taking other hair growth vitamins. I notice my nails a lot because I used to bite them for yrs so they just won&#x27;t grow on their own anymore even though I stopped biting them about 5 yrs ago so any product that can make them grow is definitely something that I will keep buying. This product is highly Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> First time purchasing this product, the reviews was great let see how works on me. Fast shipping. I will write again after a few weeks of try to let you know if works on me.</li>
            <li> This product did not yield the same results as purchased in my local health food store...Packaging the same, results..NOT!  Also, I noticed a difference in the \\&quot;look\\&quot; of the pills...disappointed! Will go back to paying for the higher price in my local store.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that I have been using for years now.  I highly recommend it!  My nails have stopped splitting and breaking off and I also believe it helps my hair.</li>
            <li> When I purchased Purvana hair, skin and nails 30 softgel over a year ago, the product was wonderful.  The vitamins were softgel and easy to dissolve. However, I purchased the same vitamins again this year and the results are quite different.  First, the pills are very hard and my nails break easily.  Also, my hair  texture does not have that silky shine look, as well as, my hair does not seem to be growing.  I don&#x27;t know what happen to the original vitamins but these new vitamins are horrible.  If you don&#x27;t believe me, try dropping a vitamin in a  glass with some water.  The pill will not dissolve, even if it stays there for several days.  I will not buy these vitamins again.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my nails fantastic.  I recently forgot to take it with me when I traveled for a week, and my nails were breaking again by the end of the trip.  That shows me that the product really works to strengthen my nails, and I won&#x27;t be forgetting it again!</li>
            <li> I had no idea when I ordered these that they would be so difficult to swallow! Not only that, but a terrible taste &amp;#34;came back up.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I could not stand it, even though I tried for a week. I would not recommend these. Why can&#x27;t these be smaller and easier to take? And why doesn&#x27;t the packaging give a real-size image of the product, so customers could decide in advance?</li>
            <li> Power product!  Eyelashes growing at alarming length... To the point where trimming is required!!  Easy to swallow pill, you would want to eat with it.  High quality ingredients!</li>
            <li> What happened to these hair vitamins?  As another consumer pointed out, over a year ago I purchased these and the vitamin capsule was a soft yellow and very easily dissolvable. The results were wonderful, and did not cause any stomach irritation. Now, it is semi-hard black vitamins that do not dissolve so readily, difficult to swallow, and leaving an unpleasant after taste. I&#x27;ve had stomach irritation with these and decided the best action was to fling these dangerous pills (ugh, vitamins...) in the garbage bin.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a big change in my hair since i started taking this product.  My hair feels more silky and i have a lot of new hair growth.  I recently had extensions in my hair which all fell out along with my own hair and caused major hair loss.  This product has definitely improved my hair.</li>
            <li> I am taking purvana for the first time after being impressed by all the good reviews.  I have been taking it for 3 weeks . And already I can see hair growth plus my hair is thicker and fuller.&lt;br /&gt;I have afro hair and its been relaxed the regrowth is very impressive .&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe how fast purvana works  I am also seeing that my nails are growing fast too .&lt;br /&gt;In regards to my skin I am not experiencing much of a difference but with more time I&#x27;m sure it will help .&lt;br /&gt;I am going to keep taking it I am very happy with the results so far .</li>
            <li> I have been using Purvana for over a year now.  My nails are stronger and my hair feels thicker with less hair loss.  I think it&#x27;s the best product out there for stronger nails and hair.</li>
            <li> Today I have completed two boxes of the Purvana Hair, Skin and Nails! I have been waiting until I was on these pills for at least two months before I decided to write a review. I do not even know where to begin! I want to shake the hand of the person who came up with this pill!&lt;br /&gt;I have dealt with HORRIBLE acne since I was in the 6th grade. Being a college student now, I was beginning to think that there was nothing that was going to help me. I tried every cream, wash, lotion, ect. that you could think of for acne. Nothing seemed to help me. When I can across this pill I decided to give it a shot. Eleven bucks or so for a one month supply is really a drop in the bucket!&lt;br /&gt;Well, Two months into this and my skin is clearer then it has ever been. I still have some blackheads but I have not had one hormonal (you know the deep, red, painful pimples?) breakout for at least two weeks now! When I was skyping my fiance (who is deployed), he even commented on how clear and pretty my skin was! No more caking on makeup just so I can feel comfortable to go to class for this girl! For the first time in my life I can walk around without makeup and feel good about myself:)&lt;br /&gt;As you can tell, I am in love with this pill and I will continue to keep taking it! A plus side is my hair does seem to be growing faster now to along with my nails. I hope this helps anyone out there like me! You need to give this a try!</li>
            <li> My hair felt better and it looked much better and it didn&#x27;t fall out as much as it use to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a African American woman who have been using Purvana for a year now.  I must admit it has my thinning hair area finally growing and thickness is back to my hair. This has been a long time coming. I figure another year taking these hair vitamins, I would truly have a full set of hair. I&#x27;m very please with these hair vitamins and I&#x27;m also glad that I took a chance on them. Can I truly say that my hair length is just a little pass my shoulders, haven&#x27;t seen that in years. I would truly recommend these pills to anyone who having trouble with their hair.</li>
            <li> No problem getting my vitamins!</li>
