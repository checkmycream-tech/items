            <li>I’m very excited to share with you my “Vitamin C Serum Review &amp; Giveaway!”</li>
            <li>Results amazing - redness reduced, tightened skin immediately.  </li>
            <li>All i have to say is that this is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This serum contains some amazing ingredients like 20% vitamin c, boosted with vitamin e, hyaluronic acid and aloe vera.</li>
            <li>Amazing serum.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing</li>
            <li>I liked the product while I was using it in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Liked the product.  </li>
            <li>I liked the way it felt until</li>
            <li>on face now - was hoping for a more fairly priced alternative...)</li>
            <li>Honestly it does nothing to my skin.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a nice size bottle for the price.</li>
            <li>was contemplating making my own Vitamin C serum but</li>
            <li>The serum feels SO nice on my skin</li>
            <li>and I love that it is good for all skin types since I have oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I was neither paid nor sponsored for my opinions—positive or otherwise—and all thoughts reflected in this review are solely my own.</li>
            <li>All opinions expressed are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really loving what this does to my skin.</li>
            <li>This serum is awesome, clinical strength and really hydrates and smooths lines...</li>
            <li>And I honestly feel like every morning I wake up after using it</li>
            <li>(the kind that comes from her buddies Ben and Jerry) and just decide to let her skin age without any intervention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I really liked it.</li>
            <li>I feel this is an effective serum.</li>
            <li>I thought I would never use another, but I gave this one a try because I liked the Dr. Song Glycolic.</li>
            <li>I bought a vitamin serum C and rose hip oil, a month ago.</li>
            <li>I have been using the vitamin Serum C in day and the rose hip oil at night before I go to bed.</li>
            <li>The peels are gentle but very effective!  </li>
            <li>Dr. Songs line is definitely a sure thing if you want beautiful smooth skin.</li>
            <li>I loved Dr. Song when I first tried it, the benzoyl peroxide and hyaluronic acid were great, but they changed them.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to read and looks like a premium product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see how much better my skin looks after even more use!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t absorb as quickly but it is very effective.</li>
            <li>It is a decent product with excellent customer support who emailed me more often than my relatives.</li>
            <li>Smooth serum feels good to apply</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed with the results so far</li>
            <li>But I am very happy with the results I see so far.</li>
            <li>So far I am very impressed with the results of the two.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just so glad I found an effective routine</li>
            <li>Was sent right on time with instuctions, very nice.</li>
            <li>Works great on face, notice better appearance right away.</li>
            <li>Really large bottle and price is great.</li>
            <li>Loving this launch sale and ordered an extra bottle, because I find it to be a very good product.</li>
            <li>its amazing and leaves my skin smooth :)&lt;br /&gt;www.</li>
            <li>ALSO, what a cheap price!</li>
            <li>I really love this serum.  </li>
            <li>The customer service is top notch.</li>
            <li>You can feel it changing the health of your skin for the better as you apply it.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this brand a try, after not being very happy with the last brand I tried.</li>
            <li>I have been using the product as directed for a couple weeks now, and have already noticed that my complexion is brighter and more even.  </li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen so many reviewers having so many scars that they are treating with this product.</li>
            <li>Ok, but is the product any good?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love both of the serums.</li>
            <li>I got a lot more than I though.</li>
            <li>It was very moisturizing and felt great on my face.</li>
            <li>ETA: Dr. Song assured me that another order would do okay in the heat.</li>
            <li>Not too sure how to use though I didn&#x27;t see any instructions.</li>
            <li>how many drops you desire to apply.  </li>
            <li>My skin resulted in a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>So, is my face adjusting to the hyaluronic acid, or is Dr. Song&#x27;s product actually better?  </li>
            <li>received this product free in exchange for my honest opinion.[[ASIN</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li>I love that it has all three of the ingredients I want in one product.  </li>
            <li>and I love this one from Dr Song.  </li>
            <li>Song Vitamin C Serum contains Vitamin E and hyaluronic acid to nourish your skin even more.</li>
            <li>I noticed my skin is smoother, more plump, and supple.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Advice that has nothing to do with the efficacy of this product: Chemically exfoliate often, and make sure to use a 50+</li>
            <li>I love Vitamin C Serum because it works so well on your skin.</li>
            <li>a product tester I received a free bottle of Dr Song Vitamin C Serum in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>love the packaging of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I use it every night with a retinal hyaluronic acid cream and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone looking for a more even skin tone</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Heck, you spend more than 9.99 at McDonald.s :-)</li>
            <li>Will definately buy again :)))</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally I haven&#x27;t noticed any life changing results while using this, except that my skin just seems to be more radiant and glowing.</li>
            <li>It has that healthy youthful appearance.</li>
            <li>Customer service was awesome and gave me a coupon off  on my next order.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;d really love to review this product again after the 30 days.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>my skin looks better.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I like it, but will know more after I use it for about 6-8 weeks.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels smoother and more supple.</li>
            <li>I buy this for everyone whenever I have the chance to gift something, and they all love it and ask me where to get more.</li>
            <li>Smoother and better appearance, reduces wrinkles.</li>
            <li>which is why I waited to post my review until I was able to evaluate it the best as possible.  </li>
            <li>Also, I love the dropper for the bottle.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It gives my skin a nice plumping effect and makes my skin silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>why should we add another step to our already overwhelming beauty routines?</li>
            <li>girls know I love a company that stands by their products!know</li>
            <li>Thinking of order more after I used up</li>
            <li>I hope that after more use I will see even more</li>
            <li>Love both products.</li>
            <li>My skin is noticeably smoother, the skin tone is much more even, my lines are diminishing</li>
            <li>I a pleased with product quality.</li>
            <li>Wonder product, very smoothing, and a great partner for the glycolic.</li>
            <li>When I ordered these ones, I doubted that they would work well for getting better skin on my face?</li>
            <li>I feel that it makes me have better skin</li>
            <li>I am so glad that they gave me the chance to review this item.</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>A pretty good deal for a $15 product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty good.</li>
            <li>This serum is great for removing discolorations and stopping new ones from forming.</li>
            <li>I was fortunate enough to receive this product for review and I am very happy to have it!</li>
            <li>Take advantage of the intro price; worth more!</li>
            <li>My fine lines look better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many other products before and this one is the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about 2 months and my skin feels moisturized, smooth and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I’m happy with this product so far and will continue to use it as my skin care</li>
            <li>I would stock up on more while they&#x27;re cheap</li>
            <li>I received a complimentary sample of this Vitamin C serum from Dr. Song in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li>received this product complimentary for review purposes; all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>right after I wash my face and the results have been amazing.</li>
            <li>about this product in particular---I love the dropper top since it makes it super easy to dispense onto my hand.</li>
            <li>and it not only felt excellent since it was applied for the first time!  </li>
            <li>Check out my full review at TheBeeHiveBuzz dot com!</li>
            <li>This is a lovely product which comes in an impressive, fun, and delightful little blue bottle.  </li>
            <li>I ordered Dr. Song 20% vitamin c serum, and it arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li>(vitamin C degrades very quickly).</li>
            <li>Very very mild.</li>
            <li>The 20% vitamin C serum is easy to apply and absorb</li>
            <li>It soaks in very quickly so that you don&#x27;t have any wait time to put your moisturizer on over it.</li>
            <li>The vitamin c product was too strong for my skin and caused stinging and redness.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t have a strong citrus smell like the others do.</li>
            <li>I am kind of stunned as I have some pretty pricey stuff that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I had a large adaptor on my check for over 10 years, after a bottle of this, it&#x27;s gone!!!</li>
            <li>I suggest you try it and make up your own mind, as it&#x27;s pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>remove fine lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li>I can see how easily using this Vitamin C Serum can fit into my morning routine.</li>
            <li>:) his items are so super inexpensive that why would you not buy them?</li>
            <li>Refreshing it to a nice glow and looking new again.</li>
            <li>Vitamins C &amp; E are antioxidants that help moisturize and prevent fine lines and wrinkles and deter free radicals.  </li>
            <li>I am HUGE fan of Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li>This serum contains a huge 20% of Vitamin C, boosted with Aloe, Vitamin E and Hyaluronic Acid and Jojoba Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>made my face smooth.</li>
            <li>This one was cheap, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;there is no discomfort with this product, anyone&lt;br /&gt;can use it comfortably.</li>
            <li>This is important, since i don&#x27;t want oily spots on my face.</li>
            <li>and the light didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>With this combination it will leave your skin with a smooth velvet finish.</li>
            <li>Vitamins C and E are known anti-oxidants which help to reverse the effects of damaging free radicals to the skin.</li>
            <li>product arrived without any problems and I have been happy with it in the short time I have been using it</li>
            <li>I enjoy the results of of using this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(I got a free sample to try out this product)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bit of a cosmetic junky and have tried almost, if not all vitamin C serums and this one is definitely up there with the favorites and the great price doesn&#x27;t hurt at all either.</li>
            <li>Also, its light but not too light, to the point where it just feels like water and not doing anything.</li>
            <li>It has a glass dropper for precise application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t happy they will simply refund your money.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any real difference in my skins appearance, but it does feel nice after putting it on.  </li>
            <li>I received a bottle  for free to review, but this did not affect my review at all.</li>
            <li>The formula has been refined through precise testing from dozens of doctors and professionals within the cosmetic industry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>But, so far it&#x27;s good...</li>
            <li>Finish by applying a good moisturizer once the serum is completely</li>
            <li>I used it for a week now and can really see the difference!!!  </li>
            <li>I definitely will buy more; I am a customer for life!!</li>
            <li>This did not break me out or feel sticky or tacky on my skin; it&#x27;s a new favorite of mine!</li>
            <li>This serum has faded my melasma significantly</li>
            <li>I just ordered and received 2 more bottles when I did not finish the first one because I do not want to run out of it.</li>
            <li>It dispenses a small controllable amount perfect for using applying in the areas where I need it.</li>
            <li>Hopefully that this lunch price stays this way a little longer so that I can purchase more this week at this great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and is light, but still moisturizes.</li>
            <li>The price is super fantastic.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;What&#x27;s great about that is the fact that it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out at all.</li>
            <li>It works and is a good price, just for me doesnt fit my needs properly.</li>
            <li>I have pretty good skin and hardly no wrinkles but have been fighting melasma for about 10 years.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this, from the first application felt the difference and just as quickly saw it as well.</li>
            <li>Goes very smoothly and absolve fast.</li>
            <li>I hope there is that special again</li>
            <li>Using Dr Song&#x27;s serum was no exception, as it spread easily and absorbed quickly into my skin.  </li>
            <li>By around the 4 week mark, it was a  bright neon yellow.</li>
            <li>Word to the wise us only a drop at a time.</li>
            <li>Bummer, but true.  </li>
            <li>Have used Vit C serum before but nothing as good as this one, have already ordered a second bottle</li>
            <li>use vitamin C twice a day—once in the morning and once in the evening—and one full size 1 oz.</li>
            <li>I definitely would recommend this serum to anyone looking for a good anti aging product.</li>
            <li>Most Vitamin C &amp;#34;serums&amp;#34; I have tried were very liquidy.</li>
            <li>But after the redness goes away it really seems like my skin looks better.</li>
            <li>love this vitamin C, it is really helpful.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a way to deliver vitamins and nutrients directly to the skin in a purer, more easily absorbed form than most creams allow.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I kept catching myself running my fingers across my cheek, admiring how soft it was.</li>
            <li>So I received one as a promotion, a full 1 ounce bottle.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>My makeup goes on really nicely over it and my skin looks dewy and feels soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The serum comes in a gorgeous opaque cobalt blue dropper bottle.  </li>
            <li>It is a fairly viscous liquid, so I rubbed it quickly between my hands to increase its temperature and decrease its viscosity, and then I applied it to my entire face and neck.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin super hydrated.</li>
            <li>The results have been great, to the point where my derm also wants to purchase the same vit c serum.</li>
            <li>The product began turning more and more yellow, though, a sign of oxidization.</li>
            <li>my time of not having to buy all the ingredients, bottling and worrying about the Vitamin C aspect quickly deteriorating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did come quickly.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different brands of Vitamin C Serum and this is one that I like the most.</li>
            <li>The restorative effect is instant, my face is starting to show great changes!</li>
            <li>Slather it on your face, neck, decolletage, because there&#x27;s no sense rationing it when it expires so quickly.</li>
            <li>My face is smoother, softer and more vibrant.</li>
            <li>Came quickly.</li>
            <li>, really cant say enough about it, I always make sure I have more on hand as I don&#x27;t want to run out!</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t feel the need to use additional hyaluronic acid afterward like I normally do with most of my Vitamin C Serums.</li>
            <li>I have use Dr Song oil for a month, I like how it feels and it gets absorbed really quick</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m loving the packaging &amp; if the first use is an indication of what this product is going to be like, it just might be my holy grail .</li>
            <li>It comes in a beautiful cobalt blue glass bottle that reminds me of old time medicine shops with their tinctures and remedies lined up gleaming in the windows.</li>
            <li>dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combination of Vitamin C and E together, provide a super powerful anti-aging punch.</li>
            <li>it looks radiant, and healthy, soft!</li>
            <li>I use Dr. Song Vitamin C every day and can see that my face is so much smother, and the fine lines in my face are almost gone.</li>
            <li>Personally, I prefer much more Vitamin C serum than rose hip oil because I don&#x27;t like some odd smell of rose hip oil.</li>
            <li>It should be packaged in a tube rather than the little bottle with the dropper, but apart from that issue it is a great product.</li>
            <li>Really made my skin feel smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 41 years old skin care junkie and LOVE</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with the the results, I&#x27;ve added it to my daily routine even after completely healing.</li>
            <li>yet - but I&#x27;m a vey satisfied customer so far.</li>
            <li>And most important of all, my pores are getting noticeably smaller.</li>
            <li>Dr. Song should rely on the product for reviews, not artificially pump up his stats.  </li>
            <li>Vitamin E was worth the gamble and</li>
            <li>have been using this serum for approximately 3 weeks and have been very happy with it.</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li>Most importantly though this actually FEELS like a serum.</li>
            <li>I use this about 3-4 times a week before bed on a freshly cleansed face.</li>
            <li>The serum is fresh, which you can tell by the color.  </li>
            <li>Are these serums really worth the time?</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li>Song originally manufactured their products for professionals, doctors, and medical facilities, so this serum has been through more rigorous testing than most beauty products available to the public.</li>
            <li>The other morning I had a real good look at my face without makeup and was genuinely surprised at how even the skin tone is, this really does the job.</li>
            <li>I also am happy that it came in a pretty blue glass bottle because it will definitely keep light from getting in too well.</li>
            <li>I notice it particularly right under my eyes - it looks smoother.  </li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t hurt, right?</li>
            <li>I did the 50% lactic peel and this one right after.</li>
            <li>Since I am a senior with wrinkles to work on, I am looking forward to seeing some positive results!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last more than a month or so even under perfect conditions because Vitamin C oxidizes in the presence of oxygen and light, rendering it useless.</li>
            <li>Good serum, absorbed to my skin quickly not greasy.  </li>
            <li>like that it doesn&#x27;t have a huge list of ingredients, and the main ones are easily recognizable.</li>
            <li>The fine lines near my eyes are gone and my under eye area is brighter!</li>
            <li>I noticed my skin has looked more brighter and plumper looking whereas before it was kind of dull.</li>
            <li>If you have brown spots and large pores this is for you!  </li>
            <li>Overall, a great product, wish it didn&#x27;t oxidize that fast, since i keep it in a dry storage place and away from the light.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s just a natural beauty regimine to keep your skin looking good which definitely doesn&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li>It was light and fresh and felt natural.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased 4 bottles total since they have a great introductory offer, and I keep the extra bottles in the refrigerator to prevent the oils from getting rancid or losing potency.  </li>
            <li>However this product give me the new face without blemish in 3days, I am so excited.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>My pores have shrunk and my skin is overall much better.  </li>
            <li>but it feels like it really works!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this product was changed because it is my first time trying it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been complimented so much on my skin!</li>
            <li>I am concerned about how it might be damaged during shipping while the weather is hot now.    </li>
            <li>Like all serums, it should always be followed with a moisturizer (lotion, cream, emulsion, what have you) and should be used consistently for visible results.</li>
            <li>With patience and healthy skin practices (drinking lots of water, getting moderate exercise, not using pore-clogging skin care products, etc.)</li>
            <li>There are many vitamin C serums out there that are all-natural and contain no added fragrances, but this one does contain some (the last ingredient).</li>
            <li>The order arrived promptly and the product was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Ordered my second bottle of this, love it.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t say enough about this product, love it highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>I think perhaps it may just have a higher percentage of hyaluronic acid in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast service!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s exactly what I get from using this Dr Song Vitamin C</li>
            <li>use it fast!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;m using both.  </li>
            <li>My first impression, yes</li>
            <li>I feel my face is getting much soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>my face is definitely getting better.</li>
            <li>When I apply it to my face I feel like I have more control rather than trying to clean up the drips from other Vitamin C Serums.  </li>
            <li>The serum does absorbs really quick into the skin which does not give me enough time to smooth it over the remaining parts of my face.</li>
            <li>product works great, nothing bad about it, and is truly amazing.</li>
            <li>The ingredients and wide ranging benefits are not age specific, so it is great to try at any age.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give full ratings is because I want to use it for a longer period to see the full effect of the serum.</li>
            <li>With using both of them every day, I am getting some positive result.</li>
            <li>Other brands are twice as much at least and are no where near as good, so definitely worth trying, especially if you are new to Vit C serum or have tried others and aren&#x27;t impressed, this one works!</li>
            <li>Truly when I bought it and first used it, it lightened up my face/acne scars so much.</li>
            <li>I also realized after I ordered the product that most of the great reviews are fake!</li>
            <li>Although I did have a reaction to it, I did notice a much softer feel to my face first time using it.</li>
            <li>When I first started using it, my skin felt kind of tight when I put it on, but it didn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I am a huge believer in taking care of my skin, even though I am young, its never too early to give it some TLC!</li>
            <li>Product is of very high quality.</li>
            <li>My skin has been lacking moisture lately and I&#x27;ve been noticing more fine lines.  </li>
            <li>This product really works not hype</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m expecting, but we will see.</li>
            <li>Easily absorbing.  </li>
            <li>I put to much on at once</li>
            <li>Very effective.&lt;br /&gt;FOLLOW</li>
            <li>Also, the serum came fresh, which you can tell by if the gel is clear.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I am multiracial &amp; have very oily/acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Since if you haven’t tried a Vitamin C Serum before, you really should.</li>
            <li>and I hope the price will not go too high!</li>
            <li>really like this product.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen much difference.  </li>
            <li>The price was reasonable.  </li>
            <li>but it works really well.</li>
            <li>It made my face much brighter and even-toned.</li>
            <li>My skin was much brighter and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Skin care is really a changing field.</li>
            <li>skin care is really an emerging field for scientific research.</li>
            <li>It worked better and faster than I expected.</li>
            <li>I find that the skin on my neck does not react well to this serum, it really dries the skin out in that area.</li>
            <li>It came so fast in the mail.</li>
            <li>Although the serum seems to absorb fast, I use it as part of my night routine, since I worry my face could look oily/shiny if used in the mornings.  </li>
            <li>I gently give myself a face massage, using the serum as my slip, and working it into my skin.</li>
            <li>This came fast.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended !</li>
            <li>This is so cheap for something that actually works.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m very accident prone, although I&#x27;ve improved with age).</li>
            <li>Songs Medical Vitamin C + E Serum with Hyaluronic Acid contains 20% Vitamin C, boosted with Vitamin E, Hyaluronic Acid and Aloe Vera for a smooth velvet finish on your skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried Vitamin C serums and lotions, but they all irritated my skin too much.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the Dr Song&#x27;s customer service.</li>
            <li>The hyaluronic acid seems to be ok so far - I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of weeks</li>
            <li>Not only do they make my skin so soft by helping my moisturizer absorb better into my skin, but they also significantly help control acne and fade acne scars and sun damage that I acquired during my teenage</li>
            <li>I don’t have fine lines yet, so I’m not sure how it works towards wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t very watery like most other serums that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Being older now, I have wrinkles, scars and large pores.</li>
            <li>Now after several days I have noticed a minimal shrinkage in the pores on my cheeks and a more even fuller tone under my eyes where they usually sink in like I haven&#x27;t slept in days lol.</li>
            <li>The only thing about this serum was it was very sticky in my hands and when I patted it on my clean face it became soapy like.</li>
            <li>It is A LOT cheaper than some of the other serums I have tried and has benefited my skin more than the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The consistency is thicker than that of other brands, more like a gel than a liquid.</li>
            <li>It needs to be kept in a dark medicine cabinet, or BETTER, kept refrigerated.</li>
            <li>The bottle looked kind of small on here</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a month now for scars and dark spots, and they are fading for sure.  </li>
            <li>I have used it only for 3days, it worked really good, I have blemish a lot around cheeks, I used Borghese green mask to clean, though it worked,not totally.</li>
            <li>and they sent me a new one without any hassle (twice) that works!</li>
            <li>This feels like a serum and rubs in smoothly, but do not rub too long or it will produce some suds!</li>
            <li>My Dr Song product arrived quickly and I appreciate the email instructions I received prior to it&#x27;s delivery.</li>
            <li>So that was my main concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I also break out while my skin adjusts), but I didn&#x27;t have the dryness issue with this particular serum.</li>
            <li>Customers experience better results with Dr Song&#x27;s products because they are made with USP (pharmaceutical grade) quality ingredients which are the same ingredients used in hospitals and medical laboratories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING from prescription creams to high end and lower end products.</li>
            <li>I always take in consideration of the high reviews when I buy a product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The serum dropper is another pleasant feature to use; helps to eliminate unnecessary waste of this precious serum product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really not one for makeup or even a night time skin routine, but the days do pass, and I am getting those fine lines and thought, why not try it?</li>
            <li>As with many vitamin C serums, it can leave you feeling a little sticky, but I just put my normal moisturizer over it</li>
            <li>Really helps clear up face and reduce pore size.</li>
            <li>Smooth skin not much else.</li>
            <li>noticed that my skin was brighter, clearer and more firm immediately.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical, but It seems to be very effective.  </li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.d at least 5 minutes to allow it time to completely absorb through my skin before applying my nighttime moisturizer.</li>
            <li>That being said, it is also a little sticky, but if you wait until it absorbs into your skin and follow it with a good moisturizer, you&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;After using it for about a week straight, I did start to see an improvement with the slight wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li>This product is new for me</li>
            <li>Like the new look and the new consistency of the serum.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is on an opaque colored bottle because Vitamin C products are vulnerable to deterioration in the presence of light.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t go very far</li>
            <li>and I actually noticed a difference almost from the first day.  </li>
            <li>you are ambitious, you can make this serum yourself, but the initial cost for the bulk ingredients might seem costly.</li>
            <li>The only thing: my drop bottle was clear glass, I wish it was blue as shown, for light protection.</li>
            <li>What more would you expect, other then the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Dr Song Medical these products are made in the USA, FDA compliant and a provider of professional products.</li>
            <li>First order I received the serum was clear white.</li>
            <li>Vitamin C serum is clear when first made and turns into a yellow over time as it degrades</li>
            <li>Cute dark blue bottle and a dropper attached to it.</li>
            <li>In fact, from the first use it left my skin feeling velvety soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>I have also been using a Moisturizer which seem to work very well with it, I&#x27;m not sure which of the products has the greater effect on my skin as I started using both products at the same time</li>
            <li>I love this product even I only used for less then two weeks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve heard that the serum works better if you apply it to slightly moist skin and then apply your regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell that my some freak spot and stained skin removed, but I can tell that my face looks smooth, elastic and brighter, and pores look tight.</li>
            <li>This goes on light, smooth and you only need a small amount to cover the entire face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent so much money on other products and I&#x27;m so excited to have finally found something that actually works, and I use a light moisturizer</li>
            <li>There were not a ton of options, and certainly people’s individual skin needs were not seen as important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If its yellow, then it means its beginning to degrade, although still usable, which I have had a problem with receiving degraded serum in the past from other vitamin c serum brands, even the more expensive ones, so I was pleasantly happy to get a fresh product from Dr Song.</li>
            <li>clear</li>
            <li>It is a clear, odorless, gooey serum that contains Vitamins C &amp; E plus hyaluronic acid.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to get triple volume for the price of 1 oz.</li>
            <li>I already bought one for a friend as a gift and she loves it so far too.</li>
            <li>It did take a few days to have that smooth affect but its visible and weather</li>
            <li>Wow..</li>
            <li>It worked very well until suddenly</li>
            <li>So far the product seems to be working as promised</li>
            <li>The sun damage on both of my cheeks was considerable looking at the pictures</li>
            <li>and I started to try natural products as I am not a fan of too may chemicals.</li>
            <li>in all I will try the product again if the price doesn&#x27;t go up too much post launch sale and my only wish was that it qualified for Prime.</li>
            <li>I really like this skin care need to have bigger bottles .  </li>
            <li>It is too soon to notice any results but Iike it as my skin feels soft after using it.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend doing a patch test if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>really surprised that this serum gives me immediate result.</li>
            <li>I have somewhat sensitive skin, and I have never had any issues with this at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Too sensitive for my face</li>
            <li>I have a bottle that&#x27;s about 3 months old</li>
            <li>I was really surprised</li>
            <li>But a lot of products do that for me because my skin is so sensitive.</li>
            <li>Would recommend the hyaluronic acid but not the vitamin c if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>In both cases shipment arrived early and</li>
            <li>It is a naturally occurring substance that depletes as we get</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The reason why I&#x27;m in this boat is because of my experimental ways.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>My skin feels really soft.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is worth using alone or in conjunction with your current moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Dr Song Medical is a medical cosmetic laboratory that originally manufactured products for professionals, doctors, and medical facilities.</li>
            <li>Also they ship very promptly and the price seems reasonable compared to other products of this type.  </li>
            <li>have Asian skin that easily tans, slight acne that always leaves scars and I have developed some Melasma on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>I usually clean my face, and then apply a few drops to my face and neck in the morning.</li>
            <li>I used this serum as recommended by my doctor after getting a CO2 laser treatment, and it helped restore my skin back to normal, while keeping it soft and shrinking pores.  </li>
            <li>have sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m pretty careful about what I use- for instance</li>
            <li>quickly.&lt;br /&gt;The only concern is that if vitamin C is not stable under light, why the serum is not using a dark shade bottle?</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend and would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>UVA/UVB broad spectrum sunscreen!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been only week to use it but skin feel smooth and slightly lighten my brown spot.</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical when I received a clear bottle and not the image posted for sale but kindly the customer service rep informed me that the clear bottle was UV coated.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with Vitamin Serum C, so I will definitely order it again because it is enough to moisturize my face without using any expensive serum or essence from others.</li>
            <li>I get the same results as I would expect from Vitamin C serums without using as much as I normally have to.</li>
            <li>I am definitely buying this again very soon before I move back</li>
            <li>Yeah, it&#x27;s enough to make a girl scream, reach for the only cream she really wants  </li>
            <li>I am a 58 yo woman and started to get the typical laugh lines and crows feet for someone my age...</li>
            <li>my pores decreased in size, and my skin fells more soft.</li>
            <li>major drawback is the shelf life, though.</li>
            <li>I think the long term effects must be positive however in the short term</li>
            <li>I have previously used a magnesium ascrobyl phosphate serum (less potent form of vitamin c) without a problem.</li>
            <li>I store it tightly in a medicine cabinet, so it is not exposed to light or heat, and only oxygen when I open it in the mornings.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also does feel a little sticky when you first apply it, but it absorbs completely within 60-90 seconds and doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of sticky residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>bottle generally lasts me two months.</li>
            <li>Everything is so natural and essential.</li>
            <li>Vitamin C serums are the only thing that has done anything for my wrinkles and has worked well for me so far.  </li>
            <li>it went on like gloss, you can actually feel  it working on your tried old skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about been a product for wrinkles since i am only 23 years old.</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid is a natural substance which is known to decline in aging skin; using this ingredient in a topical formulation helps to restore the fullness to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a veteran peeler, so for me, I need products that are high-quality, not too harsh, and that help my skin recover quickly as I am a teacher.</li>
            <li>The serum is just thick enough to be easy to use.</li>
            <li>The serum has a gel-like thin texture and absorbs really fast, so I apply moisturizer almost right after the serum.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will say that it does make the skin on my face red and a little irritated when I first put it on.</li>
            <li>Dr Song Medical is a global, integrated pharmaceutical and medical cosmetic company that specializes in research and manufacturing of products for licensed professional and institutes in over 30 different countries.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super thick, 2 drops will cover your face.  </li>
            <li>I suffer from large pores and uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li>Also, it oxidizes a little fast, 2 weeks after having the product it started to turn yellow, it has a champagne color</li>
            <li>one leaves my skin very soft, while the other one was just sticky.</li>
            <li>Great product, don&#x27;t like the packaging tho it should be in a plastic bump bottle not a glass because I take it around to travel and its heavy and afraid itll drop.</li>

            <li> I’m very excited to share with you my “Vitamin C Serum Review &amp; Giveaway!”</li>
            <li> Results amazing - redness reduced, tightened skin immediately.  </li>
            <li> All i have to say is that this is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This serum contains some amazing ingredients like 20% vitamin c, boosted with vitamin e, hyaluronic acid and aloe vera.</li>
            <li> Amazing serum.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing</li>
            <li> I liked the product while I was using it in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Liked the product.  </li>
            <li> I liked the way it felt until</li>
            <li> on face now - was hoping for a more fairly priced alternative...)</li>
            <li> Honestly it does nothing to my skin.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a nice size bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> was contemplating making my own Vitamin C serum but</li>
            <li> The serum feels SO nice on my skin</li>
            <li> and I love that it is good for all skin types since I have oily skin.  </li>
            <li> I was neither paid nor sponsored for my opinions—positive or otherwise—and all thoughts reflected in this review are solely my own.</li>
            <li> All opinions expressed are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really loving what this does to my skin.</li>
            <li> This serum is awesome, clinical strength and really hydrates and smooths lines...</li>
            <li> And I honestly feel like every morning I wake up after using it</li>
            <li> (the kind that comes from her buddies Ben and Jerry) and just decide to let her skin age without any intervention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I really liked it.</li>
            <li> I feel this is an effective serum.</li>
            <li> I thought I would never use another, but I gave this one a try because I liked the Dr. Song Glycolic.</li>
            <li> I bought a vitamin serum C and rose hip oil, a month ago.</li>
            <li> I have been using the vitamin Serum C in day and the rose hip oil at night before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> The peels are gentle but very effective!  </li>
            <li> Dr. Songs line is definitely a sure thing if you want beautiful smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I loved Dr. Song when I first tried it, the benzoyl peroxide and hyaluronic acid were great, but they changed them.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to read and looks like a premium product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see how much better my skin looks after even more use!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t absorb as quickly but it is very effective.</li>
            <li> It is a decent product with excellent customer support who emailed me more often than my relatives.</li>
            <li> Smooth serum feels good to apply</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with the results so far</li>
            <li> But I am very happy with the results I see so far.</li>
            <li> So far I am very impressed with the results of the two.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just so glad I found an effective routine</li>
            <li> Was sent right on time with instuctions, very nice.</li>
            <li> Works great on face, notice better appearance right away.</li>
            <li> Really large bottle and price is great.</li>
            <li> Loving this launch sale and ordered an extra bottle, because I find it to be a very good product.</li>
            <li> its amazing and leaves my skin smooth :)&lt;br /&gt;www.</li>
            <li> ALSO, what a cheap price!</li>
            <li> I really love this serum.  </li>
            <li> The customer service is top notch.</li>
            <li> You can feel it changing the health of your skin for the better as you apply it.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this brand a try, after not being very happy with the last brand I tried.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product as directed for a couple weeks now, and have already noticed that my complexion is brighter and more even.  </li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen so many reviewers having so many scars that they are treating with this product.</li>
            <li> Ok, but is the product any good?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love both of the serums.</li>
            <li> I got a lot more than I though.</li>
            <li> It was very moisturizing and felt great on my face.</li>
            <li> ETA: Dr. Song assured me that another order would do okay in the heat.</li>
            <li> Not too sure how to use though I didn&#x27;t see any instructions.</li>
            <li> how many drops you desire to apply.  </li>
            <li> My skin resulted in a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> So, is my face adjusting to the hyaluronic acid, or is Dr. Song&#x27;s product actually better?  </li>
            <li> received this product free in exchange for my honest opinion.[[ASIN</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li> I love that it has all three of the ingredients I want in one product.  </li>
            <li> and I love this one from Dr Song.  </li>
            <li> Song Vitamin C Serum contains Vitamin E and hyaluronic acid to nourish your skin even more.</li>
            <li> I noticed my skin is smoother, more plump, and supple.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Advice that has nothing to do with the efficacy of this product: Chemically exfoliate often, and make sure to use a 50+</li>
            <li> I love Vitamin C Serum because it works so well on your skin.</li>
            <li> a product tester I received a free bottle of Dr Song Vitamin C Serum in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> love the packaging of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I use it every night with a retinal hyaluronic acid cream and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone looking for a more even skin tone</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Heck, you spend more than 9.99 at McDonald.s :-)</li>
            <li> Will definately buy again :)))</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally I haven&#x27;t noticed any life changing results while using this, except that my skin just seems to be more radiant and glowing.</li>
            <li> It has that healthy youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> Customer service was awesome and gave me a coupon off  on my next order.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;d really love to review this product again after the 30 days.</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> my skin looks better.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and I like it, but will know more after I use it for about 6-8 weeks.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels smoother and more supple.</li>
            <li> I buy this for everyone whenever I have the chance to gift something, and they all love it and ask me where to get more.</li>
            <li> Smoother and better appearance, reduces wrinkles.</li>
            <li> which is why I waited to post my review until I was able to evaluate it the best as possible.  </li>
            <li> Also, I love the dropper for the bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It gives my skin a nice plumping effect and makes my skin silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> why should we add another step to our already overwhelming beauty routines?</li>
            <li> girls know I love a company that stands by their products!know</li>
            <li> Thinking of order more after I used up</li>
            <li> I hope that after more use I will see even more</li>
            <li> Love both products.</li>
            <li> My skin is noticeably smoother, the skin tone is much more even, my lines are diminishing</li>
            <li> I a pleased with product quality.</li>
            <li> Wonder product, very smoothing, and a great partner for the glycolic.</li>
            <li> When I ordered these ones, I doubted that they would work well for getting better skin on my face?</li>
            <li> I feel that it makes me have better skin</li>
            <li> I am so glad that they gave me the chance to review this item.</li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> A pretty good deal for a $15 product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty good.</li>
            <li> This serum is great for removing discolorations and stopping new ones from forming.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to receive this product for review and I am very happy to have it!</li>
            <li> Take advantage of the intro price; worth more!</li>
            <li> My fine lines look better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many other products before and this one is the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about 2 months and my skin feels moisturized, smooth and healthy.  </li>
            <li> I’m happy with this product so far and will continue to use it as my skin care</li>
            <li> I would stock up on more while they&#x27;re cheap</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary sample of this Vitamin C serum from Dr. Song in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> received this product complimentary for review purposes; all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> right after I wash my face and the results have been amazing.</li>
            <li> about this product in particular---I love the dropper top since it makes it super easy to dispense onto my hand.</li>
            <li> and it not only felt excellent since it was applied for the first time!  </li>
            <li> Check out my full review at TheBeeHiveBuzz dot com!</li>
            <li> This is a lovely product which comes in an impressive, fun, and delightful little blue bottle.  </li>
            <li> I ordered Dr. Song 20% vitamin c serum, and it arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li> (vitamin C degrades very quickly).</li>
            <li> Very very mild.</li>
            <li> The 20% vitamin C serum is easy to apply and absorb</li>
            <li> It soaks in very quickly so that you don&#x27;t have any wait time to put your moisturizer on over it.</li>
            <li> The vitamin c product was too strong for my skin and caused stinging and redness.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t have a strong citrus smell like the others do.</li>
            <li> I am kind of stunned as I have some pretty pricey stuff that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I had a large adaptor on my check for over 10 years, after a bottle of this, it&#x27;s gone!!!</li>
            <li> I suggest you try it and make up your own mind, as it&#x27;s pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> remove fine lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li> I can see how easily using this Vitamin C Serum can fit into my morning routine.</li>
            <li> :) his items are so super inexpensive that why would you not buy them?</li>
            <li> Refreshing it to a nice glow and looking new again.</li>
            <li> Vitamins C &amp; E are antioxidants that help moisturize and prevent fine lines and wrinkles and deter free radicals.  </li>
            <li> I am HUGE fan of Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li> This serum contains a huge 20% of Vitamin C, boosted with Aloe, Vitamin E and Hyaluronic Acid and Jojoba Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> made my face smooth.</li>
            <li> This one was cheap, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;there is no discomfort with this product, anyone&lt;br /&gt;can use it comfortably.</li>
            <li> This is important, since i don&#x27;t want oily spots on my face.</li>
            <li> and the light didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> With this combination it will leave your skin with a smooth velvet finish.</li>
            <li> Vitamins C and E are known anti-oxidants which help to reverse the effects of damaging free radicals to the skin.</li>
            <li> product arrived without any problems and I have been happy with it in the short time I have been using it</li>
            <li> I enjoy the results of of using this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(I got a free sample to try out this product)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit of a cosmetic junky and have tried almost, if not all vitamin C serums and this one is definitely up there with the favorites and the great price doesn&#x27;t hurt at all either.</li>
            <li> Also, its light but not too light, to the point where it just feels like water and not doing anything.</li>
            <li> It has a glass dropper for precise application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t happy they will simply refund your money.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any real difference in my skins appearance, but it does feel nice after putting it on.  </li>
            <li> I received a bottle  for free to review, but this did not affect my review at all.</li>
            <li> The formula has been refined through precise testing from dozens of doctors and professionals within the cosmetic industry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> But, so far it&#x27;s good...</li>
            <li> Finish by applying a good moisturizer once the serum is completely</li>
            <li> I used it for a week now and can really see the difference!!!  </li>
            <li> I definitely will buy more; I am a customer for life!!</li>
            <li> This did not break me out or feel sticky or tacky on my skin; it&#x27;s a new favorite of mine!</li>
            <li> This serum has faded my melasma significantly</li>
            <li> I just ordered and received 2 more bottles when I did not finish the first one because I do not want to run out of it.</li>
            <li> It dispenses a small controllable amount perfect for using applying in the areas where I need it.</li>
            <li> Hopefully that this lunch price stays this way a little longer so that I can purchase more this week at this great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and is light, but still moisturizes.</li>
            <li> The price is super fantastic.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;What&#x27;s great about that is the fact that it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out at all.</li>
            <li> It works and is a good price, just for me doesnt fit my needs properly.</li>
            <li> I have pretty good skin and hardly no wrinkles but have been fighting melasma for about 10 years.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this, from the first application felt the difference and just as quickly saw it as well.</li>
            <li> Goes very smoothly and absolve fast.</li>
            <li> I hope there is that special again</li>
            <li> Using Dr Song&#x27;s serum was no exception, as it spread easily and absorbed quickly into my skin.  </li>
            <li> By around the 4 week mark, it was a  bright neon yellow.</li>
            <li> Word to the wise us only a drop at a time.</li>
            <li> Bummer, but true.  </li>
            <li> Have used Vit C serum before but nothing as good as this one, have already ordered a second bottle</li>
            <li> use vitamin C twice a day—once in the morning and once in the evening—and one full size 1 oz.</li>
            <li> I definitely would recommend this serum to anyone looking for a good anti aging product.</li>
            <li> Most Vitamin C &amp;#34;serums&amp;#34; I have tried were very liquidy.</li>
            <li> But after the redness goes away it really seems like my skin looks better.</li>
            <li> love this vitamin C, it is really helpful.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a way to deliver vitamins and nutrients directly to the skin in a purer, more easily absorbed form than most creams allow.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I kept catching myself running my fingers across my cheek, admiring how soft it was.</li>
            <li> So I received one as a promotion, a full 1 ounce bottle.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> My makeup goes on really nicely over it and my skin looks dewy and feels soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The serum comes in a gorgeous opaque cobalt blue dropper bottle.  </li>
            <li> It is a fairly viscous liquid, so I rubbed it quickly between my hands to increase its temperature and decrease its viscosity, and then I applied it to my entire face and neck.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin super hydrated.</li>
            <li> The results have been great, to the point where my derm also wants to purchase the same vit c serum.</li>
            <li> The product began turning more and more yellow, though, a sign of oxidization.</li>
            <li> my time of not having to buy all the ingredients, bottling and worrying about the Vitamin C aspect quickly deteriorating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did come quickly.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different brands of Vitamin C Serum and this is one that I like the most.</li>
            <li> The restorative effect is instant, my face is starting to show great changes!</li>
            <li> Slather it on your face, neck, decolletage, because there&#x27;s no sense rationing it when it expires so quickly.</li>
            <li> My face is smoother, softer and more vibrant.</li>
            <li> Came quickly.</li>
            <li> , really cant say enough about it, I always make sure I have more on hand as I don&#x27;t want to run out!</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t feel the need to use additional hyaluronic acid afterward like I normally do with most of my Vitamin C Serums.</li>
            <li> I have use Dr Song oil for a month, I like how it feels and it gets absorbed really quick</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m loving the packaging &amp; if the first use is an indication of what this product is going to be like, it just might be my holy grail .</li>
            <li> It comes in a beautiful cobalt blue glass bottle that reminds me of old time medicine shops with their tinctures and remedies lined up gleaming in the windows.</li>
            <li> dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combination of Vitamin C and E together, provide a super powerful anti-aging punch.</li>
            <li> it looks radiant, and healthy, soft!</li>
            <li> I use Dr. Song Vitamin C every day and can see that my face is so much smother, and the fine lines in my face are almost gone.</li>
            <li> Personally, I prefer much more Vitamin C serum than rose hip oil because I don&#x27;t like some odd smell of rose hip oil.</li>
            <li> It should be packaged in a tube rather than the little bottle with the dropper, but apart from that issue it is a great product.</li>
            <li> Really made my skin feel smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 41 years old skin care junkie and LOVE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with the the results, I&#x27;ve added it to my daily routine even after completely healing.</li>
            <li> yet - but I&#x27;m a vey satisfied customer so far.</li>
            <li> And most important of all, my pores are getting noticeably smaller.</li>
            <li> Dr. Song should rely on the product for reviews, not artificially pump up his stats.  </li>
            <li> Vitamin E was worth the gamble and</li>
            <li> have been using this serum for approximately 3 weeks and have been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> Most importantly though this actually FEELS like a serum.</li>
            <li> I use this about 3-4 times a week before bed on a freshly cleansed face.</li>
            <li> The serum is fresh, which you can tell by the color.  </li>
            <li> Are these serums really worth the time?</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> Song originally manufactured their products for professionals, doctors, and medical facilities, so this serum has been through more rigorous testing than most beauty products available to the public.</li>
            <li> The other morning I had a real good look at my face without makeup and was genuinely surprised at how even the skin tone is, this really does the job.</li>
            <li> I also am happy that it came in a pretty blue glass bottle because it will definitely keep light from getting in too well.</li>
            <li> I notice it particularly right under my eyes - it looks smoother.  </li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t hurt, right?</li>
            <li> I did the 50% lactic peel and this one right after.</li>
            <li> Since I am a senior with wrinkles to work on, I am looking forward to seeing some positive results!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last more than a month or so even under perfect conditions because Vitamin C oxidizes in the presence of oxygen and light, rendering it useless.</li>
            <li> Good serum, absorbed to my skin quickly not greasy.  </li>
            <li> like that it doesn&#x27;t have a huge list of ingredients, and the main ones are easily recognizable.</li>
            <li> The fine lines near my eyes are gone and my under eye area is brighter!</li>
            <li> I noticed my skin has looked more brighter and plumper looking whereas before it was kind of dull.</li>
            <li> If you have brown spots and large pores this is for you!  </li>
            <li> Overall, a great product, wish it didn&#x27;t oxidize that fast, since i keep it in a dry storage place and away from the light.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s just a natural beauty regimine to keep your skin looking good which definitely doesn&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li> It was light and fresh and felt natural.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased 4 bottles total since they have a great introductory offer, and I keep the extra bottles in the refrigerator to prevent the oils from getting rancid or losing potency.  </li>
            <li> However this product give me the new face without blemish in 3days, I am so excited.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> My pores have shrunk and my skin is overall much better.  </li>
            <li> but it feels like it really works!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product was changed because it is my first time trying it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been complimented so much on my skin!</li>
            <li> I am concerned about how it might be damaged during shipping while the weather is hot now.    </li>
            <li> Like all serums, it should always be followed with a moisturizer (lotion, cream, emulsion, what have you) and should be used consistently for visible results.</li>
            <li> With patience and healthy skin practices (drinking lots of water, getting moderate exercise, not using pore-clogging skin care products, etc.)</li>
            <li> There are many vitamin C serums out there that are all-natural and contain no added fragrances, but this one does contain some (the last ingredient).</li>
            <li> The order arrived promptly and the product was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Ordered my second bottle of this, love it.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t say enough about this product, love it highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I think perhaps it may just have a higher percentage of hyaluronic acid in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast service!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s exactly what I get from using this Dr Song Vitamin C</li>
            <li> use it fast!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;m using both.  </li>
            <li> My first impression, yes</li>
            <li> I feel my face is getting much soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> my face is definitely getting better.</li>
            <li> When I apply it to my face I feel like I have more control rather than trying to clean up the drips from other Vitamin C Serums.  </li>
            <li> The serum does absorbs really quick into the skin which does not give me enough time to smooth it over the remaining parts of my face.</li>
            <li> product works great, nothing bad about it, and is truly amazing.</li>
            <li> The ingredients and wide ranging benefits are not age specific, so it is great to try at any age.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give full ratings is because I want to use it for a longer period to see the full effect of the serum.</li>
            <li> With using both of them every day, I am getting some positive result.</li>
            <li> Other brands are twice as much at least and are no where near as good, so definitely worth trying, especially if you are new to Vit C serum or have tried others and aren&#x27;t impressed, this one works!</li>
            <li> Truly when I bought it and first used it, it lightened up my face/acne scars so much.</li>
            <li> I also realized after I ordered the product that most of the great reviews are fake!</li>
            <li> Although I did have a reaction to it, I did notice a much softer feel to my face first time using it.</li>
            <li> When I first started using it, my skin felt kind of tight when I put it on, but it didn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I am a huge believer in taking care of my skin, even though I am young, its never too early to give it some TLC!</li>
            <li> Product is of very high quality.</li>
            <li> My skin has been lacking moisture lately and I&#x27;ve been noticing more fine lines.  </li>
            <li> This product really works not hype</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m expecting, but we will see.</li>
            <li> Easily absorbing.  </li>
            <li> I put to much on at once</li>
            <li> Very effective.&lt;br /&gt;FOLLOW</li>
            <li> Also, the serum came fresh, which you can tell by if the gel is clear.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I am multiracial &amp; have very oily/acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Since if you haven’t tried a Vitamin C Serum before, you really should.</li>
            <li> and I hope the price will not go too high!</li>
            <li> really like this product.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much difference.  </li>
            <li> The price was reasonable.  </li>
            <li> but it works really well.</li>
            <li> It made my face much brighter and even-toned.</li>
            <li> My skin was much brighter and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Skin care is really a changing field.</li>
            <li> skin care is really an emerging field for scientific research.</li>
            <li> It worked better and faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> I find that the skin on my neck does not react well to this serum, it really dries the skin out in that area.</li>
            <li> It came so fast in the mail.</li>
            <li> Although the serum seems to absorb fast, I use it as part of my night routine, since I worry my face could look oily/shiny if used in the mornings.  </li>
            <li> I gently give myself a face massage, using the serum as my slip, and working it into my skin.</li>
            <li> This came fast.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended !</li>
            <li> This is so cheap for something that actually works.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m very accident prone, although I&#x27;ve improved with age).</li>
            <li> Songs Medical Vitamin C + E Serum with Hyaluronic Acid contains 20% Vitamin C, boosted with Vitamin E, Hyaluronic Acid and Aloe Vera for a smooth velvet finish on your skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried Vitamin C serums and lotions, but they all irritated my skin too much.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the Dr Song&#x27;s customer service.</li>
            <li> The hyaluronic acid seems to be ok so far - I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> Not only do they make my skin so soft by helping my moisturizer absorb better into my skin, but they also significantly help control acne and fade acne scars and sun damage that I acquired during my teenage</li>
            <li> I don’t have fine lines yet, so I’m not sure how it works towards wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t very watery like most other serums that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Being older now, I have wrinkles, scars and large pores.</li>
            <li> Now after several days I have noticed a minimal shrinkage in the pores on my cheeks and a more even fuller tone under my eyes where they usually sink in like I haven&#x27;t slept in days lol.</li>
            <li> The only thing about this serum was it was very sticky in my hands and when I patted it on my clean face it became soapy like.</li>
            <li> It is A LOT cheaper than some of the other serums I have tried and has benefited my skin more than the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The consistency is thicker than that of other brands, more like a gel than a liquid.</li>
            <li> It needs to be kept in a dark medicine cabinet, or BETTER, kept refrigerated.</li>
            <li> The bottle looked kind of small on here</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a month now for scars and dark spots, and they are fading for sure.  </li>
            <li> I have used it only for 3days, it worked really good, I have blemish a lot around cheeks, I used Borghese green mask to clean, though it worked,not totally.</li>
            <li> and they sent me a new one without any hassle (twice) that works!</li>
            <li> This feels like a serum and rubs in smoothly, but do not rub too long or it will produce some suds!</li>
            <li> My Dr Song product arrived quickly and I appreciate the email instructions I received prior to it&#x27;s delivery.</li>
            <li> So that was my main concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I also break out while my skin adjusts), but I didn&#x27;t have the dryness issue with this particular serum.</li>
            <li> Customers experience better results with Dr Song&#x27;s products because they are made with USP (pharmaceutical grade) quality ingredients which are the same ingredients used in hospitals and medical laboratories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING from prescription creams to high end and lower end products.</li>
            <li> I always take in consideration of the high reviews when I buy a product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The serum dropper is another pleasant feature to use; helps to eliminate unnecessary waste of this precious serum product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not one for makeup or even a night time skin routine, but the days do pass, and I am getting those fine lines and thought, why not try it?</li>
            <li> As with many vitamin C serums, it can leave you feeling a little sticky, but I just put my normal moisturizer over it</li>
            <li> Really helps clear up face and reduce pore size.</li>
            <li> Smooth skin not much else.</li>
            <li> noticed that my skin was brighter, clearer and more firm immediately.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but It seems to be very effective.  </li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.d at least 5 minutes to allow it time to completely absorb through my skin before applying my nighttime moisturizer.</li>
            <li> That being said, it is also a little sticky, but if you wait until it absorbs into your skin and follow it with a good moisturizer, you&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;After using it for about a week straight, I did start to see an improvement with the slight wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> This product is new for me</li>
            <li> Like the new look and the new consistency of the serum.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is on an opaque colored bottle because Vitamin C products are vulnerable to deterioration in the presence of light.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t go very far</li>
            <li> and I actually noticed a difference almost from the first day.  </li>
            <li> you are ambitious, you can make this serum yourself, but the initial cost for the bulk ingredients might seem costly.</li>
            <li> The only thing: my drop bottle was clear glass, I wish it was blue as shown, for light protection.</li>
            <li> What more would you expect, other then the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Dr Song Medical these products are made in the USA, FDA compliant and a provider of professional products.</li>
            <li> First order I received the serum was clear white.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C serum is clear when first made and turns into a yellow over time as it degrades</li>
            <li> Cute dark blue bottle and a dropper attached to it.</li>
            <li> In fact, from the first use it left my skin feeling velvety soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> I have also been using a Moisturizer which seem to work very well with it, I&#x27;m not sure which of the products has the greater effect on my skin as I started using both products at the same time</li>
            <li> I love this product even I only used for less then two weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard that the serum works better if you apply it to slightly moist skin and then apply your regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell that my some freak spot and stained skin removed, but I can tell that my face looks smooth, elastic and brighter, and pores look tight.</li>
            <li> This goes on light, smooth and you only need a small amount to cover the entire face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent so much money on other products and I&#x27;m so excited to have finally found something that actually works, and I use a light moisturizer</li>
            <li> There were not a ton of options, and certainly people’s individual skin needs were not seen as important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If its yellow, then it means its beginning to degrade, although still usable, which I have had a problem with receiving degraded serum in the past from other vitamin c serum brands, even the more expensive ones, so I was pleasantly happy to get a fresh product from Dr Song.</li>
            <li> clear</li>
            <li> It is a clear, odorless, gooey serum that contains Vitamins C &amp; E plus hyaluronic acid.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to get triple volume for the price of 1 oz.</li>
            <li> I already bought one for a friend as a gift and she loves it so far too.</li>
            <li> It did take a few days to have that smooth affect but its visible and weather</li>
            <li> Wow..</li>
            <li> It worked very well until suddenly</li>
            <li> So far the product seems to be working as promised</li>
            <li> The sun damage on both of my cheeks was considerable looking at the pictures</li>
            <li> and I started to try natural products as I am not a fan of too may chemicals.</li>
            <li> in all I will try the product again if the price doesn&#x27;t go up too much post launch sale and my only wish was that it qualified for Prime.</li>
            <li> I really like this skin care need to have bigger bottles .  </li>
            <li> It is too soon to notice any results but Iike it as my skin feels soft after using it.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend doing a patch test if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> really surprised that this serum gives me immediate result.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin, and I have never had any issues with this at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too sensitive for my face</li>
            <li> I have a bottle that&#x27;s about 3 months old</li>
            <li> I was really surprised</li>
            <li> But a lot of products do that for me because my skin is so sensitive.</li>
            <li> Would recommend the hyaluronic acid but not the vitamin c if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> In both cases shipment arrived early and</li>
            <li> It is a naturally occurring substance that depletes as we get</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The reason why I&#x27;m in this boat is because of my experimental ways.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> My skin feels really soft.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is worth using alone or in conjunction with your current moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Dr Song Medical is a medical cosmetic laboratory that originally manufactured products for professionals, doctors, and medical facilities.</li>
            <li> Also they ship very promptly and the price seems reasonable compared to other products of this type.  </li>
            <li> have Asian skin that easily tans, slight acne that always leaves scars and I have developed some Melasma on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I usually clean my face, and then apply a few drops to my face and neck in the morning.</li>
            <li> I used this serum as recommended by my doctor after getting a CO2 laser treatment, and it helped restore my skin back to normal, while keeping it soft and shrinking pores.  </li>
            <li> have sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m pretty careful about what I use- for instance</li>
            <li> quickly.&lt;br /&gt;The only concern is that if vitamin C is not stable under light, why the serum is not using a dark shade bottle?</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend and would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> UVA/UVB broad spectrum sunscreen!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been only week to use it but skin feel smooth and slightly lighten my brown spot.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical when I received a clear bottle and not the image posted for sale but kindly the customer service rep informed me that the clear bottle was UV coated.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with Vitamin Serum C, so I will definitely order it again because it is enough to moisturize my face without using any expensive serum or essence from others.</li>
            <li> I get the same results as I would expect from Vitamin C serums without using as much as I normally have to.</li>
            <li> I am definitely buying this again very soon before I move back</li>
            <li> Yeah, it&#x27;s enough to make a girl scream, reach for the only cream she really wants  </li>
            <li> I am a 58 yo woman and started to get the typical laugh lines and crows feet for someone my age...</li>
            <li> my pores decreased in size, and my skin fells more soft.</li>
            <li> major drawback is the shelf life, though.</li>
            <li> I think the long term effects must be positive however in the short term</li>
            <li> I have previously used a magnesium ascrobyl phosphate serum (less potent form of vitamin c) without a problem.</li>
            <li> I store it tightly in a medicine cabinet, so it is not exposed to light or heat, and only oxygen when I open it in the mornings.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also does feel a little sticky when you first apply it, but it absorbs completely within 60-90 seconds and doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of sticky residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> bottle generally lasts me two months.</li>
            <li> Everything is so natural and essential.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C serums are the only thing that has done anything for my wrinkles and has worked well for me so far.  </li>
            <li> it went on like gloss, you can actually feel  it working on your tried old skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about been a product for wrinkles since i am only 23 years old.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid is a natural substance which is known to decline in aging skin; using this ingredient in a topical formulation helps to restore the fullness to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a veteran peeler, so for me, I need products that are high-quality, not too harsh, and that help my skin recover quickly as I am a teacher.</li>
            <li> The serum is just thick enough to be easy to use.</li>
            <li> The serum has a gel-like thin texture and absorbs really fast, so I apply moisturizer almost right after the serum.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will say that it does make the skin on my face red and a little irritated when I first put it on.</li>
            <li> Dr Song Medical is a global, integrated pharmaceutical and medical cosmetic company that specializes in research and manufacturing of products for licensed professional and institutes in over 30 different countries.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super thick, 2 drops will cover your face.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from large pores and uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> Also, it oxidizes a little fast, 2 weeks after having the product it started to turn yellow, it has a champagne color</li>
            <li> one leaves my skin very soft, while the other one was just sticky.</li>
            <li> Great product, don&#x27;t like the packaging tho it should be in a plastic bump bottle not a glass because I take it around to travel and its heavy and afraid itll drop.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan, its very sticky and it makes it very hard for me to be able to layer this with other products.</li>
            <li> When I used it, I found out a little really does go a long way.</li>
            <li> I am very anxious to see just how well this works after a month.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product is definitely worth trying out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The aloe vera levels in this serum seem to be really high - it even smells a little like aloe.</li>
            <li> It’s not just a matter of putting a pretty looking package together, people want to know that what they put on their face is actually backed up by hard science.</li>
            <li> Normally I have to use extra moisturizer for those few days because my skin gets a little dryer than normal (and double-bonus</li>
            <li> you are looking for a serum that makes you skin feel softer, have a soft glow, and be less red than try out this serum.</li>
            <li> I would not have paid this much for this product, as I can get the same results with other Vitamin C serums for less money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s working, trying clear up my dark marks, no difference</li>
            <li> I use a small dab of this serum all over my face and neck, and it works really well with my moisturizer (Olay Regenerist).</li>
            <li> I am pretty fickle with skin products, but I plan to use this product for at least another month.  </li>
            <li> Have not used this producet long enough yet (one Week)</li>
            <li> I found some reviews had long strings of text with verbatim accolades, despite the users having different names and supposedly being \\&quot;verified\\&quot; purchasers.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t been using it quite long enough  to know the end results.</li>
            <li> (Too much light getting in can destroy it&#x27;s life span, and I would hate that!)&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product that I&#x27;m glad that I now</li>
            <li> The second bottle contained a yellow serum, which I understand means the product has aged or oxidized.</li>
            <li> Just a little background: I&#x27;m African American female, 25 who just used 10% hyrodcorine</li>
            <li> Overall, above average.</li>
            <li> Well my results to that is that it made my skin dark to the point where I barely recognized myself.</li>
            <li> Shipping did not take too long.</li>
            <li> I look forward to long term results.</li>
            <li> No sensitive after use.</li>
            <li> put it on before I go to bed and the redness is long gone by morning.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes it had fully absorbed into my skin, so I went ahead and applied my usual moisturizer and make up.</li>
            <li> This product also feels different than the first one I had, it is less thick and it does not have the same skin-tightening effect, or the same slight tingle when I apply it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing a reduction in old acne marks, acne pigmentation, very slight working in scars.</li>
            <li> It left a film on my face that didn&#x27;t feel like the other vitamin c serums I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I got the feeling from reading some other reviews that I was reading a company promo -same wording and so forth.  </li>
            <li> It sounds silly, but the blue bottle is really pretty!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m scared it can&#x27;t last a couple months or longer like other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t used it very long</li>
            <li> so if you add sunscreen or additional moisturizer to your routine you should wait 15mins for it to dry.</li>
            <li> It has a tendency to dry your face.  </li>
            <li> My skin does feel tighter and softer after using it, Since it has a tendency to dry the skin</li>
            <li> It took a bit to dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Within a few days it made my skin seem lighter (even though I don&#x27;t think skin lightening is one of the things it&#x27;s supposed to do) and just overall younger and healthier looking.</li>
            <li> After about 2 weeks, using a small amount once a day, it has softened and smoothed my skin considerably -  </li>
            <li> But after only used half of the bottle, I noticed the vitamin c serum was oxidized.  </li>
            <li> I wear make up or not with Dr. Songs products I don&#x27;t worry about acne or rough dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a month now and have used around half the bottle (making the price at current cost $5 a month).  </li>
            <li> Weird because Ive used other serums and never had that issue other then going on smooth.</li>
            <li> Well, it is the only thing that helped with my dark spots!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe my face started to clear up after only 4 days, as I have uneven skin tone and some acne spots from my breakout the other day, but really don&#x27;t usually have acne.    </li>
            <li> I waited at least 5 minutes to allow it time to completely absorb through my skin before applying my nighttime moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I can see this bottle lasting me at least a month with daily use.</li>
            <li> could tell a difference in my skin after only a few applications.</li>
            <li> I looked in the mirror a few minutes later</li>
            <li> Believe me, I went back to Dr. Song&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum after a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be careful.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> Serums seem to have become one of the raging fads in the last few years.</li>
            <li> but because I see my face everyday I can definitely see progress.</li>
            <li> The addition of your regular moisturizer helps to seal the HA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using Dr. Song&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum for a few weeks I can say that my skin is a lot smoother.</li>
            <li> I decided to use it on my face too even though I have pretty sensitive skin and was a little afraid of it being too harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using a few different brands containing less product including an endorsed one...</li>
            <li> After applying my moisturizer, it was not compatible like all the other serums.</li>
            <li> First off, some of the reviews are absolutely fake.</li>
            <li> With all due respect....hard to believe.</li>
            <li> I am one of those weird people who like to know EXACTLY</li>
            <li> Where as other serums can not even come close.</li>
            <li> And like any other Vitamin C Serum it is not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have done peels in the past several days and have used this product, and my skin doesn&#x27;t even appear I took a hit!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not seeing improvement in your skin, it&#x27;s usually because you&#x27;re not exfoliating/protecting your skin properly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Their vitamin C serum is comprised of 20% vitamin C, but also other ingredients which help to restore the health and appearance of aging skin.</li>
            <li> A bit thicker and oilier than other Vitamin C serums I have used,</li>
            <li> I was skeptical a first, but I&#x27;m a believer now.</li>
            <li> about 3 minutes after it dried, it felt sticky and too dry.</li>
            <li> The color of my dark spot was fading.  </li>
            <li> and I hope it will help to eventually even out my dark spots.</li>
            <li> I did notice that my dark spots were a tad bit lighter.  </li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> that is the color of dark urine and the consistency of grape jelly.</li>
            <li> and my dark marks are fading to the point that I don&#x27;t use Concealer anymore</li>
            <li> After a week of testing every other day, the tight feeling stopped, and now I use it every day in the morning under a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My dark spots are minimizing and breakouts seem down.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a difference in Dr. Song&#x27;s vitamin c serum and the others I&#x27;ve tried tho, only apply a thin layer on your face and let it dry and soak in for about 30 minutes before applying a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> So instead of using it twice a day I cut down to once a day.</li>
            <li> Even though this serum has 20% Vitamin C, it seemed a little gentler on my skin than other Vitamin C serums I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I use a small amount in the evening after I wash and dry my face.</li>
            <li> As for dark spots, they are a lot less noticeable.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it stings a little and can be a tad itchy.</li>
            <li> and I had a slight glow to my skin.</li>
            <li> My face slightly swelled it</li>
            <li> This product also firms your skin and makes wrinkles much less visible.  </li>
            <li> Pretty disappointing...</li>
            <li> I feel like my face gets really clean, especially since I workout in my yard a lot, and can get real dirty doing that.  </li>
            <li> When I use the serum, it makes my skin feel tight.</li>
            <li> Your face will feel too tight if you dont.</li>
            <li> After application, my face feels a little tingly and tight..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to pick and roll all the little pieces off</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m seeing a little difference.  </li>
            <li> It also felt as though it had crystallized somewhat, it had little particles, and my face stung when I put it on.</li>
            <li> The serum is a little tacky</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is due to the fact that aloe vera gel is the number 2 ingredient on the list, or if the way this was made makes the difference.  </li>
            <li> , I looked a little sunburned and it stung a little bit too</li>
            <li> I just use a few drops after washing my face.</li>
            <li> I moved to Texas a few years ago</li>
            <li> I can place a few drops in the palm of my hand without it running all over.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone back to trying another company&#x27;s version of Vitamin C Serum with Vitamin E and Aloe Vera Gel, and my face broke out worse.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> Thankfully it did not irritate me, but if your skin is sensitive to added fragrances or chemicals, be wary this one contains some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a few days of use it broke me out.</li>
            <li> Plus it wasn&#x27;t greasy or heavy and didn&#x27;t clog my pores.  </li>
            <li> My skin is brighter, clearer, and firmer after a few days.</li>
            <li> but if my skin can&#x27;t utilize them it&#x27;s a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I used to have an aloe plant (before I killed it like I&#x27;ve killed every plant I&#x27;ve ever had), and I used to use the gooey gel inside the leaves to apply to burns</li>
            <li> a thin layer of Vitamin C Serum daily.</li>
            <li> There is not a scent to this serum and it is clear and very thin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not runny at all, and in fact has a very slight bit of stickiness to it.</li>
            <li> started using it on my forearms because I have pretty bad sun damage to that skin from riding my bike.</li>
            <li> Scars a little slower, but they ARE scars, and are difficult to treat, so I&#x27;m suprised this actually even worked.  </li>
            <li> I found it was a little thick, but it is a serum.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I apply to each area of my face and neck in small amounts.</li>
            <li> I have used vitamin c serum for the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I ordered others for family members, not sure if they will like it...</li>
            <li> You can find recipes, simple and complicated, on the internet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for not more than 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I am shocked people rated this stuff high.</li>
            <li> I hit the wrong button and deleted this long review I already wrote.</li>
            <li> is slowly</li>
            <li> Granted slowly</li>
            <li> It took about 2 days for my skin to stop getting mad at me for using this and is finally starting to show results.</li>
            <li> It is not a good serum.</li>
            <li> Since I have received my serum I have used it twice a day thinly applied (blackheads may form if you put it on too thick</li>
            <li> however, i bought this with the idea of it clearing a few of the dark spots in my face from the sun, and it didn&#x27;t do anything for that :(</li>
            <li> Turned yellow within a week - VERY disappointed with this product - NOT WORTH BUYING</li>
            <li> The uncomfortable sensation usually subsides within 20-30 min.</li>
            <li> The negative reviews seemed weird to me - like they were written by competitors or something.  </li>
            <li> You would think that products with the words &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;acid&amp;#34; in them would be irritating to one&#x27;s skin, but they aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Once upon a time, it seemed that everyone owned a few staples, like cold cream.</li>
            <li> the consistency is thin, at first.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Your wrinkles won&#x27;t get worse with&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took around 2-3 weeks to see some results but at 6 weeks that&#x27;s when I saw dramatic results.</li>
            <li> Sorry Dr. Song, you lost a  customer.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the postage was twice the price.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it broke me out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been u sad information</li>
            <li> wrong-  </li>
            <li> not because the product is awful, but just to balance out a few of the fake 5 star reviews.  </li>
            <li> The bottom line is, if it doesn&#x27;t go bad, you got a fake product.</li>
            <li> I do not believe the 2-3 days reviews below tho that&#x27;s impossible.</li>
            <li> and i have continue to use it like that, without a problem or bad reaction.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> I have never been disappointed with this brand.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product really works not hype</li>
            <li> Awesome product!! its amazing and leaves my skin smooth :)&lt;br /&gt;www. akreviews.com</li>
            <li> made my face smooth.Very happy with the product</li>
            <li> I use a small dab of this serum all over my face and neck, and it works really well with my moisturizer (Olay Regenerist). Keeps my skin super hydrated. The serum does absorbs really quick into the skin which does not give me enough time to smooth it over the remaining parts of my face. Therefore, I apply to each area of my face and neck in small amounts. Also, would like to see the aloe ingredient reduced a bit because it can get a bit tacky. Overall, it is worth using alone or in conjunction with your current moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I;ve only tried the Vitamin C Serum for one week.  I don&#x27;t see a big difference, but yes my skin seems soother.  I will continue to use the product and maybe in a months time I will see some difference.  I really don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m expecting, but we will see.</li>
            <li> Great product, best price available.  I bought it at introductory pricing.  Will buy in future if price remains competitive.</li>
            <li> Truly when I bought it and first used it, it lightened up my face/acne scars so much. ALSO, what a cheap price! However, I realized that after about a month or so it starts to oxidize and lost it&#x27;s effectiveness. Pretty disappointing... so in conclusion, it works! But only for awhile....</li>
            <li> I liked the product while I was using it in the morning.  The color of my dark spot was fading.  But after only used half of the bottle, I noticed the vitamin c serum was oxidized.  The color turned to yellow.  I wish the c serum lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 41 years old skin care junkie and LOVE this serum. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks now and have had GREAT results. I have pretty good skin and hardly no wrinkles but have been fighting melasma for about 10 years. This serum has faded my melasma significantly and I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING from prescription creams to high end and lower end products.</li>
            <li> I can tell a difference in the texture of my face after a couple of weeks..  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have use Dr Song oil for a month, I like how it feels and it gets absorbed really quick, I can not tell if it has made a difference on my skin yet but I will continue to use it, I just purchase another two bottles of it.</li>
            <li> Perfect...except there may be a quality control problem.  First order I received the serum was clear white. Results amazing - redness reduced, tightened skin immediately.  It lasted about a month.  Liking the results, I ordered a second. The second bottle contained a yellow serum, which I understand means the product has aged or oxidized. While I like the results of the product there may be a quality control issue. If I receive another bottle with yellow serum I will be sending it back.</li>
            <li> I really love this serum.  I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about 2 months and my skin feels moisturized, smooth and healthy.  Great product for the price</li>
            <li> I think the long term effects must be positive however in the short term I didn&#x27;t see any obvious changes. I think it&#x27;s just a natural beauty regimine to keep your skin looking good which definitely doesn&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li> Love it! Just bought another one for my mom! Really large bottle and price is great.</li>
            <li> Liked the product.  Easily absorbing.  Not greasy.  The negative reviews seemed weird to me - like they were written by competitors or something.  I suggest you try it and make up your own mind, as it&#x27;s pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> After using a few different brands containing less product including an endorsed one...I chose this and I&#x27;ll continue to use it.  These are the same ingredients as the competition, but you actually get enough to last.  This goes on light, smooth and you only need a small amount to cover the entire face.  The customer service is top notch.</li>
            <li> I have used vitamin c serum for the past 10 years. This one was cheap, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I have tried Timeless and I think it&#x27;s called Skin science, those are very good. This one was not! It went on well, I liked the way it felt until about 3 minutes after it dried, it felt sticky and too dry. It left a film on my face that didn&#x27;t feel like the other vitamin c serums I&#x27;ve used. After applying my moisturizer, it was not compatible like all the other serums. I&#x27;d have to pick and roll all the little pieces off til basically I wiped everything off , if not I&#x27;d be walking around looking like I was shedding. It is not a good serum. Since I already bought it, I will use it in the night when nobody can see it.  I always take in consideration of the high reviews when I buy a product. I am shocked people rated this stuff high.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super thick, 2 drops will cover your face.  But it&#x27;s *clear*.  All the Vitamin C serums I&#x27;ve used are yellowish.  Especially considering they say it contains B-12, B-vitamins are always yellow.  I&#x27;m going to give it a test on my forearms where I have lots of skin damage spots (since I use prescription C+Hydroquinone on face now - was hoping for a more fairly priced alternative...)</li>
            <li> Received the product on time. So, that is why I gave it a 4 star.  I just started using the product, and I haven&#x27;t seen any results.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels so smooth and soft.  I have fewer wrinkles and have even received compliments!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing. No results. Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> Thank you Dr. Song - you are the best!! I was surprised to get triple volume for the price of 1 oz. I am so pleased with your product! It even smells like Vitamin C. And I am so happy with the ingredients you put there. Everything is so natural and essential.</li>
            <li> I finished using 4/5 of the bottle. Honestly it does nothing to my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this at night and when I wake up, this makes my skin younger and gives it glow.  I already bought one for a friend as a gift and she loves it so far too.</li>
            <li> This serum is packed with antioxidants. You can feel it changing the health of your skin for the better as you apply it. Word to the wise us only a drop at a time. I put to much on at once and it got in to my eye, did not feel good, but great on my skin!</li>
            <li> Pores are smaller, skin is brighter, and smoother&lt;br /&gt;there is no discomfort with this product, anyone&lt;br /&gt;can use it comfortably.</li>
            <li> My derm told me to use a vit c serum for anti aging so I picked up this one and I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle.  The results have been great, to the point where my derm also wants to purchase the same vit c serum.</li>
            <li> Dr. Song&#x27;s 20% Vitamin C + E Hyaluronic Acid Serum LAUNCH SALE!! is just as good as all his products. Dr. Songs line is definitely a sure thing if you want beautiful smooth skin. It did take a few days to have that smooth affect but its visible and weather I wear make up or not with Dr. Songs products I don&#x27;t worry about acne or rough dry skin. I have my family members using his products also and they are now seeing great results. Beautiful skin starts with quality products. Hopefully that this lunch price stays this way a little longer so that I can purchase more this week at this great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  thank you&lt;br /&gt;  G.Kelley</li>
            <li> I used this serum as recommended by my doctor after getting a CO2 laser treatment, and it helped restore my skin back to normal, while keeping it soft and shrinking pores.  I&#x27;m so happy with the the results, I&#x27;ve added it to my daily routine even after completely healing.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but It seems to be very effective.  After about 2 weeks, using a small amount once a day, it has softened and smoothed my skin considerably -  and I actually noticed a difference almost from the first day.  Also they ship very promptly and the price seems reasonable compared to other products of this type.  I wouldn&#x27;t call it a mircle - yet - but I&#x27;m a vey satisfied customer so far.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and this serum works out perfectly. It absorbs quickly and is light, but still moisturizes. This is important, since i don&#x27;t want oily spots on my face. Very impressed with the results on wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Was sent right on time with instuctions, very nice. Not oily feels good on my face. Have not used this producet long enough yet (one Week) but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Very effective.&lt;br /&gt;FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS!!!!&lt;br /&gt;A great product.  I have never been disappointed with this brand. Everything Ive tried has been excellent</li>
            <li> I would recommend this so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product works great, nothing bad about it, and is truly amazing. A 5 star rating for me all the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product again! Goodluck with sales.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this brand a try, after not being very happy with the last brand I tried. The  difference is night and day.&lt;br /&gt;This one leaves my skin very soft, while the other one was just sticky. And most important of all, my pores are getting noticeably smaller.</li>
            <li> My pores have shrunk and my skin is overall much better.  Definitely notice a difference.  Also, the serum came fresh, which you can tell by if the gel is clear.  If its yellow, then it means its beginning to degrade, although still usable, which I have had a problem with receiving degraded serum in the past from other vitamin c serum brands, even the more expensive ones, so I was pleasantly happy to get a fresh product from Dr Song.</li>
            <li> I use it on s scar that I have and I&#x27;m seeing a little difference.  Hopefully it works</li>
            <li> Loving this launch sale and ordered an extra bottle, because I find it to be a very good product. The company as well is very nice to work with. I order teeth whitener as well and the light didn&#x27;t work and they sent me a new one without any hassle (twice) that works! Awesome products with awesome service is a winner in my book.</li>
            <li> just started using this - but it feels like it really works! can t wait to see the results soon</li>
            <li> All i have to say is that this is amazing.  If you have brown spots and large pores this is for you!  I used it for a week now and can really see the difference!!!  I am now a fan of Dr Song&#x27;s products</li>
            <li> I loved Dr. Song when I first tried it, the benzoyl peroxide and hyaluronic acid were great, but they changed them. I don&#x27;t know if this product was changed because it is my first time trying it but I don&#x27;t like it. It made me break out. In the trash it goes. I ordered others for family members, not sure if they will like it... Sorry Dr. Song, you lost a  customer. I also realized after I ordered the product that most of the great reviews are fake!</li>
            <li> I have used it only for 3days, it worked really good, I have blemish a lot around cheeks, I used Borghese green mask to clean, though it worked,not totally. And  it come back the next day. However this product give me the new face without blemish in 3days, I am so excited. I should buy it earlier.</li>
            <li> Good product. Fast shipping. Thaks</li>
            <li> I ordered Dr. Song 20% vitamin c serum, and it arrived very quickly.  I have been using the product as directed for a couple weeks now, and have already noticed that my complexion is brighter and more even.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I hit the wrong button and deleted this long review I already wrote. Argh!!!! Maybe it&#x27;s the universe telling me to shorten it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just so you know, I did not buy this product, but hopefully can give you guidance anyway.  First off, some of the reviews are absolutely fake. I found some reviews had long strings of text with verbatim accolades, despite the users having different names and supposedly being \\&quot;verified\\&quot; purchasers. Also, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen so many reviewers having so many scars that they are treating with this product. With all due respect....hard to believe. Ok, but is the product any good?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conceptually this is a great product. Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid offer great benefit to the skin. It can be used every night (but not during the day because it degrades in sunlight).  It needs to be kept in a dark medicine cabinet, or BETTER, kept refrigerated. It doesn&#x27;t last more than a month or so even under perfect conditions because Vitamin C oxidizes in the presence of oxygen and light, rendering it useless. If your product turns yellow, sigh and throw it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are ambitious, you can make this serum yourself, but the initial cost for the bulk ingredients might seem costly. You can find recipes, simple and complicated, on the internet. I am one of those weird people who like to know EXACTLY what&#x27;s in my food and beauty products, so I make the time.  If you buy the pre-made version offered by Dr. Song, be prepared to re-buy regularly if you like it.  The bottom line is, if it doesn&#x27;t go bad, you got a fake product. Bummer, but true.  I am giving this product 1 star...not because the product is awful, but just to balance out a few of the fake 5 star reviews.  Dr. Song should rely on the product for reviews, not artificially pump up his stats.  Hope my advice helps you.</li>
            <li> Wow.. This actually works!!! I&#x27;m seeing a reduction in old acne marks, acne pigmentation, very slight working in scars. I have used this for 7 weeks. It took around 2-3 weeks to see some results but at 6 weeks that&#x27;s when I saw dramatic results. I do not believe the 2-3 days reviews below tho that&#x27;s impossible. This is the best serum I have come across. Great product, don&#x27;t like the packaging tho it should be in a plastic bump bottle not a glass because I take it around to travel and its heavy and afraid itll drop. I highly recommend. I bought this when it was $4.95. I hope there is that special again I really like this product. Trying out others like their BP gel will give reviews shortly.&lt;br /&gt;Thank-You Dr. Song!</li>
            <li> could tell a difference in my skin after only a few applications.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this, from the first application felt the difference and just as quickly saw it as well. Have used Vit C serum before but nothing as good as this one, have already ordered a second bottle so I don&#x27;t run out! update- am still using this Vit C serum morning and night, really cant say enough about it, I always make sure I have more on hand as I don&#x27;t want to run out! The other morning I had a real good look at my face without makeup and was genuinely surprised at how even the skin tone is, this really does the job. Other brands are twice as much at least and are no where near as good, so definitely worth trying, especially if you are new to Vit C serum or have tried others and aren&#x27;t impressed, this one works!</li>
            <li> I love both of the serums. Do I put them on day or night</li>
            <li> I just received the serum and it comes in a beautiful frosted glass bottle. With a glass dropper. I got a lot more than I though. The bottle looked kind of small on here but it&#x27;s a nice size bottle for the price. I used it this morning and it soaks into the skin like a dream! I am multiracial &amp; have very oily/acne prone skin. I looked in the mirror a few minutes later and I had a slight glow to my skin. Not oily, just glowy . So far I&#x27;m loving the packaging &amp; if the first use is an indication of what this product is going to be like, it just might be my holy grail . I would recommend it .</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I suffer from large pores and uneven skin tone. Almost immediately I noticed a big difference in my skins appearance.  I&#x27;ve spent so much money on other products and I&#x27;m so excited to have finally found something that actually works, and I use a light moisturizer and I feel this product almost like boosts the effects of my moisturizer. I&#x27;ve never been complimented so much on my skin!</li>
            <li> I bought this item in a \\&quot;launch sale\\&quot;. Shipping did not take too long. When the product first arrived I was very impressed! It had a great, smooth texture and went on beautifully. It was very moisturizing and felt great on my face. My skin looked really good after applying this and sleeping on it. The color was barely yellow; the company assured me that this was the color of the vitamin E.    The product began turning more and more yellow, though, a sign of oxidization. By around the 4 week mark, it was a  bright neon yellow. It also felt as though it had crystallized somewhat, it had little particles, and my face stung when I put it on. The company refunded my purchase price when I contacted them.    I am torn WRT whether to buy it again or not. It worked very well until suddenly it didn&#x27;t. I am concerned about how it might be damaged during shipping while the weather is hot now.    ETA: Dr. Song assured me that another order would do okay in the heat. So I ordered another bottle. This one is very different. The packaging is not the same, and while the bottle says that it is 20% vitamin C with hyaluronic acid, hyaluronic acid is NOT listed in the ingredients list. This product also feels different than the first one I had, it is less thick and it does not have the same skin-tightening effect, or the same slight tingle when I apply it.</li>
            <li> Prompt excellent service.  So far the product seems to be working as promised but I haven&#x27;t been using it quite long enough  to know the end results. My skin definitely seems smoother and fuller.</li>
            <li> Great product. Great price. Will definitely order again. Already seeing results in reducing redness.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C serums are the only thing that has done anything for my wrinkles and has worked well for me so far.  Using Dr Song&#x27;s serum was no exception, as it spread easily and absorbed quickly into my skin.  The price is the kicker, as it can&#x27;t be beat for the value you get.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time I just started using it so I hope to see good results. Not too sure how to use though I didn&#x27;t see any instructions. I just use a few drops after washing my face.</li>

            <li> This is a lovely product which comes in an impressive, fun, and delightful little blue bottle.  The serum dropper is another pleasant feature to use; helps to eliminate unnecessary waste of this precious serum product. You can dole out with precision how many drops you desire to apply.  The price is super fantastic.  This serum product is smooth, silky, and absorbs excellently into the skin. I have super sensitive skin.  My skin resulted in a healthy glow. I follow the serum by using an excellent moisturizer as recommended.  I highly recommend this fascinating product to help you achieve your best face forward!  Joy to the skin!</li>
            <li> Well, it is the only thing that helped with my dark spots! I use it on my hands too! I just ordered and received 2 more bottles when I did not finish the first one because I do not want to run out of it. I moved to Texas a few years ago and I did not use proper sunscreen creme. The sun damage on both of my cheeks was considerable looking at the pictures and I started to try natural products as I am not a fan of too may chemicals. This works! I will buy it again and I hope the price will not go too high!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I will always buy it and use it.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical when I received a clear bottle and not the image posted for sale but kindly the customer service rep informed me that the clear bottle was UV coated. Since I have received my serum I have used it twice a day thinly applied (blackheads may form if you put it on too thick, I made that mistake in the beginning) right after I wash my face and the results have been amazing. The serum is a little tacky so if you add sunscreen or additional moisturizer to your routine you should wait 15mins for it to dry. Note I also keep mine in the refrigerator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have Asian skin that easily tans, slight acne that always leaves scars and I have developed some Melasma on my cheeks. My skin has done a 360; my scars have lightened and seem to be diminishing, skin texture has a dewy glow and my Melasma on my cheeks is slowly fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was contemplating making my own Vitamin C serum but the price for the combination of Vitamin C Serum with Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin E was worth the gamble and my time of not having to buy all the ingredients, bottling and worrying about the Vitamin C aspect quickly deteriorating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I will try the product again if the price doesn&#x27;t go up too much post launch sale and my only wish was that it qualified for Prime.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to receive this product for review and I am very happy to have it! The serum feels SO nice on my skin - I feel like I want to slather it on day and night (not kidding). As with many vitamin C serums, it can leave you feeling a little sticky, but I just put my normal moisturizer over it and then it&#x27;s no longer a problem. I use this nightly before bed and I hope it will help to eventually even out my dark spots. So far, so good!</li>
            <li> Dr. Song Vitamin C Serum is just that. A Serum.  Not water. Not liquid that is similar to water. A Serum.  I&#x27;m not sure if it is due to the fact that aloe vera gel is the number 2 ingredient on the list, or if the way this was made makes the difference.  In any case, I like the serum.  I can place a few drops in the palm of my hand without it running all over.  When I apply it to my face I feel like I have more control rather than trying to clean up the drips from other Vitamin C Serums.  And like any other Vitamin C Serum it is not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for the Hyaluronic Acid reaction.  Yes, my face broke out, again.  This time only on my chin, and this time it only lasted for about 5 days.  So, is my face adjusting to the hyaluronic acid, or is Dr. Song&#x27;s product actually better?  I&#x27;ve gone back to trying another company&#x27;s version of Vitamin C Serum with Vitamin E and Aloe Vera Gel, and my face broke out worse.  Believe me, I went back to Dr. Song&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum after a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benefits of Vitamin C Serum include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;encouraging collagen production&lt;br /&gt;exfoliates and cleanses&lt;br /&gt;helps remove fine lines and wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;great for those with acne or pimples&lt;br /&gt;moisturizes and softens the skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Routine for using the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wash and cleanse skin&lt;br /&gt;Tone Skin&lt;br /&gt;Apply Vitamin C Serum with Hyaluronic Acid&lt;br /&gt;Apply moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product. My face feels smoother and softer.  My wrinkles are fading away. I feel like my face gets really clean, especially since I workout in my yard a lot, and can get real dirty doing that.  This is truly a serum in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product free in exchange for my honest opinion.[[ASIN:B00ELN94GS LAUNCH SALE!!! Dr Song 20% Vitamin C Serum with Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin E]]</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK.  Been using for almost a month. Haven&#x27;t seen much difference.  Be careful. It has a tendency to dry your face.  Only use once a day.</li>
            <li> I use this under moisturizer.  It&#x27;s one of my go-to skin care products.  I love that it has all three of the ingredients I want in one product.  I&#x27;m stocking up on this while it&#x27;s still on sale for $9.99!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say if this did anything. I&#x27;ve not seen anything different in my face. I use it after I microneedle roller my face. Maybe it&#x27;s not often enough? It did come quickly.</li>
            <li> it went on like gloss, you can actually feel  it working on your tried old skin. Refreshing it to a nice glow and looking new again. I finally got my rosy checks back . I recommend this product to those that want to refresh there skin, and want a glowing complexion. I would definably buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I love this product and the information on how to use it was excellent! I will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> This made my skin looked so healthy! I love vitamin c serum for my face! This is awesome!</li>
            <li> I am HUGE fan of Vitamin C Serum and I love this one from Dr Song.  They sent me a bottle to review for my GlamRiver blog and I am so happy they did.  I have been using it for a few weeks now and I already notice some spots fading and I love that it is good for all skin types since I have oily skin.  I can&#x27;t wait to see how much better my skin looks after even more use!</li>
            <li> Great product! My skin has definitely improve... it looks radiant, and healthy, soft! however, i bought this with the idea of it clearing a few of the dark spots in my face from the sun, and it didn&#x27;t do anything for that :( I don&#x27;t know about been a product for wrinkles since i am only 23 years old. Also, it oxidizes a little fast, 2 weeks after having the product it started to turn yellow, it has a champagne color and i have continue to use it like that, without a problem or bad reaction. Overall, a great product, wish it didn&#x27;t oxidize that fast, since i keep it in a dry storage place and away from the light.</li>
            <li> I really like this skin care need to have bigger bottles .  Doesn&#x27;t go very far</li>
            <li> Excellent product! This, in conjunction with the lactic acid peel, has left my skin glowing. You would think that products with the words &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;acid&amp;#34; in them would be irritating to one&#x27;s skin, but they aren&#x27;t. And, I have rosacea. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C Serums are a staple in my skin care routine. Not only do they make my skin so soft by helping my moisturizer absorb better into my skin, but they also significantly help control acne and fade acne scars and sun damage that I acquired during my teenage years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Song Vitamin C Serum contains Vitamin E and hyaluronic acid to nourish your skin even more. This did not break me out or feel sticky or tacky on my skin; it&#x27;s a new favorite of mine! Like all serums, it should always be followed with a moisturizer (lotion, cream, emulsion, what have you) and should be used consistently for visible results. Skin care is like weight management; just like you can&#x27;t exercise once and expect to lose a lot of weight, you also can&#x27;t use a product once and expect it to change your face overnight. With patience and healthy skin practices (drinking lots of water, getting moderate exercise, not using pore-clogging skin care products, etc.) Dr. Song&#x27;s serum will make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use vitamin C twice a day—once in the morning and once in the evening—and one full size 1 oz. bottle generally lasts me two months. A pretty good deal for a $15 product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is the added fragrance. There are many vitamin C serums out there that are all-natural and contain no added fragrances, but this one does contain some (the last ingredient). Thankfully it did not irritate me, but if your skin is sensitive to added fragrances or chemicals, be wary this one contains some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FTC Disclosure: I received a complimentary sample of this Vitamin C serum from Dr. Song in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I was neither paid nor sponsored for my opinions—positive or otherwise—and all thoughts reflected in this review are solely my own.</li>
            <li> Turned yellow within a week - VERY disappointed with this product - NOT WORTH BUYING</li>
            <li> I use Dr. Song Vitamin C every day and can see that my face is so much smother, and the fine lines in my face are almost gone. Recommend this</li>
            <li> The order arrived promptly and the product was exactly as described.  The price was reasonable.  You really do only need one drop.  It is too soon to notice any results but Iike it as my skin feels soft after using it.  I would buy Dr Song products again.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and as described. Great serum. Already see results after 2 weeks! Take advantage of the intro price; worth more! ♡ it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s working, trying clear up my dark marks, no difference</li>
            <li> I like this serum, the price was exellent. Unfortunately the postage was twice the price.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for several days, and the results have been immediate. I noticed my skin is smoother, more plump, and supple. I am a veteran peeler, so for me, I need products that are high-quality, not too harsh, and that help my skin recover quickly as I am a teacher. I have done peels in the past several days and have used this product, and my skin doesn&#x27;t even appear I took a hit! I am definitely buying this again very soon before I move back overseas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice that has nothing to do with the efficacy of this product: Chemically exfoliate often, and make sure to use a 50+ UVA/UVB broad spectrum sunscreen! If you&#x27;re not seeing improvement in your skin, it&#x27;s usually because you&#x27;re not exfoliating/protecting your skin properly. It&#x27;s no use using high-quality products if your home routine is mediocre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely recommend Dr. Song&#x27;s line with or without the sale.</li>
            <li> It is a gel rather than a serum, you have to rub it between your fingers to break it up for a minute before you put it on your face but it works really well. It should be packaged in a tube rather than the little bottle with the dropper, but apart from that issue it is a great product. It made my face much brighter and even-toned. I will re-purchase and continue to use.</li>
            <li> Works great with a dermal roller.  Really helps clear up face and reduce pore size. I highly reccomend and would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Ordered my second bottle of this, love it.I had a large adaptor on my check for over 10 years, after a bottle of this, it&#x27;s gone!!! Couldn&#x27;t say enough about this product, love it highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> This serum has good ingredients but unfortunately it broke me out. I have previously used a magnesium ascrobyl phosphate serum (less potent form of vitamin c) without a problem. I would recommend doing a patch test if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different brands of Vitamin C Serum and this is one that I like the most. It isn&#x27;t very watery like most other serums that I&#x27;ve tried. I think perhaps it may just have a higher percentage of hyaluronic acid in it.&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s great about that is the fact that it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out at all. It doesn&#x27;t tingle, itch, or irritate my skin at all. I also don&#x27;t feel the need to use additional hyaluronic acid afterward like I normally do with most of my Vitamin C Serums. I love Vitamin C Serum because it works so well on your skin. Ever since I started using vitamin c serums my complexion has changed A LOT.&lt;br /&gt;More about this product in particular---I love the dropper top since it makes it super easy to dispense onto my hand. I also am happy that it came in a pretty blue glass bottle because it will definitely keep light from getting in too well. (Too much light getting in can destroy it&#x27;s life span, and I would hate that!)&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product that I&#x27;m glad that I now own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a product tester I received a free bottle of Dr Song Vitamin C Serum in exchange for my honest review. All opinions expressed are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Works great for my skin.  I love it!  Not greasy at all and my pores look tighter only after using for a week!  I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after a month!</li>
            <li> Amazing serum. I&#x27;ve tried so many other products before and this one is the best. I keep it in my fridge and use it under my moisturizer. My face literally saw improvements immediately. My skin was much brighter and moisturized. I look forward to long term results.</li>
            <li> Skin care is really a changing field. Once upon a time, it seemed that everyone owned a few staples, like cold cream. There were not a ton of options, and certainly people’s individual skin needs were not seen as important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now skin care is really an emerging field for scientific research. It’s not just a matter of putting a pretty looking package together, people want to know that what they put on their face is actually backed up by hard science. We know what kinds of things contribute to aging skin, now companies are racing to create products which help to mitigate the effects of pollution, UV exposure, smoking, stress, and genetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Science is the principle which underlies Dr. Song’s Vitamin C Serum. Dr Song Medical is a medical cosmetic laboratory that originally manufactured products for professionals, doctors, and medical facilities. Their products are manufactured in the U.S., and are all fully FDA compliant. They adhere to strict quality control procedures, so that you can be assured that what is on their labels is actually in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their vitamin C serum is comprised of 20% vitamin C, but also other ingredients which help to restore the health and appearance of aging skin. These ingredients include: vitamin E, aloe vera and hyaluronic acid. Vitamins C and E are known anti-oxidants which help to reverse the effects of damaging free radicals to the skin. Hyaluronic acid is a natural substance which is known to decline in aging skin; using this ingredient in a topical formulation helps to restore the fullness to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this serum for approximately 3 weeks and have been very happy with it. I use a small amount in the evening after I wash and dry my face. The serum is dispensed using an glass eye dropper. It is a fairly viscous liquid, so I rubbed it quickly between my hands to increase its temperature and decrease its viscosity, and then I applied it to my entire face and neck. I waited at least 5 minutes to allow it time to completely absorb through my skin before applying my nighttime moisturizer. Despite its texture, I didn’t find this serum to be overly sticky. It seemed to absorb very nicely through my skin, and it didn’t leave any residue. Also despite the label which indicated that it contained a fragrance, I didn’t detect any noticeable scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.d at least 5 minutes to allow it time to completely absorb through my skin before applying my nighttime moisturizer. Despite its texture, I didn’t find this serum to be overly sticky. It seemed to absorb very nicely through my skin, and it didn’t leave any residue. Also despite the label which indicated that it contained a fragrance, I didn’t detect any noticeable scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> I got the feeling from reading some other reviews that I was reading a company promo -same wording and so forth.  I wanted to give an unbiased scoop for those considering this product.  I have used this for a month now and have used around half the bottle (making the price at current cost $5 a month).  My scars were not erased, my pores did not go back to pre-teen smoothness and my wrinkles did not part like the Red Sea.  In fact, I had no noticeable change in those areas.  I did notice that my dark spots were a tad bit lighter.  More impressively, the product made my skin look healthier.  I notice it particularly right under my eyes - it looks smoother.  I am pretty fickle with skin products, but I plan to use this product for at least another month.  It is a decent product with excellent customer support who emailed me more often than my relatives.</li>
            <li> It worked better and faster than I expected. The fine lines near my eyes are gone and my under eye area is brighter! Also, the skin around my eyes seems firmer on the days that I use the serum. I definitely would recommend this serum to anyone looking for a good anti aging product. I&#x27;m buying some for family members now.</li>
            <li> I have tried out a lot of different Vitamin C serums and my opinion of them was that they did not benefit me at all. That is until I tried Dr. Song&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum. Finally, I have found a serum that fades the redness and sun spots on my face. I do not have any wrinkles or scars so I can not say if this serum will help those problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a serum that makes you skin feel softer, have a soft glow, and be less red than try out this serum. It is A LOT cheaper than some of the other serums I have tried and has benefited my skin more than the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the packaging of the bottle. It is very easy to read and looks like a premium product. The dropper is perfect in dispensing the right amount of serum into your hand. Most importantly though this actually FEELS like a serum. Most Vitamin C &amp;#34;serums&amp;#34; I have tried were very liquidy. This feels like a serum and rubs in smoothly, but do not rub too long or it will produce some suds!</li>
            <li> Been using this for almost a month now, and can already notice a difference in the complexion of the skin and have even been commented on it.  I would and will repurchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really loving what this does to my skin. I use it every night with a retinal hyaluronic acid cream and my skin has never looked better. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product!! Goes very smoothly and absolve fast. No sensitive after use. It&#x27;s been only week to use it but skin feel smooth and slightly lighten my brown spot. It is wonderful serum and great price.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my skin!  I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> product arrived without any problems and I have been happy with it in the short time I have been using it</li>
            <li> I enjoy the results of of using this product. My only complaint is that it stings a little and can be a tad itchy. The uncomfortable sensation usually subsides within 20-30 min. My skin does feel tighter and softer after using it, Since it has a tendency to dry the skin, I use it just about every 2 days. I find that the skin on my neck does not react well to this serum, it really dries the skin out in that area.</li>
            <li> This serum is great for removing discolorations and stopping new ones from forming. I noticed my skin has looked more brighter and plumper looking whereas before it was kind of dull. When using this I like to mix it in with my moisturizer to enhance my overall experience. I recommend this to anyone looking for a more even skin tone and I will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I have been using the serum for 2 weeks. I usually clean my face, and then apply a few drops to my face and neck in the morning. The serum has a gel-like thin texture and absorbs really fast, so I apply moisturizer almost right after the serum. I’m really surprised that this serum gives me immediate result. My skin looks brighter and firmer after a week!!! I don’t have fine lines yet, so I’m not sure how it works towards wrinkles and fine lines. I did see some online reviews that it works great on those too. I’m happy with this product so far and will continue to use it as my skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;(I got a free sample to try out this product)</li>
            <li> It came so fast in the mail. It.s a product so good for your skin and Dr. Song is the bomb :) his items are so super inexpensive that why would you not buy them? Everyone else is charging 40 and 50.00 or more..spas are 100.00 for these products that he sells for 9.99. I love it and I keep going back to Dr. Song for products for my face. Heck, you spend more than 9.99 at McDonald.s :-)</li>
            <li> Great product, my skin is having the humidity it needs</li>
            <li> I like this serum.  A bit thicker and oilier than other Vitamin C serums I have used, but it feels wonderful going on and afterward, skin feels moisturized and looks dewy.  Although the serum seems to absorb fast, I use it as part of my night routine, since I worry my face could look oily/shiny if used in the mornings.  I am very happy with the results, but I can&#x27;t scientifically say it will eliminate wrinkles or scars.  I will definitely continue to use and will repurchase before the introductory price goes up...</li>
            <li> Very pleased!  Fast service!</li>
            <li> Outstanding product! I&#x27;ve been using it for not more than 2 weeks and it not only felt excellent since it was applied for the first time!  The restorative effect is instant, my face is starting to show great changes! Love it !&lt;br /&gt;Iris Sanchez&lt;br /&gt;Miramar, FL</li>
            <li> This serum is awesome, clinical strength and really hydrates and smooths lines...they are fading and smooting !!  Will definately buy again :)))</li>
            <li> I am a huge believer in taking care of my skin, even though I am young, its never too early to give it some TLC! That&#x27;s exactly what I get from using this Dr Song Vitamin C Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot comment about what it does for wrinkles, age spots, etc since I don&#x27;t have those. I am using this as a bit of a supplement for my skin. I use this about 3-4 times a week before bed on a freshly cleansed face. A small amount goes a long way. I dot it in 5 places on my face (forehead, nose, chin, and both cheeks. I gently give myself a face massage, using the serum as my slip, and working it into my skin. I have somewhat sensitive skin, and I have never had any issues with this at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I haven&#x27;t noticed any life changing results while using this, except that my skin just seems to be more radiant and glowing. It has that healthy youthful appearance. I am happy with it thus far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> This came fast. Cute dark blue bottle and a dropper attached to it. Customer service was awesome and gave me a coupon off  on my next order. The only thing about this serum was it was very sticky in my hands and when I patted it on my clean face it became soapy like. Weird because Ive used other serums and never had that issue other then going on smooth. It took a bit to dry. After a few days of use it broke me out. So instead of using it twice a day I cut down to once a day. But it still kepted on breaking me out. I couldn&#x27;t even finish the bottle. Too sensitive for my face I suppose.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. My dark spots are minimizing and breakouts seem down.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  Really made my skin feel smooth and silky.  My skin has been lacking moisture lately and I&#x27;ve been noticing more fine lines.  Dr. Songs made my skin feel hydrated and renewed.  Plus it wasn&#x27;t greasy or heavy and didn&#x27;t clog my pores.  It was light and fresh and felt natural.  I would definitely continue to use this product!  Check out my full review at TheBeeHiveBuzz dot com!</li>
            <li> My Dr Song product arrived quickly and I appreciate the email instructions I received prior to it&#x27;s delivery. I&#x27;ve been using the product for a week now and some results are visible. But I&#x27;d really love to review this product again after the 30 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for one week, but I believe I&#x27;ve already seen a difference!  My fine lines look better.</li>
            <li> Good serum, absorbed to my skin quickly not greasy.  Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> its great i love it moisturizes and my skin is improving</li>
            <li> I have tried two bottles of this now, and here&#x27;s my review:&lt;br /&gt;It is a good product, and I do see results almost immediately. My skin is brighter, clearer, and firmer after a few days. There is no scent and the consistency is thin, at first.&lt;br /&gt;The major drawback is the shelf life, though. You really only get about 4 weeks of quality use out of a bottle. Around that 4-week mark, the color starts to yellow and the consistency thickens. I have a bottle that&#x27;s about 3 months old that is the color of dark urine and the consistency of grape jelly. Unusable. I store it tightly in a medicine cabinet, so it is not exposed to light or heat, and only oxygen when I open it in the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;So use it fast! Slather it on your face, neck, decolletage, because there&#x27;s no sense rationing it when it expires so quickly. This bottle is truly a one-month supply.</li>
            <li> I actually won this product in a blog giveaway and I don&#x27;t think I would have ever tried it otherwise, but now I&#x27;m hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using it on my forearms because I have pretty bad sun damage to that skin from riding my bike. So that was my main concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a few days it made my skin seem lighter (even though I don&#x27;t think skin lightening is one of the things it&#x27;s supposed to do) and just overall younger and healthier looking. I was really surprised how well it was working so I looked up some info about hyaluronic acid and found out that it&#x27;s actually used on burns to help people heal faster. So it kinda makes sense that it would help my sun-damaged skin heal too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After being amazed at how well it was working on my arms I decided to use it on my face too even though I have pretty sensitive skin and was a little afraid of it being too harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it does make the skin on my face red and a little irritated when I first put it on. But a lot of products do that for me because my skin is so sensitive. But after the redness goes away it really seems like my skin looks better. It just looks overall healthier, smoother and softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on before I go to bed and the redness is long gone by morning. And I honestly feel like every morning I wake up after using it my skin looks better.</li>
            <li> Love it. love this vitamin C, it is really helpful. it keeps my face shine and bright, and everyone noticed changes. Thank you</li>
            <li> This product is new for me and I like it, but will know more after I use it for about 6-8 weeks.  Since I am a senior with wrinkles to work on, I am looking forward to seeing some positive results!</li>
            <li> Smooth skin not much else.</li>
            <li> Smooth serum feels good to apply</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month. When I use the serum, it makes my skin feel tight. I use once a day. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan, its very sticky and it makes it very hard for me to be able to layer this with other products. It works and is a good price, just for me doesnt fit my needs properly.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how great this product is!  It WORKS.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C serum gives my skin Life. I have only been using this product for 4 days and trust me when I say I have already seen improvements. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give full ratings is because I want to use it for a longer period to see the full effect of the serum. But, so far it&#x27;s good...I have also been using a Moisturizer which seem to work very well with it, I&#x27;m not sure which of the products has the greater effect on my skin as I started using both products at the same time and it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;m using both.  Well thinking about it I have change my skin regime and so I think all the products are working perfectly together and providing real good results. I can&#x27;t believe my face started to clear up after only 4 days, as I have uneven skin tone and some acne spots from my breakout the other day, but really don&#x27;t usually have acne.    I can&#x27;t wait to see what my face looks like after a month, I&#x27;ll check you posted.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quicker than expected. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 10 days. My skin feels smoother and more supple.</li>
            <li> This product is very good, the best for wrinkle protection that I have used.  Even for the corners&lt;br /&gt;of the mouth it helps to minimize or hold things as they are.  Your wrinkles won&#x27;t get worse with&lt;br /&gt;this product and some will be minimized.  Highly recommended !</li>
            <li> I used to use a $100 serum from my spa, but now, I&#x27;ve moved away and am going to keep using Dr Song&#x27;s. I was skeptical a first, but I&#x27;m a believer now.</li>
            <li> The only thing that has worked for my wrinkles! I buy this for everyone whenever I have the chance to gift something, and they all love it and ask me where to get more.</li>
            <li> I bought this product together with the hyaluronic acid. The vitamin c product was too strong for my skin and caused stinging and redness. The hyaluronic acid seems to be ok so far - I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of weeks but my skin does seem to feel softer. Would recommend the hyaluronic acid but not the vitamin c if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered Dr.Song&#x27;s vitamin c serum and I haven&#x27;t used it very long but I&#x27;m starting to see a difference in my skin. I had several lines on my neck and lines between my eyebrows and they are starting to soften! Yes! There&#x27;s a difference in Dr. Song&#x27;s vitamin c serum and the others I&#x27;ve tried tho, only apply a thin layer on your face and let it dry and soak in for about 30 minutes before applying a moisturizer. I&#x27;m impressed with the results so far and I will share my results on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit of a cosmetic junky and have tried almost, if not all vitamin C serums and this one is definitely up there with the favorites and the great price doesn&#x27;t hurt at all either. The serum is fresh, which you can tell by the color.  Vitamin C serum is clear when first made and turns into a yellow over time as it degrades (vitamin C degrades very quickly). Also, its light but not too light, to the point where it just feels like water and not doing anything.</li>
            <li> This together with some phytoceramides tablets, has improved my skin overnight! It not greasy, it&#x27;s like the consistency of aloe vera. I even put it on my arms, cause my skin is thinning there, and on a surgical scar on my ankle. I can see an improvement.</li>
            <li> I tested the ph level as soon as I received the product. Ideally you need a 3.5 for the serum to be effective for your skin. Ph level for this product was 7. May be good ingredients but if my skin can&#x27;t utilize them it&#x27;s a waste of time and money. Too bad.</li>
            <li> Works great on face, notice better appearance right away. If you want a tighter smoother skin this is for you, minutes after applying you can .feel the serum working. I also apply a cream over this after it dries. Smoother and better appearance, reduces wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I received this about a week ago, and after my first use I seemed to have a small reaction to it. My face slightly swelled it the areas I applied it, I looked a little sunburned and it stung a little bit too which is why I waited to post my review until I was able to evaluate it the best as possible.  My first impression, yes I know It sounds silly, but the blue bottle is really pretty! Lol... Also, I love the dropper for the bottle. It dispenses a small controllable amount perfect for using applying in the areas where I need it. I can see how easily using this Vitamin C Serum can fit into my morning routine. After a few minutes it had fully absorbed into my skin, so I went ahead and applied my usual moisturizer and make up. It took about 2 days for my skin to stop getting mad at me for using this and is finally starting to show results. Although I did have a reaction to it, I did notice a much softer feel to my face first time using it. Now after several days I have noticed a minimal shrinkage in the pores on my cheeks and a more even fuller tone under my eyes where they usually sink in like I haven&#x27;t slept in days lol. I am very anxious to see just how well this works after a month.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product is definitely worth trying out. The ingredients and wide ranging benefits are not age specific, so it is great to try at any age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided in exchange for review. All stated above is 100 % personal opinion.</li>
            <li> I bought this looking for a cheaper alternative to the more expensive brands, and found that it works just as well.  Great buy.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It gives my skin a nice plumping effect and makes my skin silky smooth.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a month, so not sure about the long term effects, but even so, its still worth it</li>
            <li> I purchased this Vitamin C not expecting miracles. But I am very happy with the results I see so far. Being older now, I have wrinkles, scars and large pores. My skin feels smoother and I can see a visible improvement in overall complexion.</li>
            <li> I love this serum! I use it twice a day under my moisturizer. It plumps up my skin and minimizes my crowed feet.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing I&#x27;ve been u sad information it for two weeks and my dark marks are fading to the point that I don&#x27;t use Concealer anymore I will order the twin pack next</li>
            <li> Serums seem to have become one of the raging fads in the last few years. Now it isn&#x27;t enough to have a day lotion, a night cream, an eye cream, a BB cream, a CC cream--ARGH! Yeah, it&#x27;s enough to make a girl scream, reach for the only cream she really wants  (the kind that comes from her buddies Ben and Jerry) and just decide to let her skin age without any intervention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why should we add another step to our already overwhelming beauty routines? Are these serums really worth the time? Personally, I think they are. They&#x27;re a way to deliver vitamins and nutrients directly to the skin in a purer, more easily absorbed form than most creams allow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one I tried out for this post is Dr Song&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum. It comes in a beautiful cobalt blue glass bottle that reminds me of old time medicine shops with their tinctures and remedies lined up gleaming in the windows. It has a glass dropper for precise application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a huge list of ingredients, and the main ones are easily recognizable. This serum contains a huge 20% of Vitamin C, boosted with Aloe, Vitamin E and Hyaluronic Acid and Jojoba Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m pretty careful about what I use- for instance, I can break out if a poison ivy plant just looks at me wrong-  but I didn&#x27;t experience any problems with this serum. In fact, from the first use it left my skin feeling velvety soft to the touch. I kept catching myself running my fingers across my cheek, admiring how soft it was. So that could be an issue, people will think you&#x27;re a weirdo. ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr Song originally manufactured their products for professionals, doctors, and medical facilities, so this serum has been through more rigorous testing than most beauty products available to the public. Their products are made in the USA and they offer a one year refund policy- you don&#x27;t even have to return the product. If you aren&#x27;t happy they will simply refund your money. You girls know I love a company that stands by their products!know I love a company that stands by their products!</li>
            <li> Great product! it is not sticky after put it on and absolves faster than I expected&lt;br /&gt;Plus great price! Thinking of order more after I used up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a month now for scars and dark spots, and they are fading for sure.  Scars a little slower, but they ARE scars, and are difficult to treat, so I&#x27;m suprised this actually even worked.  As for dark spots, they are a lot less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have literally only been using this for about a week and I can already see my acne scars fading away. Granted slowly but because I see my face everyday I can definitely see progress. Plus, these are scars that have haunted me for almost 10 years of my life so I realize they won&#x27;t immediately go away, the fact that they are at all is euphoria. I searched on Amazon for something that would help my scars, ranked the search for highest rated and Dr. Song&#x27;s product came up as one of the top products! This is so cheap for something that actually works. I am an extremely happy customer! I would stock up on more while they&#x27;re cheap but I&#x27;m scared it can&#x27;t last a couple months or longer like other products.&lt;br /&gt;Advice: Keep in refrigerator for longer shelf life!</li>
            <li> I love this product even I only used for less then two weeks. I feel my face is getting much soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not one for makeup or even a night time skin routine, but the days do pass, and I am getting those fine lines and thought, why not try it? It can&#x27;t hurt, right? So I received one as a promotion, a full 1 ounce bottle. When I used it, I found out a little really does go a long way. I can see this bottle lasting me at least a month with daily use. I found it was a little thick, but it is a serum. That being said, it is also a little sticky, but if you wait until it absorbs into your skin and follow it with a good moisturizer, you&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;After using it for about a week straight, I did start to see an improvement with the slight wrinkles around my eyes. I hope that after more use I will see even more improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty good. I did the 50% lactic peel and this one right after. Been applying every night on face and neck (just the serum, of course). Very very mild. My face looks refreshed, moistured. Love both products. Its a good combination.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend to use your night moisturizer after the serum to avoid the sticky feeling. Your face will feel too tight if you dont.</li>
            <li> Love this serum!!  I am a 58 yo woman and started to get the typical laugh lines and crows feet for someone my age...but when I started getting frown lines, and lines in my forehead and jowls...yikes!!!  I heard a lot of about this serum and decided to try it out. My skin is noticeably smoother, the skin tone is much more even, my lines are diminishing and I see a remarkable difference!</li>
            <li> I just ordered two additional bottles, one for a friend.  I am kind of stunned as I have some pretty pricey stuff that I have tried.  This beats then all, have been using this product exclusively since I got it.  It is a 5 star.</li>
            <li> Product is of very high quality. I placed 2 orders with Dr. Song, Vic C Serum and the 50% Lactic Acid. In both cases shipment arrived early and I a pleased with product quality.</li>
            <li> I like that this product is a lot thicker than others I have used.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any real difference in my skins appearance, but it does feel nice after putting it on.  Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING! My face is smoother, softer and more vibrant. I use this morning and night and have noticed remarkable results. I will use this for years to come!</li>
            <li> Good product--left my skin feeling clearer and softer. I would not have paid this much for this product, as I can get the same results with other Vitamin C serums for less money. Overall, above average. I received a bottle  for free to review, but this did not affect my review at all.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try Dr. Song Vitamin C Serum and I really liked it. It is a clear, odorless, gooey serum that contains Vitamins C &amp; E plus hyaluronic acid.  Vitamins C &amp; E are antioxidants that help moisturize and prevent fine lines and wrinkles and deter free radicals.  Hyaluronic acid or HA is said to hold 1000 times its weight in water and is a skin plumper.  It is a naturally occurring substance that depletes as we get older.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard that the serum works better if you apply it to slightly moist skin and then apply your regular moisturizer. Why?  Hyaluronic acid pulls moisture out of the air and onto your skin and can be drying for some skin types.  The addition of your regular moisturizer helps to seal the HA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using Dr. Song&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum for a few weeks I can say that my skin is a lot smoother. My makeup goes on really nicely over it and my skin looks dewy and feels soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have heard that plastic surgeons recommend using this serum after surgeries to reduce scarring and to plump up the skin.  My skin definitely felt softer and smoother with regular use.</li>
            <li> I feel this is an effective serum. The only thing: my drop bottle was clear glass, I wish it was blue as shown, for light protection.</li>
            <li> Even though this serum has 20% Vitamin C, it seemed a little gentler on my skin than other Vitamin C serums I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;d fallen out of the Vitamin C habit, and my skin tends to need a 3-4 day \\&quot;adjustment period\\&quot; to get used to (or re-used to) a Vitamin C regimen. Normally I have to use extra moisturizer for those few days because my skin gets a little dryer than normal (and double-bonus, I also break out while my skin adjusts), but I didn&#x27;t have the dryness issue with this particular serum. (I did, however, get the temporary splotchiness, which happily went away within three days and hasn&#x27;t come back).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aloe vera levels in this serum seem to be really high - it even smells a little like aloe. The consistency is thicker than that of other brands, more like a gel than a liquid. It&#x27;s not runny at all, and in fact has a very slight bit of stickiness to it. I used to have an aloe plant (before I killed it like I&#x27;ve killed every plant I&#x27;ve ever had), and I used to use the gooey gel inside the leaves to apply to burns (yes, I burn myself frequently enough that I had a plant to treat myself growing in my home - I&#x27;m very accident prone, although I&#x27;ve improved with age). My point being, the \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; part of the texture of the Dr. Song Vitamin C Serum is probably attributable to the aloe, as it&#x27;s the same look and feel. It also does feel a little sticky when you first apply it, but it absorbs completely within 60-90 seconds and doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of sticky residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary for review purposes; all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Dr. Song products are awesome!  I purchased Glycolic and and Lactic Acid peels, also the Vitamin C Serum which I won&#x27;t be without never!  The peels are gentle but very effective!  Love these products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a longtime Vitamin C serum user and this is the only one that I&#x27;ve used that had made my skin itch and cause bumps to occur on my cheeks. I tried stopping and then restarting use and had the same results. I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin but I&#x27;m definitely discontinuing use.</li>
            <li> Dr Song Medical is a global, integrated pharmaceutical and medical cosmetic company that specializes in research and manufacturing of products for licensed professional and institutes in over 30 different countries. Their products are sourced from the best materials and made in the USA. They meet, if not exceed FDA requirements. Customers experience better results with Dr Song&#x27;s products because they are made with USP (pharmaceutical grade) quality ingredients which are the same ingredients used in hospitals and medical laboratories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr Songs Medical Vitamin C + E Serum with Hyaluronic Acid contains 20% Vitamin C, boosted with Vitamin E, Hyaluronic Acid and Aloe Vera for a smooth velvet finish on your skin. The formula has been refined through precise testing from dozens of doctors and professionals within the cosmetic industry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply a thin layer of Vitamin C Serum daily. It&#x27;s best used after you exfoliate in the morning to utilize the Vitamin C&#x27;s sun-protecting properties. Finish by applying a good moisturizer once the serum is completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combination of Vitamin C and E together, provide a super powerful anti-aging punch. The length of time from when you start using Vitamin C Serum until you see results may vary with each person. Some people will see changes as soon as 2-4 weeks, while others may take 6-8 weeks to see the difference. You will see maximum results around 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that my skin was brighter, clearer and more firm immediately. It did not irritate my skin. There is not a scent to this serum and it is clear and very thin. The serum comes in a gorgeous opaque cobalt blue dropper bottle.  I love the fact that it is on an opaque colored bottle because Vitamin C products are vulnerable to deterioration in the presence of light. I am very happy with the way this has made my skin look and feel.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Good price.  A co-worker told me today that I &amp;#34;glowed&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The 20% vitamin C serum is easy to apply and absorb quickly.&lt;br /&gt;The only concern is that if vitamin C is not stable under light, why the serum is not using a dark shade bottle?</li>
            <li> Beware!  This product does not match the description!  It is advertised as &amp;#34;huge 4 oz bottle&amp;#34;, but is actually only 1 oz.  also, it says it contains Hyaluronic acid, but it is not listed on the ingredient list on the actual bottle.  I have tried connecting with the seller to no avail (yet!).  There are lots of vitamin C serums on the market; consider a different one...</li>
            <li> I have been using this product in conjunction with a micro-needle I ordered from Amazon as well. So far I am very impressed with the results of the two. After application, my face feels a little tingly and tight.. which let&#x27;s me know it&#x27;s working. Great product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s has clumps of jelly!</li>
            <li> I notice immediate improve of my face my pores decreased in size, and my skin fells more soft.</li>
            <li> Great product. The serum is just thick enough to be easy to use. It soaks in very quickly so that you don&#x27;t have any wait time to put your moisturizer on over it. Came quickly. Great follow up. I will continue to purchase Dr Song products.</li>
            <li> I have tried Vitamin C serums and lotions, but they all irritated my skin too much. I thought I would never use another, but I gave this one a try because I liked the Dr. Song Glycolic. When I first started using it, my skin felt kind of tight when I put it on, but it didn&#x27;t burn. After a week of testing every other day, the tight feeling stopped, and now I use it every day in the morning under a moisturizer. Wonder product, very smoothing, and a great partner for the glycolic.</li>
            <li> I bought a vitamin serum C and rose hip oil, a month ago. I have been using the vitamin Serum C in day and the rose hip oil at night before I go to bed. With using both of them every day, I am getting some positive result. When I ordered these ones, I doubted that they would work well for getting better skin on my face? I can&#x27;t tell that my some freak spot and stained skin removed, but I can tell that my face looks smooth, elastic and brighter, and pores look tight. I feel that it makes me have better skin like 20&#x27;s one on my face. Especially, when I put on makeup, my skin absorbs it well too. Personally, I prefer much more Vitamin C serum than rose hip oil because I don&#x27;t like some odd smell of rose hip oil. I hope that it is improved by Dr. song. I am so happy with Vitamin Serum C, so I will definitely order it again because it is enough to moisturize my face without using any expensive serum or essence from others.*:) happy</li>
            <li> Great product!!! I&#x27;m using this in conjunction with 50% lactic acid peel and already ( it&#x27;s only been 2 weeks) I see 30% of the darkness on my face gone!  Just a little background: I&#x27;m African American female, 25 who just used 10% hyrodcorine (spelling is off, but you know the skin bleaching ingredient!!) Well my results to that is that it made my skin dark to the point where I barely recognized myself. Now using these 2 products also along with the papaya soap and neutrogena ( for cleaning) my face is definitely getting better. I definitely will buy more; I am a customer for life!! And word of advice- please if something works for your skin; stick with it! The reason why I&#x27;m in this boat is because of my experimental ways. I&#x27;m just so glad I found an effective routine</li>
            <li> This vitamin C serum is great! I get the same results as I would expect from Vitamin C serums without using as much as I normally have to. This serum will last me longer than my others have. It doesn&#x27;t absorb as quickly but it is very effective. It also doesn&#x27;t have a strong citrus smell like the others do. I am so glad that they gave me the chance to review this item.</li>
            <li> I loved this product. It makes my skin soft and supple. I really appreciate the Dr Song&#x27;s customer service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 months on my face and the back of my hands.  I have noticed that the brown age spots are starting to fade, so hopefully with continuous use they will disappear.  This product also firms your skin and makes wrinkles much less visible.  I&#x27;ve purchased 4 bottles total since they have a great introductory offer, and I keep the extra bottles in the refrigerator to prevent the oils from getting rancid or losing potency.  In 2 months of daily use I&#x27;ve only used 1/3 of a bottle.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Like the new look and the new consistency of the serum. My skin feels really soft. I use this product every night and use the Hyaluronic Acid in the morning. My sister loves this product</li>
