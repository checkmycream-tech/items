            <li>I might have to buy more when i run out because i use a lot...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>The Tigi Catwalk has done a pretty awesome job with really shaping my curls and keeping most of the frizz under control but not all of it.</li>
            <li>I certainly recommend this product because it&#x27;s the best I have found so far for curly hair.</li>
            <li>And this is the only product that defines my curls beautifully all day.  </li>
            <li>I do have a lot of hair, however it is baby fine.  </li>

            <li>This is by far the best product I have found thus far to manage it all.</li>
            <li>it works fabulously.</li>
            <li>but now it&#x27;s back and the formula is better and more effective than ever.</li>
            <li>Works great for several days.  </li>
            <li>and this is hands down the best styling product because it defines my curls just the right amount without flattening them.  </li>
            <li>Great product, super pleased, put into palm of hand, rub palms together and apply to wet hair and scrunch up while drying, may sure not to apply too much in one spot or you will end up with a &amp;#34;Something About Mary&amp;#34; style.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I have more curls at the top of my 2c/3a hair the next day.  </li>
            <li>I think this stuff would work better for someone with thick hair - most reviewers love it.  </li>
            <li>The price is well worth it.</li>
            <li>The next morning it&#x27;s even better after sleeping on it.  </li>
            <li>Just ordered 3 more since my initial purchase!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>If you have straight hair, curl it and then use this gel.</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t put too much of this product on your hair or else makes your hair crunchy.  </li>
            <li>and it really works.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just more recently been wearing my hair naturally curly and wanted something to help shape the curl without so much frizz..</li>
            <li>l layer my products and use this last and twist for smooth curls.</li>
            <li>However, if you try to style an area with a brush that has too much of this product it will flake.</li>
            <li>I would have appreciated a response and a way to resolve this issue.&lt;br /&gt;Get</li>
            <li>Good product, but thick.</li>
            <li>It dries soft to the touch and holds really well.</li>
            <li>I have tried nearly every curl product on the market.</li>
            <li>I have tried every product out there for frizz -- including John Frieda&#x27;s Frizz Ease and Ouidad (made for women with naturally curly hair)</li>
            <li>I use it for pony tails, setting my hair, or just a natural curl look, and it does not flake up.</li>
            <li>I am a White woman who has very tight naturally curly hair that frizzes easily.</li>
            <li>This is the first and only product I&#x27;ve ever found that allows my curls to hang long and under control without frizz.</li>
            <li>Do be careful not to use too much, as it will make your hair crunchy.</li>

            <li> As a black man, I never dreamed I would have such soft, curly blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I have unusual hair - thin and naturally curly.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is it can sometimes leave areas of my hair crunchy, so I have to be careful to use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> but the only issue that it keeps the hair looking kinda wet</li>
            <li> I add it when my hair is damp, scrunch my hair and blow dry.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s getting harder to come by.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I expected it to leave my hair softer.</li>
            <li> You may want to wet your fingers or hands Before sqirting out some product.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair out and wet during the summer and the Cat Walk holds my style when it dries.</li>
            <li> It leaves a shine making it look like your hair has a wet look, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Put a modest to moderate amount on while wet, working it through, let your hair half dry, then put on a small amount to &#x27;finish&#x27; it (slick your hands then caress over your hair, not into or through it)</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> That way there is less frizz.  </li>
            <li> So focus on putting on a little amount and evening that out across your hair.</li>
            <li> You can always change the consistency if you add just a little water in your palm.</li>
            <li> It tends to leave my hair a little greasy if I don&#x27;t dilute it - I actually put a little of this in my palm, then a drip of water to thin it out and make it disperse easier</li>
            <li> I may spritz it with water to freshen it if I have a few frizzies.  </li>
            <li> Product is sticky on my hair and when hair has dried, it is stiff.</li>
            <li> Very firm.</li>
            <li> (&lt;br /&gt;I am stuck with this nasty sticky mess because it is not even worth</li>
            <li> I have very difficult hair to manage</li>
            <li> If you have curly hair, this will let you pull off even bad hair days with people complimenting you.</li>
            <li> and I was very disappointed,</li>

            <li> Works great for curly hair.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!  It makes my curl hold better and gives my hair volume</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.  I have wavy hair and this product is great for the beach look.  Just scrunch into hair after shower and airdry or diffuse</li>
            <li> I have tried many styling products over the years for my type 2c/3a curls and this is hands down the best styling product because it defines my curls just the right amount without flattening them.  Although I do find that I need to layer a leave-in-conditioner before I apply this.  Currently I am using Miss Jessie&#x27;s Leave-in Condish, but I have also used Tigi&#x27;s leave-in-conditioner from the same line and that works also.  That way there is less frizz.  But please note - you can&#x27;t put too much of this product on your hair or else makes your hair crunchy.  So focus on putting on a little amount and evening that out across your hair.</li>
            <li> I am a White woman who has very tight naturally curly hair that frizzes easily. I have tried every product out there for frizz -- including John Frieda&#x27;s Frizz Ease and Ouidad (made for women with naturally curly hair), NONE worked well at all. This is the first and only product I&#x27;ve ever found that allows my curls to hang long and under control without frizz. For a while they took it off the market and I was very disappointed, but now it&#x27;s back and the formula is better and more effective than ever.</li>
            <li> I just received this product yesterday and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out.  It did amplify my curls making my hair look and feel thicker.  I do have a lot of hair, however it is baby fine.  I use the Curl Booster and this along with it and the shampoo and it really works.  I can go about 3 days without washing my hair, but I do rewet it in the morning and let it air dry...works for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this curl enhancer for years and it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever found for bouncy curl hold. I add it when my hair is damp, scrunch my hair and blow dry. It holds all day.</li>
            <li> This version is great for my wavy hair but it&#x27;s getting harder to come by.&lt;br /&gt;Somewhere along the way Tigi reformulated (it has a darker label) and I am not a fan.&lt;br /&gt;Buy this while you still can but leave some for me!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I put in after washing my hair and scrunch.  That&#x27;s it!  No blowing drying, etc.  The next morning it&#x27;s even better after sleeping on it.  I have more curls at the top of my 2c/3a hair the next day.  I may spritz it with water to freshen it if I have a few frizzies.  Works great for several days.  Love it!</li>
            <li> If you have curly hair, buy this</li>
            <li> Product is sticky on my hair and when hair has dried, it is stiff. I expected it to leave my hair softer.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product, helps define my curls.  The only drawback is it can sometimes leave areas of my hair crunchy, so I have to be careful to use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just more recently been wearing my hair naturally curly and wanted something to help shape the curl without so much frizz.. The Tigi Catwalk has done a pretty awesome job with really shaping my curls and keeping most of the frizz under control but not all of it. I certainly recommend this product because it&#x27;s the best I have found so far for curly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m as bald as a billiard ball, but when I slathered this stuff on my head, I grew the most amazing curls. As a black man, I never dreamed I would have such soft, curly blonde hair. Also, I didn&#x27;t know I was gay until my barber came on to me and I responded.</li>
            <li> Great price, great product! You can always change the consistency if you add just a little water in your palm. People always ask me what I use bc they love my curls.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for wife, who seems satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way!  l layer my products and use this last and twist for smooth curls.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It puts my curls together taking out some of the fullness and defining the curls. It dries soft to the touch and holds really well. The shipment was well packaged and arrived sooner than they said it would.AWESOME!</li>
            <li> product is really good when there is humidity but the only issue that it keeps the hair looking kinda wet and it also needs to be washed next day because the form is messed up during sleep as it is like a gel/mousse, not an oil.</li>
            <li> I have screwed up hair, not as wavy/curly in the front, and quite wavy/curly underneath and going back, if that makes sense. This is by far the best product I have found thus far to manage it all. Just ordered 3 more since my initial purchase!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I like this product.  However, if you try to style an area with a brush that has too much of this product it will flake.</li>
            <li> I emailed them for a possible refund and they never got back to me :(&lt;br /&gt;I am stuck with this nasty sticky mess because it is not even worth&lt;br /&gt;the shipping back costs. I know the seller did not make the product, just sells it&lt;br /&gt;but I would have appreciated a response and a way to resolve this issue.&lt;br /&gt;Get this if you want your hair to stick together&lt;br /&gt;and not be able to wash it off in one wash! Made my daughter&#x27;s hair break&lt;br /&gt;from the sticky-ness!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. Good product, but thick. You may want to wet your fingers or hands Before sqirting out some product. a little goes a long way. FYI-Creat for curls but wont do anything for frizz.</li>
            <li> Love, love, LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I have very difficult hair to manage And this is the only product that defines my curls beautifully all day.  I definitely recommend this product to anyone with curly or wavy hair</li>
            <li> I have unusual hair - thin and naturally curly.  My hair frizzes all over!  I think this stuff would work better for someone with thick hair - most reviewers love it.  It tends to leave my hair a little greasy if I don&#x27;t dilute it - I actually put a little of this in my palm, then a drip of water to thin it out and make it disperse easier and that seems to help.</li>
            <li> Good product.  I use it all the time.  I might have to buy more when i run out because i use a lot...</li>
            <li> I chose to rate this product 5 stars because it has a nice hold to my hair style. I wear my hair out and wet during the summer and the Cat Walk holds my style when it dries. I use it for pony tails, setting my hair, or just a natural curl look, and it does not flake up. It leaves a shine making it look like your hair has a wet look, but it doesn&#x27;t. The price is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Really works! Luv this .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK. Very firm. Feels slimy.</li>
