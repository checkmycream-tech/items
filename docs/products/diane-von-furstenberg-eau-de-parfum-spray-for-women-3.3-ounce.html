            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this perfume!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved Tatiana for many years and didn&#x27;t think it could be surpassed.  </li>
            <li>so her compliments are her own.  </li>
            <li>The best part is that when I spray Diane lightly in my hair before bed, my husband NEVER fails to tell me how good I smell as his face brushes my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I feel regal and confident when wearing it.</li>
            <li>After more weeks of wearing it, a coworker and a cousin asked if I could order them each a bottle from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I did and they are as pleased as I am with the scent</li>
            <li>Why does one love a perfume?  </li>
            <li>I got it by fluke one time at a discount store for under $10.00 and fell I love with it.</li>
            <li>Was more like a combo of chemicals and soap.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t have more words to say.</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>I love this scent.</li>
            <li>The scent is fresh, clean, bright, woodsy and just lovely to be around.  </li>
            <li>Lovely light daytime fragrance.</li>
            <li>I wish I&#x27;d bought them all, because TJ was selling them at a huge discount.</li>
            <li>Been looking for Diane Von Furstenberg Eau De Parfum for a long time at a Discounted price, well AMAZON saves the day again, I got 3.3 ounces for a GREAT price and will tell all my friends about my deal and recommend Amazon a the place to purchase it.  </li>
            <li>I bought it originally at TJMax at a sale, just to try it out.</li>
            <li>After reading reviews about men noticing the scent and finding it pleasant enough to comment on, I wanted to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>So yes I recommend this DVF scent it is so different and unique in a good way.</li>
            <li>This is a classic, sexy scent with floral notes and a musky undertone that smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume so much I had to order it again.</li>
            <li>I love this scent - and so does anyone who comes near me!</li>
            <li>Always comments &amp;#34;What is that gorgeous perfume?&amp;#34; &amp;#34;You smell just lovely.&amp;#34; I have worn various perfumes throughout my many years of life, but this is the only one that has garnered consistent compliments.</li>
            <li>It arrived promptly, sealed original packaging, and my nose tells me it is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I recieved it all right.</li>
            <li>Two friends are going to order this right away, because of the price and fast delivery and of course my recommendation!  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t have the greatest staying power, so you will need to reapply throughout the day in order to maintain the fragrance.</li>
            <li>It is clean, soft and does not knock you over.    </li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>It is, indeed, the real deal.</li>
            <li>thanks you.</li>
            <li>a real bargain for the money.</li>
            <li>It is my new signature scent!</li>
            <li>Still, the price of this bottle through this provider was pretty reasonable, and the scent is the same, so this seems to be a &amp;#34;genuine&amp;#34; product, and not a knock off.</li>
            <li>Clean smelling, last long.</li>
            <li>When I used Diane at work for the very 1st time, I received several compliments.  </li>
            <li>I save my other scents for my special time spent with my husband....</li>
            <li>I was concerned that this perfume would not be the real deal, due to the price.</li>

            <li> Have retired some of my other favorites  to make this my signature scent.  </li>

            <li> I bought my 1st bottle of Diane several months ago.  After reading reviews about men noticing the scent and finding it pleasant enough to comment on, I wanted to give it a try.  I&#x27;ve loved Tatiana for many years and didn&#x27;t think it could be surpassed.  When I used Diane at work for the very 1st time, I received several compliments.  After more weeks of wearing it, a coworker and a cousin asked if I could order them each a bottle from Amazon.  I did and they are as pleased as I am with the scent and they get compliments as well.  The coworker doesn&#x27;t work in the same department so our scent is not being noticed by the same people.  My cousin doesn&#x27;t work where I do so her compliments are her own.  The best part is that when I spray Diane lightly in my hair before bed, my husband NEVER fails to tell me how good I smell as his face brushes my hair.  We&#x27;re in our 60&#x27;s and he still notices something as unique as Diane!!!  It&#x27;s subtle but &#x27;there&#x27; all day.  Let&#x27;s keep this Von Furstenberg product a secret.......</li>
            <li> Love this perfume!!!! Great price too!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Received on time!!!!!</li>
            <li> Why does one love a perfume?  It just fits me.  It is clean, soft and does not knock you over.    9-14  third bottle on the way.  I adore this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is a classic, sexy scent with floral notes and a musky undertone that smells fantastic. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t have the greatest staying power, so you will need to reapply throughout the day in order to maintain the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that this perfume would not be the real deal, due to the price. It is, indeed, the real deal. The fragrance lasts all day!! I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Not overpowering. Have retired some of my other favorites  to make this my signature scent.  Good buy at this price.</li>
            <li> this is one of the best</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume so much I had to order it again. I got it by fluke one time at a discount store for under $10.00 and fell I love with it. Needless to say I can&#x27;t find it again at that very very steal of a price I wear it daily for my Goto work perfume and get lots of compliments on it. I save my other scents for my special time spent with my husband.... The perfumes he has purchased for me and they are the ones he loves. So yes I recommend this DVF scent it is so different and unique in a good way.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume!  I always get tons of compliments when I wear it.  It is my new signature scent!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly disappointed.  I do not get the sunflower inspiration at all.  Was more like a combo of chemicals and soap.</li>
            <li> it is a good product. I recieved it all right. i don&#x27;t have more words to say. thanks you. ok</li>
            <li> I love this scent. I was a little bit worried about originality of this product because of the surprisingly low price. It arrived promptly, sealed original packaging, and my nose tells me it is the real deal. a real bargain for the money.</li>
