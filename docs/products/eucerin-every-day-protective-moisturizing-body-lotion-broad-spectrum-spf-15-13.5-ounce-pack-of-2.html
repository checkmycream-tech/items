    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Perfect body lotion for summer as it has SPF built in.</li>
            <li>The SPF protection is a great idea</li>
            <li>so i am happy with product.</li>
            <li>GREAT value for the price, too, considering it&#x27;s a moisturizer WITH sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had heard good things about this Eucerin products from Dr. Oz and tried it.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>and I was very glad to find this product.  </li>
            <li>This seems to be a great way to protect yourself from light, day to day sun exposure.  </li>
            <li>I knew it was popular</li>
            <li>( so it must be good right!?!)</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>Mostly becuase</li>
            <li>Use neutrogena lotion with sunscreen, that is much better.</li>
            <li>I love the combination of moisturizer and sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Light, easily soaks into the skin not  sticky and doesn&#x27;t come off on your clothes.</li>
            <li>While fragrance may not have been added I can assure you this lotion is not fragrance or odor free.  </li>
            <li>Great basic moisturizer without the perfumes that can be so drying.  </li>
            <li>Applies smoothly and quickly and has a light, clean, non-chemical scent.</li>
            <li>This product was recommended by my dermotologist and is much more reasonably priced than the products available at the dermotologist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is a very good, everyday, everywhere product.  </li>
            <li>Since then, I&#x27;ve saved this product for quick application before things like morning errands, walking the dog, and gardening, but avoid it before work.</li>
            <li>It says on the bottle \\&quot;Fragrance Free\\&quot;, and maybe it is the sun screen component, but there is a fruity odor, not unpleasant, but not odor</li>
            <li>Though my skin had a good first response to the product, in the end I had to stop using it as well as the face cream version which also caused the same allergic rashing under the eyes.</li>
            <li>If anyone knows of a true odor free SPF lotion please comment on this review as I would be very interested.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I may obsess a bit about sun exposure (and yes, I know about the Vitamin D studies), but it&#x27;s still the right thing to protect your skin - this lotion is made by a highly respected company, has no nasty chemical odor, smooths on/absorbs and just does its job.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice light lotion that helps with dry skin, and is easily absorbed .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>--this one soaks right in</li>
            <li>It feels and works the same but the scent seems to be gone, so, something in the formula has changed and for the better.</li>
            <li>First tried it when I received a sample from my dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>I can actually use it as a substitute for lotion which means I get much more consistent sun protection all summer.</li>
            <li>Eucerin in general, feels a little greasy when it first goes on, but for me after about an hour is absorbed into the skin and is extremely effective in preventing cracking, drying, and irritations.</li>
            <li>This body lotion works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>Generally I really dislike the way that sunscreen smells, but this has almost no odor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now and really like it.</li>
            <li>I paid too much for this product .</li>
            <li>So in general it was ok for occational use, but, in a daily use situation, I had problems with it over time.</li>
            <li>, I generally get a reaction right away</li>
            <li>My dematologist recomends Eucerin and I use several versions of the product regularly now and find it works better for me</li>
            <li>latest shipment is in a slightly different package saying something like same formula.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty disappointed with this product &amp; am extremely happy the drugstore that I purchased it from is willing to let me exchange it!  </li>
            <li>Great for everyday use especially in the Australian sun.</li>
            <li>i love too use it everyday for spf15 sun protection.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m prone to skin allergies, I didn&#x27;t associate it to the product right away as I had started off so well using it daily without any problem - for me</li>
            <li>you need it when you live in florida.</li>
            <li>This is light enough to where anytime, all day, going to work, etc., as a daily after shower moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Next time, I&#x27;ll go to Walmart first.</li>
            <li>was pleasantly surprised and will continue to use it during the summer months.</li>
            <li>Very greasy, would not dry off, even after hours and wiping with a dry towel.  </li>

            <li> Updated 2010/0927&lt;br /&gt;I changed my rating from 5 to 3 because I found that over time my skin began to react to the lotion causing red rashes that would last a few days but then clear.</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend it anymore for that reason but as I note below, I&#x27;ve had allergic reactions to all the other SPF products as well.  </li>

            <li> and you get almost immediate results--plus you get a little sun protection</li>
            <li> This lotion also has little to no fragrance which is a plus.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s hard to go wrong in choosing a Eucerin product.  </li>

            <li> Updated 2010/0927&lt;br /&gt;I changed my rating from 5 to 3 because I found that over time my skin began to react to the lotion causing red rashes that would last a few days but then clear. Since I&#x27;m prone to skin allergies, I didn&#x27;t associate it to the product right away as I had started off so well using it daily without any problem - for me, I generally get a reaction right away if I have a sensativity to a product so I thought I had hit gold. Though my skin had a good first response to the product, in the end I had to stop using it as well as the face cream version which also caused the same allergic rashing under the eyes. So in general it was ok for occational use, but, in a daily use situation, I had problems with it over time. I can&#x27;t recommend it anymore for that reason but as I note below, I&#x27;ve had allergic reactions to all the other SPF products as well.  This one I had the least reaction to, but in the end, I had a bad reaction from daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initial review:&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for SPF protection but have skin sensativities and had been allergic to everything I tried previously.  My dematologist recomends Eucerin and I use several versions of the product regularly now and find it works better for me then anything else.  Eucerin in general, feels a little greasy when it first goes on, but for me after about an hour is absorbed into the skin and is extremely effective in preventing cracking, drying, and irritations. It has NO fragrance added to it, which for me is essential.  The SPF protection is a great idea and I was very glad to find this product.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone with sensative skin looking for sun protection.  This is light enough to where anytime, all day, going to work, etc., as a daily after shower moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and like the idea of a lotion with sun screen for arms, neck, ears (body parts in the sun).  I like this lotion except is does have an odor.  It says on the bottle \\&quot;Fragrance Free\\&quot;, and maybe it is the sun screen component, but there is a fruity odor, not unpleasant, but not odor free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July 2011&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than one person has commented on my fragrance.  Not at all what I was going for.  While fragrance may not have been added I can assure you this lotion is not fragrance or odor free.  If anyone knows of a true odor free SPF lotion please comment on this review as I would be very interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May 2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My latest shipment is in a slightly different package saying something like same formula.  It feels and works the same but the scent seems to be gone, so, something in the formula has changed and for the better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to go wrong in choosing a Eucerin product.  This one is no exception.    Glad I bought it and will do so again.</li>
            <li> after having 3 or 4 body lotions with sunscreen to choose from, I picked the Eucerin. Mostly becuase I knew it was popular ( so it must be good right!?!) when I worked at a drugstore.  I&#x27;m pretty disappointed with this product &amp; am extremely happy the drugstore that I purchased it from is willing to let me exchange it!  It left me feeling sticky, all day long.  It made me feel like I was living somewhere humid!</li>
            <li> not greasy like other eucerin --this one soaks right in and you get almost immediate results--plus you get a little sun protection</li>
            <li> This body lotion works very well for me.  My dermatologist says my skin looks like it&#x27;s well taken care of.</li>
            <li> i love too use it everyday for spf15 sun protection. you need it when you live in florida. so i am happy with product.</li>
            <li> Perfect body lotion for summer as it has SPF built in. No more burns because I forgot to put on sunblock.</li>
            <li> Applies smoothly and quickly and has a light, clean, non-chemical scent. GREAT value for the price, too, considering it&#x27;s a moisturizer WITH sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint, really, is that it leaves my skin feeling sticky, enough that I&#x27;ve actually had to wash my hands before doing paperwork.

            <li> I may obsess a bit about sun exposure (and yes, I know about the Vitamin D studies), but it&#x27;s still the right thing to protect your skin - this lotion is made by a highly respected company, has no nasty chemical odor, smooths on/absorbs and just does its job.  I cannot find this anymore in local stores, so Amazon is my go-to (again).</li>
            <li> Great for everyday use especially in the Australian sun. Light, easily soaks into the skin not  sticky and doesn&#x27;t come off on your clothes.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a great way to protect yourself from light, day to day sun exposure.  No strong smell.</li>
            <li> I assume this product does not protect against both uva &amp; uvb.  It states on the back that it protects against sun burn, but not skin cancer or skin aging.</li>
            <li> I had heard good things about this Eucerin products from Dr. Oz and tried it.  Aweful.  Very greasy, would not dry off, even after hours and wiping with a dry towel.  Never got in my eyes, but both my eyes and my wifes eyes were burning.  I do not recommend this product at all.  Use neutrogena lotion with sunscreen, that is much better.</li>
            <li> This lotion is a very good, everyday, everywhere product.  I like the sun protection and being unscented, it doesn&#x27;t interfere with perfume.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Great basic moisturizer without the perfumes that can be so drying.  My husband uses it daily as well.  First tried it when I received a sample from my dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> I love the combination of moisturizer and sunscreen.  This lotion also has little to no fragrance which is a plus.</li>
