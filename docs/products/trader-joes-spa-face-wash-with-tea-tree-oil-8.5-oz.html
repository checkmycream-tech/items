            <li>I liked it but its not for me.</li>
            <li>To the point that it was kind of peeling.  </li>
            <li>I liked this soap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great face wash, it just washes away clean.</li>
            <li>The BEST face wash I have found so far!  </li>
            <li>The greatest benefit I have seen so far is that it has refined the enlarged pores on my nose!  </li>

            <li>I am so far very happy with my purchase.  </li>

            <li>I do :)</li>
            <li>Love it/Hate it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been struggling with acne for 3 years now and have tried so many products and remedys to get rid of it</li>
            <li>Seems to have cleared most of my problem skin</li>
            <li>I bought this product in the store and fell in love with the smell.</li>
            <li>Excellent facial product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;M SO GLAD</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over six months now and am immensely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I love it as a cleanser....</li>
            <li>Hopefully the more I use it, the better it will get.  </li>
            <li>LOVE THIS STUFF.  </li>
            <li>Love how it foams up.</li>
            <li>I love this face wash.</li>
            <li>Most face washes have a tendency to be drying.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m a real person lol).</li>
            <li>Not in love with the product.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser.</li>
            <li>Lathers nicely, rinses clean.</li>
            <li>It rinses nice and clean with no lingering residue.</li>
            <li>It was a hassle and my skin is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I love this wash, works great for sensitive, oily skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is nice and fresh and clean!</li>
            <li>Great price for a natural product.</li>
            <li>I tried this face wash and, while it seems to clean my face well, it seems like more of an astringent wash.  </li>
            <li>I now swear by this product and strongly suggest that you give it a try as well...and for around $5 a bottle, what have you got to lose?</li>
            <li>Has a strong smell, but it doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time about a year ago and liked that it cleaned my face well</li>
            <li>I have oily and acne prone skin and after two days of use, my acne has died down and my skin feels wonderful.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon, I was able to order it!</li>
            <li>I get HUGE cystic pimples</li>
            <li>CHEAP, about $5&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even though my face isn&#x27;t completely clear yet it is alot better, not as red, and the best part is its not irritated.</li>
            <li>Using this has greatly reduced my gross face issues!</li>
            <li>But it was cheap, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>( I know, I sound like an infomercial</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>the best face wash I have ever used--I&#x27;ve had moderate acne my whole life and this helps without over drying and irritation.</li>
            <li>Although a lot of people comment on the smell I think it kind of nice, it actually smells like Fruit Loops to me.</li>
            <li>Tea tree oil leaves your skin clean and fresh without over drying like most acne treatments.</li>
            <li>Feels really clean and smooth after washing.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin smooth and clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>Quick and easy transaction.</li>
            <li>so I was really excited to give this a try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>leaves skin feeling clean</li>
            <li>feels clean.</li>
            <li>Thoroughly Clean Face Wash Refill, 32-Ounce, 2.5 Bottle]], so go with whichever one you can find at a lower price.</li>
            <li>I even use this face wash to clean my makeup brushes and beauty blender.</li>
            <li>After washing your face with this, it feels so incredibly clean.</li>
            <li>Sometimes when I wipe this face wash off, it feels almost  too clean.</li>
            <li>I hardly ever write reviews, but I have to say this is the best face wash I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Tea tree oil is good for oily skin and deep cleansing purpose.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive yet acne-prone, and this is hands-down the most gentle, yet effective cleanser I have put on my face.</li>
            <li>This got my face super clean.</li>
            <li>Personally, I see this as a good thing and the smell rinses away anyway.  </li>
            <li>Super fresh and clean feeling and so reasonably priced!!!</li>
            <li>It has a strong antiseptic smell to it when you are first using it</li>
            <li>but these are very small prices to pay for the clearest &amp; most beautiful skin I have ever had.</li>
            <li>Tea tree oil is seriously one of the best products for your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just lucky</li>
            <li>For me, this is simply the best facial wash I&#x27;ve found in the 20 years</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll go back to any store/name brand products because this works better!</li>
            <li>I bought this face wash in Trader Joe&#x27;s and every since I&#x27;ve been using it, my face is much more clear!</li>
            <li>I love all the natural ingredients too!</li>
            <li>If you have acne prone skin, I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m finishing my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Well worth the try and will reorder.  </li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t familiar with castile soap, and how to use it, it can be very drying.</li>
            <li>The price is right too.</li>
            <li>I would not hesitate and would buy this right away....</li>
            <li>Is the packageing which I contacted and had made right by amazon.  </li>
            <li>this is a refreshing wash, It would sometimes make my face feel too tight but it is also a great body wash especially for body acne</li>
            <li>This stuff is great for acne and, just as importantly, for simply having a face wash with natural ingredients and no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>Generally, I have lovely skin, but when that \\&quot;time\\&quot; comes around</li>
            <li>Even with using a good moisturizer, it helped, but it stil felt tight and</li>
            <li>I have found this to be very gentle and non-irritating.  </li>
            <li>I have had exactly one cystic pimple.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The first time I washed my face I washed around my eyes as well</li>
            <li>However, when I went to use it the first time, it sprayed into my eyes as I opened it.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite facial soap for summer.  </li>
            <li>And avoid your eyes, it really stings!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not in love with the smell, but since I use it in the shower, it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li>My husband and I spent 45 minutes flushing my eyes with warm water and lubricating eye drops.</li>
            <li>for the first time on over 20 years I leave my house without concealer.</li>
            <li>and it lathers up really well!</li>
            <li>This is the first face wash I&#x27;m going to repurchase after trying so many different products.</li>
            <li>I hope you find the same results :)</li>
            <li>This says a lot because my skin is naturally pretty soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>was interested so</li>
            <li>Love this product and use it daily</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a great price, and lasts a really long time, too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had trouble finding a face wash that works for my sensitive skin but this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel so soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>Love the Tea Tree oil for acne, but the wash makes my face super dry, so I only use it occasionally and wash my face with warm water the rest of the time.</li>
            <li>First, I wash my face, and then I gently rub in the cleanser until it foams up</li>
            <li>I love washing my face everyday, because I can feel how refreshed my skin is, also it leaves my skin even more soft and silky than it already is.</li>
            <li>I have never used a product I feel this strongly about &amp; can truly attest to it actually working!</li>
            <li>and then if you like it, get the large 32 oz.</li>
            <li>I liked that you could close the lid tight to pack it so it wouldn&#x27;t leak.  </li>
            <li>Very deep cleaning and breaks down all the facial oils leaving a great smooth, non-oily face.  </li>
            <li>After using this product for 3 months my skin is clear, soft, and smooth.</li>
            <li>and it makes my skin feel very refreshed.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the smell, and can&#x27;t imagine that it would put anyone off enough to not use the product.</li>
            <li>I continually had to wash my eyes out with water and was in so much pain I couldn&#x27;t do anything else and was shaking and cried some.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care for the smell the face wash (I think it&#x27;s the tea tree oil?)</li>
            <li>I found the bentonite at Whole foods in the beauty section.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend you try this out!</li>
            <li>It smells rather like an antiseptic, and I find I need to use a moisturizer after, but it really helped me.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t open my eyes for more than a second or two and for some reason was light sensitive.</li>
            <li>This face wash is gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>it really burns...</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have too much acne issues except around my period, but before using this it would take a week or so for my acne to go away.</li>
            <li>You really have to rinse and rinse, so I like to keep it in the shower.</li>
            <li>You will probably pay more if you purchase similar items from spas or natural stores.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know if a tea tree face wash would be potent enough, but again, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>You will want to use a good moisturizer afterwards, but for cutting the crud off of your face, nothing is better.</li>
            <li>The squeaky clean feeling only lasts until I put some lotion on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m highly allergic to noxema type products, and cetaphyl didn&#x27;t really eliminate the acne.  </li>
            <li>Trader Joe&#x27;s products usually have good reputations, with decent ingredients, often near organic.</li>
            <li>the cap comes off far too easily, and does not appear to go back on</li>
            <li>it just didn&#x27;t agree with me, and then one day my bronchial tubes closed up completely and it took 30 seconds for me to force enough air in to get a good cough.  </li>
            <li>The article said that it was designed by a man who has made several high end products...article also continued to say this is the same formula as the very over priced products for the a much more resonable price</li>
            <li>I have adult acne (I am in my 40s) which flares up at certain times of the month, and I really did not want to take prescription acne medication.</li>
            <li>I adore this face wash, it smells nice (albeit different than your typical wash), and it really helps control my acne!</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent that is not overpowering, and just a little squirt goes a long way.</li>
            <li>so I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend using a moisturizer..</li>
            <li>It can be a little drying, so it&#x27;s better for oily skin.</li>
            <li>The only thing that has kept my face, neck, and shoulders clean and clear.</li>
            <li>Also, the product is thinner than might be expected but it does a fantastic job of lathering up.  </li>
            <li>, it wasn&#x27;t drying, improved the overall tone of my skin, and helped with breakouts (rarely have issues now).</li>
            <li>Also, the pump dispenses to much most of the time and it&#x27;s waste.</li>
            <li>But I LOVE washing my face everyday with this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive, acne-prone skin...</li>
            <li>I bought this product because Trader Joe&#x27;s has a reputation of being natural and highly rated.</li>
            <li>My skin has never been so clear!  </li>
            <li>I was told about Trader Joe&#x27;s tea tree oil face wash from a dermatologist who recommended natural soap products for my hyper-allergic skin (I am allergic to all corn and corn bi-products which seem to be in just about everything these days!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had problems with acne for the last 10 years, and no matter what type of medicated face wash or even sensitive skin soap I used, my skin never really got better.</li>
            <li>I just wanted to let everyone know that Desert Essence and Trader Joe&#x27;s must have made a deal because the ingredients are exactly the same as [[ASIN:B001CMV8FG</li>
            <li>I find myself having to use 2-3 squirts, the smell is a little strong too</li>
            <li>If I do get a pimple I can usually attribute it to changes in my diet, and use a little Trader Joe&#x27;s tea tree oil as a spot treatment, it does a great job of drying and flattening out pimples overnight.</li>
            <li>My face has been a lot clearer due to the fact that I started to use more natural products on my face recently.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t have as many black and white heads.</li>
            <li>In the morning I use my hands to apply the face wash to my face, and at night I pump about a 1/2 pump onto an Eco Tools Pure Complexion Facial Sponge to remove my makeup.</li>
            <li>Be careful and try a test area the first time you use this product!  </li>
            <li>Clean, fresh feeling that never leaves my skin feeling tight or dry.</li>
            <li>I admit, my washcloth did pass over my eyelids when I was rinsing the product off with clear water.  </li>
            <li>The directions clearly say this twice.</li>
            <li>and it has stayed clear for over a month now.  </li>
            <li>I even tried buying a tea tree face wash from the natural foods store in town, but none of it helped.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- natural ingredients</li>
            <li>far so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I chose this one because of that and all the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin like me,  this might not be the product for you.</li>
            <li>Being 20 years old I&#x27;ve always been dealt with acne.</li>
            <li>In addition to night sweats and mood swings, at the age of 46 I&#x27;ve developed adult acne.  </li>
            <li>Pumping some into my hand, the soap ricochetted off of my palm and went directly into both of my eyes.</li>
            <li>It was all natural, but under $6 bucks.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s stripping too much of my natural oils?</li>
            <li>Much to my delight, this routine totally worked!</li>
            <li>better solutions that didn&#x27;t keep things clear long enough for the last breakout to heal completely and fade before the next.  </li>
            <li>It is mainly from the tea tree essential oil.</li>
            <li>Has really lasted a long time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t live by a Trader Joe&#x27;s anymore, and when I ran out of this stuff my skin instantly broke out.</li>
            <li>It is very liquidy, just a speck goes a long way, so be cautious when squirting, it will go everywhere if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>
            <li>Very nice, but a little bit thin.</li>
            <li>I spent a lot of money trying out different natural face products, feeling like it would be well worth the extra money if any of it worked....but none of it did.</li>
            <li>It was not sealed right and leaked on some other items I ordered at the same time.</li>
            <li>Sorry, TJ, you&#x27;re amazing</li>
            <li>The tea tree oil generally reduces acne issues and promotes clearer skin.</li>
            <li>first, it broke me out even more so than what I was already, which being someone with acne was disappointing.  </li>
            <li>and my eyes were quite red and sensitive.</li>
            <li>I tried several natural methods but nothing was helping.</li>
            <li>This has happened to me before, as the saying goes, it gets worse before it gets better sometimes holds</li>
            <li>I live in south Florida and work outside regularly, but I&#x27;m still a girly girl that loves her makeup.</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona and my skin is either dry to normal/oily based on the season.  </li>
            <li>recently, my face has been starting to clear up.  </li>
            <li>It has a lot of natural elements, such as essential oils and plant extracts.</li>
            <li>I probably wouldn&#x27;t use it if you have overly dry or very sensitive skin, as the tea tree oil could irritate it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth it...</li>
            <li>I have a mixture between oily, sensitive, and dry skin</li>
            <li>While it took a month or so of use to see results, my skin has been SO much smoother and less prone to blemishes.</li>
            <li>Gentle and natural, definitely recommended, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>The intense stinging stopped after about 2 hours, but all the next day my eyelids were slightly swollen</li>

            <li> Its seriously so amazing</li>
            <li> I liked it but its not for me.</li>
            <li> To the point that it was kind of peeling.  </li>
            <li> I liked this soap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great face wash, it just washes away clean.</li>
            <li> The BEST face wash I have found so far!  </li>
            <li> The greatest benefit I have seen so far is that it has refined the enlarged pores on my nose!  </li>
            <li> and so far I&#x27;m am really impressed!</li>
            <li> I am so far very happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff</li>

            <li> I do :)</li>
            <li> Love it/Hate it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with acne for 3 years now and have tried so many products and remedys to get rid of it</li>
            <li> Seems to have cleared most of my problem skin</li>
            <li> I bought this product in the store and fell in love with the smell.</li>
            <li> Excellent facial product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;M SO GLAD</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over six months now and am immensely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I love it as a cleanser....</li>
            <li> Hopefully the more I use it, the better it will get.  </li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF.  </li>
            <li> Love how it foams up.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash.</li>
            <li> Most face washes have a tendency to be drying.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m a real person lol).</li>
            <li> Not in love with the product.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Lathers nicely, rinses clean.</li>
            <li> It rinses nice and clean with no lingering residue.</li>
            <li> It was a hassle and my skin is pretty good.</li>
            <li> I love this wash, works great for sensitive, oily skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is nice and fresh and clean!</li>
            <li> Great price for a natural product.</li>
            <li> I tried this face wash and, while it seems to clean my face well, it seems like more of an astringent wash.  </li>
            <li> I now swear by this product and strongly suggest that you give it a try as well...and for around $5 a bottle, what have you got to lose?</li>
            <li> Has a strong smell, but it doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time about a year ago and liked that it cleaned my face well</li>
            <li> I have oily and acne prone skin and after two days of use, my acne has died down and my skin feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon, I was able to order it!</li>
            <li> I get HUGE cystic pimples</li>
            <li> CHEAP, about $5&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even though my face isn&#x27;t completely clear yet it is alot better, not as red, and the best part is its not irritated.</li>
            <li> Using this has greatly reduced my gross face issues!</li>
            <li> But it was cheap, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> ( I know, I sound like an infomercial</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> the best face wash I have ever used--I&#x27;ve had moderate acne my whole life and this helps without over drying and irritation.</li>
            <li> Although a lot of people comment on the smell I think it kind of nice, it actually smells like Fruit Loops to me.</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil leaves your skin clean and fresh without over drying like most acne treatments.</li>
            <li> Feels really clean and smooth after washing.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin smooth and clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> Quick and easy transaction.</li>
            <li> so I was really excited to give this a try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> leaves skin feeling clean</li>
            <li> feels clean.</li>
            <li> Thoroughly Clean Face Wash Refill, 32-Ounce, 2.5 Bottle]], so go with whichever one you can find at a lower price.</li>
            <li> I even use this face wash to clean my makeup brushes and beauty blender.</li>
            <li> After washing your face with this, it feels so incredibly clean.</li>
            <li> Sometimes when I wipe this face wash off, it feels almost  too clean.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever write reviews, but I have to say this is the best face wash I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil is good for oily skin and deep cleansing purpose.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive yet acne-prone, and this is hands-down the most gentle, yet effective cleanser I have put on my face.</li>
            <li> This got my face super clean.</li>
            <li> Personally, I see this as a good thing and the smell rinses away anyway.  </li>
            <li> Super fresh and clean feeling and so reasonably priced!!!</li>
            <li> It has a strong antiseptic smell to it when you are first using it</li>
            <li> but these are very small prices to pay for the clearest &amp; most beautiful skin I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil is seriously one of the best products for your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just lucky</li>
            <li> For me, this is simply the best facial wash I&#x27;ve found in the 20 years</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll go back to any store/name brand products because this works better!</li>
            <li> I bought this face wash in Trader Joe&#x27;s and every since I&#x27;ve been using it, my face is much more clear!</li>
            <li> I love all the natural ingredients too!</li>
            <li> If you have acne prone skin, I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m finishing my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Well worth the try and will reorder.  </li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t familiar with castile soap, and how to use it, it can be very drying.</li>
            <li> The price is right too.</li>
            <li> I would not hesitate and would buy this right away....</li>
            <li> Is the packageing which I contacted and had made right by amazon.  </li>
            <li> this is a refreshing wash, It would sometimes make my face feel too tight but it is also a great body wash especially for body acne</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for acne and, just as importantly, for simply having a face wash with natural ingredients and no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Generally, I have lovely skin, but when that \\&quot;time\\&quot; comes around</li>
            <li> Even with using a good moisturizer, it helped, but it stil felt tight and</li>
            <li> I have found this to be very gentle and non-irritating.  </li>
            <li> I have had exactly one cystic pimple.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The first time I washed my face I washed around my eyes as well</li>
            <li> However, when I went to use it the first time, it sprayed into my eyes as I opened it.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite facial soap for summer.  </li>
            <li> And avoid your eyes, it really stings!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not in love with the smell, but since I use it in the shower, it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> My husband and I spent 45 minutes flushing my eyes with warm water and lubricating eye drops.</li>
            <li> for the first time on over 20 years I leave my house without concealer.</li>
            <li> and it lathers up really well!</li>
            <li> This is the first face wash I&#x27;m going to repurchase after trying so many different products.</li>
            <li> I hope you find the same results :)</li>
            <li> This says a lot because my skin is naturally pretty soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> was interested so</li>
            <li> Love this product and use it daily</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a great price, and lasts a really long time, too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble finding a face wash that works for my sensitive skin but this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel so soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> Love the Tea Tree oil for acne, but the wash makes my face super dry, so I only use it occasionally and wash my face with warm water the rest of the time.</li>
            <li> First, I wash my face, and then I gently rub in the cleanser until it foams up</li>
            <li> I love washing my face everyday, because I can feel how refreshed my skin is, also it leaves my skin even more soft and silky than it already is.</li>
            <li> I have never used a product I feel this strongly about &amp; can truly attest to it actually working!</li>
            <li> and then if you like it, get the large 32 oz.</li>
            <li> I liked that you could close the lid tight to pack it so it wouldn&#x27;t leak.  </li>
            <li> Very deep cleaning and breaks down all the facial oils leaving a great smooth, non-oily face.  </li>
            <li> After using this product for 3 months my skin is clear, soft, and smooth.</li>
            <li> and it makes my skin feel very refreshed.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the smell, and can&#x27;t imagine that it would put anyone off enough to not use the product.</li>
            <li> I continually had to wash my eyes out with water and was in so much pain I couldn&#x27;t do anything else and was shaking and cried some.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for the smell the face wash (I think it&#x27;s the tea tree oil?)</li>
            <li> I found the bentonite at Whole foods in the beauty section.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend you try this out!</li>
            <li> It smells rather like an antiseptic, and I find I need to use a moisturizer after, but it really helped me.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t open my eyes for more than a second or two and for some reason was light sensitive.</li>
            <li> This face wash is gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> it really burns...</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have too much acne issues except around my period, but before using this it would take a week or so for my acne to go away.</li>
            <li> You really have to rinse and rinse, so I like to keep it in the shower.</li>
            <li> You will probably pay more if you purchase similar items from spas or natural stores.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know if a tea tree face wash would be potent enough, but again, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> You will want to use a good moisturizer afterwards, but for cutting the crud off of your face, nothing is better.</li>
            <li> The squeaky clean feeling only lasts until I put some lotion on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m highly allergic to noxema type products, and cetaphyl didn&#x27;t really eliminate the acne.  </li>
            <li> Trader Joe&#x27;s products usually have good reputations, with decent ingredients, often near organic.</li>
            <li> the cap comes off far too easily, and does not appear to go back on</li>
            <li> it just didn&#x27;t agree with me, and then one day my bronchial tubes closed up completely and it took 30 seconds for me to force enough air in to get a good cough.  </li>
            <li> The article said that it was designed by a man who has made several high end products...article also continued to say this is the same formula as the very over priced products for the a much more resonable price</li>
            <li> I have adult acne (I am in my 40s) which flares up at certain times of the month, and I really did not want to take prescription acne medication.</li>
            <li> I adore this face wash, it smells nice (albeit different than your typical wash), and it really helps control my acne!</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant scent that is not overpowering, and just a little squirt goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend using a moisturizer..</li>
            <li> It can be a little drying, so it&#x27;s better for oily skin.</li>
            <li> The only thing that has kept my face, neck, and shoulders clean and clear.</li>
            <li> Also, the product is thinner than might be expected but it does a fantastic job of lathering up.  </li>
            <li> , it wasn&#x27;t drying, improved the overall tone of my skin, and helped with breakouts (rarely have issues now).</li>
            <li> Also, the pump dispenses to much most of the time and it&#x27;s waste.</li>
            <li> But I LOVE washing my face everyday with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive, acne-prone skin...</li>
            <li> I bought this product because Trader Joe&#x27;s has a reputation of being natural and highly rated.</li>
            <li> My skin has never been so clear!  </li>
            <li> I was told about Trader Joe&#x27;s tea tree oil face wash from a dermatologist who recommended natural soap products for my hyper-allergic skin (I am allergic to all corn and corn bi-products which seem to be in just about everything these days!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with acne for the last 10 years, and no matter what type of medicated face wash or even sensitive skin soap I used, my skin never really got better.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to let everyone know that Desert Essence and Trader Joe&#x27;s must have made a deal because the ingredients are exactly the same as [[ASIN:B001CMV8FG</li>
            <li> I find myself having to use 2-3 squirts, the smell is a little strong too</li>
            <li> If I do get a pimple I can usually attribute it to changes in my diet, and use a little Trader Joe&#x27;s tea tree oil as a spot treatment, it does a great job of drying and flattening out pimples overnight.</li>
            <li> My face has been a lot clearer due to the fact that I started to use more natural products on my face recently.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t have as many black and white heads.</li>
            <li> In the morning I use my hands to apply the face wash to my face, and at night I pump about a 1/2 pump onto an Eco Tools Pure Complexion Facial Sponge to remove my makeup.</li>
            <li> Be careful and try a test area the first time you use this product!  </li>
            <li> Clean, fresh feeling that never leaves my skin feeling tight or dry.</li>
            <li> I admit, my washcloth did pass over my eyelids when I was rinsing the product off with clear water.  </li>
            <li> The directions clearly say this twice.</li>
            <li> and it has stayed clear for over a month now.  </li>
            <li> I even tried buying a tea tree face wash from the natural foods store in town, but none of it helped.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- natural ingredients</li>
            <li> far so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I chose this one because of that and all the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin like me,  this might not be the product for you.</li>
            <li> Being 20 years old I&#x27;ve always been dealt with acne.</li>
            <li> In addition to night sweats and mood swings, at the age of 46 I&#x27;ve developed adult acne.  </li>
            <li> Pumping some into my hand, the soap ricochetted off of my palm and went directly into both of my eyes.</li>
            <li> It was all natural, but under $6 bucks.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s stripping too much of my natural oils?</li>
            <li> Much to my delight, this routine totally worked!</li>
            <li> better solutions that didn&#x27;t keep things clear long enough for the last breakout to heal completely and fade before the next.  </li>
            <li> It is mainly from the tea tree essential oil.</li>
            <li> Has really lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t live by a Trader Joe&#x27;s anymore, and when I ran out of this stuff my skin instantly broke out.</li>
            <li> It is very liquidy, just a speck goes a long way, so be cautious when squirting, it will go everywhere if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>
            <li> Very nice, but a little bit thin.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of money trying out different natural face products, feeling like it would be well worth the extra money if any of it worked....but none of it did.</li>
            <li> It was not sealed right and leaked on some other items I ordered at the same time.</li>
            <li> Sorry, TJ, you&#x27;re amazing</li>
            <li> The tea tree oil generally reduces acne issues and promotes clearer skin.</li>
            <li> first, it broke me out even more so than what I was already, which being someone with acne was disappointing.  </li>
            <li> and my eyes were quite red and sensitive.</li>
            <li> I tried several natural methods but nothing was helping.</li>
            <li> This has happened to me before, as the saying goes, it gets worse before it gets better sometimes holds</li>
            <li> I live in south Florida and work outside regularly, but I&#x27;m still a girly girl that loves her makeup.</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona and my skin is either dry to normal/oily based on the season.  </li>
            <li> recently, my face has been starting to clear up.  </li>
            <li> It has a lot of natural elements, such as essential oils and plant extracts.</li>
            <li> I probably wouldn&#x27;t use it if you have overly dry or very sensitive skin, as the tea tree oil could irritate it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth it...</li>
            <li> I have a mixture between oily, sensitive, and dry skin</li>
            <li> While it took a month or so of use to see results, my skin has been SO much smoother and less prone to blemishes.</li>
            <li> Gentle and natural, definitely recommended, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The intense stinging stopped after about 2 hours, but all the next day my eyelids were slightly swollen</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I have to say is right after you wash your face with this</li>
            <li> Helps to clear them faster than other products I have used.</li>
            <li> For years I used Proactiv (which worked) but was disappointed that I couldn&#x27;t find something more natural to keep my face clear.</li>
            <li> the doctor did an allergy test and determined that the body soap, shampoo, and even detergent and fabric softeners I was using ALL had some form of corn or corn bi-product in them that was causing my skin reaction SO long story short, her office conducted extensive research and came up with a list of products that have no corn or talc in them</li>
            <li> hormonal breakouts that followed a regular monthly cycle, with minor breakouts throughout the month</li>
            <li> I tried everything from Pro Active to more expensive skin systems and none of them worked as well as this simple face wash.</li>
            <li> I tried a few of my old washes..</li>
            <li> Not completely, but it&#x27;s getting there...  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be purchasing this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> I read an article on stumble upon...</li>
            <li> I am a 28 year old female and I have had horrible cystic acne most of my adult life.</li>
            <li> So I started using tea tree oil (and sometimes raw honey and apple cider vinegar, after googling natural acne cures).</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t dry it out</li>
            <li> (My skin gets too dry in the winter</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t over use it because it will make your skin dry.</li>
            <li> Using without a face moisturizer will definitely dry out your face.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dry me out like Salicylic acid or benzoylperoxide products, but it cleared my skin.....</li>
            <li> face wash does have a strong herbal, medicinal smell; personally I don&#x27;t find it unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 3 months now, and I hardly ever get new pimples.</li>
            <li> You only need a little and lather it up in your hands and apply to your face.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed anything different with my skin, and it burns a little.</li>
            <li> The oil cleansing method helped with my acne a little bit, but also left me with little tiny bumps all over my cheeks (clogged pores?</li>
            <li> This face wash cleared my skin up, and got rid of the little bumps that the oil cleansing method left me with.   </li>
            <li> Therefore, I &amp;#34;make sure&amp;#34; my eyes are closed when using it and rinse it thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and all you need is a tiny bit for each washing so it lasts forever!</li>
            <li> I only wash for a few seconds, 10-15 tops, and use coconut oil for a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I use to never really wash my face every day.</li>
            <li> This is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> I may be allergic, although I&#x27;m not allergic to any other products, and I don&#x27;t have asthma.</li>
            <li> I guess I missed the two other ratings that warned me this product smells like vomit.</li>
            <li> Other than that this face wash is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I transferred the contents to other bottles (with flip tops).</li>
            <li> After an extremely stressful semester, I started developing hormonal acne on both sides of my face, as well as my chin.</li>
            <li> and I can say it is primarily due to this face wash.</li>
            <li> Other face washes don&#x27;t take off my make up, which I think was always my problem.</li>
            <li> I noticed the other day that they seem to be lighting up.</li>
            <li> I told her that I agreed with her and had tried other products but that nothing had worked.</li>
            <li> brings glow back to dull skin ...</li>
            <li> For about 20 years I&#x27;ve tried everything with no success.....</li>
            <li> If the liquid were just a bit thicker it would be easier to hold in your hand and rub on your face and work into your skin, this it feels like half of it flows out of your hand while you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li> Also, if you have a Trader Joes nearby, you should get it there because it&#x27;s half the price in the store.</li>
            <li> It hurt like a monkey for at least an hour.</li>
            <li> Contrary to other reviews this actually made my acne worse, think it may have been too drying for my skin.</li>
            <li> Please tightly close your eyes while washing, I know from experience that tea tree oil BURNS.</li>
            <li> And it stings a little too,</li>
            <li> and it was a little too harsh for me.</li>
            <li> This has ruined me from other face washes!!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the bottles themselves are shoddily made-</li>
            <li> There are a few things you have to get used to with this product though...</li>
            <li> It is quite watery or runny that it is not easy to &amp;#34;apply&amp;#34; to the face in a controlled manner.</li>
            <li> I have used some pretty nasty stuff in the past, I have to say tho, this isn&#x27;t the worst, lol.</li>
            <li> I usually leave my eye circles alone when washing face.</li>
            <li> dried out my face a lot!  </li>
            <li> I was not pleased with the outcome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with breakouts for the past couple of months and nothing seemed to be helping.</li>
            <li> This face wash is very harsh.</li>
            <li> However, due to the thin texture, it tends to drip.</li>
            <li> but once I wash and then rinse I can hardly smell it.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s always hard to find a product that works well.</li>
            <li> and now they are hardly noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Its a little too thin</li>
            <li> I purchase at least two at a time.</li>
            <li> In addition, the wash does sting eyes if it gets in, as some customer complained.</li>
            <li> It takes a VERY small amount and a LOT of water to cut it.</li>
            <li> All the smell was horrible but other than that if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> expensive gizmos like Zeno, and dermatologist visits and prescriptions all with little or no luck.  </li>
            <li> They are extremely painful and last for a week or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason for 4 not 5 stars: the thin texture.</li>
            <li> Since I started using it I have seen a dramatic decrease in breakouts</li>
            <li> Prescriptions, expensive products, proactiv, etc.</li>
            <li> I used it despite the consistency and smell and was unhappy with the results.</li>
            <li> Crazy, yes, I know.</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks badly and its runny like water.</li>
            <li> If you have really bad acne, give this a try-</li>
            <li> It burned my eyes so badly that I was incapacitated for about 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I struggled for years with really bad acne, and tried EVERYTHING aside from accutane.</li>
            <li> Yes it does smell slightly bad, but the smell does not linger.  </li>
            <li> So I kept using Proactiv...until I went on a trip with co-workers, and one of my co-workers (who also happens to be an esthetician) saw me using Proactiv and told me how bad it is for your face.</li>
            <li> It dries my face out really bad.</li>
            <li> It made my face greasy and shiny for the rest of the day, and it caused me to develop a painful zit on my forehead within 24 hours of using it.</li>
            <li> I have hormonal acne, every month I get 3-10 horribly painful pimples.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
            <li> and it stinks!  </li>
            <li> smells terrible.</li>
            <li> This face wash has a horrible smell and will sting your eyes...</li>
            <li> I decided to try this face wash after a horrible experience with the oil cleansing method.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have oily and acne prone skin and after two days of use, my acne has died down and my skin feels wonderful. Definitely going to repurchase but maybe not from here. I&#x27;ll buy it from my local Trader Joe&#x27;s because it&#x27;s cheaper</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the TJ tea tree shampoo and conditioner for awhile so I was really excited to give this a try. I&#x27;m really disappointed. The consistency is watery and it smells like vomit (I&#x27;m not being flip, it literally smells like vomit). I used it despite the consistency and smell and was unhappy with the results. It made my face greasy and shiny for the rest of the day, and it caused me to develop a painful zit on my forehead within 24 hours of using it. Sorry, TJ, you&#x27;re amazing but you missed the mark on this one!</li>
            <li> Very nice, but a little bit thin. If the liquid were just a bit thicker it would be easier to hold in your hand and rub on your face and work into your skin, this it feels like half of it flows out of your hand while you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 3 months now.  I live in Arizona and my skin is either dry to normal/oily based on the season.  Generally, I have lovely skin, but when that \\&quot;time\\&quot; comes around I get HUGE cystic pimples (2-3 at a time).  They are extremely painful and last for a week or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have been using this product (once a day in the shower) I have had exactly one cystic pimple.  I now swear by this product and strongly suggest that you give it a try as well...and for around $5 a bottle, what have you got to lose?</li>
            <li> So far so good. I was told about Trader Joe&#x27;s tea tree oil face wash from a dermatologist who recommended natural soap products for my hyper-allergic skin (I am allergic to all corn and corn bi-products which seem to be in just about everything these days!) since I was breaking out all over my neck, face, and body (to include my scalp) the doctor did an allergy test and determined that the body soap, shampoo, and even detergent and fabric softeners I was using ALL had some form of corn or corn bi-product in them that was causing my skin reaction SO long story short, her office conducted extensive research and came up with a list of products that have no corn or talc in them and this is one of the products.  It has a strong antiseptic smell to it when you are first using it but the smell goes away almost immediately and it makes my skin feel very refreshed. Since I started using it I have seen a dramatic decrease in breakouts so I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is awesome! Recommended from a friend and now I am sold! Super fresh and clean feeling and so reasonably priced!!!</li>
            <li> I been using this product for about 5 yrs now, and when my local TJs stop selling it I was furious, just recently about 6 months ago I found it here on Amazon. I was filled with joy my face was happy to it again. I purchase at least two at a time. I wish they would make a subscription for it. Every time I use it my face feels and look glowy! Heels PMS pimples quickly!!! Best face soap in the world:-)</li>
            <li> If you have really bad acne, give this a try- it works! I saw results within a week BUT it drys my skin out ALOT. I would highly recommend using a moisturizer.. Love this stuff I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll go back to any store/name brand products because this works better!</li>
            <li> Ugh. Be careful and try a test area the first time you use this product!  Keep away from eye area completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind the smell, problem is I had an allergic reaction to the Tea Tree oil.  My eyelids and under my eyes swelled up all puffy , and the next morning I looked like a monster.  I admit, my washcloth did pass over my eyelids when I was rinsing the product off with clear water.  Keep it away from your eyes!! The directions clearly say this twice. I will stay away from tea tree oil products from now on since I am allergic.</li>
            <li> the best face wash I have ever used--I&#x27;ve had moderate acne my whole life and this helps without over drying and irritation. it also has helped with my bacne as well.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of the product on my skin - it&#x27;s cooling/minty and piney. However, I *cannot* figure out how to keep this stuff out of my eyes?! The cooling/minty always seeps in my eyes and translates into cooling/burning my eyeballs. So, I&#x27;ve relegated this product to my chin/nose area.</li>
            <li> I love love the face wash. It makes my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Trader Joe&#x27;s products usually have good reputations, with decent ingredients, often near organic. This facial wash is no exception. It has a lot of natural elements, such as essential oils and plant extracts. Tea tree oil is good for oily skin and deep cleansing purpose. You will probably pay more if you purchase similar items from spas or natural stores. I refer to the price at TJ&#x27;s stores, not necessary on Amazon, since it varies depending on the sellers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This face wash does have a strong herbal, medicinal smell; personally I don&#x27;t find it unpleasant. It is mainly from the tea tree essential oil. It doesn&#x27;t linger after washing; therefore, it should not be a concern if you don&#x27;t care for the odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for 4 not 5 stars: the thin texture. It is quite watery or runny that it is not easy to &amp;#34;apply&amp;#34; to the face in a controlled manner. I usually leave my eye circles alone when washing face. However, due to the thin texture, it tends to drip. In addition, the wash does sting eyes if it gets in, as some customer complained. Therefore, I &amp;#34;make sure&amp;#34; my eyes are closed when using it and rinse it thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the texture matter, this face wash deep cleans the skin without over-drying. The tea tree oil generally reduces acne issues and promotes clearer skin. However, it may not for everybody. Stop using it if your skin reacts with irritations or redness, as some customers mentioned.</li>
            <li> To preface... I have VERY sensitive, acne-prone skin... This product is awesome! I used it for the first time about a year ago and liked that it cleaned my face well, it wasn&#x27;t drying, improved the overall tone of my skin, and helped with breakouts (rarely have issues now). I don&#x27;t live by a Trader Joe&#x27;s anymore, and when I ran out of this stuff my skin instantly broke out. I tried a few of my old washes.. Neutrogena, Panoxyl, nothing helped... I even tried buying a tea tree face wash from the natural foods store in town, but none of it helped. Thanks to Amazon, I was able to order it! Now I make sure I always have a backup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- natural ingredients&lt;br /&gt;- CHEAP, about $5&lt;br /&gt;- works amazing&lt;br /&gt;- leaves skin feeling clean&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t dry it out&lt;br /&gt;- smells good... if you like tea tree oil. I do :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY con&lt;br /&gt;- it does burn the heck out of your eyes (I use the Trader Joe&#x27;s jojoba oil afterwards to remove eye makeup)</li>
            <li> this is a refreshing wash, It would sometimes make my face feel too tight but it is also a great body wash especially for body acne</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time,  It is  absolutely.the best.</li>
            <li> Love it/Hate it.  Great product - unless you use it in the shower.  If you notice that it makes you cough when you rinse it off, then you should stop using it immediately.  I was coughing regularly after rinsing - it just didn&#x27;t agree with me, and then one day my bronchial tubes closed up completely and it took 30 seconds for me to force enough air in to get a good cough.  I stayed swollen for about an hour, but breathed well enough.  I may be allergic, although I&#x27;m not allergic to any other products, and I don&#x27;t have asthma. I still use the product on my feet and legs from time to time.  Tea Tree oil is considered poisonous if ingested, so you don&#x27;t want use it anywhere it might get inside you - even in the smallest quantities.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week now and so far I&#x27;m am really impressed! I&#x27;ve been struggling with acne for 3 years now and have tried so many products and remedys to get rid of it, I went off and on with acne problems but it never fully went away. Even though my face isn&#x27;t completely clear yet it is alot better, not as red, and the best part is its not irritated. If you struggle with acne or are just looking for a good cleanser than this is a very good product :)</li>
            <li> I love this wash, works great for sensitive, oily skin. Also, if you have a Trader Joes nearby, you should get it there because it&#x27;s half the price in the store.</li>
            <li> This Face Wash is the One. Clean, fresh feeling that never leaves my skin feeling tight or dry. I am sensitive yet acne-prone, and this is hands-down the most gentle, yet effective cleanser I have put on my face. Lathers nicely, rinses clean. I enjoy the smell, and can&#x27;t imagine that it would put anyone off enough to not use the product.</li>
            <li> Great product. Great price. I won&#x27;t use another face soap ever again. Seems to have cleared most of my problem skin and now I use it on my body. Even cleared up my husbands athletes foot.</li>
            <li> This product works great! I&#x27;m 30 and still get pimples. Using this has greatly reduced my gross face issues! I used to use abrasive cleansers but now I just use this in the morning and at night. You only need to use a very tiny amount, like 1/4 pump should do it. Then lather it up and go to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: It smells great.</li>
            <li> I tried this face wash and, while it seems to clean my face well, it seems like more of an astringent wash.  The first time I washed my face I washed around my eyes as well and it bothered my eyes when I washed over them.  From then I tried to keep it away from my eyes when washing.  I recently went on a trip and packed the face wash.  I liked that you could close the lid tight to pack it so it wouldn&#x27;t leak.  However, when I went to use it the first time, it sprayed into my eyes as I opened it.  I guess some had built up in the nozzle.  It burned my eyes so badly that I was incapacitated for about 30 minutes.  I continually had to wash my eyes out with water and was in so much pain I couldn&#x27;t do anything else and was shaking and cried some.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite facial soap for summer.  Very deep cleaning and breaks down all the facial oils leaving a great smooth, non-oily face.  Note - I can&#x27;t use this product in the winter months.  (My skin gets too dry in the winter so I have to use a soap that also hydrates.)</li>
            <li> I am a 28 year old female and I have had horrible cystic acne most of my adult life. I have tried everything from Proactive to persciptions (topical and oral) NOTHING worked... until I started using this face wash. I&#x27;ve been using it a month and since then have only had 2 bumps, which only lasted about 2 days each. I don&#x27;t really care for the smell the face wash (I think it&#x27;s the tea tree oil?) but once I wash and then rinse I can hardly smell it. It&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks badly and its runny like water. I guess I missed the two other ratings that warned me this product smells like vomit.</li>
            <li> I am so far very happy with my purchase.  I made this purchase in hopes to help with acne.  Dr. Axe (google him he&#x27;s awesome) recommends face wash with tea tree oil so I chose this one because of that and all the natural ingredients.  I have hormonal acne, every month I get 3-10 horribly painful pimples.  After just 3 days I can already notice a difference, not kidding, even my husband said &amp;#34;wow, your face looks great!&amp;#34;  It is very liquidy, just a speck goes a long way, so be cautious when squirting, it will go everywhere if you&#x27;re not careful.  And avoid your eyes, it really stings!  Hopefully this is my hormonal acne cure!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because Trader Joe&#x27;s has a reputation of being natural and highly rated. I liked it but its not for me. I have sensitive skin and it was a little too harsh for me. All the smell was horrible but other than that if you have sensitive skin I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend it but if you don&#x27;t go ahead and give it a try.</li>
            <li> smells terrible. feels clean.</li>
            <li> This face wash is very harsh. My face is still burning and it has been 2 hours since I washed my face with it.  I have since rewashed it and put some coconut oil on my face and it still feels like it&#x27;s on fire.  If you have sensitive skin like me,  this might not be the product for you.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in the store and fell in love with the smell. I have oily skin that is prone to break outs once a month. After using this for a week, the texture and appearance of my skin looked amazing. I also use a bentonite clay mask once a month that I mix with apple cider vinergar. The mask works great when your period rolls around and those annoying break outs start to pop up. I found the bentonite at Whole foods in the beauty section.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it before. Great price for a natural product.</li>
            <li> Excellent facial product. Good for greesy skin.</li>
            <li> Contrary to other reviews this actually made my acne worse, think it may have been too drying for my skin. Will not buy again .</li>
            <li> If you have acne give this a try. I tried everything from Pro Active to more expensive skin systems and none of them worked as well as this simple face wash. Tea tree oil leaves your skin clean and fresh without over drying like most acne treatments.</li>
            <li> Being 20 years old I&#x27;ve always been dealt with acne. My face has been a lot clearer due to the fact that I started to use more natural products on my face recently. I was introduced to this product by a friend who let me use her face wash because I left mine at home and I&#x27;M SO GLAD I DID. After using this product for only 2 days I noticed a difference in my face! Blemishes that have been on my face forever became lighter in appearance. I have a mixture between oily, sensitive, and dry skin so it&#x27;s always hard to find a product that works well. I highly recommend you try this out! Just don&#x27;t over use it because it will make your skin dry. I only use it in the morning/nighttime.</li>
            <li> Its a little too thin I find myself having to use 2-3 squirts, the smell is a little strong too but that&#x27;s what Tea Tree Oil smells like. Other than that this face wash is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve been using it for three days now and it has made my face smoother and it has cleared up blemishes that I had around my jaw line that was caused by menstrual cycle. Cleans the dirt and oil off your face, you can use this on your chest and neck too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this now for 4 weeks.  In addition to night sweats and mood swings, at the age of 46 I&#x27;ve developed adult acne.  Yay!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m highly allergic to noxema type products, and cetaphyl didn&#x27;t really eliminate the acne.  This product does.  It smells rather like an antiseptic, and I find I need to use a moisturizer after, but it really helped me.  The price is right too.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over six months now and am immensely pleased with the results. I have adult acne (I am in my 40s) which flares up at certain times of the month, and I really did not want to take prescription acne medication. My sister recommended washing my face with a cleanser that had tea tree oil. I was impressed by the positive reviews here on Amazon, and decided to try Trader Joe&#x27;s SPA Face Wash with Tea Tree Oil. It has a pleasant scent that is not overpowering, and just a little squirt goes a long way. First, I wash my face, and then I gently rub in the cleanser until it foams up and I wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note is that this stings big time if it gets into your eyes - so there is need for some caution. Otherwise, this product has managed to keep my acne under control.</li>
            <li> I love it as a cleanser....brings glow back to dull skin ...</li>
            <li> I started using this product about a month ago.  I wanted to give it some time before I wrote a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dried out my face a lot!  To the point that it was kind of peeling.  Even with using a good moisturizer, it helped, but it stil felt tight and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, it broke me out even more so than what I was already, which being someone with acne was disappointing.  This has happened to me before, as the saying goes, it gets worse before it gets better sometimes holds true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just recently, my face has been starting to clear up.  Not completely, but it&#x27;s getting there...  Hopefully the more I use it, the better it will get.  If not, I will not be buying anymore of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and it stinks!  lol  I have used some pretty nasty stuff in the past, I have to say tho, this isn&#x27;t the worst, lol.</li>
            <li> This face wash has a horrible smell and will sting your eyes...so beware. Using without a face moisturizer will definitely dry out your face. I prefer Trader Joe&#x27;s - Nourish All in One Facial Cleanser as it is gentler on my skin and has resulted in fewer breakouts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with acne for the last 10 years, and no matter what type of medicated face wash or even sensitive skin soap I used, my skin never really got better. I switched to tea tree wash based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation. While it took a month or so of use to see results, my skin has been SO much smoother and less prone to blemishes. I&#x27;m not in love with the smell, but since I use it in the shower, it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> This is the best face wash I have ever used.  I struggled for years with really bad acne, and tried EVERYTHING aside from accutane. Prescriptions, expensive products, proactiv, etc. After using this product for 3 months my skin is clear, soft, and smooth. Perfect</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great face wash, it just washes away clean. It can be a little drying, so it&#x27;s better for oily skin. Also, the pump dispenses to much most of the time and it&#x27;s waste. I transfer mine into a dump bottle to eliminate this problem.</li>
            <li> I liked this soap. I had been using it for months. Then: If you accidentally squirt this product into your eyes, it will probably take you some time to recover. Pumping some into my hand, the soap ricochetted off of my palm and went directly into both of my eyes. Crazy, yes, I know. My husband and I spent 45 minutes flushing my eyes with warm water and lubricating eye drops. I couldn&#x27;t open my eyes for more than a second or two and for some reason was light sensitive. It hurt like a monkey for at least an hour. The intense stinging stopped after about 2 hours, but all the next day my eyelids were slightly swollen and my eyes were quite red and sensitive. I&#x27;d say, all told, it took 48 hours to fully recover. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth it...I&#x27;m just lucky I was home and not at the gym!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for acne and, just as importantly, for simply having a face wash with natural ingredients and no harsh chemicals. I just wanted to let everyone know that Desert Essence and Trader Joe&#x27;s must have made a deal because the ingredients are exactly the same as [[ASIN:B001CMV8FG Desert Essence Thoroughly Clean Face Wash Refill, 32-Ounce, 2.5 Bottle]], so go with whichever one you can find at a lower price. I bought the 8.5 oz. pump bottle at my local Trader Joe&#x27;s for about $6. Do that to try it out and then if you like it, get the large 32 oz. refill from Desert Essence and just use it to fill up your pump bottle when you need to!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF.  Makes my face feel so soft and clean.  Gentle and natural, definitely recommended, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Love how it foams up. Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything for my acne breakouts.... everything over-the-counter I could find, mail order products (Proactive, Murad, etc), expensive gizmos like Zeno, and dermatologist visits and prescriptions all with little or no luck.  Either they dried out my face too much leading to sore cracked skin and still breakouts, or &amp;#34;sort of&amp;#34; better solutions that didn&#x27;t keep things clear long enough for the last breakout to heal completely and fade before the next.  I have (had now) hormonal breakouts that followed a regular monthly cycle, with minor breakouts throughout the month, they started in my teens and never ended.  For about 20 years I&#x27;ve tried everything with no success.....until this. It may not be advertised as an acne &amp;#34;medicine&amp;#34; face wash, but it has made all the difference for me.  It didn&#x27;t dry me out like Salicylic acid or benzoylperoxide products, but it cleared my skin.....and it has stayed clear for over a month now.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase... for the first time on over 20 years I leave my house without concealer.</li>
            <li> This face wash is excellent. The pump got clogged so I transferred the contents to other bottles (with flip tops). I keep one in the shower and one by the sink. Has really lasted a long time. You only need a little and lather it up in your hands and apply to your face. It rinses nice and clean with no lingering residue.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS AMAZING!!! I&#x27;m 17 and I have moderate acne, its always been a problem and I was searching for a product to get it under control. I bought this face wash in Trader Joe&#x27;s and every since I&#x27;ve been using it, my face is much more clear! Its seriously so amazing I swear by it! Tea tree oil is seriously one of the best products for your skin.</li>
            <li> This face wash is gentle on my skin. I don&#x27;t use it for any type of skin problem tho. I just use it as a simple cleanser and it feels wonderful. I love all the natural ingredients too!</li>
            <li> I had read about this product and decided to try it,we&#x27;ll let&#x27;s just say it broke out my face. And it stings a little too,I was not pleased with the outcome.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash. I&#x27;ve had trouble finding a face wash that works for my sensitive skin but this stuff is great. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and all you need is a tiny bit for each washing so it lasts forever!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just that...okay! I haven&#x27;t noticed anything different with my skin, and it burns a little. So I&#x27;ll continue to stick with it and see what happens.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash!  I wash my face with it every morning and every evening.  I follow it with Trader Joe&#x27;s jojoba oil in the evening before bed.  My skin has never been so clear!  Most face washes have a tendency to be drying.  I have found this to be very gentle and non-irritating.  Yes it does smell slightly bad, but the smell does not linger.  If you have acne prone skin, I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s this product creating my whiteheads or if it&#x27;s just me but I&#x27;m finishing my money&#x27;s worth. Although a lot of people comment on the smell I think it kind of nice, it actually smells like Fruit Loops to me. I only wash for a few seconds, 10-15 tops, and use coconut oil for a moisturizer. Please tightly close your eyes while washing, I know from experience that tea tree oil BURNS.</li>
            <li> Works good on my skin for breakputs. Helps to clear them faster than other products I have used.</li>
            <li> After an extremely stressful semester, I started developing hormonal acne on both sides of my face, as well as my chin. I decided to try this face wash after a horrible experience with the oil cleansing method. The oil cleansing method helped with my acne a little bit, but also left me with little tiny bumps all over my cheeks (clogged pores?, it was unlike anything that I&#x27;ve seen).   I tried several natural methods but nothing was helping. This face wash cleared my skin up, and got rid of the little bumps that the oil cleansing method left me with.   In the morning I use my hands to apply the face wash to my face, and at night I pump about a 1/2 pump onto an Eco Tools Pure Complexion Facial Sponge to remove my makeup. A little bit goes a long way and it lathers up really well! I use aloe vera moisturizer after cleansing both morning and night. I have never had a problem with this drying out my face and am so happy I have found something that works!   I have been using it for about 3 months now, and I hardly ever get new pimples. If I do get a pimple I can usually attribute it to changes in my diet, and use a little Trader Joe&#x27;s tea tree oil as a spot treatment, it does a great job of drying and flattening out pimples overnight. I even use this face wash to clean my makeup brushes and beauty blender. This is the first face wash I&#x27;m going to repurchase after trying so many different products. It&#x27;s such a great price, and lasts a really long time, too! I hope that this works for others as well as it has for me!</li>
            <li> I hardly ever write reviews, but I have to say this is the best face wash I have ever used. I have always suffered from acne, and finally by the age of 24 it has cleared up and I can say it is primarily due to this face wash. After washing your face with this, it feels so incredibly clean. Other face washes don&#x27;t take off my make up, which I think was always my problem. But with this one, there is zero dirt or remaining make up on my face. I will be a lifetime customer of this and won&#x27;t know what to do if I ever have to go without it! The smell is not the best I&#x27;ve ever smelt and if it gets in your eyes it really burns...but these are very small prices to pay for the clearest &amp; most beautiful skin I have ever had. I would not hesitate and would buy this right away....I have never used a product I feel this strongly about &amp; can truly attest to it actually working! I hope you find the same results :)</li>
            <li> This got my face super clean. Love the Tea Tree oil for acne, but the wash makes my face super dry, so I only use it occasionally and wash my face with warm water the rest of the time.</li>
            <li> I did not order this off amazon, because you can just get it from Trader Joe&#x27;s. When I was in trader joe&#x27;s I was just looking around and stumbled on this. It was all natural, but under $6 bucks. I was suspicious and did not think it would work well. But it was cheap, so I decided to give it a try. This has ruined me from other face washes!! I use to never really wash my face every day. It was a hassle and my skin is pretty good. But I LOVE washing my face everyday with this stuff. ( I know, I sound like an infomercial but I&#x27;m a real person lol). I love washing my face everyday, because I can feel how refreshed my skin is, also it leaves my skin even more soft and silky than it already is. This says a lot because my skin is naturally pretty soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have too much acne issues except around my period, but before using this it would take a week or so for my acne to go away. Now, it&#x27;s gone like two days later! The only negative thing I have to say is right after you wash your face with this, you definitely need a lotion follow up. Sometimes when I wipe this face wash off, it feels almost  too clean. Maybe it&#x27;s stripping too much of my natural oils? I don&#x27;t know. But it&#x27;s not a big issue because the product is obviously doing it&#x27;s job. The squeaky clean feeling only lasts until I put some lotion on. Also it seems as if this is making my acne scars fade. I noticed the other day that they seem to be lighting up. I also don&#x27;t have as many black and white heads. My skin is nice and fresh and clean! Hurray!!</li>
            <li> I adore this face wash, it smells nice (albeit different than your typical wash), and it really helps control my acne! My only complaint is that the bottles themselves are shoddily made- the cap comes off far too easily, and does not appear to go back on once it&#x27;s off.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!! For years I used Proactiv (which worked) but was disappointed that I couldn&#x27;t find something more natural to keep my face clear. I spent a lot of money trying out different natural face products, feeling like it would be well worth the extra money if any of it worked....but none of it did. So I kept using Proactiv...until I went on a trip with co-workers, and one of my co-workers (who also happens to be an esthetician) saw me using Proactiv and told me how bad it is for your face. I told her that I agreed with her and had tried other products but that nothing had worked. She told me to use tea tree oil. So I started using tea tree oil (and sometimes raw honey and apple cider vinegar, after googling natural acne cures). Much to my delight, this routine totally worked! After about a month of this, I happened to be shopping at Trader Joe&#x27;s when I noticed this face wash. I didn&#x27;t know if a tea tree face wash would be potent enough, but again, I was pleasantly surprised. This stuff totally works! And I am so grateful.</li>
            <li> This is the best face wash I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve been struggling with breakouts for the past couple of months and nothing seemed to be helping. Somebody recommended giving tea tree oil a shot, and I took their advice on a whim. Within a week or so, I could see changes in my skin. Feels really clean and smooth after washing. Has a strong smell, but it doesn&#x27;t linger. I&#x27;ll be purchasing this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy transaction. Not in love with the product. It dries my face out really bad.</li>
            <li> Face cleared up within days!</li>
            <li> I read an article on stumble upon...was interested so came on amazon to look it up.  The article said that it was designed by a man who has made several high end products...article also continued to say this is the same formula as the very over priced products for the a much more resonable price thus is why I wanted to try it.  Well worth the try and will reorder.  Only con: Is the packageing which I contacted and had made right by amazon.  It was not sealed right and leaked on some other items I ordered at the same time. BTW works well with the moisturizers in this same line!</li>
            <li> This is not what I expected. The product does not smell good at all. I&#x27;ve purchased another product from Florida&#x27;s Best which smells great and leaves your skin feeling tingly. I will not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> For me, this is simply the best facial wash I&#x27;ve found in the 20 years I&#x27;ve been looking. I wish I&#x27;d had it as an acne-riddled teen. I hope it works the same for others.</li>
            <li> Love this product and use it daily</li>
            <li> The BEST face wash I have found so far!  It leaves your skin smooth and clean feeling.  The greatest benefit I have seen so far is that it has refined the enlarged pores on my nose!  I&#x27;ve had them forever and now they are hardly noticeable.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t use it if you have overly dry or very sensitive skin, as the tea tree oil could irritate it.  There are a few things you have to get used to with this product though...it smells like tea tree oil, not perfume. Personally, I see this as a good thing and the smell rinses away anyway.  Also, the product is thinner than might be expected but it does a fantastic job of lathering up.  Lastly, you will probably want to moisturize afterward because it is a bit drying.  It&#x27;s a quality product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of years, and it is absolutely awesome. The only thing that has kept my face, neck, and shoulders clean and clear. Nothing else compares!</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser. If you aren&#x27;t familiar with castile soap, and how to use it, it can be very drying. It takes a VERY small amount and a LOT of water to cut it. You really have to rinse and rinse, so I like to keep it in the shower. I live in south Florida and work outside regularly, but I&#x27;m still a girly girl that loves her makeup. And I have cystic acne. It melts away the day&#x27;s sweat and makeup, even waterproof mascara. And the tea tree oil definitely battles inflamed acne. You will want to use a good moisturizer afterwards, but for cutting the crud off of your face, nothing is better.</li>
            <li> My complexion had improved! I used this with the face wipes.</li>
