            <li>It does have a very good weight which I liked.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but the lighting just isn&#x27;t the best.  </li>

            <li>Handy with no cord!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice compact and lights up!</li>
            <li>My Daughter loves having her own makeup mirror, thank you for the timely delivery!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still a nice looking mirror!</li>
            <li>Nice!</li>
            <li>This is a great mirror and the light is the perfect brightness for doing makeup!</li>
            <li>The mirror was shipped and it arrived promptly, its just not that bright</li>
            <li>Not as bright as I thought it would be</li>
            <li>Illumination is not as bright as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>really bright for battery operated</li>
            <li>Still, good quality.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a good mirror for makeup</li>
            <li>The picture shows the light as yellowish glow but its honestly blueish!!!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still good.</li>
            <li>nice mirror, but the lighting isn&#x27;t great, and the batteries drain in about 10 min of use... should have returned it.</li>
            <li>Good quality, good price.</li>
            <li>Lighting is good.</li>
            <li>Good product good price</li>
            <li>A good medium  size.  </li>
            <li>Looks good on the vanity too.</li>
            <li>Mirror has good magnification.</li>
            <li>Mirror is good.</li>
            <li>Good purchase.</li>
            <li>Girlfriend loved she has had no issues with it just buy rechargable batteries.</li>
            <li>the 5x is not as good as i thought, will probably order another one but find a 10x.</li>
            <li>Still a good mirror just not what i wanted</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good for putting on makeup.  </li>
            <li>I would take note of the size of the mirror itself before ordering to see if the size is good for you.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but, when I start to use it make a good job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend for people who have a limit space and want a good mirror.&lt;br /&gt;ps.</li>
            <li>Aside from that, good construction</li>
            <li>But the mirror is of good quality aside from the lighting issue.</li>
            <li>really good mirror</li>
            <li>I was very pleased and the one I gave it to lived th mirror good going</li>
            <li>The light isn&#x27;t very bright on this one.</li>
            <li>so I am very pleased with that function.</li>
            <li>But its a great idea to have magnification, and the light!  </li>
            <li>still happy though :)</li>
            <li>Maybe I should have read the description better but it still works great for its size.  </li>
            <li>is a great mirror if you need one to travel with and can&#x27;t be sure about the electric.  </li>
            <li>but the light wasn&#x27;t bright!</li>
            <li>The light on it isn&#x27;t that strong or bright but the magnification is perfect.</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>I love this mirror!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I thought my skin was pretty awesome....</li>
            <li>Great for seeing fine hairs and looking at pores and applying makeup</li>
            <li>this is amazing.</li>
            <li>I had to buy another kind for my daughter who I gave to for a gift.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to be getting them for all our students soon, and incouraging students with vision problems to buy their own to take along with them when they graduate.</li>
            <li>I liked the mirror (and</li>
            <li>I bought this because I liked the fact that it was lighted.</li>
            <li>It does NOT come with any kind of adaptor.</li>
            <li>good for close ups mostly but not for putting on</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and perfect size</li>
            <li>Also is is the kind that takes batteries.</li>
            <li>This is a Nice scale, works well and looks sleek.</li>
            <li>Nice battery operated mirror for the price</li>
            <li>Looks nice and with the batts installed</li>
            <li>My daughter loves it though, fits nicely on her bathroom vanity.  </li>
            <li>This provides the assistance nicely.</li>
            <li>Purchased as a gift for  friend, but it was not the kind she wanted.  </li>
            <li>it render it effective.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t as nice as I thought, my loss.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s my own fault.</li>
            <li>I had a very large and very bright make up mirror for years.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice classic shape and sits perfectly on my makeup table.</li>
            <li>The light is VERY dim but the mirror is very good light weight material is excellent</li>
            <li>The mirror is a good size but the battery operated light worked once for me.</li>
            <li>but the light isn&#x27;t that bright.</li>
            <li>WONDERFUL ADDITION TO MY VANITY AREA ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE ROOM.  </li>
            <li>but the light isn&#x27;t that bright in my opinion</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter at Christmas - she LOVED it - the light worked for 3 days and quit.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, the mirror is okay</li>
            <li>And the light isn&#x27;t really bright, so I still have to have a lamp beside the mirror.</li>
            <li>The light does not get that bright</li>
            <li>Light is not that bright.</li>
            <li>the light is not so bright but works ok.</li>
            <li>I thought since it was Conair it would be a great product, don&#x27;t buy this, CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP!</li>
            <li>My husband needed this so he could shave in bed, laid up do to surgery, and it is excellent, light better than reviews say and very well made item.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cheap quality for the price.</li>
            <li>But on the bright side, it&#x27;s light and easy to carry around.</li>
            <li>I loved this mirror for the first week I had it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay for the price.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to manufacture a product with parts that wear out, make sure you keep plenty of replacement parts in stock.  </li>
            <li>I get better illumination from my overhead 60W soft-white.  </li>
            <li>Lighted up part wasn&#x27;t much better</li>
            <li>you get the more you need magnification.  </li>
            <li>Satisfied with merchandise</li>
            <li>The magnified side of the mirror helps her apply her makeup better, and the lighted section is also convenient.</li>
            <li>To top it off, the bulb burned out after two uses.</li>
            <li>make sure you read size.</li>
            <li>Extremely pleased, no complaints here.</li>
            <li>It would make a nice night light - that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li>Plus the mirror is so cute defenitely something I like.</li>
            <li>Which is a bit of a downer, considering I was hoping to get something with a bit more weight to ensure it doesnt move around.</li>
            <li>And the fact that it has a regular reflection and 5x magnification is great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok for plucking my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I love the ascetics of the mirror.</li>
            <li>Love the electric use</li>
            <li>I love this mirror.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>than I thought, might as well buy it from.a.local store to be safe about the size their about the same.price</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I love this because I was getting it to go in my dorm room.</li>
            <li>I love this mirror</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping</li>
            <li>but I still use it!  :)</li>
            <li>It is a good mirror but the light doesn&#x27;t really do any good at all.</li>
            <li>It is more for decoration then anything else.</li>
            <li>Size of mirror was ok.</li>
            <li>have since purchased another mirror that meets my needs, and I&#x27;ll keep this because I think it will work OK as a travel mirror when the time comes.</li>
            <li>I have to set it on top of things</li>
            <li>but had I known I would&#x27;ve saved and gotten something of better quality.</li>
            <li>HAVE NOT EVEN BEEN ABLE TO USE IT.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like this Mirror much better, if I could find the replacement lamps for it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because it was so cute, and had the Conair name.  </li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I can do better using a magnified mirror and a table lamp.</li>
            <li>It might be better in brighter lighting.</li>
            <li>Does not work most of the time even with the batteries.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite for the price</li>
            <li>Love that it runs on batteries, so</li>
            <li>This is ok</li>
            <li>otherwise ok.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t put on my face without it! :)</li>
            <li>Maybe would be okay as a child&#x27;s toy...</li>
            <li>I could not be more upset.</li>
            <li>make sure you check the size.  </li>
            <li>She uses it daily and says the lighting and magnification are perfect for her needs.</li>
            <li>and they were more than helpful and refunded my money.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy another one, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>the light didn&#x27;t work at all!</li>
            <li>love the idea of battery operated, can be moved/used  anywhere</li>
            <li>I was expecting much more illumination.  </li>
            <li>The mirror is of very good quality and the zoom on the mirror makes it easy to see things on your face and the light works pretty well.</li>
            <li>It has a lovely finish that makes it decorative, the lighting is just right, not too bright.</li>
            <li>It has a lovely finish that makes it decorative, the lighting is just right, not too bright</li>
            <li>very accurate.i liked it a lot.has butter and that convinient for me.im very pleased</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a great mirror, but I needed a decent size mirror with lights that I can take with me on trips.</li>
            <li>Pretty good for its price.</li>
            <li>The light is not as bright as I had hoped, it is good for general use, like applying make up, but when you need to see detail like grooming your eye brows, it could be better.</li>
            <li>The mirror is very nice with good magnification and light and sturdy enough to sit well on any surface.  </li>
            <li>Love the mirror itself, but the battery dies very quickly.  </li>
            <li>The light isn&#x27;t very bright, and 5X magnification just barely allows me to see the stray hairs I wanted to pluck.  </li>
            <li>I wish I had bought one with more magnification because the light does not help you see any clearer.</li>
            <li>size is Ok, its Light weight ..</li>
            <li>The problem is cheap bulbs that you will not be able to find.</li>
            <li>Oh, and the oh-so-dim light burned out within a week, just as many others report.</li>
            <li>The light is not as bright as I would have expected it to be, but it is great for a travel mirror that is lighted.</li>
            <li>The light doesn&#x27;t really help much, but the price was best at Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is okay, if you don&#x27;t mind the light going out, it&#x27;s fine...</li>
            <li>Other than that its perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to see one just like the one I have used and love.  </li>
            <li>But with such a great price, its not something im concerned about. :)  2)</li>
            <li>It should be easily replaceable too.</li>
            <li>As there are no cords, it is easy to manoeuvre around.</li>
            <li>Fits easily on the counter.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this mirror very much - a good size for older person.</li>
            <li>When I first got it, it seemed to be fine although I would have liked brighter lights.</li>
            <li>This is flimsy and cheap, and for some reason the batteries die very quickly every time I replace them.</li>
            <li>The mirror magnification is just fine.</li>
            <li>Seemed to work just fine.</li>
            <li>This mirror works fine.</li>
            <li>Came and didn&#x27;t light up; I returned it easily though.</li>
            <li>Very upset with this item I always have to put a new battery every time for the light to be very bright</li>
            <li>The amount of light is adequate for me and the magnification is more than I even need.  </li>
            <li>The light isnt too bright or too dim...</li>
            <li>But honestly if I were you I would add 20$ and get a Real Makeup mirror with light.</li>
            <li>but that was probably a huge oversight on my part.</li>
            <li>Light just do not turn on anymore .</li>
            <li>so if you need the light plus the magnification, please don&#x27;t spend your money.</li>
            <li>Light stopped working after a couple days.  </li>
            <li>Light worked once.</li>
            <li>I would recommend they make the light a LOT brighter.</li>
            <li>the light blew out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Returned this item, Amazon is great on returns and overall customer service.</li>
            <li>This mirror could just as well be an &amp;quot;unlighted mirror&amp;quot; for the amount of light it gives off.  </li>
            <li>The light didn&#x27;t come on but I made myself be patient and look at the instructions</li>
            <li>As for the light bulb, mine has not burnt out yet</li>
            <li>I have had this product for 5 years and the light just went out.</li>
            <li>I take this light when I travel even when we go camping</li>
            <li>thought it would be a brighter light, but i still like it.  </li>
            <li>have to use the overhead room light to pluck unwanted eyebrow hairs.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the cordless aspect, but the way it burns through batteries just doesn&#x27;t make it worth it.</li>
            <li>Put the batteries in and turned the light on.</li>
            <li>Replaced batteries and there was barely a light that came on then</li>
            <li>I like the light weight and cordless aspect</li>
            <li>She still uses the mirror and says she didn&#x27;t care about the light.</li>
            <li>The light is all around the mirror</li>
            <li>The light stopped working after 3 days.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy it for the light.</li>
            <li>but no, the light stopped working.</li>
            <li>The light is a bonus.  </li>
            <li>LIGHT DOES NOT SHINE ON THE MIRROR</li>
            <li>Great mirror, too short.</li>
            <li>The light is insufficient.</li>
            <li>I thought it would have a brighter light</li>
            <li>of cheap material l.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this mirror 1 month, and the light is burned out already.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in light at my makeup area - which is why I ordered the product.</li>
            <li>I tried to change the batteries and nothing could seem to restore the light.</li>
            <li>I liked this mirror so much that I bought my mother one, too.</li>
            <li>Even after replacing the light bulb, it no longer works.</li>
            <li>I have to buy batteries for the light.</li>
            <li>The light never works.</li>
            <li>I placed batteries inside and the light didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I even replaced the bulb; even though I just opened it from the box, the light still didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t buy this mirror if you want a light.</li>
            <li>Light does not stay on</li>
            <li>Had to return -- light didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>the light stopped working after 2 days.</li>
            <li>so I figure the light is just burned out.</li>
            <li>I tried turning it off then on again, the light still did not work.</li>
            <li>I bought this specifically for the light</li>
            <li>Iv&#x27;e had this mirror for a while now and the light still hasn&#x27;t gone out.</li>
            <li>it came cracked, and the light literally worked once or twice before it died.  </li>
            <li>Light in both sides.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter and the light blew out within 3 or 4 days.</li>
            <li>Does it light?</li>
            <li>The light isn&#x27;t fantastic</li>
            <li>I was hopint to use this as the light I use to do makeup with.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Dissapointed about the light.</li>
            <li>the light around the mirror is way too dim to do much good.</li>
            <li>I would love to return it if I hadn&#x27;t thrown out the box the night before after I first opened it, tested it and all seemed fine.</li>
            <li>Works great, but the light is pretty dim.</li>
            <li>One day this semester I found one of these Conair mirrors at a thrift store cheap and lent it to a student who was having this kind of problem, and immediately she went from barely being able to apply the stuff, to our \\&quot;star\\&quot; of the class.  </li>
            <li>The mirror is double sided with a great magnifying side and a nice normal size side .&lt;br</li>
            <li>the light is a nice feature and on requires 3 AA batteries.. HIGHLY recommended</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find a 5x lighted magnification mirror.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s perfect and very portable!</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this mirror ,I got it home and turned it on</li>
            <li>I originally made the purchase to get my wife out of the bathroom when doing her make-up.</li>
            <li>Also, for me, a higher magnification would be better.</li>
            <li>Even without the light the mirror is super.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping which I enjoy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s SUPER light weight.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it is a good mirror, but if you are looking for a brighter light, try a different model or corded version.</li>
            <li>Light doesn&#x27;t get bright enough at all.</li>
            <li>Other than that the light for the mirror works great.</li>
            <li>It was much smaller and not as bright as I needed to be .</li>
            <li>Smaller than I thought but daughter loved it.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t even begin to see good enough to put on make up or anything.  </li>
            <li>good for a teen or child</li>
            <li>I ordered it from the &amp;#34;warehouse&amp;#34; for such a good price.  </li>
            <li>I was able to use it this morning while i was getting ready for work.</li>
            <li>Hence why it didnt recieve a full 5 stars from me.</li>
            <li>I love that it magnifies and I can see alot better especially with the light.</li>
            <li>the actual mirror is good quality.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much difference between this one and one without a light!</li>
            <li>batteries coroded fast in the casing, not bathroom humidity safe</li>
            <li>Following cataract surgery, I now do not have any close-up vision and hoped this would be good for putting on mascara, but NO.</li>
            <li>Mirror arrived quickly, and worked , but the mirror was not of the best quality, and the light was not bright at all.</li>
            <li>If it plugged in, the light might be the right level.</li>
            <li>I have to get right up to the mirror for the light to reflect on my face.</li>
            <li>Great product just wish the light was a little brighter.</li>
            <li>Other than those 2 things, Im really happy with it.</li>
            <li>I loved this product at first but two days later light stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;Kind</li>
            <li>The cost is more than just buying a new mirror!  </li>
            <li>The mirror&#x27;s light is quite dim and the magnification (5x)is inadequate for most purposes.</li>
            <li>This doesnt really bother me, as I much prefer batteries over any kind of cables.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>The batteries drain rather quickly as well.</li>
            <li>and it goes through batteries relatively quickly.</li>
            <li>goes thru batteries way too quick</li>
            <li>I love the size for my dorm room, but the light was so dim</li>
            <li>and then get raked over the coals on high priced specialty light bulbs - BINGO!    </li>
            <li>The light around this mirror does nothing but look pretty.</li>
            <li>only good part is the magnifying mirror, but the lighting is not adequate for indoors like an electric makeup mirror would provide.... great if you are sitting outside in the sun in a lawn chair...on a sunny day in warm climate..</li>
            <li>I put brand new Duracells in it and was able to use it once for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>and so glad to have a new one.</li>
            <li>VERY PORTABLE AND CAN BE PACKED EASILY IN SUITCASE...</li>
            <li>It also was very well wrapped and packaged and arrived very quickly,</li>
            <li>Round light/mirror and magnification perfect for our old eyes!</li>
            <li>batteries, put them in and the light worked very dully for like 5 minutes then went off and now doesnt work at all!&lt;br /&gt;must</li>
            <li>But if you really want it for the light you should work on a battery solution.</li>
            <li>but I still use it everyday because it has a great mirror</li>
            <li>the light really doesnt make a diference.  </li>
            <li>I am now in the market for a plug-in one, the battery life lasts for literally 2-3 uses and the light is very dim.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money.</li>
            <li>I didnt really buy it for the light anyways.....</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really use the light anymore because it doesn&#x27;t make a difference.</li>
            <li>The mirror light is also very weak.&lt;br /&gt;Do not recommend.</li>
            <li>I like the magnification, and the light is very helpful as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice mirror to have wear a bigger mirror is located so that you can transition to this one if you want to get a closer look of something.</li>
            <li>Gets over heated and turns off the light, light is really dim.</li>
            <li>Love that it does not need a cord.&lt;br /&gt;Mirror was clear and magnified side did not seem to have distortion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok but in dim lighting</li>
            <li>The product has a mind of its own, only work sometimes, do not buy.</li>
            <li>So i was kind pf taken back at what I paid for $25.00.</li>
            <li>Deferentially worth your money.</li>
            <li>Finally found it, I was so excited!!</li>
            <li>In an obscure place I found the bulb with the right voltage but not the right wattage.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just right for my needs.</li>
            <li>Its just the right size to move around.</li>
            <li>I tried it out right when I received it in the mail.</li>
            <li>It is great however, its too small, and I have to keep moving side to side to get the mirror to focus where I want it to.     </li>
            <li>The lighting isn&#x27;t too bad, it isn&#x27;t bright but it is still a good amount of light.</li>
            <li>Excellent present for my young teenage girls.</li>
            <li>Batteries drain super fast with this mirror.</li>
            <li>Also the light doesn&#x27;t give off enough light.</li>
            <li>everytime you put in new batteries!!!</li>
            <li>This light is very dim</li>
            <li>The light was also very dim.  </li>
            <li>my daughter bought this for her mother and see likes very much.</li>
            <li>Has good weight to it so it doesn&#x27;t fall over easily, the mirrors are very clear, however the Light is awfully weak..</li>
            <li>Even when I tried replacing the batteries after the use, it only worked a couple of more times then refused to even turn on.</li>
            <li>The only place I&#x27;ve been able to find them is on Conair&#x27;s web-site, but wait --</li>
            <li>At first i thought i forgot the button on</li>
            <li>The light is so dim there</li>
            <li>higher magnification and on sale at Costco.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only thing that would be better would be an option to fold with a carrying case for travel  </li>
            <li>But the light is so dim, you can&#x27;t see it in a lit up room.</li>
            <li>The light on the mirror is so dim that it provides no illumination while using it.</li>
            <li>Just a thought though, for those of you interested.  </li>
            <li>then what I expected and the light isn&#x27;t as bright partly because there is only one setting.</li>
            <li>The light on this mirror is too dim for my taste.</li>
            <li>The on /off switch didn&#x27;t work after the first couple of times  </li>
            <li>I love this mirror and use it daily.</li>
            <li>Light is extremely dim.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li>For basic magnifying mirror uses, this is OK.</li>
            <li>My mother has a mirror that&#x27;s just like this one, the only thing is that it lights up much more.</li>
            <li>We are make-up mirror people and I highly recommend this mirror!!</li>
            <li>First time that I saw the mirror I feel like it was too mall to use</li>
            <li>net time i will check the measurments more closely</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li>you may not want anyone to see ;)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The students like them tremendously, and even those with normal vision say they help a lot.  </li>
            <li>Apparently 5X magnification is not as strong as I thought and</li>
            <li>Nice mirror, only it doesn&#x27;t throw enough light to really matter.</li>
            <li>Magnification and light really helps these old eyes see what I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even use the light everyday and when I do, its not for more than a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable and delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>but the light barely works.</li>
            <li>If you want a pretty one to stay on your vanity there are much nicer ones.</li>
            <li>The light doesn&#x27;t stay on very long either and the batteries run out quick.</li>
            <li>put in 3 brand new batteries, turned it on, light is very, very dim.</li>
            <li>Batteries running low very quickly</li>
            <li>I was really surprised that I recieved my item so quickly.</li>
            <li>it makes no difference the light on my phone was better then this mirror waste of money shaking my head!</li>
            <li>good but batteries don&#x27;t last too long</li>
            <li>shipped fast, i love that it doesnt have a cord so you can take it anywhere as long as it has batteries,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good mirror, don&#x27;t get me wrong, the magnifying side is especially helpful, but be prepared to have a dedicated light source behind you, because the light A.) isn&#x27;t very bright and B.) drains batteries like water in a sink.</li>
            <li>The mirror part is great, the light is just not bright enough.</li>
            <li>I find it is very convenient and easy enough to pack for vacation.  </li>
            <li>This is quite small, and the light is not strong but it is perfectly good quality and works fine.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like this very much because the light is very dim and barely makes a difference.</li>
            <li>This mirror is nice, but the light sucks!</li>
            <li>cheap crappy thing with little light</li>
            <li>It casts a faint glow rather than a bright light needed for tweezing, extractions, etc.</li>
            <li>Light does not give out enough light to do makeup and stopped working properly.</li>
            <li>gives off white light.</li>
            <li>and it kills batteries extremely fast</li>
            <li>None of the stores carried much of a selection.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;light\\&quot; really is inadequate for applying make-up.  </li>
            <li>I just got this mirror today and after only 10 minutes, the light stopped working.</li>
            <li>Made my eyebrow plucking and makeup application much easier.</li>
            <li>VERY STURDY.</li>
            <li>U cant see much</li>
            <li>When I went to use it the following day with the light, it wouldn&#x27;t switch on.</li>
            <li>Not enough light</li>
            <li>The internal light burned out, and I needed another.  </li>
            <li>I came across this one and took the chance as it was very well priced.</li>
            <li>It magnifies without much distortion.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t help too much if you want to apply makeup and you are a perfectionist like I am.</li>
            <li>I got LED lights that are much brighter.</li>
            <li>Then you are expecting that upon contacting  CONair and explaining that the unit comes with a defective bulb, they will be reasonable and send one to you...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not too big and it fit with my makeup table.</li>
            <li>The batteries die so fast with this that I have replaced the batteries 4 times</li>
            <li>I came across this one and took the chance as it was very well priced.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>It really goes through batteries.  </li>
            <li>So that only leaves one hand available.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The mirror is ok but the size is not what I expected.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight.</li>
            <li>The light bulb didn&#x27;t last a month and it was quite a problem to find a replacement bulb.  </li>
            <li>Nothing spectacular; not big enough.  </li>
            <li>It could however, make a nice (albeit expensive) night light!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to toss it because the mirror itself is nice but the lights dimmed after a couple of weeks and now are just dead.</li>
            <li>Now I am pretty sure I&#x27;m half lizard.  </li>
            <li>The amount of light given off is about the same as the &lt;1 watt covered led nightlights I buy for saving electricity so I can navigate my home at night without having to turn on the main lights.</li>
            <li>I went out and dredged up two more mirrors for the other students with glasses, and they both improved as well.  </li>
            <li>She went to Mexico and was able to take it with her since it isn&#x27;t bulky like the other one sold at stores.</li>
            <li>I am assuming that&#x27;s because as you slide toward the off button the light goes out, but apparently it&#x27;s not all the way off!</li>
            <li>I love evrything about it except that the light is not bright at all.</li>
            <li>The light is barely noticeable when there is other light in the room.  </li>
            <li>other than that it&#x27;s nice, small and cute.</li>
            <li>Bought for Fiance as a christmas present, light went out before new years with 20 mins of use per day.</li>
            <li>Nice mirror, but really to small.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of small</li>
            <li>and i only got 1 full use out of it before the batteries died.</li>
            <li>Unless you normally tweeze or apply makeup by candlelight you won&#x27;t find this mirror to be much help.</li>
            <li>I even bought new batteries and it still didn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li>When buying a lighted mirror, make sure it takes something approaching a standard bulb - - and I&#x27;d try to avoid CONair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tiny, it falls over, the battery dies almost instantly so using the light is basically out, and it squeaks when I turn it around to use the magnified side!</li>
            <li>Getting older, I&#x27;ve decided I need a lighted mirror.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice mirror but the light is simply USELESS.</li>
            <li>about the light it is not really help that much.</li>
            <li>I only had it for a month before the light around the mirror completely died.</li>
            <li>Nice but smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li>May be nice on a little girl&#x27;s desk, but not for an average-sized human being, perhaps ;)</li>
            <li>The light that the people below complain about is NOT intended to be the only light in the makeup room, but is a small additional light right where a little extra light counts.</li>
            <li>The mirror was a little smaller than expected, but nonetheless a good buy a very useful for travel.</li>
            <li>My wife has had this mirror for a little more than a year.  </li>
            <li>The light is less than bright and if I open my curtains in the bathroom, I see with the mirro justs[ fine, very dull dim lighting</li>
            <li>A whole pack of batteries later and the light won&#x27;t turn back on still.</li>
            <li>It does not provide enough illumination by itself to be that useful.</li>
            <li>It is pretty small to put on your makeup, but it is nicely made, lightweight and battery operated - unlike my 1985 big one.  </li>
            <li>This would make it pretty much the same as an...unlighted mirror!</li>
            <li>This one is still useful though, as a regular mirror.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this if you&#x27;re expecting it to be a normal vanity mirror.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t last long the bright light turns into a yellow dark</li>
            <li>The light was so dim that it was useless, and I had to use a separate desk lamp for adequate light.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave this product even one star, is because the mirror itself is good and I like how one side of it is regular, and the other is magnified.</li>
            <li>The light is not very bright even when the batteries are fresh.</li>
            <li>As long as you remember to turn it off when you&#x27;re not using it you&#x27;ll be fine and the extra 10 watts make a whole lot of difference.</li>
            <li>I still have to use other light when i use this mirror.</li>
            <li>Thought maybe it was the brand new batteries that I just put in</li>
            <li>, i have had to replace the new batteries i put in it in two weeks.</li>
            <li>-- it just needed a new bulb inside.  </li>
            <li>For the price, I&#x27;m just gonna buy a new one rather than trying to find a replacement bulb.</li>
            <li>I received the product, put brand new batteries in it, turned it on and off twice and the bulb immediately burned out.</li>
            <li>I bought this item brand new.</li>
            <li>Small and very cheap looking.  </li>
            <li>Very dim lights.</li>
            <li>It is very dim.</li>
            <li>I was not touching the mirror I was touching the frame and the mirror cracked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;m going to keep it from cracking, but I&#x27;m sure clothes for padding</li>
            <li>The lights start to go dim after one use!</li>
            <li>First mirror arrived - the bulb blew after only one minute of being on.</li>
            <li>When I initially got it I was upset that it was battery operated in the first place</li>
            <li>The light super sucks!</li>
            <li>Mirror is very small, not well made and broke very easy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bit disappointed as the light is not as bright as I was hoping</li>
            <li>Mirror is fine for putting on makeup but light is not bright enough...</li>
            <li>At first, when mine died, I thought it was the bulbs too, but so far, it has only been a battery</li>
            <li>light is super dim, so weak ..</li>
            <li>This mirror is fine as a double sided mirror, but the light, when run with battery  is weak.</li>
            <li>This mirror is smaller than we expected and the light is very dim.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it came quickly ad</li>
            <li>Make sure it&#x27;s calibrated on a hard surface before using.</li>
            <li>This is an highly inefficient machine and will cost you a small fortune to keep the mirror light on.</li>
            <li>I still see the point that I have to cover clearly when I use this mirror</li>
            <li>batteries are cumbersome and need to be replaced frequently.</li>
            <li>My 8 year old is using it on her vanity.  </li>
            <li>Oh yeah, you can order the bulbs direct from Conair....4 to 6 week delivery....who has time for that????</li>
            <li>At least ours lasted more &lt;</li>
            <li>It was way, way, way too dim to be of any use.</li>
            <li>It adds no light if there is any light in the room</li>
            <li>For that, the bulb should last much longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been so busy with work and traveling</li>
            <li>it died completely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alright, fast shipping , it&#x27;s kinda smaller</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s dim, wimpy.</li>
            <li>The lights were so dim</li>
            <li>A couple weeks after having the product, the lights completely went out.</li>
            <li>My light bulb blew out after a few months.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t find it dim like I saw others mention.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen th same mirror much cheaper at $10.</li>
            <li>The part of this that I have trouble with is the light.  </li>
            <li>The light is very dim and the mirror itself is just too small for me.</li>
            <li>I broke my other one and plan on being more careful with this one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m traveling this year and just needed a small mirror that would pack easily.  </li>
            <li>Second one I have owned as I find the older</li>
            <li>Barely has any light, it&#x27;s as if theres no light at all.</li>
            <li>definetly want my money back on this item, I HIGHLY DONT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this mirror for anyone looking for a daily use mirror.</li>
            <li>feels heavy enough that you don&#x27;t have to worry about it being knocked over easily.</li>
            <li>Its too small and the light burns out</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that the other Conair mirror that is similar to this but more expensive works better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tiny and not for normal use.</li>
            <li>A true waste of money.</li>
            <li>We even tried several new batteries.</li>
            <li>The light blew just recently (after using everyday for 5+ years).</li>
            <li>The light is not very bright at all</li>
            <li>According to the user it was given to, the light is not very bright.</li>
            <li>LED Light is not very bright at all.</li>
            <li>The light is not bright at all, its very dim.</li>
            <li>No bells or whistles, just a small mirror with a very low power light.</li>
            <li>Very small&lt;br /&gt;Smaller than expected</li>
            <li>The mirror barely lights up, thus defeating the purpose of having a lighted mirror.</li>
            <li>This was purchased as part of my 17 year old Granddaughter&#x27;s birthday present.  </li>
            <li>The lighting is much dimmer then I expected but it does the job.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I would not recommend this product due to the very minimal light it puts out.</li>
            <li>Theres a few things I noticed right off the bat:  1)</li>
            <li>but it is very, small and also the light around the mirror burnt out after a day.</li>
            <li>This is a little smaller than I expected but it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>With the other batteries, the light was already starting to dim a few days later.</li>
            <li>but with brand new batteries the lights didn&#x27;t last long before I had to change batteries again</li>
            <li>The light  is damn near useless, but perhaps would be useful if it was pitch black in my bathroom.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But ........ the light does no good.</li>
            <li>I shopped around and the average mirrors were priced around $$ and this was too much for my budget.</li>
            <li>I shopped around and the average mirrors were priced around $$ and this was too much for my budget.</li>
            <li>I apparently did not read the description close enough because I thought it came with a power adapter, which it did not.  </li>
            <li>Does not light up much at all!</li>
            <li>The light is not bright and the bulbs burnt out after 5 uses</li>
            <li>The light is not bright at all.  </li>
            <li>Light is not bright.  </li>
            <li>Light was not bright but</li>
            <li>The batteries dont last long, new batteries last 2 days.</li>
            <li>The light is not particularly bright, but it does offer some illumination that is helpful, especially if you are sitting close to the mirror or using the magnification</li>
            <li>light is not bright enough.</li>
            <li>The light is not bright enough and the mirror is about 3&amp;#34; in diameter.</li>
            <li>Light too weak to see by.</li>
            <li>is not clear enough not happy with this item I&#x27;m better off with the cord one</li>
            <li>Besides not being enough light,  it completely stopped working after a few days- not sure if it was the bulb or the battery</li>
            <li>Easy usage ,small and breaks down for travel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was never able to use this mirror successfully due to its low light source.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is actually very small (my fault for not measuring the dimensions on my old mirror) and the light is quite weak, not providing much illumination.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> My Daughter loves having her own makeup mirror, thank you for the timely delivery!</li>

            <li> Nice!</li>
            <li> This is a great mirror and the light is the perfect brightness for doing makeup!</li>
            <li> The mirror was shipped and it arrived promptly, its just not that bright</li>
            <li> Not as bright as I thought it would be</li>
            <li> Illumination is not as bright as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> really bright for battery operated</li>
            <li> Still, good quality.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a good mirror for makeup</li>
            <li> The picture shows the light as yellowish glow but its honestly blueish!!!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still good.</li>
            <li> nice mirror, but the lighting isn&#x27;t great, and the batteries drain in about 10 min of use... should have returned it.</li>
            <li> Good quality, good price.</li>
            <li> Lighting is good.</li>
            <li> Good product good price</li>

            <li> Mirror is good.</li>
            <li> Good purchase.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loved she has had no issues with it just buy rechargable batteries.</li>
            <li> the 5x is not as good as i thought, will probably order another one but find a 10x.</li>
            <li> Still a good mirror just not what i wanted</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s good for putting on makeup.  </li>
            <li> I would take note of the size of the mirror itself before ordering to see if the size is good for you.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but, when I start to use it make a good job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend for people who have a limit space and want a good mirror.&lt;br /&gt;ps.</li>
            <li> Aside from that, good construction</li>
            <li> But the mirror is of good quality aside from the lighting issue.</li>
            <li> really good mirror</li>
            <li> I was very pleased and the one I gave it to lived th mirror good going</li>
            <li> The light isn&#x27;t very bright on this one.</li>
            <li> so I am very pleased with that function.</li>
            <li> But its a great idea to have magnification, and the light!  </li>
            <li> still happy though :)</li>
            <li> Maybe I should have read the description better but it still works great for its size.  </li>
            <li> is a great mirror if you need one to travel with and can&#x27;t be sure about the electric.  </li>
            <li> but the light wasn&#x27;t bright!</li>
            <li> The light on it isn&#x27;t that strong or bright but the magnification is perfect.</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> I love this mirror!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> I thought my skin was pretty awesome....</li>
            <li> Great for seeing fine hairs and looking at pores and applying makeup</li>
            <li> this is amazing.</li>
            <li> I had to buy another kind for my daughter who I gave to for a gift.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be getting them for all our students soon, and incouraging students with vision problems to buy their own to take along with them when they graduate.</li>
            <li> I liked the mirror (and</li>
            <li> I bought this because I liked the fact that it was lighted.</li>
            <li> It does NOT come with any kind of adaptor.</li>
            <li> good for close ups mostly but not for putting on</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and perfect size</li>
            <li> Also is is the kind that takes batteries.</li>
            <li> This is a Nice scale, works well and looks sleek.</li>
            <li> Nice battery operated mirror for the price</li>
            <li> Looks nice and with the batts installed</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it though, fits nicely on her bathroom vanity.  </li>
            <li> This provides the assistance nicely.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for  friend, but it was not the kind she wanted.  </li>
            <li> it render it effective.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as nice as I thought, my loss.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s my own fault.</li>
            <li> I had a very large and very bright make up mirror for years.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice classic shape and sits perfectly on my makeup table.</li>
            <li> The light is VERY dim but the mirror is very good light weight material is excellent</li>
            <li> The mirror is a good size but the battery operated light worked once for me.</li>
            <li> but the light isn&#x27;t that bright.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL ADDITION TO MY VANITY AREA ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE ROOM.  </li>
            <li> but the light isn&#x27;t that bright in my opinion</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter at Christmas - she LOVED it - the light worked for 3 days and quit.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, the mirror is okay</li>
            <li> And the light isn&#x27;t really bright, so I still have to have a lamp beside the mirror.</li>
            <li> The light does not get that bright</li>
            <li> Light is not that bright.</li>
            <li> the light is not so bright but works ok.</li>
            <li> I thought since it was Conair it would be a great product, don&#x27;t buy this, CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP!</li>
            <li> My husband needed this so he could shave in bed, laid up do to surgery, and it is excellent, light better than reviews say and very well made item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cheap quality for the price.</li>
            <li> But on the bright side, it&#x27;s light and easy to carry around.</li>
            <li> I loved this mirror for the first week I had it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for the price.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to manufacture a product with parts that wear out, make sure you keep plenty of replacement parts in stock.  </li>
            <li> I get better illumination from my overhead 60W soft-white.  </li>
            <li> Lighted up part wasn&#x27;t much better</li>
            <li> you get the more you need magnification.  </li>
            <li> Satisfied with merchandise</li>
            <li> The magnified side of the mirror helps her apply her makeup better, and the lighted section is also convenient.</li>
            <li> To top it off, the bulb burned out after two uses.</li>
            <li> make sure you read size.</li>
            <li> Extremely pleased, no complaints here.</li>
            <li> It would make a nice night light - that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> Plus the mirror is so cute defenitely something I like.</li>
            <li> Which is a bit of a downer, considering I was hoping to get something with a bit more weight to ensure it doesnt move around.</li>
            <li> And the fact that it has a regular reflection and 5x magnification is great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for plucking my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I love the ascetics of the mirror.</li>
            <li> Love the electric use</li>
            <li> I love this mirror.</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> than I thought, might as well buy it from.a.local store to be safe about the size their about the same.price</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> I love this because I was getting it to go in my dorm room.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> but I still use it!  :)</li>
            <li> It is a good mirror but the light doesn&#x27;t really do any good at all.</li>
            <li> It is more for decoration then anything else.</li>
            <li> Size of mirror was ok.</li>
            <li> have since purchased another mirror that meets my needs, and I&#x27;ll keep this because I think it will work OK as a travel mirror when the time comes.</li>
            <li> I have to set it on top of things</li>
            <li> but had I known I would&#x27;ve saved and gotten something of better quality.</li>
            <li> HAVE NOT EVEN BEEN ABLE TO USE IT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like this Mirror much better, if I could find the replacement lamps for it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it was so cute, and had the Conair name.  </li>
            <li> Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I can do better using a magnified mirror and a table lamp.</li>
            <li> It might be better in brighter lighting.</li>
            <li> Does not work most of the time even with the batteries.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite for the price</li>
            <li> Love that it runs on batteries, so</li>
            <li> This is ok</li>
            <li> otherwise ok.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t put on my face without it! :)</li>
            <li> Maybe would be okay as a child&#x27;s toy...</li>
            <li> I could not be more upset.</li>
            <li> make sure you check the size.  </li>
            <li> She uses it daily and says the lighting and magnification are perfect for her needs.</li>
            <li> and they were more than helpful and refunded my money.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy another one, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> the light didn&#x27;t work at all!</li>
            <li> love the idea of battery operated, can be moved/used  anywhere</li>
            <li> I was expecting much more illumination.  </li>
            <li> The mirror is of very good quality and the zoom on the mirror makes it easy to see things on your face and the light works pretty well.</li>
            <li> It has a lovely finish that makes it decorative, the lighting is just right, not too bright.</li>
            <li> It has a lovely finish that makes it decorative, the lighting is just right, not too bright</li>
            <li> very accurate.i liked it a lot.has butter and that convinient for me.im very pleased</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a great mirror, but I needed a decent size mirror with lights that I can take with me on trips.</li>
            <li> Pretty good for its price.</li>
            <li> The light is not as bright as I had hoped, it is good for general use, like applying make up, but when you need to see detail like grooming your eye brows, it could be better.</li>
            <li> The mirror is very nice with good magnification and light and sturdy enough to sit well on any surface.  </li>
            <li> Love the mirror itself, but the battery dies very quickly.  </li>
            <li> The light isn&#x27;t very bright, and 5X magnification just barely allows me to see the stray hairs I wanted to pluck.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had bought one with more magnification because the light does not help you see any clearer.</li>
            <li> size is Ok, its Light weight ..</li>
            <li> The problem is cheap bulbs that you will not be able to find.</li>
            <li> Oh, and the oh-so-dim light burned out within a week, just as many others report.</li>
            <li> The light is not as bright as I would have expected it to be, but it is great for a travel mirror that is lighted.</li>
            <li> The light doesn&#x27;t really help much, but the price was best at Amazon.</li>
            <li> It is okay, if you don&#x27;t mind the light going out, it&#x27;s fine...</li>
            <li> Other than that its perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> so I was excited to see one just like the one I have used and love.  </li>
            <li> But with such a great price, its not something im concerned about. :)  2)</li>
            <li> It should be easily replaceable too.</li>
            <li> As there are no cords, it is easy to manoeuvre around.</li>
            <li> Fits easily on the counter.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this mirror very much - a good size for older person.</li>
            <li> When I first got it, it seemed to be fine although I would have liked brighter lights.</li>
            <li> This is flimsy and cheap, and for some reason the batteries die very quickly every time I replace them.</li>
            <li> The mirror magnification is just fine.</li>
            <li> Seemed to work just fine.</li>
            <li> This mirror works fine.</li>
            <li> Came and didn&#x27;t light up; I returned it easily though.</li>
            <li> Very upset with this item I always have to put a new battery every time for the light to be very bright</li>
            <li> The amount of light is adequate for me and the magnification is more than I even need.  </li>
            <li> The light isnt too bright or too dim...</li>
            <li> But honestly if I were you I would add 20$ and get a Real Makeup mirror with light.</li>
            <li> but that was probably a huge oversight on my part.</li>
            <li> Light just do not turn on anymore .</li>
            <li> so if you need the light plus the magnification, please don&#x27;t spend your money.</li>
            <li> Light stopped working after a couple days.  </li>
            <li> Light worked once.</li>
            <li> I would recommend they make the light a LOT brighter.</li>
            <li> the light blew out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Returned this item, Amazon is great on returns and overall customer service.</li>
            <li> This mirror could just as well be an &amp;quot;unlighted mirror&amp;quot; for the amount of light it gives off.  </li>
            <li> The light didn&#x27;t come on but I made myself be patient and look at the instructions</li>
            <li> As for the light bulb, mine has not burnt out yet</li>
            <li> I have had this product for 5 years and the light just went out.</li>
            <li> I take this light when I travel even when we go camping</li>
            <li> thought it would be a brighter light, but i still like it.  </li>
            <li> have to use the overhead room light to pluck unwanted eyebrow hairs.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the cordless aspect, but the way it burns through batteries just doesn&#x27;t make it worth it.</li>
            <li> Put the batteries in and turned the light on.</li>
            <li> Replaced batteries and there was barely a light that came on then</li>
            <li> I like the light weight and cordless aspect</li>
            <li> She still uses the mirror and says she didn&#x27;t care about the light.</li>
            <li> The light is all around the mirror</li>
            <li> The light stopped working after 3 days.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it for the light.</li>
            <li> but no, the light stopped working.</li>
            <li> The light is a bonus.  </li>
            <li> LIGHT DOES NOT SHINE ON THE MIRROR</li>
            <li> Great mirror, too short.</li>
            <li> The light is insufficient.</li>
            <li> I thought it would have a brighter light</li>
            <li> of cheap material l.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this mirror 1 month, and the light is burned out already.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in light at my makeup area - which is why I ordered the product.</li>
            <li> I tried to change the batteries and nothing could seem to restore the light.</li>
            <li> I liked this mirror so much that I bought my mother one, too.</li>
            <li> Even after replacing the light bulb, it no longer works.</li>
            <li> I have to buy batteries for the light.</li>
            <li> The light never works.</li>
            <li> I placed batteries inside and the light didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I even replaced the bulb; even though I just opened it from the box, the light still didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t buy this mirror if you want a light.</li>
            <li> Light does not stay on</li>
            <li> Had to return -- light didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> the light stopped working after 2 days.</li>
            <li> so I figure the light is just burned out.</li>
            <li> I tried turning it off then on again, the light still did not work.</li>
            <li> I bought this specifically for the light</li>
            <li> Iv&#x27;e had this mirror for a while now and the light still hasn&#x27;t gone out.</li>
            <li> it came cracked, and the light literally worked once or twice before it died.  </li>
            <li> Light in both sides.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and the light blew out within 3 or 4 days.</li>
            <li> Does it light?</li>
            <li> The light isn&#x27;t fantastic</li>
            <li> I was hopint to use this as the light I use to do makeup with.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Dissapointed about the light.</li>
            <li> the light around the mirror is way too dim to do much good.</li>
            <li> I would love to return it if I hadn&#x27;t thrown out the box the night before after I first opened it, tested it and all seemed fine.</li>
            <li> Works great, but the light is pretty dim.</li>
            <li> One day this semester I found one of these Conair mirrors at a thrift store cheap and lent it to a student who was having this kind of problem, and immediately she went from barely being able to apply the stuff, to our \\&quot;star\\&quot; of the class.  </li>
            <li> The mirror is double sided with a great magnifying side and a nice normal size side .&lt;br</li>
            <li> the light is a nice feature and on requires 3 AA batteries.. HIGHLY recommended</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find a 5x lighted magnification mirror.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s perfect and very portable!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this mirror ,I got it home and turned it on</li>
            <li> I originally made the purchase to get my wife out of the bathroom when doing her make-up.</li>
            <li> Also, for me, a higher magnification would be better.</li>
            <li> Even without the light the mirror is super.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping which I enjoy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s SUPER light weight.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it is a good mirror, but if you are looking for a brighter light, try a different model or corded version.</li>
            <li> Light doesn&#x27;t get bright enough at all.</li>
            <li> Other than that the light for the mirror works great.</li>
            <li> It was much smaller and not as bright as I needed to be .</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought but daughter loved it.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t even begin to see good enough to put on make up or anything.  </li>
            <li> good for a teen or child</li>
            <li> I ordered it from the &amp;#34;warehouse&amp;#34; for such a good price.  </li>
            <li> I was able to use it this morning while i was getting ready for work.</li>
            <li> Hence why it didnt recieve a full 5 stars from me.</li>
            <li> I love that it magnifies and I can see alot better especially with the light.</li>
            <li> the actual mirror is good quality.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much difference between this one and one without a light!</li>
            <li> batteries coroded fast in the casing, not bathroom humidity safe</li>
            <li> Following cataract surgery, I now do not have any close-up vision and hoped this would be good for putting on mascara, but NO.</li>
            <li> Mirror arrived quickly, and worked , but the mirror was not of the best quality, and the light was not bright at all.</li>
            <li> If it plugged in, the light might be the right level.</li>
            <li> I have to get right up to the mirror for the light to reflect on my face.</li>
            <li> Great product just wish the light was a little brighter.</li>
            <li> Other than those 2 things, Im really happy with it.</li>
            <li> I loved this product at first but two days later light stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;Kind</li>
            <li> The cost is more than just buying a new mirror!  </li>
            <li> The mirror&#x27;s light is quite dim and the magnification (5x)is inadequate for most purposes.</li>
            <li> This doesnt really bother me, as I much prefer batteries over any kind of cables.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> The batteries drain rather quickly as well.</li>
            <li> and it goes through batteries relatively quickly.</li>
            <li> goes thru batteries way too quick</li>
            <li> I love the size for my dorm room, but the light was so dim</li>
            <li> and then get raked over the coals on high priced specialty light bulbs - BINGO!    </li>
            <li> The light around this mirror does nothing but look pretty.</li>
            <li> only good part is the magnifying mirror, but the lighting is not adequate for indoors like an electric makeup mirror would provide.... great if you are sitting outside in the sun in a lawn chair...on a sunny day in warm climate..</li>
            <li> I put brand new Duracells in it and was able to use it once for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> and so glad to have a new one.</li>
            <li> VERY PORTABLE AND CAN BE PACKED EASILY IN SUITCASE...</li>
            <li> It also was very well wrapped and packaged and arrived very quickly,</li>
            <li> Round light/mirror and magnification perfect for our old eyes!</li>
            <li> batteries, put them in and the light worked very dully for like 5 minutes then went off and now doesnt work at all!&lt;br /&gt;must</li>
            <li> But if you really want it for the light you should work on a battery solution.</li>
            <li> but I still use it everyday because it has a great mirror</li>
            <li> the light really doesnt make a diference.  </li>
            <li> I am now in the market for a plug-in one, the battery life lasts for literally 2-3 uses and the light is very dim.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I didnt really buy it for the light anyways.....</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really use the light anymore because it doesn&#x27;t make a difference.</li>
            <li> The mirror light is also very weak.&lt;br /&gt;Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I like the magnification, and the light is very helpful as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice mirror to have wear a bigger mirror is located so that you can transition to this one if you want to get a closer look of something.</li>
            <li> Gets over heated and turns off the light, light is really dim.</li>
            <li> Love that it does not need a cord.&lt;br /&gt;Mirror was clear and magnified side did not seem to have distortion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but in dim lighting</li>
            <li> The product has a mind of its own, only work sometimes, do not buy.</li>
            <li> So i was kind pf taken back at what I paid for $25.00.</li>
            <li> Deferentially worth your money.</li>
            <li> Finally found it, I was so excited!!</li>
            <li> In an obscure place I found the bulb with the right voltage but not the right wattage.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just right for my needs.</li>
            <li> Its just the right size to move around.</li>
            <li> I tried it out right when I received it in the mail.</li>
            <li> It is great however, its too small, and I have to keep moving side to side to get the mirror to focus where I want it to.     </li>
            <li> The lighting isn&#x27;t too bad, it isn&#x27;t bright but it is still a good amount of light.</li>
            <li> Excellent present for my young teenage girls.</li>
            <li> Batteries drain super fast with this mirror.</li>
            <li> Also the light doesn&#x27;t give off enough light.</li>
            <li> everytime you put in new batteries!!!</li>
            <li> This light is very dim</li>
            <li> The light was also very dim.  </li>
            <li> my daughter bought this for her mother and see likes very much.</li>
            <li> Has good weight to it so it doesn&#x27;t fall over easily, the mirrors are very clear, however the Light is awfully weak..</li>
            <li> Even when I tried replacing the batteries after the use, it only worked a couple of more times then refused to even turn on.</li>
            <li> The only place I&#x27;ve been able to find them is on Conair&#x27;s web-site, but wait --</li>
            <li> At first i thought i forgot the button on</li>
            <li> The light is so dim there</li>
            <li> higher magnification and on sale at Costco.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing that would be better would be an option to fold with a carrying case for travel  </li>
            <li> But the light is so dim, you can&#x27;t see it in a lit up room.</li>
            <li> The light on the mirror is so dim that it provides no illumination while using it.</li>
            <li> Just a thought though, for those of you interested.  </li>
            <li> then what I expected and the light isn&#x27;t as bright partly because there is only one setting.</li>
            <li> The light on this mirror is too dim for my taste.</li>
            <li> The on /off switch didn&#x27;t work after the first couple of times  </li>
            <li> I love this mirror and use it daily.</li>
            <li> Light is extremely dim.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> For basic magnifying mirror uses, this is OK.</li>
            <li> My mother has a mirror that&#x27;s just like this one, the only thing is that it lights up much more.</li>
            <li> We are make-up mirror people and I highly recommend this mirror!!</li>
            <li> First time that I saw the mirror I feel like it was too mall to use</li>
            <li> net time i will check the measurments more closely</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> you may not want anyone to see ;)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The students like them tremendously, and even those with normal vision say they help a lot.  </li>
            <li> Apparently 5X magnification is not as strong as I thought and</li>
            <li> Nice mirror, only it doesn&#x27;t throw enough light to really matter.</li>
            <li> Magnification and light really helps these old eyes see what I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use the light everyday and when I do, its not for more than a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable and delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> but the light barely works.</li>
            <li> If you want a pretty one to stay on your vanity there are much nicer ones.</li>
            <li> The light doesn&#x27;t stay on very long either and the batteries run out quick.</li>
            <li> put in 3 brand new batteries, turned it on, light is very, very dim.</li>
            <li> Batteries running low very quickly</li>
            <li> I was really surprised that I recieved my item so quickly.</li>
            <li> it makes no difference the light on my phone was better then this mirror waste of money shaking my head!</li>
            <li> good but batteries don&#x27;t last too long</li>
            <li> shipped fast, i love that it doesnt have a cord so you can take it anywhere as long as it has batteries,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good mirror, don&#x27;t get me wrong, the magnifying side is especially helpful, but be prepared to have a dedicated light source behind you, because the light A.) isn&#x27;t very bright and B.) drains batteries like water in a sink.</li>
            <li> The mirror part is great, the light is just not bright enough.</li>
            <li> I find it is very convenient and easy enough to pack for vacation.  </li>
            <li> This is quite small, and the light is not strong but it is perfectly good quality and works fine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this very much because the light is very dim and barely makes a difference.</li>
            <li> This mirror is nice, but the light sucks!</li>
            <li> cheap crappy thing with little light</li>
            <li> It casts a faint glow rather than a bright light needed for tweezing, extractions, etc.</li>
            <li> Light does not give out enough light to do makeup and stopped working properly.</li>
            <li> gives off white light.</li>
            <li> and it kills batteries extremely fast</li>
            <li> None of the stores carried much of a selection.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;light\\&quot; really is inadequate for applying make-up.  </li>
            <li> I just got this mirror today and after only 10 minutes, the light stopped working.</li>
            <li> Made my eyebrow plucking and makeup application much easier.</li>
            <li> VERY STURDY.</li>
            <li> U cant see much</li>
            <li> When I went to use it the following day with the light, it wouldn&#x27;t switch on.</li>
            <li> Not enough light</li>
            <li> The internal light burned out, and I needed another.  </li>
            <li> I came across this one and took the chance as it was very well priced.</li>
            <li> It magnifies without much distortion.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t help too much if you want to apply makeup and you are a perfectionist like I am.</li>
            <li> I got LED lights that are much brighter.</li>
            <li> Then you are expecting that upon contacting  CONair and explaining that the unit comes with a defective bulb, they will be reasonable and send one to you...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not too big and it fit with my makeup table.</li>
            <li> The batteries die so fast with this that I have replaced the batteries 4 times</li>
            <li> I came across this one and took the chance as it was very well priced.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> It really goes through batteries.  </li>
            <li> So that only leaves one hand available.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The mirror is ok but the size is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight.</li>
            <li> The light bulb didn&#x27;t last a month and it was quite a problem to find a replacement bulb.  </li>
            <li> Nothing spectacular; not big enough.  </li>
            <li> It could however, make a nice (albeit expensive) night light!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to toss it because the mirror itself is nice but the lights dimmed after a couple of weeks and now are just dead.</li>
            <li> Now I am pretty sure I&#x27;m half lizard.  </li>
            <li> The amount of light given off is about the same as the &lt;1 watt covered led nightlights I buy for saving electricity so I can navigate my home at night without having to turn on the main lights.</li>
            <li> I went out and dredged up two more mirrors for the other students with glasses, and they both improved as well.  </li>
            <li> She went to Mexico and was able to take it with her since it isn&#x27;t bulky like the other one sold at stores.</li>
            <li> I am assuming that&#x27;s because as you slide toward the off button the light goes out, but apparently it&#x27;s not all the way off!</li>
            <li> I love evrything about it except that the light is not bright at all.</li>
            <li> The light is barely noticeable when there is other light in the room.  </li>
            <li> other than that it&#x27;s nice, small and cute.</li>
            <li> Bought for Fiance as a christmas present, light went out before new years with 20 mins of use per day.</li>
            <li> Nice mirror, but really to small.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kind of small</li>
            <li> and i only got 1 full use out of it before the batteries died.</li>
            <li> Unless you normally tweeze or apply makeup by candlelight you won&#x27;t find this mirror to be much help.</li>
            <li> I even bought new batteries and it still didn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> When buying a lighted mirror, make sure it takes something approaching a standard bulb - - and I&#x27;d try to avoid CONair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tiny, it falls over, the battery dies almost instantly so using the light is basically out, and it squeaks when I turn it around to use the magnified side!</li>
            <li> Getting older, I&#x27;ve decided I need a lighted mirror.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice mirror but the light is simply USELESS.</li>
            <li> about the light it is not really help that much.</li>
            <li> I only had it for a month before the light around the mirror completely died.</li>
            <li> Nice but smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> May be nice on a little girl&#x27;s desk, but not for an average-sized human being, perhaps ;)</li>
            <li> The light that the people below complain about is NOT intended to be the only light in the makeup room, but is a small additional light right where a little extra light counts.</li>
            <li> The mirror was a little smaller than expected, but nonetheless a good buy a very useful for travel.</li>
            <li> My wife has had this mirror for a little more than a year.  </li>
            <li> The light is less than bright and if I open my curtains in the bathroom, I see with the mirro justs[ fine, very dull dim lighting</li>
            <li> A whole pack of batteries later and the light won&#x27;t turn back on still.</li>
            <li> It does not provide enough illumination by itself to be that useful.</li>
            <li> It is pretty small to put on your makeup, but it is nicely made, lightweight and battery operated - unlike my 1985 big one.  </li>
            <li> This would make it pretty much the same as an...unlighted mirror!</li>
            <li> This one is still useful though, as a regular mirror.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this if you&#x27;re expecting it to be a normal vanity mirror.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t last long the bright light turns into a yellow dark</li>
            <li> The light was so dim that it was useless, and I had to use a separate desk lamp for adequate light.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this product even one star, is because the mirror itself is good and I like how one side of it is regular, and the other is magnified.</li>
            <li> The light is not very bright even when the batteries are fresh.</li>
            <li> As long as you remember to turn it off when you&#x27;re not using it you&#x27;ll be fine and the extra 10 watts make a whole lot of difference.</li>
            <li> I still have to use other light when i use this mirror.</li>
            <li> Thought maybe it was the brand new batteries that I just put in</li>
            <li> , i have had to replace the new batteries i put in it in two weeks.</li>
            <li> -- it just needed a new bulb inside.  </li>
            <li> For the price, I&#x27;m just gonna buy a new one rather than trying to find a replacement bulb.</li>
            <li> I received the product, put brand new batteries in it, turned it on and off twice and the bulb immediately burned out.</li>
            <li> I bought this item brand new.</li>
            <li> Small and very cheap looking.  </li>
            <li> Very dim lights.</li>
            <li> It is very dim.</li>
            <li> I was not touching the mirror I was touching the frame and the mirror cracked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;m going to keep it from cracking, but I&#x27;m sure clothes for padding</li>
            <li> The lights start to go dim after one use!</li>
            <li> First mirror arrived - the bulb blew after only one minute of being on.</li>
            <li> When I initially got it I was upset that it was battery operated in the first place</li>
            <li> The light super sucks!</li>
            <li> Mirror is very small, not well made and broke very easy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit disappointed as the light is not as bright as I was hoping</li>
            <li> Mirror is fine for putting on makeup but light is not bright enough...</li>
            <li> At first, when mine died, I thought it was the bulbs too, but so far, it has only been a battery</li>
            <li> light is super dim, so weak ..</li>
            <li> This mirror is fine as a double sided mirror, but the light, when run with battery  is weak.</li>
            <li> This mirror is smaller than we expected and the light is very dim.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it came quickly ad</li>
            <li> Make sure it&#x27;s calibrated on a hard surface before using.</li>
            <li> This is an highly inefficient machine and will cost you a small fortune to keep the mirror light on.</li>
            <li> I still see the point that I have to cover clearly when I use this mirror</li>
            <li> batteries are cumbersome and need to be replaced frequently.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old is using it on her vanity.  </li>
            <li> Oh yeah, you can order the bulbs direct from Conair....4 to 6 week delivery....who has time for that????</li>
            <li> At least ours lasted more &lt;</li>
            <li> It was way, way, way too dim to be of any use.</li>
            <li> It adds no light if there is any light in the room</li>
            <li> For that, the bulb should last much longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been so busy with work and traveling</li>
            <li> it died completely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright, fast shipping , it&#x27;s kinda smaller</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dim, wimpy.</li>
            <li> The lights were so dim</li>
            <li> A couple weeks after having the product, the lights completely went out.</li>
            <li> My light bulb blew out after a few months.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t find it dim like I saw others mention.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen th same mirror much cheaper at $10.</li>
            <li> The part of this that I have trouble with is the light.  </li>
            <li> The light is very dim and the mirror itself is just too small for me.</li>
            <li> I broke my other one and plan on being more careful with this one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m traveling this year and just needed a small mirror that would pack easily.  </li>
            <li> Second one I have owned as I find the older</li>
            <li> Barely has any light, it&#x27;s as if theres no light at all.</li>
            <li> definetly want my money back on this item, I HIGHLY DONT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this mirror for anyone looking for a daily use mirror.</li>
            <li> feels heavy enough that you don&#x27;t have to worry about it being knocked over easily.</li>
            <li> Its too small and the light burns out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that the other Conair mirror that is similar to this but more expensive works better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tiny and not for normal use.</li>
            <li> A true waste of money.</li>
            <li> We even tried several new batteries.</li>
            <li> The light blew just recently (after using everyday for 5+ years).</li>
            <li> The light is not very bright at all</li>
            <li> According to the user it was given to, the light is not very bright.</li>
            <li> LED Light is not very bright at all.</li>
            <li> The light is not bright at all, its very dim.</li>
            <li> No bells or whistles, just a small mirror with a very low power light.</li>
            <li> Very small&lt;br /&gt;Smaller than expected</li>
            <li> The mirror barely lights up, thus defeating the purpose of having a lighted mirror.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as part of my 17 year old Granddaughter&#x27;s birthday present.  </li>
            <li> The lighting is much dimmer then I expected but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I would not recommend this product due to the very minimal light it puts out.</li>
            <li> Theres a few things I noticed right off the bat:  1)</li>
            <li> but it is very, small and also the light around the mirror burnt out after a day.</li>
            <li> This is a little smaller than I expected but it works just fine.  </li>
            <li> With the other batteries, the light was already starting to dim a few days later.</li>
            <li> but with brand new batteries the lights didn&#x27;t last long before I had to change batteries again</li>
            <li> The light  is damn near useless, but perhaps would be useful if it was pitch black in my bathroom.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But ........ the light does no good.</li>
            <li> I shopped around and the average mirrors were priced around $$ and this was too much for my budget.</li>
            <li> I shopped around and the average mirrors were priced around $$ and this was too much for my budget.</li>
            <li> I apparently did not read the description close enough because I thought it came with a power adapter, which it did not.  </li>
            <li> Does not light up much at all!</li>
            <li> The light is not bright and the bulbs burnt out after 5 uses</li>
            <li> The light is not bright at all.  </li>
            <li> Light is not bright.  </li>
            <li> Light was not bright but</li>
            <li> The batteries dont last long, new batteries last 2 days.</li>
            <li> The light is not particularly bright, but it does offer some illumination that is helpful, especially if you are sitting close to the mirror or using the magnification</li>
            <li> light is not bright enough.</li>
            <li> The light is not bright enough and the mirror is about 3&amp;#34; in diameter.</li>
            <li> Light too weak to see by.</li>
            <li> is not clear enough not happy with this item I&#x27;m better off with the cord one</li>
            <li> Besides not being enough light,  it completely stopped working after a few days- not sure if it was the bulb or the battery</li>
            <li> Easy usage ,small and breaks down for travel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was never able to use this mirror successfully due to its low light source.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is actually very small (my fault for not measuring the dimensions on my old mirror) and the light is quite weak, not providing much illumination.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The price was right; the product seemed simple and hard to screw up.</li>
            <li> It gets super hot and drains the battery like crazy</li>
            <li> As you get older, you need a little help with make up and face maintenance.  </li>
            <li> I just put some Duracell batteries in a few days ago, and they seem to be holding fairly steady at this point.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wasted far more time than the stupid mirror is worth looking for replacement bulbs.  </li>
            <li> Not bright enough to see face right in front of it.</li>
            <li> but it actually can&#x27;t take it for to long.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long on the batteries.  </li>
            <li> but the batteries didn&#x27;t last long (that may have been cheap/old batteries on my part)</li>
            <li> The dim glow from behind the mirror is completely useless--I have to use it next to a window in broad daylight to see a thing.</li>
            <li> My wife tells me that the light is not very bright and due to all of the other complaints regarding the bulb going out, this is being returned.</li>
            <li> even though I have a new heavy duty batteries on.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The batteries do not last very long.</li>
            <li> Turned it off then turned it back on but light failed to come on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with the low light output.</li>
            <li> I put several new batteries in from package nothing when it did work the first time the light was terrible</li>
            <li> The light is very weak, it&#x27;s like its</li>
            <li> The light is useless.</li>
            <li> Also, the light is so faint that it doesn&#x27;t make a difference whether its on or off.</li>
            <li> The light it useless.</li>
            <li> The stand is too short and the mirror is too small for an adult to use.  </li>
            <li> This mirror is a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than I expected.  </li>
            <li> It is smaller than I expected,  but I like it.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected it to be.  </li>
            <li> They said to us that they have no way of knowing how long these units sit around so it is not their problem...</li>
            <li> I have other Conair products and thought this would be the same quality.  </li>
            <li> I had to return this item, it did not live up to its reputation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too small and the light is weak.</li>
            <li> Light is so weak and the diameter is so small.</li>
            <li> the light on this is pretty worthless unless the room is dark.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of disappointed by the battery life on this thing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that 5x magnification was not very much.</li>
            <li> tiny small tiny.</li>
            <li> The lasted a little longer, but still rather short.</li>
            <li> but it is a little bit short.</li>
            <li> He wished it would hav been a larger mirror and a little taller.  </li>
            <li> I thought the mirror itself was a little larger</li>
            <li> Magnifying side was a little distorted, possibly because of its size.</li>
            <li> It is a little smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> Mirror is great, but the lighting is TERRIBLE.  </li>
            <li> Tells me every time this is an axe murder behind me or when I accidentally put on too much eye shadow.</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> I have only turned it on 3 times since I got it and the batteries are already dead.  </li>
            <li> A total waste of money.</li>
            <li> not very well lighting</li>
            <li> After adding AA batteries and turning it on, it worked for a few minutes then suddenly stopped lighting up.</li>
            <li> Do not exactly like this.  </li>
            <li> The mirror is small in size and uses two double AA batteries.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers mentioned, buying a replacement bulb is a costly hassle that I didn&#x27;t bother going through.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too small or too big.</li>
            <li> Use the AC adaptor or batteries, there is no difference between the two, you still need to be in an extremely well lit room</li>
            <li> never worked the other for 5 mins.</li>
            <li> I should have read the other reviews</li>
            <li> It is a little than I expected (I did not read the dimensions, I guess).  </li>
            <li> If you are serious about using this everyday, pay a little extra and get the larger sized version.   </li>
            <li> Bad thing is the light broke...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror for my wife for makeup application, but she said it was like doing her makeup in the dark.</li>
            <li> not worth the buy.</li>
            <li> my only complaint is that it takes 3 batteries.</li>
            <li> Same complaint...</li>
            <li> Not worth the money at all</li>
            <li> not on at all, even In the dark.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> The overall mirror is just so small!</li>
            <li> I agree with a previous reviewer.  </li>
            <li> I wish it took less.</li>
            <li> Dorm room bathrooms shared by 5-6 girls seemed pretty crazy to me</li>
            <li> This is not true.</li>
            <li> Lights not bright enough</li>
            <li> bad quality, light is very weak and not useful at all , gets dirty very quick .</li>
            <li> Agree with other users--this mirror was no better than an unlighted one.</li>
            <li> Magnification was a little warped.</li>
            <li> I was hoping the lights would be a little brighter.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money!</li>
            <li> Light is not very bright and mirror is much c smaller than I expected  very disappointed</li>
            <li> What a hassle and waste of $20.00.</li>
            <li> The lights don&#x27;t work, don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> The light on this mirror is worthless.</li>
            <li> , it didn&#x27;t matter because the light was worthless anyway.  </li>
            <li> The light is almost worthless.  </li>
            <li> none of them fit......total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> No light... Not working.</li>
            <li> It is so dim that it makes it difficult to see regardless of the room lighting.</li>
            <li> I dont know if maybe i just got one thats missing a cord.</li>
            <li> Biggest waste of my money.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to waste batteries on this product that often,</li>
            <li> ....USE IN EVERYDAY TO PUT ON MY MAKE</li>
            <li> So dim as to be useless.  </li>
            <li> Batteries went dead.</li>
            <li> After trying a few others she asked me to try and find the one that she had.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it a few weeks trying to make it work</li>
            <li> Way too much trouble to replace them.  </li>
            <li> This product was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Waste of 20$</li>
            <li> not much light coverage</li>
            <li> I returned it within a few days.</li>
            <li> She sent me a text message this morning to tell me she uses it everyday</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> Also, it just stopped working after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It was dead.</li>
            <li> The light on this mirror sucks :( dissappointed</li>
            <li> Even as a magnified mirror with no light, it is rather small.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, this thing sucks down batteries like nobodies&#x27; business.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the first one was broken and without it I had a really hard time doing my make-up.  </li>
            <li> Very cheaply made; in China, of course, and absolutely terrible quality!</li>
            <li> and the mirror it self is too small.</li>
            <li> Granted, at first I had a terrible batch of AmazonBasic batteries in it that only lasted a week.</li>
            <li> really really small.</li>
            <li> small.</li>
            <li> How do manufacturers get away with such lousy products?</li>
            <li> The mirror surface is small and the stand is small.</li>
            <li> Really small</li>
            <li> Somewhat small but works for me.</li>
            <li> Ridiculously small,</li>
            <li> It was really to small for my wife</li>
            <li> I use my mirror everyday!</li>
            <li> It was so small.</li>
            <li> It turned out smaller than I had thought and unfortunately had to return it.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other raters that this a poor quality product.</li>
            <li> Too lightweight and not very good quality.  </li>
            <li> The lighting on this is extremely poor and I just thought it would be slightly taller.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in the amount of light that it puts out.</li>
            <li> The light was terrible turned it on once and then turned it off</li>
            <li> The luck sucks, I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s even there.</li>
            <li> The light however is the worst thing about it.</li>
            <li> Delicately would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I would like to give this mirror negative stars</li>
            <li> Too small and goes through batteries crazy, crazy fast</li>
            <li> even it is a small point on my face!</li>
            <li> I mean seriously did the engineers even use it with the mirror before deciding to make it a product?</li>
            <li> but it was very small</li>
            <li> Very small and does not magnify at all.  </li>
            <li> Mirror is very small.  </li>
            <li> Seriously?</li>
            <li> seriously.</li>
            <li> Not a good buy at all.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not really good for apply makeup.</li>
            <li> Amazon stepped in and helped, but I for one will never deal with this sub standard, pathetic excuse for a company again.</li>
            <li> Not bright, sucky product..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much smaller than I thought it&#x27;d be! :(</li>
            <li> You need extra lights on just to see what you are doing :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty awful.  </li>
            <li> With the mirror small in size its difficult to judge things even with magnification.</li>
            <li> terrible , don&#x27;t waste your money, also not bright enough at all</li>
            <li> WASTE  OF  MONEY ! ! !</li>
            <li> The lighting is poor.</li>
            <li> Poor quality product.</li>
            <li> Item was broken.</li>
            <li> The battery compartment is poorly constructed so that the batteries have to be shimmed to work.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very small in size which makes it difficult to apply makeup.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed and struggled to find a new one.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not really bright!</li>
            <li> Really annoyed I spent $20 on this just to be very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> I teach Theatrical Makeup at UAF, and for years I&#x27;ve noticed that students with vision problems had a terrible time applying makeup because they couldn&#x27;t use their glasses, or see themselves in mirrors two feet away.  </li>
            <li> For $20 this is unfortunately &lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe Conair would make such a terrible product.</li>
            <li> There is nothing WRONG with this item, it just isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li> He is unable to stand to shave.  </li>
            <li> well Ill take tacky over useless anyday.</li>
            <li> You are wrong.</li>
            <li> The lighting is very poor.</li>
            <li> VERY VERY POOR PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Im afraid she wouldnt have seen herself in the mirror though.</li>
            <li> Eats batteries like crazy.</li>
            <li> Boy, was I wrong!  </li>
            <li> It will randomly make a hissing noise coming from the base, even though the switch is in the off position.</li>
            <li> I mean there was no difference between turning off and on, Horrible lighting!</li>
            <li> The &#x27;battery power&#x27; is bad and the optics suck.</li>
            <li> it was so bad.  </li>
            <li> (:(</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed to not find another Remington, after using it for years and years.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Batteries running low very quickly</li>
            <li> Do not exactly like this.  It&#x27;s okay, but the lighting just isn&#x27;t the best.  Still, good quality.</li>
            <li> The mirror is a good size but the battery operated light worked once for me. Even when I tried replacing the batteries after the use, it only worked a couple of more times then refused to even turn on. I&#x27;m in the market for another lighted mirror now.</li>
            <li> Light does not give out enough light to do makeup and stopped working properly. Light just do not turn on anymore . It&#x27;s not worth the money. It&#x27;s a rip off. :(:(</li>
            <li> got it for gift for sister. she loves it..batteries are cumbersome and need to be replaced frequently. gives off white light.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I agree with most on this mirror. It&#x27;s too small and the light is weak. The &#x27;battery power&#x27; is bad and the optics suck. That&#x27;s all folks...</li>
            <li> This mirror is fine as a double sided mirror, but the light, when run with battery  is weak. The battery option is why I purchased this model. It does not provide enough illumination by itself to be that useful.</li>
            <li> love it! i can now do my make-up outside of the bathroom! the light is a nice feature and on requires 3 AA batteries.. HIGHLY recommended</li>
            <li> the light is not so bright but works ok.</li>
            <li> I have used this mirror about five times and the bulbs have burned out.  I am returning it.  What a hassle and waste of $20.00.</li>
            <li> This mirror is a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my daughter in law. She loves it.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than I expected.  Very dim lights. I had to buy another kind for my daughter who I gave to for a gift.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for the price.</li>
            <li> The lights don&#x27;t work, don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> The light on this mirror is worthless. Besides not being enough light,  it completely stopped working after a few days- not sure if it was the bulb or the battery, it didn&#x27;t matter because the light was worthless anyway.  It does have a very good weight which I liked.</li>
            <li> My wife has had this mirror for a little more than a year.  She likes it even though it must always be set on the highest setting in order to be useable.  One of the two bulbs burned out a couple of weeks ago and I figured, no big deal, I&#x27;ll just go buy another - NOT!  Home Depot, Lowes, and several online web-sites have  nothing like it.  Then I figured, Oh, this is just another scam - buy the inexpensive mirror and then get raked over the coals on high priced specialty light bulbs - BINGO!    The only place I&#x27;ve been able to find them is on Conair&#x27;s web-site, but wait -- they are out of stock.  You have to be kidding!  If you&#x27;re going to manufacture a product with parts that wear out, make sure you keep plenty of replacement parts in stock.  Talk about a lack of concern for their customers.  I&#x27;ve wasted far more time than the stupid mirror is worth looking for replacement bulbs.  URGH!  Save yourself the frustration.  When buying a lighted mirror, make sure it takes something approaching a standard bulb - - and I&#x27;d try to avoid CONair</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find a 5x lighted magnification mirror.  I have other Conair products and thought this would be the same quality.  Boy, was I wrong!  This light is very dim so if you need the light plus the magnification, please don&#x27;t spend your money.</li>
            <li> The zoom function and flippable mirror are convenient, but I got this specifically to be a \\&quot;lighted\\&quot; mirror.  The light is almost worthless.  I get better illumination from my overhead 60W soft-white.  If it&#x27;s a lighted mirror you&#x27;re looking for, might want to keep searching.</li>
            <li> This is a great mirror and the light is the perfect brightness for doing makeup! The only issue I had with it is the constant changing of my batteries but that is totally dependent on the brand I used. Other than that it&#x27;s perfect and very portable!</li>
            <li> Garbage. Light is so weak and the diameter is so small. Useless.</li>
            <li> Light stopped working after a couple days.  Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> My daughter opened this gift this morning for Christmas...we installed 3 double AA Duracell batterries and it turned on like it should then turned it off.  She placed it on her desk and went to take a shower. Came back to put her make up on and it wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  Thought maybe it was the brand new batteries that I just put in so I decided to try to just replace those, NOPE! It&#x27;s broke, ALREADY? Seriously? Thanks,I appreciate you ruining her gift for Christmas and Conairs customer service isn&#x27;t open on Christmas! UGH! I thought since it was Conair it would be a great product, don&#x27;t buy this, CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP!</li>
            <li> It gets super hot and drains the battery like crazy</li>
            <li> Nice mirror, only it doesn&#x27;t throw enough light to really matter. It was a gift, and I&#x27;d return it if it wasn&#x27;t a pain in the butt.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a good mirror for makeup but it was very small</li>
            <li> Small and very cheap looking.  Lighted up part wasn&#x27;t much better</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought but daughter loved it.</li>
            <li> Does not light up much at all! Did not serve for the purpose I needed it to</li>
            <li> The light on this mirror sucks :( dissappointed</li>
            <li> Very small&lt;br /&gt;Smaller than expected</li>
            <li> Received product in perfect condition and timely.  Use it every day.    Second one I have owned as I find the older you get the more you need magnification.  I broke my other one and plan on being more careful with this one.  Would order from company again.</li>
            <li> It is a little than I expected (I did not read the dimensions, I guess).  It is pretty small to put on your makeup, but it is nicely made, lightweight and battery operated - unlike my 1985 big one.  My 8 year old is using it on her vanity.  You could use it to pluck your eyebrows or apply eye liner, but I don&#x27;t think it is big enough to get an overall view of your face to check your foundation, etc. Back to my Conair 1985 Big Make Up Mirror!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tiny, it falls over, the battery dies almost instantly so using the light is basically out, and it squeaks when I turn it around to use the magnified side!</li>
            <li> I teach Theatrical Makeup at UAF, and for years I&#x27;ve noticed that students with vision problems had a terrible time applying makeup because they couldn&#x27;t use their glasses, or see themselves in mirrors two feet away.  One day this semester I found one of these Conair mirrors at a thrift store cheap and lent it to a student who was having this kind of problem, and immediately she went from barely being able to apply the stuff, to our \\&quot;star\\&quot; of the class.  I went out and dredged up two more mirrors for the other students with glasses, and they both improved as well.  The light that the people below complain about is NOT intended to be the only light in the makeup room, but is a small additional light right where a little extra light counts. The students like them tremendously, and even those with normal vision say they help a lot.  I&#x27;m going to be getting them for all our students soon, and incouraging students with vision problems to buy their own to take along with them when they graduate.</li>
            <li> I looked all over for this mirror!! Finally found it, I was so excited!! &lt;BR&gt;A week later the bulb blew out..........bought 6 bulbs...none of them fit......total waste of money.  I was so disappointed.  I liked the mirror (and the weight of it was great) but if you can&#x27;t buy bulbs for it what&#x27;s the point?? Oh yeah, you can order the bulbs direct from Conair....4 to 6 week delivery....who has time for that????</li>
            <li> bad quality, light is very weak and not useful at all , gets dirty very quick . i thew it away !</li>
            <li> very accurate.i liked it a lot.has butter and that convinient for me.im very pleased</li>
            <li> The picture shows the light as yellowish glow but its honestly blueish!!! I LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a little smaller than I expected but it works just fine.  I needed the magnification so I am very pleased with that function.</li>
            <li> I am now going through what everyone else is talking about. &lt;br /&gt;Finding replacement bulbs.  For $20 this is unfortunately &lt;br /&gt;for some a \\&quot;throw away\\&quot; mirror.  At least ours lasted more &lt;br /&gt;than 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror for my wife for makeup application, but she said it was like doing her makeup in the dark. It was way, way, way too dim to be of any use. We returned it the next day.</li>
            <li> Mirror arrived quickly, and worked , but the mirror was not of the best quality, and the light was not bright at all.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with merchandise</li>
            <li> Light is not very bright and mirror is much c smaller than I expected  very disappointed</li>
            <li> The batteries dont last long, new batteries last 2 days. You go through a lot of batteries</li>
            <li> Light worked once. Got it Monday, used it Monday evening, turned it on Tuesday evening.... No light... Not working.</li>
            <li> Could not find it anywhere else.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> The lighting is very poor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why they bothered putting a &amp;quot;light&amp;quot;.  You can&#x27;t even begin to see good enough to put on make up or anything.  I bought this mirror and ended up returning it. I would recommend they make the light a LOT brighter.</li>
            <li> There is nothing &amp;quot;lighted&amp;quot; about this mirror, unless you use it under a hundred-watt ceiling fixture. The dim glow from behind the mirror is completely useless--I have to use it next to a window in broad daylight to see a thing. This would make it pretty much the same as an...unlighted mirror! Put this product out of your mind and move on to another.</li>
            <li> Tells me every time this is an axe murder behind me or when I accidentally put on too much eye shadow. Magnification side great for popping zits.</li>
            <li> The mirror is small in size and uses two double AA batteries. I was very disappointed in the amount of light that it puts out. I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> The mirror&#x27;s light is quite dim and the magnification (5x)is inadequate for most purposes.</li>
            <li> At first i thought i forgot the button on but it actually can&#x27;t take it for to long. other than that it&#x27;s nice, small and cute.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom, and she likes it. The magnified side of the mirror helps her apply her makeup better, and the lighted section is also convenient.</li>
            <li> I loved this mirror for the first week I had it! However, after just ONE WEEK of use (turning it on for about 10 mins per day) the light blew out. I can&#x27;t believe Conair would make such a terrible product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit disappointed as the light is not as bright as I was hoping but it&#x27;s still good. I use it often.</li>
            <li> The light is so dim there may as well not be one there. I tried all kinds of batteries nothing worked. It drains the battery.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this mirror ,I got it home and turned it on and there was no lighting, I mean there was no difference between turning off and on, Horrible lighting! I&#x27;m hoping that the other Conair mirror that is similar to this but more expensive works better.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I liked the fact that it was lighted. The light was so dim that it was useless, and I had to use a separate desk lamp for adequate light. To top it off, the bulb burned out after two uses. TWO! As other reviewers mentioned, buying a replacement bulb is a costly hassle that I didn&#x27;t bother going through. If you&#x27;re looking for a lighted makeup mirror, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> nice mirror, but the lighting isn&#x27;t great, and the batteries drain in about 10 min of use... should have returned it.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time when i do my makeup. Bad thing is the light broke...</li>
            <li> As expected. Good quality, good price.</li>
            <li> only worked for about 3 weeks then broke</li>
            <li> make sure you read size. not very big. good for a teen or child</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift; then I saw a corded version, taller, larger mirror face. higher magnification and on sale at Costco.&lt;br /&gt;Returned this item, Amazon is great on returns and overall customer service.</li>
            <li> This is flimsy and cheap, and for some reason the batteries die very quickly every time I replace them. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Just ordered this mirror for my wife for Christmas.  Have had it for 2 days and gone through 2 sets of batteries already.  I apparently did not read the description close enough because I thought it came with a power adapter, which it did not.  My wife tells me that the light is not very bright and due to all of the other complaints regarding the bulb going out, this is being returned.</li>
            <li> For the price, I think they should make the mirror a bit larger.   If you are serious about using this everyday, pay a little extra and get the larger sized version.   It is great however, its too small, and I have to keep moving side to side to get the mirror to focus where I want it to.     But its a great idea to have magnification, and the light!  I am planning to buy another one, but the larger one this time.</li>
            <li> The light is less than bright and if I open my curtains in the bathroom, I see with the mirro justs[ fine, very dull dim lighting</li>
            <li> just got this yesterday. It&#x27;s the perfect size for my bedroom I also can take it traveling. Lighting is good.</li>
            <li> Works great. Good lights and great view area from both sides of the mirror.</li>
            <li> The lighting is terrible and it is battery operated.  The batteries last about two - three days.  I don&#x27;t recommend this item.</li>
            <li> It is a good product that arrived in perfectly unharmed condition. The mirror was a little smaller than expected, but nonetheless a good buy a very useful for travel.</li>
            <li> I agree with a previous reviewer.  This mirror could just as well be an &amp;quot;unlighted mirror&amp;quot; for the amount of light it gives off.  I returned it after one use.</li>
            <li> It is smaller than I expected,  but I like it. The price is very reasonable and delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> The mirror is very nice with good magnification and light and sturdy enough to sit well on any surface.  The only thing that would be better would be an option to fold with a carrying case for travel  I like it regardless</li>
            <li> Daughter loves this!!</li>
            <li> Works beautifully, looks great on my make-up table. Magnification and light really helps these old eyes see what I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li> The mirror was shipped and it arrived promptly, its just not that bright and it kills batteries extremely fast, i have had to replace the new batteries i put in it in two weeks. it does not have a plug in cord so you cant run it on anything but batteries. works great as a mirror, just not for make up lighting.</li>
            <li> Too small and goes through batteries crazy, crazy fast</li>
            <li> BOUGHT THS FOR MY WIFE SHE LOVES THIS PRODUCT GREAT PRODUCT WORDS FROM MY WIFE</li>
            <li> Awful!  Wish I could return.  Only worked a week!</li>
            <li> I love this mirror! I ordered it from the &amp;#34;warehouse&amp;#34; for such a good price.  The light didn&#x27;t come on but I made myself be patient and look at the instructions -- it just needed a new bulb inside.  Even without the light the mirror is super.</li>
            <li> Good product good price I was very pleased and the one I gave it to lived th mirror good going</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers.  My Remington 3-way lamp burned out, and I went in search for a replacement.  I was disappointed to not find another Remington, after using it for years and years.  None of the stores carried much of a selection.  I selected the Conair.  The \\&quot;light\\&quot; really is inadequate for applying make-up.  I&#x27;m going to return it.</li>
            <li> The mirror is great. The lighting is poor. My bulb blew and I replaced it with a 40 watt bulb which cost $1.90. As long as you remember to turn it off when you&#x27;re not using it you&#x27;ll be fine and the extra 10 watts make a whole lot of difference.</li>
            <li> I just got this mirror today and after only 10 minutes, the light stopped working. I am returning this product immediately.</li>
            <li> I bought this at walmart. The light is useless. It is very dim. I like the size of the mirror thought. It&#x27;s not too small or too big. Fits perfectly on my vanity table.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror and I am very happy with it!  The amount of light is adequate for me and the magnification is more than I even need.  The size is perfect as it doesn&#x27;t look out of place on my bathroom counter.  I find it is very convenient and easy enough to pack for vacation.  As for the light bulb, mine has not burnt out yet but I will order some ahead of time from Conair.  Extremely pleased, no complaints here.</li>
            <li> The mirror magnification is just fine. But the light is so dim, you can&#x27;t see it in a lit up room. It would make a nice night light - that&#x27;s all. We even tried several new batteries.</li>
            <li> The light on the mirror is so dim that it provides no illumination while using it. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping which I enjoy.Plus the mirror is so cute defenitely something I like.Made my eyebrow plucking and makeup application much easier.</li>
            <li> Mirror is great, but the lighting is TERRIBLE.  It is so dim that it makes it difficult to see regardless of the room lighting.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loves it!  Round light/mirror and magnification perfect for our old eyes! Fits in suitcase for travel. Great value for the money.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised that I recieved my item so quickly. I was able to use it this morning while i was getting ready for work. Theres a few things I noticed right off the bat:  1) It&#x27;s SUPER light weight. Hence why it didnt recieve a full 5 stars from me. Its made out of plastic thats painted silver. Which is a bit of a downer, considering I was hoping to get something with a bit more weight to ensure it doesnt move around. But with such a great price, its not something im concerned about. :)  2) The description says it uses AA batteries or an adaptor. It does NOT come with any kind of adaptor. I dont know if maybe i just got one thats missing a cord. This doesnt really bother me, as I much prefer batteries over any kind of cables. Just a thought though, for those of you interested.  Other than those 2 things, Im really happy with it. The light isnt too bright or too dim...I feel like its perfect for me. And the fact that it has a regular reflection and 5x magnification is great! Definitely a great product for a great price!</li>
            <li> not working in 24hs !!!!!! terrible , don&#x27;t waste your money, also not bright enough at all</li>
            <li> I like the mirror but the light isn&#x27;t that bright. Maybe depends on battery strength.</li>
            <li> The light was terrible turned it on once and then turned it off and it didn&#x27;t work anymore I put several new batteries in from package nothing when it did work the first time the light was terrible it makes no difference the light on my phone was better then this mirror waste of money shaking my head!</li>
            <li> The mirror part is much smaller then what I expected and the light isn&#x27;t as bright partly because there is only one setting.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL ADDITION TO MY VANITY AREA ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE ROOM.  CAN USE IT FOR MAKE UP AND FIXING MY HAIR.  GREAT BUY!! VERY STURDY.</li>
            <li> Thought it would be a bit bigger.  It&#x27;s ok for plucking my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for 5 years and the light just went out. Only because of a power surge. I called Conair and ordered replacements for $1.50 each (it requires 2)It should be here in 4-5 business days, no shipping. I take this light when I travel even when we go camping it will run off batteries.</li>
            <li> Nice mirror, but really to small. Thinking about sending it back.</li>
            <li> The mirror does it&#x27;s job I just thought it&#x27;d be bigger. The luck sucks, I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s even there.</li>
            <li> thought it would be a brighter light, but i still like it.  good for close ups mostly but not for putting on make up like i wanted.</li>
            <li> Lighting doesnt work! I dont like it at all and the mirror it self is too small. U cant see much</li>
            <li> Mirror is fine for putting on makeup but light is not bright enough...have to use the overhead room light to pluck unwanted eyebrow hairs.</li>
            <li> definetly want my money back on this item, I HIGHLY DONT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS!&lt;br /&gt;bought batteries, put them in and the light worked very dully for like 5 minutes then went off and now doesnt work at all!&lt;br /&gt;must be made in the slums of china if i were to guess!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REFUND PLEASE!! send me a label!</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY! Lit or un-lit, no difference!!</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror because I wanted a cordless, lighted makeup mirror. I love the ascetics of the mirror. It&#x27;s a nice classic shape and sits perfectly on my makeup table. The light is not particularly bright, but it does offer some illumination that is helpful, especially if you are sitting close to the mirror or using the magnification side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this thing sucks down batteries like nobodies&#x27; business. Granted, at first I had a terrible batch of AmazonBasic batteries in it that only lasted a week. Then I tried my rechargeable batteries. The lasted a little longer, but still rather short. I just put some Duracell batteries in a few days ago, and they seem to be holding fairly steady at this point. With the other batteries, the light was already starting to dim a few days later. I noticed that several reviews mentioned the lightbulbs dying, but I think that perhaps it is the batteries instead. At first, when mine died, I thought it was the bulbs too, but so far, it has only been a battery issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again. I LOVE the cordless aspect, but the way it burns through batteries just doesn&#x27;t make it worth it. I&#x27;d buy the corded version figure out how to make that work for me.</li>
            <li> I was never able to use this mirror successfully due to its low light source. Agree with other users--this mirror was no better than an unlighted one.</li>
            <li> There is nothing WRONG with this item, it just isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;d hoped.  Apparently 5X magnification is not as strong as I thought and the light on this is pretty worthless unless the room is dark.  It adds no light if there is any light in the room</li>
            <li> The mirror is $25 at Target. For that, the bulb should last much longer. It should be easily replaceable too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this mirror for 5+ years. It has worked out great. The light blew just recently (after using everyday for 5+ years). For the price, I&#x27;m just gonna buy a new one rather than trying to find a replacement bulb.</li>
            <li> The light on this mirror is too dim for my taste. It was supposed to be a gift for my mom. Im afraid she wouldnt have seen herself in the mirror though.</li>
            <li> This is perfect the batery operated ones do not work  with my eyes.  Love the electric use I could se,e what needed to be plucked perfectly.Arrived quickly.  Excellant miror!</li>
            <li> I got this for My Wife &amp; She just loves it for doing her makeup.</li>
            <li> I bought this but have to replace the batteries every week -_-. If that wasnt the issue it would be great</li>
            <li> really really small. not worth the buy. DONT BUY IT. seriously. dont buy it. tiny small tiny. tiny. tiny. small.</li>
            <li> The light is not bright at all, its very dim. The light doesn&#x27;t stay on very long either and the batteries run out quick.</li>
            <li> It quit working shortly after I bought it and replacement batteries didn&#x27;t help.  Very cheaply made; in China, of course, and absolutely terrible quality!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize that it was battery operated :(</li>
            <li> Broke within days of owning it...</li>
            <li> I like the mirror, it lights up but the light isn&#x27;t that bright in my opinion it&#x27;s kind of small but it&#x27;s a gd beginner mirror.</li>
            <li> I love that it magnifies and I can see alot better especially with the light. It is a little smaller than I expected but it does the job.</li>
            <li> light is not bright enough.</li>
            <li> I order this a about 2 months ago now. I&#x27;ve been so busy with work and traveling I didn&#x27;t use it until recently. Put the batteries in and turned the light on. Seemed to work just fine. Turned it off and set it aside. When I went to use it the following day with the light, it wouldn&#x27;t switch on. I just thought maybe one of the batteries was a dud. A whole pack of batteries later and the light won&#x27;t turn back on still. I would love to return it if I hadn&#x27;t thrown out the box the night before after I first opened it, tested it and all seemed fine. Biggest waste of my money.</li>
            <li> The lighting isn&#x27;t very good on this mirror. The batteries drain rather quickly as well. I have only turned it on 3 times since I got it and the batteries are already dead.  I still have to use other light when i use this mirror. Other than that, it came quickly ad the actual mirror is good quality. My only issue is the lighting.</li>
            <li> i love it and am very happy with it but it is a little bit short. still happy though :)</li>
            <li> Replaced batteries and there was barely a light that came on then it died completely. Even if I switch the batteries it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It lasted for 10 years.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror. Great mirror for this price my only complaint is that it takes 3 batteries. I wish it took less.</li>
            <li> The on /off switch didn&#x27;t work after the first couple of times  I used it.  I don&#x27;t have the time to return it, so had to junk it.  Poor quality product.</li>
            <li> It was much smaller and not as bright as I needed to be . I like the light weight and cordless aspect but that is it .</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and perfect size but with brand new batteries the lights didn&#x27;t last long before I had to change batteries again</li>
            <li> this item requires batteries instead of plug in. My batteries died after 2 weeks and I didn&#x27;t want to waste batteries on this product that often, so I bought rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li> I got the magnification I wanted but the light around the mirror is way too dim to do much good. If it plugged in, the light might be the right level.</li>
            <li> Handy with no cord!  Battery operated is great!  Would recomend</li>
            <li> This product for the price does the job. No bells or whistles, just a small mirror with a very low power light. That&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> Maybe I should have read the description better but it still works great for its size.  Also is is the kind that takes batteries.</li>
            <li> GREAT MIRROR....LOVE THE 5X....USE IN EVERYDAY TO PUT ON MY MAKE&#x3D;UP.....VERY PORTABLE AND CAN BE PACKED EASILY IN SUITCASE...LOVE IT</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright, fast shipping , it&#x27;s kinda smaller than I thought, might as well buy it from.a.local store to be safe about the size their about the same.price</li>
            <li> Getting older, I&#x27;ve decided I need a lighted mirror.  This is not that mirror.  So dim as to be useless.  Returned it to Amazon.</li>
            <li> Perfect! As there are no cords, it is easy to manoeuvre around.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror and use it daily. But if you really want it for the light you should work on a battery solution. I put brand new Duracells in it and was able to use it once for about 20 minutes. Batteries went dead.</li>
            <li> this is amazing. love it</li>
            <li> The light is not very bright at all and it goes through batteries relatively quickly. We wish we would have purchased a larger one that was brighter.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my mother and she loves it. It&#x27;s nice compact and lights up! She went to Mexico and was able to take it with her since it isn&#x27;t bulky like the other one sold at stores. It&#x27;s a great buy!</li>
            <li> This is a Nice scale, works well and looks sleek. Make sure it&#x27;s calibrated on a hard surface before using.</li>
            <li> This is much smaller than I imagined. Also, the light is so faint that it doesn&#x27;t make a difference whether its on or off. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. Mine is getting donated.</li>
            <li> The light around this mirror does nothing but look pretty. I wish I had bought one with more magnification because the light does not help you see any clearer.</li>
            <li> I love this because I was getting it to go in my dorm room. Dorm room bathrooms shared by 5-6 girls seemed pretty crazy to me and I wanted a mirror I could use outside the bathroom conveniently without it being crowded.</li>
            <li> This mirror works fine. The draw back is the batteries. Batteries only last my wife one........maybe two days before needing replacement!</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd one of these mirrors I purchased.  Unfortunately the first one was broken and without it I had a really hard time doing my make-up.  I love this mirror and so glad to have a new one.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> My wife had one of these mirrors before and left it a a hotel while we were traveling this summer.  After trying a few others she asked me to try and find the one that she had.  This was it and she is happy again so I am too.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter at Christmas - she LOVED it - the light worked for 3 days and quit.  She still uses the mirror and says she didn&#x27;t care about the light.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband to use to shave with. He is unable to stand to shave.  He wished it would hav been a larger mirror and a little taller.  For now it is working.</li>
            <li> It does not have the greatest lighting like I thought it would but I still use it everyday because it has a great mirror</li>
            <li> Batteries drain super fast with this mirror. Especially if you turn it on all the time to do your makeup like my wife does. I plan to get some rechargeable batteries for her someday. Other than that the light for the mirror works great.</li>
            <li> not at all impressed.  Very small and does not magnify at all.  the light really doesnt make a diference.  if I didnt trash the box it would go back.  probably use as some gag gift.  Great idea though.</li>
            <li> ITS GREAT I LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> Not as bright as I thought it would be but I still use it!  :)</li>
            <li> Honestly, the mirror is okay but the light barely works. I didn&#x27;t notice much difference between this one and one without a light!</li>
            <li> What a great idea !&lt;br /&gt;  The mirror is double sided with a great magnifying side and a nice normal size side .&lt;br /&gt;  Easy usage ,small and breaks down for travel.&lt;br /&gt;  Uses batteries so you can take it camping or anywhere you go without needing electricity.&lt;br /&gt;  The light is all around the mirror so you can see everything !</li>
            <li> Love the mirror itself, but the battery dies very quickly.  I am assuming that&#x27;s because as you slide toward the off button the light goes out, but apparently it&#x27;s not all the way off!</li>
            <li> WASTE  OF  MONEY ! ! ! Stopped working the third time I attempted to turn it on!</li>
            <li> I am now in the market for a plug-in one, the battery life lasts for literally 2-3 uses and the light is very dim.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This mirror uses up all the juice in the 3 AA batteries it requires in about 30minutes. Never have I ever seen batteries being used so inefficiently. This is an highly inefficient machine and will cost you a small fortune to keep the mirror light on. DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> The light stopped working after 3 days. Don&#x27;t buy it for the light.</li>
            <li> Illumination is not as bright as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be bigger. It&#x27;s a nice mirror to have wear a bigger mirror is located so that you can transition to this one if you want to get a closer look of something. The lighting isn&#x27;t too bad, it isn&#x27;t bright but it is still a good amount of light.</li>
            <li> It is a good mirror but the light doesn&#x27;t really do any good at all. It is more for decoration then anything else.</li>
            <li> The light is VERY dim but the mirror is very good light weight material is excellent I didnt really buy it for the light anyways..... Its worst the money</li>
            <li> Size of mirror was ok. The bulbs burnt out after 2 times. Not enough light when they did work. I tried to replace them but it still doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Has good weight to it so it doesn&#x27;t fall over easily, the mirrors are very clear, however the Light is awfully weak.. I mean seriously did the engineers even use it with the mirror before deciding to make it a product? The light is barely noticeable when there is other light in the room.  Otherwise it is a good mirror, but if you are looking for a brighter light, try a different model or corded version.</li>
            <li> Use in guest bath. . .  Works great.</li>
            <li> Same complaint...put in 3 brand new batteries, turned it on, light is very, very dim. Turned it off then turned it back on but light failed to come on. I tried again and again but no, the light stopped working. How do manufacturers get away with such lousy products? Especially at $16.00 a pop? Incredible...also I discovered 5x magnification is really not enough to tweeze and such. Please do yourself a favor &amp; don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> Nice battery operated mirror for the price but the light wasn&#x27;t bright!</li>
            <li> This was just perfect for me.  I wanted a mirror that I could move around and hold in my hand.  The light is a bonus.  I can use it, then store it out of sight.  Very nice.</li>
            <li> The stand is too short and the mirror is too small for an adult to use.  Would recommend for a child.</li>
            <li> Purchased this mirror some time ago and it only worked for a week tops, I thought I may have left the switch on but no, it wasn&#x27;t user error. It was the product. Didn&#x27;t want to buy the big white square mirror because before now, I thought it was too tacky....well Ill take tacky over useless anyday. Not a good buy at all.</li>
            <li> I had a very large and very bright make up mirror for years.  The internal light burned out, and I needed another.  I ordered this because it looked like my former mirror and the price was good.&lt;br /&gt;It is actually very small (my fault for not measuring the dimensions on my old mirror) and the light is quite weak, not providing much illumination.&lt;br /&gt;I have since purchased another mirror that meets my needs, and I&#x27;ll keep this because I think it will work OK as a travel mirror when the time comes.</li>
            <li> Thought it would be brighter but oh well. Don&#x27;t really use the light anymore because it doesn&#x27;t make a difference.</li>
            <li> The light isn&#x27;t very bright on this one.</li>
            <li> The light is not as bright as I had hoped, it is good for general use, like applying make up, but when you need to see detail like grooming your eye brows, it could be better.</li>
            <li> The light is not bright and the bulbs burnt out after 5 uses</li>
            <li> Wanted something bigger</li>
            <li> Very disappointing. Light is extremely dim. Not bright enough to see face right in front of it.</li>
            <li> Great to have in the bathroom</li>
            <li> I had this for 3 days and I already need to change the batteries.  The light is very dim and the mirror itself is just too small for me. Not worth the money at all</li>
            <li> The light is very weak, it&#x27;s like its not on at all, even In the dark.</li>
            <li> Lights not bright enough</li>
            <li> I had the same make up mirror for years and when it blew out on me I was very disappointed and struggled to find a new one. I like the magnification on the mirror. The overall mirror is just so small! The mirror surface is small and the stand is small. I have to set it on top of things so I&#x27;m not hunched over. The light however is the worst thing about it. It dims constantly. I&#x27;ve had it a few weeks trying to make it work and I&#x27;ve already changed the batteries 3 times. I&#x27;ll keep trying to make it work since it&#x27;s all I have but had I known I would&#x27;ve saved and gotten something of better quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much smaller than I thought it&#x27;d be! :( And the light isn&#x27;t really bright, so I still have to have a lamp beside the mirror. But on the bright side, it&#x27;s light and easy to carry around.</li>
            <li> The price was right; the product seemed simple and hard to screw up. But ........ the light does no good. It&#x27;s dim, wimpy. If you want a lighted mirror, vs just a mirror, don&#x27;t buy this. Investigate a corded, plug-in.</li>
            <li> VERY VERY POOR PRODUCT. LIGHT DOES NOT SHINE ON THE MIRROR AT ALL . HAVE NOT EVEN BEEN ABLE TO USE IT. PLEASE FORWARD ADDRESS SO I CAN RETURN FOR A REFUND. THANK YOU</li>
            <li> I had to return this item, it did not live up to its reputation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like this Mirror much better, if I could find the replacement lamps for it. Can you help me with this problem?&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;BR&gt;Joyce</li>
            <li> Lights burned out after 4 weeks.  Way too much trouble to replace them.  Nothing spectacular; not big enough.  This product was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it was so cute, and had the Conair name.  Within 6 weeks, the bulb blew out, and I started looking for a replacement.  Ive been to all the local places, and everyplace I could find online.  In an obscure place I found the bulb with the right voltage but not the right wattage.  The only place I could get the correct bulb was on the conair website -- but they make you buy 10 bulbs, then charge $9.00 for handling.  The cost is more than just buying a new mirror!  a rip off!</li>
            <li> Gets over heated and turns off the light, light is really dim. Waste of 20$</li>
            <li> This mirror is smaller than we expected and the light is very dim.</li>
            <li> not much light coverage</li>
            <li> A good medium  size.  Looks nice and with the batts installed feels heavy enough that you don&#x27;t have to worry about it being knocked over easily. Looks good on the vanity too. Love that it does not need a cord.&lt;br /&gt;Mirror was clear and magnified side did not seem to have distortion.</li>
            <li> I wanted a lighted mirror for daily use. I shopped around and the average mirrors were priced around $$ and this was too much for my budget. I came across this one and took the chance as it was very well priced. It is exactly what I hoped it would be. It has a lovely finish that makes it decorative, the lighting is just right, not too bright. It magnifies without much distortion. Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Great mirror, too short.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I originally made the purchase to get my wife out of the bathroom when doing her make-up. The mirror is of very good quality and the zoom on the mirror makes it easy to see things on your face and the light works pretty well. It could be brighter but of course you get what you pay for and at this price I would recommend to any one on the market for a make up mirror.</li>
            <li> The light is not bright at all.  Don&#x27;t recommend it at all.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other raters that this a poor quality product. I can do better using a magnified mirror and a table lamp. I returned it within a few days.</li>
            <li> You purchased this item on February 12, 2009.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this mirror-its buld won&#x27;t last for 3 months.</li>
            <li> Great for seeing fine hairs and looking at pores and applying makeup</li>
            <li> Magnification was a little warped.</li>
            <li> The product descriptions claims that the mirror can run off a cord. This is not true. Only runs on AAA batteries. The mirror light is also very weak.&lt;br /&gt;Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;The light is super dim, so weak .. even though I have a new heavy duty batteries on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size is Ok, its Light weight ..&lt;br /&gt;  You could use Mirror... Only.&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t buy it yet, I&#x27;m not going to say don&#x27;t buy, its Up to you, But honestly if I were you I would add 20$ and get a Real Makeup mirror with light.</li>
            <li> For basic magnifying mirror uses, this is OK. The light isn&#x27;t very bright, and 5X magnification just barely allows me to see the stray hairs I wanted to pluck.  It might be better in brighter lighting.</li>
            <li> Very nice and compact, could use a brighter lamp, but wife loves it, so would buy again. Fits easily on the counter.</li>
            <li> Mirror has good magnification. The light is insufficient. Battery-power makes it portable and doesn&#x27;t limit where you can you it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item and immediately returned it. The lighting on this is extremely poor and I just thought it would be slightly taller. This item was not a keeper for me.</li>
            <li> Battery life is very short. Mirror is good.</li>
            <li> Item was broken. I put batteries in the mirror, and it would not turn on. Really annoyed I spent $20 on this just to be very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Does not work most of the time even with the batteries.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected it to be.  My daughter loves it though, fits nicely on her bathroom vanity.  Thank you</li>
            <li> The light it useless. Dimmer than a night light:-/</li>
            <li> really bright for battery operated</li>
            <li> The mirror part is great, the light is just not bright enough. You need extra lights on just to see what you are doing :( Not my favorite for the price, I was expecting a much bigger mirror as well.</li>
            <li> As you get older, you need a little help with make up and face maintenance.  This provides the assistance nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m traveling this year and just needed a small mirror that would pack easily.  Love that it runs on batteries, so no matter where I am, I can touch up.  Good purchase.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for  friend, but it was not the kind she wanted.  It is still in the box not being used by anyone.</li>
            <li> The light  is damn near useless, but perhaps would be useful if it was pitch black in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is all.</li>
            <li> This is ok but it&#x27;s not really bright! I thought it would have a brighter light but it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s ok but in dim lighting it&#x27;s not really good for apply makeup.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loved she has had no issues with it just buy rechargable batteries. If the bulb does go out just replaced it you crybabies. You get what you pay for</li>
            <li> the 5x is not as good as i thought, will probably order another one but find a 10x. Still a good mirror just not what i wanted</li>
            <li> Light doesn&#x27;t get bright enough at all. Basically just a magnifying mirror, and it&#x27;s great at just that.</li>
            <li> This mirror is a great value for the price! I use mine almost every day! I like that it&#x27;s double sided and lighted! Great value!</li>
            <li> I loved this product at first but two days later light stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;Kind of cheap material l.</li>
            <li> good but batteries don&#x27;t last too long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this mirror 1 month, and the light is burned out already. I do not use it daily either... probably only 6 times since I got it!</li>
            <li> I love it!  The swivel mirrors with &#x27;surround&#x27; lighting.  I use bifocals so, the magnifying mirror is perfect.  I don&#x27;t have to hold my face next to the bathroom mirror. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> The light is not bright enough and the mirror is about 3&amp;#34; in diameter.</li>
            <li> Great product just wish the light was a little brighter. I got rechargeable batteries for it.</li>
            <li> My mother has a mirror that&#x27;s just like this one, the only thing is that it lights up much more. This one is still useful though, as a regular mirror. Doesn&#x27;t help too much if you want to apply makeup and you are a perfectionist like I am.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with the low light output. I got LED lights that are much brighter. Also, the 5X magnification is not that great. I got an antique brass double-sided mirror with 10X magnification in comparison. It just doesn&#x27;t have a lamp attached.</li>
            <li> Expect no help from CONair . We are on our third. The problem is cheap bulbs that you will not be able to find. The bigger problem is that YOU are probably expecting that it will come with a working bulb. It will not. Then you are expecting that upon contacting  CONair and explaining that the unit comes with a defective bulb, they will be reasonable and send one to you...You are wrong. They said to us that they have no way of knowing how long these units sit around so it is not their problem... Amazon stepped in and helped, but I for one will never deal with this sub standard, pathetic excuse for a company again. Join me my fellow consumers !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And count my rating as a &amp;#34;Zero stars&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> only good part is the magnifying mirror, but the lighting is not adequate for indoors like an electric makeup mirror would provide.... great if you are sitting outside in the sun in a lawn chair...on a sunny day in warm climate..</li>
            <li> Great mirror. I bought this for my sister for Christmas and she loves it! We are make-up mirror people and I highly recommend this mirror!!</li>
            <li> Bought for Fiance as a christmas present, light went out before new years with 20 mins of use per day.</li>
            <li> As soon as i figure out how to return items.....this one will be. I&#x27;ve never had to return something i ordered from Amazon before. I was disappointed to find out it is battery operated and i only got 1 full use out of it before the batteries died. Delicately would not recommend.</li>
            <li> It broke within the week. junk</li>
            <li> This is NOT a lighted mirror. I so wish I&#x27;d read the reviews before purchasing. A total waste of money. Oh, and the oh-so-dim light burned out within a week, just as many others report. Junk.</li>
            <li> Really small and i need to replace the battery almost every time the I used</li>
            <li> I like this mirror it does the job but it is very, small and also the light around the mirror burnt out after a day. So you truly do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I seen one at a friends house and had to have one too. It&#x27;s just right for my needs. Somewhat small but works for me.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed by this product. When I first got it, it seemed to be fine although I would have liked brighter lights. The lights were so dim I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in light at my makeup area - which is why I ordered the product. A couple weeks after having the product, the lights completely went out. I tried to change the batteries and nothing could seem to restore the light. The only reason I gave this product even one star, is because the mirror itself is good and I like how one side of it is regular, and the other is magnified. Anyway, I would not recommend this product due to the very minimal light it puts out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this if you&#x27;re expecting it to be a normal vanity mirror. Mini would be the correct way to describe it. It&#x27;s tiny and not for normal use. My wife returned it.</li>
            <li> The product is sturdy and made well.  I thought the mirror itself was a little larger but it&#x27;s good for putting on makeup.  I would take note of the size of the mirror itself before ordering to see if the size is good for you.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a nice mirror but the light is simply USELESS. It casts a faint glow rather than a bright light needed for tweezing, extractions, etc. I wouldn&#x27;t dream of using it to apply makeup. Use the AC adaptor or batteries, there is no difference between the two, you still need to be in an extremely well lit room it render it effective. Unless you normally tweeze or apply makeup by candlelight you won&#x27;t find this mirror to be much help. It could however, make a nice (albeit expensive) night light!</li>
            <li> batteries don&#x27;t last long....have to change often... only use it for 10 minutes a day and still have to change often.  otherwise ok.</li>
            <li> not very well lighting and I returned and ordered mirror with cord</li>
            <li> I liked this mirror so much that I bought my mother one, too. The light on it isn&#x27;t that strong or bright but the magnification is perfect. Can&#x27;t put on my face without it! :)</li>
            <li> Ridiculously small, but i guess that is my fault for not reading the description well enough.  May be nice on a little girl&#x27;s desk, but not for an average-sized human being, perhaps ;)</li>
            <li> My husband needed this so he could shave in bed, laid up do to surgery, and it is excellent, light better than reviews say and very well made item.</li>
            <li> According to the user it was given to, the light is not very bright.</li>
            <li> My light bulb blew out after a few months. Even after replacing the light bulb, it no longer works. It&#x27;s also very small in size which makes it difficult to apply makeup.</li>
            <li> Light too weak to see by.</li>
            <li> The batteries do not last very long. Mirror is very small, not well made and broke very easy. I have had to purchase another mirror to replace it because the mirror broke while trying to adj the mirror position. I was not touching the mirror I was touching the frame and the mirror cracked. The light is not very bright even when the batteries are fresh. The batteries last about 1 hour of on time.</li>
            <li> Came and didn&#x27;t light up; I returned it easily though. I was reimbursed promptly</li>
            <li> My Daughter loves having her own makeup mirror, thank you for the timely delivery!</li>
            <li> This is quite small, and the light is not strong but it is perfectly good quality and works fine.</li>
            <li> I have to buy batteries for the light.</li>
            <li> Light is not bright.  Doesn&#x27;t last long on the batteries.  Mirror is very small.  Maybe would be okay as a child&#x27;s toy...</li>
            <li> Much smaller than what I thought.</li>
            <li> The light never works. It&#x27;s very cheap quality for the price.</li>
            <li> A true waste of money. The mirror barely lights up, thus defeating the purpose of having a lighted mirror. I am returning it.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as part of my 17 year old Granddaughter&#x27;s birthday present.  She sent me a text message this morning to tell me she uses it everyday and she loves the mirror.</li>
            <li> First time that I saw the mirror I feel like it was too mall to use but, when I start to use it make a good job.&lt;br /&gt;It is not too big and it fit with my makeup table. I still see the point that I have to cover clearly when I use this mirror even it is a small point on my face! I recommend for people who have a limit space and want a good mirror.&lt;br /&gt;ps. about the light it is not really help that much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good mirror, don&#x27;t get me wrong, the magnifying side is especially helpful, but be prepared to have a dedicated light source behind you, because the light A.) isn&#x27;t very bright and B.) drains batteries like water in a sink.</li>
            <li> The batteries die so fast with this that I have replaced the batteries 4 times and I have only had it for 2 months. I don&#x27;t even use the light everyday and when I do, its not for more than a couple of minutes. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It was really to small for my wife net time i will check the measurments more closely I guess thats my misstake</li>
            <li> I received the product, put brand new batteries in it, turned it on and off twice and the bulb immediately burned out. I could not be more upset. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> my daughter bought this for her mother and see likes very much. for the money it was a very good buy.</li>
            <li> I was hoping the lights would be a little brighter.  It isn&#x27;t a great mirror, but I needed a decent size mirror with lights that I can take with me on trips. This does the trick. I&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;m going to keep it from cracking, but I&#x27;m sure clothes for padding will help.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great mirror if you need one to travel with and can&#x27;t be sure about the electric.  If you want a pretty one to stay on your vanity there are much nicer ones.</li>
            <li> I got this mirrors so that I could thread my eyebrows at home. For such precision work, one needs a mirror that you can get close to. I like the magnification, and the light is very helpful as well. It also looks great on my vanity.</li>
            <li> The product has a mind of its own, only work sometimes, do not buy.</li>
            <li> The light is not as bright as I would have expected it to be, but it is great for a travel mirror that is lighted.</li>
            <li> I wanted a lighted mirror for daily use. I shopped around and the average mirrors were priced around $$ and this was too much for my budget. I came across this one and took the chance as it was very well priced. It is exactly what I hoped it would be. It has a lovely finish that makes it decorative, the lighting is just right, not too bright and I didn&#x27;t find it dim like I saw others mention. The magnification is wonderful too. I would highly recommend this mirror for anyone looking for a daily use mirror. Thanks Amazon. It also was very well wrapped and packaged and arrived very quickly,</li>
            <li> batteries coroded fast in the casing, not bathroom humidity safe</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this very much because the light is very dim and barely makes a difference.</li>
            <li> make sure you check the size.  It really goes through batteries.  Plus I find it only works it I hold it up to my face.  So that only leaves one hand available.</li>
            <li> Works great, but the light is pretty dim. I have to get right up to the mirror for the light to reflect on my face.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as nice as I thought, my loss.</li>
            <li> Pretty good for its price. Eats up batteries like they&#x27;re nothing. Bought rechargeable batteries and solved that problem.</li>
            <li> LED Light is not very bright at all. Aside from that, good construction; sturdy. Hate the fact that its battery operated.</li>
            <li> This mirror is nice, but the light sucks! I placed batteries inside and the light didn&#x27;t work. I even replaced the bulb; even though I just opened it from the box, the light still didn&#x27;t work. What a rip off. Please don&#x27;t buy this mirror if you want a light.</li>
            <li> The lighting is much dimmer then I expected but it does the job. Its just the right size to move around. It came on time and is a descent make up mirror</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter&#x27;s birthday.  She uses it daily and says the lighting and magnification are perfect for her needs.</li>
            <li> Product did not work. I even bought new batteries and it still didn&#x27;t work! I will be sending it back as soon as possible for a refund!</li>
            <li> Light does not stay on</li>
            <li> The lights start to go dim after one use! I have only been using it for a week or so and have replaced the batteries three times. Not worth the money!</li>
            <li> shipped fast, i love that it doesnt have a cord so you can take it anywhere as long as it has batteries, oh and it works well!</li>
            <li> I love evrything about it except that the light is not bright at all. Other than that its perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> Bought 2 for my two teen daughters.  Replaced batteries several time but ine never worked the other for 5 mins.</li>
            <li> I thought my skin was pretty awesome....till I bought this thing.  Now I am pretty sure I&#x27;m half lizard.  It&#x27;s pretty awful.  I will never look at myself the same way again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT MAGNIFY YOUR FACE, you have been warned....</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Drains battery though; I&#x27;m going through 6 batteries every 2 weeks. However, I can still use the mirror.</li>
            <li> Had to return -- light didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> The mirror is ok but the size is not what I expected. In looking at the photo on line it looked bigger to me. I imagined it was a much larger mirror in itself. With the mirror small in size its difficult to judge things even with magnification. I&#x27;ve seen th same mirror much cheaper at $10. So i was kind pf taken back at what I paid for $25.00. I should have received a bigger product.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought. Very lightweight.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a battery operated \\&quot;Lighted\\&quot; mirror - do not order this! First mirror arrived - the bulb blew after only one minute of being on. There was nothing else in my price range on Amazon so I returned it and hoped for the best with a replacement. With the second shipment, the bulb did not work at all! Outrageous!!! I did contact Amazon and they were more than helpful and refunded my money. Even as a magnified mirror with no light, it is rather small.</li>
            <li> I like that there is not a cord but this mirror eats batteries like they are ice cream.  No kidding.  Also, for me, a higher magnification would be better.</li>
            <li> Awful product, drained battery, smallish, and doesn&#x27;t work anymore. Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> This is a piece of crap. Barely has any light, it&#x27;s as if theres no light at all. Also, it just stopped working after a few weeks. Don&#x27;t do it!</li>
            <li> Everyone needs one of these!! Weather you like it or not, this mirror helps you see the things on your face you may not want anyone to see ;)</li>
            <li> goes thru batteries way too quick</li>
            <li> the light stopped working after 2 days.</li>
            <li> Too lightweight and not very good quality.  The light bulb didn&#x27;t last a month and it was quite a problem to find a replacement bulb.  And when it is lite, it isn&#x27;t very bright.  Should have just left the bulb burned out and saved the batteries. I wouldn&#x27;t buy another one, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> Its too small and the light burns out everytime you put in new batteries!!!</li>
            <li> had to return on christmas morning! :( the light didn&#x27;t work at all!</li>
            <li> I enjoy this mirror very much - a good size for older person. The light doesn&#x27;t really help much, but the price was best at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that 5x magnification was not very much. Following cataract surgery, I now do not have any close-up vision and hoped this would be good for putting on mascara, but NO.</li>
            <li> The lighting is inadequate.  The battery compartment is poorly constructed so that the batteries have to be shimmed to work.  Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Thought the mirror was bigger, didn&#x27;t pay attention to dimensions in description...love the idea of battery operated, can be moved/used  anywhere</li>
            <li> I only had it for a month before the light around the mirror completely died. I changed the batteries but that didn&#x27;t fix it so I figure the light is just burned out. It will randomly make a hissing noise coming from the base, even though the switch is in the off position. I don&#x27;t want to toss it because the mirror itself is nice but the lights dimmed after a couple of weeks and now are just dead. Bummer.</li>
            <li> Great make-up mirror.  Travels well.</li>
            <li> This item was horrible. I tried it out right when I received it in the mail. After adding AA batteries and turning it on, it worked for a few minutes then suddenly stopped lighting up. It was dead. I tried turning it off then on again, the light still did not work. I bought this item brand new. I am extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> The light super sucks! It doesn&#x27;t illuminate at all.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought.</li>
            <li> The part of this that I have trouble with is the light.  The batteries are burned out but I can&#x27;t get the cover off of them.  I bought this specifically for the light but the batteries didn&#x27;t last long (that may have been cheap/old batteries on my part) and now I can&#x27;t change them.</li>
            <li> cheap crappy thing with little light</li>
            <li> I use my mirror everyday! Iv&#x27;e had this mirror for a while now and the light still hasn&#x27;t gone out. Deferentially worth your money.</li>
            <li> I would like to give this mirror negative stars it was so bad.  It was so small. it came cracked, and the light literally worked once or twice before it died.  Terrible.</li>
            <li> Eats batteries like crazy.</li>
            <li> The light does not get that bright but it&#x27;s still a nice looking mirror!</li>
            <li> Excellent present for my young teenage girls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of disappointed by the battery life on this thing. When I initially got it I was upset that it was battery operated in the first place but that was probably a huge oversight on my part. But I swear the batteries don&#x27;t even last through one makeup application! Also the light doesn&#x27;t give off enough light. BUMMER. But the mirror is of good quality aside from the lighting issue.</li>
            <li> Works great, doesn&#x27;t come with batteries. You would need 3 AA. Light is not that bright. Light in both sides.</li>
            <li> I love the size for my dorm room, but the light was so dim I ended up buying a different Conair, and gave this one to my younger sister to play with.</li>
            <li> Not bright, sucky product..</li>
            <li> Very upset with this item I always have to put a new battery every time for the light to be very bright it doesn&#x27;t last long the bright light turns into a yellow dark is not clear enough not happy with this item I&#x27;m better off with the cord one</li>
            <li> Light was not bright but really good mirror</li>
            <li> Nice but smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> Magnifying side was a little distorted, possibly because of its size. It turned out smaller than I had thought and unfortunately had to return it.</li>
            <li> Nice! And in great condition.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and the light blew out within 3 or 4 days. It is okay, if you don&#x27;t mind the light going out, it&#x27;s fine...</li>
            <li> Technically it does what it says, but when it said it was lighted and showed the light[s] went all the way around I was expecting much more illumination.  The amount of light given off is about the same as the &lt;1 watt covered led nightlights I buy for saving electricity so I can navigate my home at night without having to turn on the main lights. Does it light? Yes?  Is it enough for makeup, only in a well lit room to start with.</li>
            <li> I have had one of these for years and now have a teenage daughter that was in need of a make-up mirror so I was excited to see one just like the one I have used and love.  Hope it holds up as great as mine has, if it doesn&#x27;t I will edit my review accordingly.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought it was but that&#x27;s my own fault. The light isn&#x27;t fantastic so I always accidentally leave it on and the batteries are always dying. It&#x27;s also pretty flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use it for my eyebrows so it does the job it&#x27;s supposed to do but I wish I would have bought a different one.</li>
            <li> Died after about a month.  The light was also very dim.  Will get a more expensive model next time.</li>
            <li> I was hopint to use this as the light I use to do makeup with. I should have read the other reviews first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The magnification is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sits on a shelf and I use it when I am putting on earrings, and sometimes I will grab it and use it as a hand held mirror to see the back of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dissapointed about the light.</li>
