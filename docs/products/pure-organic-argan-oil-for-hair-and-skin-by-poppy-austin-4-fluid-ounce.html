            <li>Love Argan oil.</li>
            <li>I also think the 4 oz bottle is a better bargain for the price</li>
            <li>and I spilled most of it.  </li>
            <li>From now on I am going to make sure it is on a more level surface or I will put a facecloth on the sink so it can rest on it so it will not slip.  </li>
            <li>Poppy&#x27;s oil is nice and light.</li>
            <li>Skin seems to be brighter, softer and more supple.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it for a great all-around beauty regimen.</li>
            <li>Love this oil.  </li>
            <li>Need to order more.</li>
            <li>Each time I use the oil, my hair feels softer and more manageable.  </li>
            <li>dermatologist recommended so many products over the years, from over the counter solutions to prescription grade solutions, all with varied results.</li>
            <li>I love most</li>
            <li>I love love love this product.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE it even more than the Moroccan Oil.  </li>
            <li>The oil also does not have a scent, which my husband, who has allergies to most scented products, loves.  </li>
            <li>Love this oil.</li>
            <li>and i love the effect on my skin.</li>

            <li>This oil is an anti-inflammatory and works great for imperfections, irritations or even to help clear breakouts.</li>
            <li>Poppy Austin Argon Oil is great for both men and women who want to improve the look and health of their hair and skin naturally.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so soft and it makes me happy to put it on.</li>
            <li>Never felt it was worth the price that another popular brand was selling.  </li>
            <li>Love love love this Argan oil will buy again, works very well.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I use Argan Oil and I am loving the result.</li>
            <li>Works great for razor burn, or pretty much anything.</li>
            <li>Thank you for a fine product.</li>
            <li>Thank you Poppy Austin for making such an amazing product, that is chemical free!!</li>
            <li>Great to find Poppy Austin&#x27;s argan oil since it was the same product that I was use to from Morocco.  </li>
            <li>Great for oily acne-prone skin, as it did not break me out and actually controls oil.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my hair and scalp primarily to help reduce hair thinning.</li>
            <li>When I wash my hair in the morning it is silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels fantastic.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and recently, even the best moisturizers I could buy started causing problems Doing some research, I discovered argan oil to be at the top of the list of non comedogenic moisturizers and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Good product all natural.</li>
            <li>As great if not better than the top rated oil!</li>
            <li>I love this oil very much.</li>
            <li>After looking and spending thousands of $$ at hair salons finally my hair dresser who is also the proud retired owner of two former salons which he sold at the peak of the market, and does hair for Jennifer Anniston, Britney spears amongst others said this was a good a oil.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see a significant difference???</li>
            <li>Then, I use 1 full drop per eye.  </li>
            <li>Love this oil, very affordable.</li>
            <li>Better yet very competitive price.</li>
            <li>I use this everywhere; mix it in with body lotion, use full strength on hair and nails.  </li>
            <li>I &#x27;pray&#x27; that these Morracan Women (and famiies) are just and fairly treated and properly honored with the right/proper Pay!</li>
            <li>Oil is light, absorbs right into the skin, no odor.</li>
            <li>It is not perfumed and has a mild smell which I like.</li>
            <li>My face drys out quickly and I need to reapply the oil a couple of times a day for my skin to stay hydrated.</li>
            <li>It definitely makes the ends of my hair look so much better, and my hair looks thicker and not crunchy like most volumizing products will make the hair feel.  </li>
            <li>I love Poppy Austin Argan oil and will most definitely keep on using it</li>
            <li>Absorbs quick.  </li>
            <li>My husband likes this product better than the argan oil he had ordered directly from Morocco... keeps his face supple and smooth.</li>
            <li>No dry patches, smoother, clearer and more radiant!</li>
            <li>Heals my skin great in less time.</li>
            <li>I chose the poppy Austin, and it has left my hair completely and beautifully shinny, non greasy.</li>
            <li>The positive difference is in the price (Poppy&#x27;s is much more reasonable).</li>
            <li>It does not absorb fast, it does take a while.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is fine.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft, silky, and with a healthy shine.  </li>
            <li>Give it a try, worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Smells fresh ...</li>
            <li>I have used many different products over the years and was fortunate to find out about Argon oil.</li>
            <li>It ls straight, shiny, healthy looking, and very manageable.</li>
            <li>and I figured it is worth a try.</li>
            <li>Great product, and half the price of Josie Morans!</li>
            <li>I apply my foundation right over it, and it stays all day.</li>
            <li>did not have high hopes for this product, but I was also happy to try it since it was natural and there would be no negative side effects like many traditional skin treatments.  </li>
            <li>What makes this product even better is that its 100% natural and your supporting a co-op.  </li>
            <li>I am 64 and have great face skin, very few wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a few different brands of argon oil, Poppy Austin brand is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>It feels great to be giving back to myself and others at the same time.</li>
            <li>I am happy to say that not only did the oil rejuvenate my skin, but also has brought life back to my overly abused hair.  </li>
            <li>My skin is a lot smoother than it was before, and surprisingly, my face , which was a big source of breakouts, has cleared considerably.</li>
            <li>I am on my second bottle (double the size of my first trial purchase) and have never been so happy with a moisturizer before.  </li>
            <li>Good quality oil, smells a little</li>
            <li>I am a psychiatric nurse and my husband a Stanford chemical engineer who lets he say put &amp;#34;everything in spreadsheets as a challenge for the correct items.&amp;#34; Now, I have heard wonderful things over the other brands, straight from Morroco, where we visited last year on a trip, and highly priced Josie&#x27;s star oil, to cabella&#x27;s $38 an ounce oil, to $300 an celebrity items per ounce!</li>
            <li>It penetrates the hair so fast!</li>
            <li>Love this specific argan oil.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;m using Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li>It literally takes only one drip to spread all over the face, or drip in your favorite moisturizer in your palms and apply.</li>
            <li>First time buyer from Poppy Austin.</li>
            <li>I wish I had known about this product in my twenties and have suggested it to 2 younger friends (one in her 20&#x27;s) who are using it and are pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>, I received my order quickly, even during the busy holiday months!!</li>
            <li>Super light, penetrates deeply, used it for 2 weeks......</li>
            <li>Pure Argan Oil is a much welcomed Gift for My Life!  </li>
            <li>You can accomplish any hair routine, curl and flip, no fly away&#x27;s or frizziness, and just beautiful hair.</li>
            <li>My skin has been dry on my arms and legs and this oil has truly helped in keeping it healthy.</li>
            <li>be it amber or blue, but it should also be in glass because chemicals from plastic can mix easily with pure oils.  </li>
            <li>OMG, I use it on my face, my hair, and basically anywhere on my body that has some sort of an issue, whether it be a rash, an irritation, or just pure dryness.  </li>
            <li>You can tell this is pure argan oil because there is no added colors.  </li>
            <li>Did start to notice after a while that my face became oily and started breaking out with large zits.</li>
            <li>I used to use Moroccan Oil, but when I had problems ordering it, I went looking for another source of Argan Oil and found Poppy Austin Pure Organic Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>It is very hydrating and is healing my skin.</li>
            <li>If you are really greasy you used to much.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much Poppy Austin and Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is a real life saver.</li>
            <li>I am a diabetic and do not heal fast.</li>
            <li>You really must try it.</li>
            <li>My hair naturally dryer and styled At the lowest setting!!!</li>
            <li>There is no oily feeling left on your skin after you put it on like many other oils and leaves you with a smooth and silky feel.</li>
            <li>I thought that adding this to the treatment I am already doing would be helpful and early indications are that I am right.</li>
            <li>It absorbs better and faster than any other oil I&#x27;ve tried and my acne is non-existent.</li>
            <li>Will be trying other products in the line, since I&#x27;m so pleased with this one.</li>
            <li>Has a very light, slightly hazelnut scent .</li>
            <li>but it is not long lasting i love what it does for my skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a huge bottle and will go a long way!</li>
            <li>At first when you pour the oil in your hand it looks like it&#x27;s very oily, but it penetrates the skin very fast and disappears within minutes and leave your hands well moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this company and product.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised!!</li>
            <li>They are all pretty much the same.  </li>
            <li>But, maybe that&#x27;s normal for this oil.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this oil, I use it everyday in my hair.</li>
            <li>It is fine, like any other 100% argan oil.  </li>
            <li>in my culture looks is everything since we are taught from a very young age to compete and become miss universe, so</li>
            <li>that is very sensitive and prone to breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Same Argan oil I have purchased for a higher price.</li>
            <li>But, it seems so damn precious that I might use it on my face only, or stretch it with other oils if using it on my hair.</li>
            <li>I purchases Argan oil in Europe and found it to be very positive for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>who are of similar mind or personal standards and taste; their positive responses are much like mine.  </li>
            <li>I saw my skin going from dry to very soft the first week I started applying this product.</li>
            <li>I have ULTRA sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My naturally curly hair LOVES this product.  </li>
            <li>I have given and recommended to my near and dear,</li>
            <li>Now the secret to gorgeous hair is not wash constantly, so you can go up to a week and the hair does not become greasy or smelly of applied at the ends.</li>
            <li>It sinks right in.  </li>
            <li>Using a small amount on my hair daily and my hair is sooo soft now and feels really healthy</li>
            <li>This oil is so smooth and silky on my skin and does not feel greased down!!</li>
            <li>but it seems like the result is mighty fast, or at least the shine is instant and you don&#x27;t feel that stickiness of the gel or spray.</li>
            <li>New growth is seem almost after a month of religious application...</li>
            <li>It styled very fast and I am extremely content.</li>
            <li>But for the short time I&#x27;ve been using it, I can see that my skin is soft and supple and my hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I fully recommend Poppy Austin Argon Oil for those who are tired of lackluster results from products that are manmade, and cost way more than this natural alternative.</li>
            <li>You only need a few drops for most uses so it also lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I spread 3-4 drops of  argan oil over my entire face and neck and what is  left on my eyelids is enough to allow me to create a straight line of eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>After getting tired of my skin feeling like a science experiment, she suggest that I try Argon oil, and thanks to a bit of research and many other reviews from users, I settled on Poppy Austin Argon Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, not greasy at all, and absorbs right into the skin.  </li>
            <li>It does not absorb into the skin as fast as other argan oil</li>
            <li>I use a clear gel also on my hair after I apply both products to my hair which cause it to have a white look to the gel, but once it dries, the white color goes away.  </li>
            <li>Instructions are clear and ingredient list is very short, only Argan oil.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Of course, I still get an occasional pimple, but only on one or two places, but I no longer have the all over redness and pitting that comes with adult acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anything pure and natural, such as essential oils, need to be in a dark colored bottle</li>
            <li>My hair shaft absorbs the oil resulting in soft and moisturized hair all day long.</li>
            <li>I am Venezuelan and have purchased about $600 worth of hair oils this past month alone,</li>
            <li>For my face, I use 5 drops in my palm, rub a little bit and press firmly in my whole face.  </li>
            <li>is that you only need a little bit to cover your hair and skin, and the bottle size is very generous for the price.  </li>
            <li>This bottle will last me a long time because a little goes a long ways, so you are getting your monies worth with this product.</li>

            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> Love Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I also think the 4 oz bottle is a better bargain for the price</li>
            <li> and I spilled most of it.  </li>
            <li> From now on I am going to make sure it is on a more level surface or I will put a facecloth on the sink so it can rest on it so it will not slip.  </li>
            <li> Poppy&#x27;s oil is nice and light.</li>
            <li> Skin seems to be brighter, softer and more supple.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it for a great all-around beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> Love this oil.  </li>
            <li> Need to order more.</li>
            <li> Each time I use the oil, my hair feels softer and more manageable.  </li>
            <li> dermatologist recommended so many products over the years, from over the counter solutions to prescription grade solutions, all with varied results.</li>
            <li> I love most</li>
            <li> I love love love this product.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE it even more than the Moroccan Oil.  </li>
            <li> The oil also does not have a scent, which my husband, who has allergies to most scented products, loves.  </li>
            <li> Love this oil.</li>
            <li> and i love the effect on my skin.</li>

            <li> I love this oil.</li>
            <li> far so good!</li>
            <li> Fabulous moisturizer on skin but use sparingly soaks in skin quickly and feels really good</li>
            <li> First bottle purchased seemed good but purchases after we&#x27;re not as good.stopped using and noted decrease in skin breakouts.</li>
            <li> Large bottle, good price.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased this time from Poppy, the price is great and will be purchasing more in the future.  </li>
            <li> This oil is an anti-inflammatory and works great for imperfections, irritations or even to help clear breakouts.</li>
            <li> Poppy Austin Argon Oil is great for both men and women who want to improve the look and health of their hair and skin naturally.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so soft and it makes me happy to put it on.</li>
            <li> Never felt it was worth the price that another popular brand was selling.  </li>
            <li> Love love love this Argan oil will buy again, works very well.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I use Argan Oil and I am loving the result.</li>
            <li> Works great for razor burn, or pretty much anything.</li>
            <li> Thank you for a fine product.</li>
            <li> Thank you Poppy Austin for making such an amazing product, that is chemical free!!</li>
            <li> Great to find Poppy Austin&#x27;s argan oil since it was the same product that I was use to from Morocco.  </li>
            <li> Great for oily acne-prone skin, as it did not break me out and actually controls oil.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my hair and scalp primarily to help reduce hair thinning.</li>
            <li> When I wash my hair in the morning it is silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and recently, even the best moisturizers I could buy started causing problems Doing some research, I discovered argan oil to be at the top of the list of non comedogenic moisturizers and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Good product all natural.</li>
            <li> As great if not better than the top rated oil!</li>
            <li> I love this oil very much.</li>
            <li> After looking and spending thousands of $$ at hair salons finally my hair dresser who is also the proud retired owner of two former salons which he sold at the peak of the market, and does hair for Jennifer Anniston, Britney spears amongst others said this was a good a oil.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a significant difference???</li>
            <li> Then, I use 1 full drop per eye.  </li>
            <li> Love this oil, very affordable.</li>
            <li> Better yet very competitive price.</li>
            <li> I use this everywhere; mix it in with body lotion, use full strength on hair and nails.  </li>
            <li> I &#x27;pray&#x27; that these Morracan Women (and famiies) are just and fairly treated and properly honored with the right/proper Pay!</li>
            <li> Oil is light, absorbs right into the skin, no odor.</li>
            <li> It is not perfumed and has a mild smell which I like.</li>
            <li> My face drys out quickly and I need to reapply the oil a couple of times a day for my skin to stay hydrated.</li>
            <li> It definitely makes the ends of my hair look so much better, and my hair looks thicker and not crunchy like most volumizing products will make the hair feel.  </li>
            <li> I love Poppy Austin Argan oil and will most definitely keep on using it</li>
            <li> Absorbs quick.  </li>
            <li> My husband likes this product better than the argan oil he had ordered directly from Morocco... keeps his face supple and smooth.</li>
            <li> No dry patches, smoother, clearer and more radiant!</li>
            <li> Heals my skin great in less time.</li>
            <li> I chose the poppy Austin, and it has left my hair completely and beautifully shinny, non greasy.</li>
            <li> The positive difference is in the price (Poppy&#x27;s is much more reasonable).</li>
            <li> It does not absorb fast, it does take a while.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is fine.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft, silky, and with a healthy shine.  </li>
            <li> Give it a try, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Smells fresh ...</li>
            <li> I have used many different products over the years and was fortunate to find out about Argon oil.</li>
            <li> It ls straight, shiny, healthy looking, and very manageable.</li>
            <li> and I figured it is worth a try.</li>
            <li> Great product, and half the price of Josie Morans!</li>
            <li> I apply my foundation right over it, and it stays all day.</li>
            <li> did not have high hopes for this product, but I was also happy to try it since it was natural and there would be no negative side effects like many traditional skin treatments.  </li>
            <li> What makes this product even better is that its 100% natural and your supporting a co-op.  </li>
            <li> I am 64 and have great face skin, very few wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different brands of argon oil, Poppy Austin brand is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> It feels great to be giving back to myself and others at the same time.</li>
            <li> I am happy to say that not only did the oil rejuvenate my skin, but also has brought life back to my overly abused hair.  </li>
            <li> My skin is a lot smoother than it was before, and surprisingly, my face , which was a big source of breakouts, has cleared considerably.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle (double the size of my first trial purchase) and have never been so happy with a moisturizer before.  </li>
            <li> Good quality oil, smells a little</li>
            <li> I am a psychiatric nurse and my husband a Stanford chemical engineer who lets he say put &amp;#34;everything in spreadsheets as a challenge for the correct items.&amp;#34; Now, I have heard wonderful things over the other brands, straight from Morroco, where we visited last year on a trip, and highly priced Josie&#x27;s star oil, to cabella&#x27;s $38 an ounce oil, to $300 an celebrity items per ounce!</li>
            <li> It penetrates the hair so fast!</li>
            <li> Love this specific argan oil.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;m using Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li> It literally takes only one drip to spread all over the face, or drip in your favorite moisturizer in your palms and apply.</li>
            <li> First time buyer from Poppy Austin.</li>
            <li> I wish I had known about this product in my twenties and have suggested it to 2 younger friends (one in her 20&#x27;s) who are using it and are pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> , I received my order quickly, even during the busy holiday months!!</li>
            <li> Super light, penetrates deeply, used it for 2 weeks......</li>
            <li> Pure Argan Oil is a much welcomed Gift for My Life!  </li>
            <li> You can accomplish any hair routine, curl and flip, no fly away&#x27;s or frizziness, and just beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> My skin has been dry on my arms and legs and this oil has truly helped in keeping it healthy.</li>
            <li> be it amber or blue, but it should also be in glass because chemicals from plastic can mix easily with pure oils.  </li>
            <li> OMG, I use it on my face, my hair, and basically anywhere on my body that has some sort of an issue, whether it be a rash, an irritation, or just pure dryness.  </li>
            <li> You can tell this is pure argan oil because there is no added colors.  </li>
            <li> Did start to notice after a while that my face became oily and started breaking out with large zits.</li>
            <li> I used to use Moroccan Oil, but when I had problems ordering it, I went looking for another source of Argan Oil and found Poppy Austin Pure Organic Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> It is very hydrating and is healing my skin.</li>
            <li> If you are really greasy you used to much.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much Poppy Austin and Amazon.</li>
            <li> It is a real life saver.</li>
            <li> I am a diabetic and do not heal fast.</li>
            <li> You really must try it.</li>
            <li> My hair naturally dryer and styled At the lowest setting!!!</li>
            <li> There is no oily feeling left on your skin after you put it on like many other oils and leaves you with a smooth and silky feel.</li>
            <li> I thought that adding this to the treatment I am already doing would be helpful and early indications are that I am right.</li>
            <li> It absorbs better and faster than any other oil I&#x27;ve tried and my acne is non-existent.</li>
            <li> Will be trying other products in the line, since I&#x27;m so pleased with this one.</li>
            <li> Has a very light, slightly hazelnut scent .</li>
            <li> but it is not long lasting i love what it does for my skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a huge bottle and will go a long way!</li>
            <li> At first when you pour the oil in your hand it looks like it&#x27;s very oily, but it penetrates the skin very fast and disappears within minutes and leave your hands well moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li> High quality.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this company and product.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised!!</li>
            <li> They are all pretty much the same.  </li>
            <li> But, maybe that&#x27;s normal for this oil.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this oil, I use it everyday in my hair.</li>
            <li> It is fine, like any other 100% argan oil.  </li>
            <li> in my culture looks is everything since we are taught from a very young age to compete and become miss universe, so</li>
            <li> that is very sensitive and prone to breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Same Argan oil I have purchased for a higher price.</li>
            <li> But, it seems so damn precious that I might use it on my face only, or stretch it with other oils if using it on my hair.</li>
            <li> I purchases Argan oil in Europe and found it to be very positive for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> who are of similar mind or personal standards and taste; their positive responses are much like mine.  </li>
            <li> I saw my skin going from dry to very soft the first week I started applying this product.</li>
            <li> I have ULTRA sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My naturally curly hair LOVES this product.  </li>
            <li> I have given and recommended to my near and dear,</li>
            <li> Now the secret to gorgeous hair is not wash constantly, so you can go up to a week and the hair does not become greasy or smelly of applied at the ends.</li>
            <li> It sinks right in.  </li>
            <li> Using a small amount on my hair daily and my hair is sooo soft now and feels really healthy</li>
            <li> This oil is so smooth and silky on my skin and does not feel greased down!!</li>
            <li> but it seems like the result is mighty fast, or at least the shine is instant and you don&#x27;t feel that stickiness of the gel or spray.</li>
            <li> New growth is seem almost after a month of religious application...</li>
            <li> It styled very fast and I am extremely content.</li>
            <li> But for the short time I&#x27;ve been using it, I can see that my skin is soft and supple and my hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I fully recommend Poppy Austin Argon Oil for those who are tired of lackluster results from products that are manmade, and cost way more than this natural alternative.</li>
            <li> You only need a few drops for most uses so it also lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I spread 3-4 drops of  argan oil over my entire face and neck and what is  left on my eyelids is enough to allow me to create a straight line of eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> After getting tired of my skin feeling like a science experiment, she suggest that I try Argon oil, and thanks to a bit of research and many other reviews from users, I settled on Poppy Austin Argon Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, not greasy at all, and absorbs right into the skin.  </li>
            <li> It does not absorb into the skin as fast as other argan oil</li>
            <li> I use a clear gel also on my hair after I apply both products to my hair which cause it to have a white look to the gel, but once it dries, the white color goes away.  </li>
            <li> Instructions are clear and ingredient list is very short, only Argan oil.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Of course, I still get an occasional pimple, but only on one or two places, but I no longer have the all over redness and pitting that comes with adult acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anything pure and natural, such as essential oils, need to be in a dark colored bottle</li>
            <li> My hair shaft absorbs the oil resulting in soft and moisturized hair all day long.</li>
            <li> I am Venezuelan and have purchased about $600 worth of hair oils this past month alone,</li>
            <li> For my face, I use 5 drops in my palm, rub a little bit and press firmly in my whole face.  </li>
            <li> is that you only need a little bit to cover your hair and skin, and the bottle size is very generous for the price.  </li>
            <li> This bottle will last me a long time because a little goes a long ways, so you are getting your monies worth with this product.</li>
            <li> I have only used Pure Argan Oil by Poppy Austin a few times, but the brittleness ia already gone!  </li>
            <li> I use a few drops and my skin is very soft</li>
            <li> so I cannot attest to long term benefits.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly &amp; a few drops leaves my beard soft.</li>
            <li> At 73 years old My beauty secrets and devices are few and carefully chosen: they have are no (obviously) harmful ingredients and are composed of a few simple, organic (when possible) ingredients.</li>
            <li> Bottle was actually larger than I expected!</li>
            <li> I think it smells a little weird, but tolerable for it&#x27;s many benefits.</li>
            <li> The inside of my nose get so dry that when I wake up in the morning, it hurts me to touch or move my nose when I wash my face.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this product for anyone with dry skin or hair.</li>
            <li> Also appears to stop dry, flaking skin under my beard.</li>
            <li> Dry skin gone almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I use this oil on my face in my hair, and for dry or irritated skin on my body.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I have used any number of creams, lotions and oils on my lower legs to try to alleviate severely dry skin.  </li>
            <li> At times it also seemed to dry my skin out and at times was oily also???</li>
            <li> I had to totally reimagine my skin care routine and after a few years of trying everything under the sun, started using this argan oil as my daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Same quality only half the price!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, this will last me forever.</li>
            <li> Purchased this oil several times in the past several months.</li>
            <li> It has a different fragrance than JM Argan oil, but for about half the price, it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> Only a small drop is needed even if it doesn&#x27;t feel like enough.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and use the argan oil on my face, neck, hands and arms.</li>
            <li> City water and the harsh dry winter left my skin and hair so dry!  </li>
            <li> I have moisture with absolutely no irritation.  </li>
            <li> and it was not pure and it stated so on the bottle, which by the way was plastic although it had an amber color to the bottle.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so did not over do.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> it is the oily after effects go away immediately unlike other oils.</li>
            <li> I do this every night after all my other skincare items.  </li>
            <li> As for my hair I will never put any other product on it.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I use a few drops when my hair is damp before I blow dry.  </li>
            <li> And dean&#x27;s Wen oil at $68 or so for less quality, to biosilk, to 100% proteins, And yes, a lot of other ones, but nothing like this one.</li>
            <li> I made it through my teen years acne free but in my late 20&#x27;s I started to get really bad break outs.</li>
            <li> I can even use it during the day but just a bit less.  </li>
            <li> I find the oil sticky when I put it in my hair, and it has an odd smell.</li>
            <li> I have always had a rather complex relationship with skin products since some of my skin is overly oily, while other areas were very dry.  </li>
            <li> And I received the order in a few days.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday on my arms and legs to give it some conditioning.</li>
            <li> Start with a few drops in your hand and add as needed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I ran out and tried to find similar.  </li>
            <li> No more frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> The only negative difference is that Poppy&#x27;s has a weird smell</li>
            <li> And this is coming from thick coarse bleached highlighted hair, which is impossible to let it shine down to my waist.</li>
            <li> and I immediately noticed the effects of hard water on my hair.  </li>
            <li> but I live in a very cold climate</li>
            <li> No more dry and painful nose.  </li>
            <li> It is cold pressed so all the active ingredients are still intact.</li>
            <li> I am 69 and have spent plenty of money on very expensive face creams in my time.</li>
            <li> The smells is not great</li>
            <li> I had started using creamy eye shadow, in my forties, as a base for eyeliner - preventing those ugly jagged lines that early wrinkles caused.</li>
            <li> No more split ends!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried plus the smell really is unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I was shocked.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different brands of argon oil, Poppy Austin brand is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last 2 weeks so I cannot attest to long term benefits. But for the short time I&#x27;ve been using it, I can see that my skin is soft and supple and my hair is soft and shiny. It is not perfumed and has a mild smell which I like. One thing I like about it is the oily after effects go away immediately unlike other oils. Will update this review after using for a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Great product.  The quality is excellent as is the packing.  And I received the order in a few days. This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this product from Poppy Austin.  I will order again for sure!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely wonderful on my skin.  Especially around my eyes.  It goes on smoothly, not greasy at all, and absorbs right into the skin.  I apply my foundation right over it, and it stays all day.</li>
            <li> Easy transaction and wonderful product. A light oil that absorbs quickly, perfect as a night time moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The smells is not great but it certainly moisturizers beautifully - without leaving hair greasy and filmy.</li>
            <li> I am Venezuelan and have purchased about $600 worth of hair oils this past month alone, in my culture looks is everything since we are taught from a very young age to compete and become miss universe, so it is a high need to look absolutely perfect. After looking and spending thousands of $$ at hair salons finally my hair dresser who is also the proud retired owner of two former salons which he sold at the peak of the market, and does hair for Jennifer Anniston, Britney spears amongst others said this was a good a oil. I was so surprised!! I was in awe since I was used to spending lots of $$ in my hair, and the correct tools is a must. I chose the poppy Austin, and it has left my hair completely and beautifully shinny, non greasy. It penetrates the hair so fast! I am a psychiatric nurse and my husband a Stanford chemical engineer who lets he say put &amp;#34;everything in spreadsheets as a challenge for the correct items.&amp;#34; Now, I have heard wonderful things over the other brands, straight from Morroco, where we visited last year on a trip, and highly priced Josie&#x27;s star oil, to cabella&#x27;s $38 an ounce oil, to $300 an celebrity items per ounce! And dean&#x27;s Wen oil at $68 or so for less quality, to biosilk, to 100% proteins, And yes, a lot of other ones, but nothing like this one. The smell is great and truly amazing. Now the secret to gorgeous hair is not wash constantly, so you can go up to a week and the hair does not become greasy or smelly of applied at the ends. My hair naturally dryer and styled At the lowest setting!!! And this is coming from thick coarse bleached highlighted hair, which is impossible to let it shine down to my waist. What a miracle!! So happy!! You can accomplish any hair routine, curl and flip, no fly away&#x27;s or frizziness, and just beautiful hair. Wish you could see the difference. Amazed. It styled very fast and I am extremely content. Will always come back and this price is a steal.</li>
            <li> This is the best place to buy pure oils online. Pure Argan oil at a good price, wonderful service. Love Poppy Austin.</li>
            <li> I love the Argan oil. Poppy Austin is priced fairly and was delivered quickly. I use it for my skin and hair and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this oil but I live in a very cold climate and I wish it had more staying power.  My face drys out quickly and I need to reapply the oil a couple of times a day for my skin to stay hydrated.</li>
            <li> Love love love this Argan oil will buy again, works very well. Good quality oil, smells a little but it is not long lasting i love what it does for my skin and i am in my 50&#x27;s but you wouldn&#x27;t know it. I take very good care of my skin and if a product works why change it natural products are always better. Thank you for a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I love this Argan Oil.  Great price, works very well.  I use on my face, hair and cuticles.</li>
            <li> City water and the harsh dry winter left my skin and hair so dry!  After a week of using this product I noticed my skin was softer and brighter, and my hair was smoother.  What makes this product even better is that its 100% natural and your supporting a co-op.  It feels great to be giving back to myself and others at the same time.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Using a small amount on my hair daily and my hair is sooo soft now and feels really healthy</li>
            <li> Love this specific argan oil.  Traveled to Morocco earlier this year and purchased some of their oil.  Unfortunately, I ran out and tried to find similar.  Great to find Poppy Austin&#x27;s argan oil since it was the same product that I was use to from Morocco.  I am pleased to know that I can re-order with confidence.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this oil! I was so excited to receive it. It is cold pressed so all the active ingredients are still intact. There is no oily feeling left on your skin after you put it on like many other oils and leaves you with a smooth and silky feel. This bottle will last me a long time because a little goes a long ways, so you are getting your monies worth with this product.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Leaves my hair soft, silky, and with a healthy shine.  A little goes a long way. A Must Have!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;m using Argan Oil.  Never felt it was worth the price that another popular brand was selling.  But a co-worker keeps raving about it, so after a bit of research, I ended up purchasing this from Poppy Austin.  Good price and good size.  I am so glad I did.  OMG, I use it on my face, my hair, and basically anywhere on my body that has some sort of an issue, whether it be a rash, an irritation, or just pure dryness.  For my face, I use 5 drops in my palm, rub a little bit and press firmly in my whole face.  Then, I use 1 full drop per eye.  I do this every night after all my other skincare items.  My skin feels so good and it has definitely improved the dullness of my skin.  It sinks right in.  I can even use it during the day but just a bit less.  For my hair, I use about 5 - 10 drops, rub it between my palms, and run it through my waist length hair and put it in a bun while I&#x27;m asleep, then I wash it in the morning.  I use a few drops when my hair is damp before I blow dry.  It definitely makes the ends of my hair look so much better, and my hair looks thicker and not crunchy like most volumizing products will make the hair feel.  Another way I use it is to put some in my nose.  The inside of my nose get so dry that when I wake up in the morning, it hurts me to touch or move my nose when I wash my face.  I used to have to put Vaseline in it every night.  But with this oil, I only did it once and that was it.  No more dry and painful nose.  I was shocked.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I use Argan Oil and I am loving the result. I saw my skin going from dry to very soft the first week I started applying this product. This is an wonderful moisturizer at a very reasonable price for an organic product. At first when you pour the oil in your hand it looks like it&#x27;s very oily, but it penetrates the skin very fast and disappears within minutes and leave your hands well moisturized all day long. As for my hair I will never put any other product on it. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just a feeling but it seems like the result is mighty fast, or at least the shine is instant and you don&#x27;t feel that stickiness of the gel or spray. I love Poppy Austin Argan oil and will most definitely keep on using it and I am pleased to recommend this product for all type of hair and skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. Use on face and hair. High quality. Absorbs quick.  Would recommend to anyone.  Great moisturizer.  Very good product.</li>
            <li> Love this oil, very affordable.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday on my arms and legs to give it some conditioning. My skin has been dry on my arms and legs and this oil has truly helped in keeping it healthy. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! Great for oily acne-prone skin, as it did not break me out and actually controls oil. It is very hydrating and is healing my skin. A little goes a long way, this will last me forever. I also had a good experience with Amazon.com, I received my order quickly, even during the busy holiday months!! Thank you Poppy Austin for making such an amazing product, that is chemical free!!</li>
            <li> Love this. Use it on my face and my skin looks great! Has a very light, slightly hazelnut scent . Love that it is organic too, no added extras!</li>
            <li> Love Argan oil. I have been using this product for several years. It is a great plumper for the skin, hair, ext..  Would recommend to anyone with dry skin. I am so glad I purchased this time from Poppy, the price is great and will be purchasing more in the future.  Same Argan oil I have purchased for a higher price. Would recommend this product for anyone with dry skin or hair. A little goes a long way, so did not over do.  Start with a few drops in your hand and add as needed. This product will soak into the skin and not be greasy. If you are really greasy you used to much. Hope this helps!!</li>
            <li> This oil smells like machine oil, not argan oil.  It does not absorb into the skin as fast as other argan oil I&#x27;ve tried plus the smell really is unpleasant.</li>
            <li> This oil has lived up to all that it is advertised to do. I Reccomend it to every one. Product was delivered on time and the price is very good.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  U can use it for hair, skin, and nails.  Great product.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I received my product today, August 2, 2014.  It arrived in a timely manner.  I love this product, because the smell is great and I combine it with jojoba oil and the mixture of both smells is nice.  I use a clear gel also on my hair after I apply both products to my hair which cause it to have a white look to the gel, but once it dries, the white color goes away.  You can tell this is pure argan oil because there is no added colors.  I have purchased argan oil before and it was not pure and it stated so on the bottle, which by the way was plastic although it had an amber color to the bottle.  Anything pure and natural, such as essential oils, need to be in a dark colored bottle be it amber or blue, but it should also be in glass because chemicals from plastic can mix easily with pure oils.  Also the ingredients on Poppy Austin&#x27;s bottle only states that it is argan oil and where it comes from.  I am so happy with this product.  I also think the 4 oz bottle is a better bargain for the price and I only had to buy it because the 2 oz bottle in had slipped into the sink and I spilled most of it.  From now on I am going to make sure it is on a more level surface or I will put a facecloth on the sink so it can rest on it so it will not slip.  Thank you so much Poppy Austin and Amazon.</li>
            <li> This oil is so smooth and silky on my skin and does not feel greased down!! Would recommend this product!! The price is great also!!</li>
            <li> The texture of the oil is wonderful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this as a beard oil &amp; it is excellent. Absorbs quickly &amp; a few drops leaves my beard soft. Also appears to stop dry, flaking skin under my beard.</li>
            <li> I do not use the argan oil for my hair, I use it on my skin! I have very dry skin and use the argan oil on my face, neck, hands and arms. It is a real life saver. When you use argan oil it is a blessing. Poppy&#x27;s oil is nice and light. Just wait a minute and your skin will absorb it all in. And fyi, the cuts and scrapes heal faster, too.7</li>
            <li> Oil is light, absorbs right into the skin, no odor. Dry skin gone almost immediately. I would recommend it to anyone who ask.</li>
            <li> I love this oil very much. This is the only oil that helped my oily acne prone skin and hair. I would recommend it and definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product, and half the price of Josie Morans! Same quality only half the price! I recommend to all my friends, all the time!!</li>
            <li> Great product . Bottle was actually larger than I expected! Looking forward to using it on my hair skin and cuticles . Prompt shipping. I will use Poppy Austin again! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Package arrived in 2 days and was wrapped in bubble wrap when it arrived.  I use it on my face and hair.  Been using for 2 weeks on my face and have already noticed a difference in my complexion. Skin seems to be brighter, softer and more supple.  Will definitely keep this in my arsenal from now on.</li>
            <li> I purchases Argan oil in Europe and found it to be very positive for my dry skin.  I was happy to find it in the US.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for about 2 weeks and have noticed an immediate difference in my skin! No dry patches, smoother, clearer and more radiant! I use it on my hair too! Gives it great shine! Love this product and will continue to use it! It&#x27;s a huge bottle and will go a long way!</li>
            <li> Like the oil,hate the smell.</li>
            <li> Great product. Better yet very competitive price. Any questions are answered by email in a timely manner. Highly recommend this company and product.</li>
            <li> Amazing oil!!! Super light, penetrates deeply, used it for 2 weeks...... No more split ends!!!! Give it a try, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I use this oil on my face in my hair, and for dry or irritated skin on my body. I have ULTRA sensitive skin so if you are worried about break outs, don&#x27;t. This oil is an anti-inflammatory and works great for imperfections, irritations or even to help clear breakouts. Works great for razor burn, or pretty much anything. I think it smells a little weird, but tolerable for it&#x27;s many benefits. You only need a few drops for most uses so it also lasts a long time. I recommend it for a great all-around beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> Love this oil.  Use it on my skin, hair &amp; cuticles.  Need to order more.</li>
            <li> We moved to another area several months ago and I immediately noticed the effects of hard water on my hair.  I have only used Pure Argan Oil by Poppy Austin a few times, but the brittleness ia already gone!  Each time I use the oil, my hair feels softer and more manageable.  At this point, I am convinced of the healing properties of Poppy Austin Argan Oil.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> We have religiously purchased this oil every month...two bottles, and it works like a dream.  New growth is seem almost after a month of religious application...I said religious....that means no skipping, people.  If you skip or apply sparingly don&#x27;t look for miracles. Applied to areas with no hair now have fuzz and hair is growing in as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks loads Poppy Austin....for once someone does what they say.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I have used any number of creams, lotions and oils on my lower legs to try to alleviate severely dry skin.  This is the only product I have found that actually works for that area!  In addition, I have used it on my face, hands and  even as a moisturizer for my hair.  It&#x27;s great for calloused heels as well.  This product definitely met my expectations!</li>
            <li> Works great for cuticles and hair! Fabulous moisturizer on skin but use sparingly soaks in skin quickly and feels really good</li>
            <li> As great if not better than the top rated oil!</li>
            <li> Purchased this oil several times in the past several months. Did start to notice after a while that my face became oily and started breaking out with large zits. At times it also seemed to dry my skin out and at times was oily also??? First bottle purchased seemed good but purchases after we&#x27;re not as good.stopped using and noted decrease in skin breakouts.</li>
            <li> My naturally curly hair LOVES this product.  It is not greasy.  My hair shaft absorbs the oil resulting in soft and moisturized hair all day long.</li>
            <li> Good quality argan oil &amp; it&#x27;s 100% pure.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be using this product on my skin &amp; hair.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Nothing else like it on the market!! A little goes a long ways. Instructions are clear and ingredient list is very short, only Argan oil.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I am using this on my face before I apply my moisturizer. Great product. I use a few drops and my skin is very soft</li>
            <li> seems work good on my skin and hair. Smells fresh ...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a significant difference???</li>
            <li> I use this everywhere; mix it in with body lotion, use full strength on hair and nails.  It has a different fragrance than JM Argan oil, but for about half the price, it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> Poppy Austin Argon Oil is great for both men and women who want to improve the look and health of their hair and skin naturally.  I have always had a rather complex relationship with skin products since some of my skin is overly oily, while other areas were very dry.  That is aside from my face that is very sensitive and prone to breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist recommended so many products over the years, from over the counter solutions to prescription grade solutions, all with varied results. After getting tired of my skin feeling like a science experiment, she suggest that I try Argon oil, and thanks to a bit of research and many other reviews from users, I settled on Poppy Austin Argon Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not have high hopes for this product, but I was also happy to try it since it was natural and there would be no negative side effects like many traditional skin treatments.  I am happy to say that not only did the oil rejuvenate my skin, but also has brought life back to my overly abused hair.  After using the oil on my face, legs and hands for 2 weeks,  I noticed that a lot of the patchwork of oily/dry areas have settled and my skin has a uniform glow. My skin is a lot smoother than it was before, and surprisingly, my face , which was a big source of breakouts, has cleared considerably. Of course, I still get an occasional pimple, but only on one or two places, but I no longer have the all over redness and pitting that comes with adult acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love most is that you only need a little bit to cover your hair and skin, and the bottle size is very generous for the price.  I fully recommend Poppy Austin Argon Oil for those who are tired of lackluster results from products that are manmade, and cost way more than this natural alternative.</li>
            <li> At 73 years old My beauty secrets and devices are few and carefully chosen: they have are no (obviously) harmful ingredients and are composed of a few simple, organic (when possible) ingredients. My personal use over time is  proof that these items or products serve my body/face by helping to enhance my looks/appearance without sacrificing my health or wellness!  Pure Argan Oil is a much welcomed Gift for My Life!  I have given and recommended to my near and dear, who are of similar mind or personal standards and taste; their positive responses are much like mine.  I know I shall always seek-out this product. I &#x27;pray&#x27; that these Morracan Women (and famiies) are just and fairly treated and properly honored with the right/proper Pay!</li>
            <li> Argon oil is helping to heal the skin sores and damage to my face and hair. I have been using 4 drops on my hair only at night and 6 drops on my face and neck morning after shave and at night.&lt;br /&gt;So far so good! I have used many different products over the years and was fortunate to find out about Argon oil.</li>
            <li> Very nice feel to skin after use.  Both my husband and I use it and are well-pleased.  He has also used it heal cracked fingertips.</li>
            <li> Heard about it on tv show... Use every night and there is noticeable difference in my skins softness, glow and overall look.</li>
            <li> I did my research before getting this, from sources that explains the process of extracting Argan oil. This one meets those explanations. It literally takes only one drip to spread all over the face, or drip in your favorite moisturizer in your palms and apply. It obviously can be use for hair as well. But, it seems so damn precious that I might use it on my face only, or stretch it with other oils if using it on my hair.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product.  It makes my skin feel so soft and it makes me happy to put it on.</li>
            <li> It is fine, like any other 100% argan oil.  They are all pretty much the same.  I bought it for a friend as she has exzcema, hoping it will help.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it is too soon.  It does not absorb fast, it does take a while.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is fine.</li>
            <li> I just started using the product but am already very pleased with the results I am seeing. I bought it for my hair and scalp primarily to help reduce hair thinning. I thought that adding this to the treatment I am already doing would be helpful and early indications are that I am right. I massage the oil into the scalp and leave on overnight. When I wash my hair in the morning it is silky and smooth. My scalp also looks healthier. I tried some on my face, neck and hands, too, with nice results.</li>
            <li> This is my fourth bottle. Purchased one for me and three as gifts for friends.</li>
            <li> I used to use Moroccan Oil, but when I had problems ordering it, I went looking for another source of Argan Oil and found Poppy Austin Pure Organic Argan Oil. I LOVE it even more than the Moroccan Oil.  My hair looks and feels fantastic. It ls straight, shiny, healthy looking, and very manageable. This is saying A LOT since I have frizzy curly hair that can look like I never brush it, even when I just styled it. The oil also does not have a scent, which my husband, who has allergies to most scented products, loves.  This product is amazing!</li>
            <li> First time buyer from Poppy Austin. Love this oil. I started to use from another source and it healed my  three skin spots. I am a diabetic and do not heal fast. This oil is amazing, I use it all over, face hands, arms,nails etc. Poppy Austin&#x27;s oil is great, only oil, nothing added. Large bottle, good price.Heals my skin great in less time. I am 64 and have great face skin, very few wrinkles. You really must try it.</li>
            <li> I received the product intact and on time. Very happy for the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it day and night and i love the effect on my skin.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I find the oil sticky when I put it in my hair, and it has an odd smell. But, maybe that&#x27;s normal for this oil.</li>
            <li> Absolutely GREAT!! No more frizzy hair. It works great on my hair and skin when sailing. Love the product.</li>
            <li> I have been using Josie Maran argan oil for years. My sister told me about Poppy brand and I figured it is worth a try. I can honestly say that there is no difference in the quality or how my skin looks. The positive difference is in the price (Poppy&#x27;s is much more reasonable). The only negative difference is that Poppy&#x27;s has a weird smell but it does seem to go away shortly after being applied. Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and will continue to use Poppy Argan oil.</li>
            <li> Amazing beauty product.  Poppy Austin delivers the best quality, price, and results.</li>
            <li> I am 69 and have spent plenty of money on very expensive face creams in my time. I have sensitive skin and recently, even the best moisturizers I could buy started causing problems Doing some research, I discovered argan oil to be at the top of the list of non comedogenic moisturizers and decided to give it a try. I love it - I have moisture with absolutely no irritation.  I am on my second bottle (double the size of my first trial purchase) and have never been so happy with a moisturizer before.  I had started using creamy eye shadow, in my forties, as a base for eyeliner - preventing those ugly jagged lines that early wrinkles caused. Now, I don&#x27;t have to use that eyeliner anymore. I spread 3-4 drops of  argan oil over my entire face and neck and what is  left on my eyelids is enough to allow me to create a straight line of eyeliner.  I wish I had known about this product in my twenties and have suggested it to 2 younger friends (one in her 20&#x27;s) who are using it and are pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I made it through my teen years acne free but in my late 20&#x27;s I started to get really bad break outs. I had to totally reimagine my skin care routine and after a few years of trying everything under the sun, started using this argan oil as my daily moisturizer.  It absorbs better and faster than any other oil I&#x27;ve tried and my acne is non-existent. Will be trying other products in the line, since I&#x27;m so pleased with this one. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this oil, I use it everyday in my hair. I will be buying this brand again, I also use the Rose Water which is another product I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Product is excellent for hair and skin. Made my face feel ultra moisturized. Hair silky soft😆</li>
            <li> My husband likes this product better than the argan oil he had ordered directly from Morocco... keeps his face supple and smooth. Excellent customer service and shipping.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this product and so do my girls. Good product all natural.</li>
            <li> This is very nice oil.  I use on my face, neck, and hair. Only a small drop is needed even if it doesn&#x27;t feel like enough.</li>
            <li> The product of the Argan Oil is excellent, in purity and quality. Using Amazon as a distributor is also excellent. I will be reordering again because of these factors. Thank you for a fine product. Linda Robinson.</li>
            <li> Liquid Gold! Love the way this makes my hair feel! A little goes a long way!</li>
