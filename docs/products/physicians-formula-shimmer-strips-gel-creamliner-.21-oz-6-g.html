            <li>so I ordered this one instead and am very happy.</li>
            <li>Fórmula makeup ♥</li>
            <li>/&gt;The best gel eyeliner ever</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that awesome.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now a convert for life to gel liners, and am so happy with the Physicians Formula version that I don&#x27;t feel the need to try the pricier gel/cream brands from MAC, Bobbi Brown, or Clinique.</li>
            <li>The color, texture, and consistency of these are great.</li>
            <li>If you like Gel liners this pack is great..</li>
            <li>this is great</li>
            <li>THIS WAS A GREAT BUY...</li>
            <li>WORKS GREAT AND DOES NOT SMEAR...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy, I could cry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice!</li>
            <li>It is so easy to apply, and it looks great!   </li>
            <li>I find the brush that comes with it really good too.</li>
            <li>These eyeliners apply very easily and have great staying power.</li>
            <li>When pulled apart, each pot still has its own cover.</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful because it&#x27;s gentle on the eyes and mine have not gotten irritated.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat this, three colors, nice brush..</li>
            <li>The cream liner glides on very easily, and makes doing winged eyeliner a breeze.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>RIGHT ON!!!</li>
            <li>It is okay.</li>
            <li>I like their liquid liner better</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>I am not yet sure how it holds up to the duress of rubbing your eyes, as I have not had a problem with itchy eyes since switching to this stuff.   </li>
            <li>All in all, I am totally pleased that I&#x27;ve found this product, and I have already reccomended it to many people.</li>
            <li>My favorite eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>Physicians Formula is absolutely my favorite gel liner, so I bought two.</li>
            <li>I was able to save them by re-hydrating them with eyedrops but still.</li>
            <li>I love Physicians Formula eyeliners.......</li>
            <li>I HAVE BEEN USING THIS EYE LINER FOR MORE THAN A YEAR</li>
            <li>AND I LOVE IT .I</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s better?</li>
            <li>IT LOOKS GREAT, HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT</li>
            <li>I am really impressed with how long this stays on.</li>
            <li>One thing I love about this product is how easy it is to remove.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all (most importantly), it didn&#x27;t burn my eyes (even when applied to the waterline.</li>
            <li>It stays put all day yet is easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>The gel is so easy to apply and it doesn&#x27;t look like a dotted line across your lids.</li>
            <li>It is easy to put on (I use an angled eyeliner brush) and it stays on without streaking throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>Makeup remover takes it off easily - but that&#x27;s about all that WILL take it</li>
            <li>Feels great, comes with its own applicator, lovely colors black, natural brown and purple, the one that i love the most.</li>
            <li>so they&#x27;re not annoying to carry in your purse.</li>
            <li>NOT EXPENSIVE AND IS BETTER THAN CLINQUE OR MARY KAY OR</li>
            <li>They recommend that you wipe the brush with a tissue after every use, but I moisten the tissue first with makeup brush cleaner just to be sure to get it clean every time.</li>
            <li>So, yeah, I just recently started doing research on the best eyeliner out there for EXTREMELY sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>brush and liners themselves are great for applying a clean, sharp, fine line.</li>
            <li>I use coconut oil to wash my face at night, and it removes this eyeliner quickly and without making me look like I&#x27;ve never slept before.</li>
            <li>but luckily I found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The gel liners are not as convenient or quick as using pencils, but the tradeoffs are well worth it.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t give it any higher praise than that!</li>
            <li>I do use a different brush to apply them - the thinner, tapered kind with the angled neck.</li>
            <li>The set comes with its own little brush that works just fine.</li>
            <li>This is the first crème eyeliner I have used</li>
            <li>You can make the line precise or, as long as you&#x27;re quick about it, smudge it to make a smoky eye.   </li>
            <li>Through, tears, rain, or a long night; this stuff is sure to stay put.</li>
            <li>Second, it was sooooo easy to apply (I don&#x27;t have the steadiest of hands).</li>
            <li>All the shades are nice for dark eyes!</li>
            <li>I luv this product, stays on and is reasonably priced....</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think real physicians would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I was previously having problems with regular eyeliners because they made my eyes either super dry or become watery, so I figured it may be a good idea to try eyeliner with more natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Needless to say, I&#x27;m completely sold on PF and will definitely buy more of their products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so very hot, multiplied by the surroundings being downtown and full of concrete and metal, and every single thing I&#x27;d tried over the years would just melt off after 30 minutes and leave me looking like a raccoon..</li>
            <li>Basically, after a full day of wear, it&#x27;s almost all still there with just a tiny bit of fading.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply once you learn how to make an even line, I only use it on my upper lids.</li>
            <li>live in Atlanta, and every year, I go to DragonCon.</li>
            <li>After hours upon hours of watching YouTube review videos (perhaps a couple hours dedicated to funny \\&quot;fail\\&quot; videos) and reading online reviews, I finally decided to chance it all and try the PF gel cream liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s a yearly sci-fi/fantasy/geek and pop culture con, like Comic Con, just down here, and with 1/3 of Comic Con&#x27;s attendees.)</li>
            <li>I made my own cheaply with just a few common ingredients (such as baby shampoo and rubbing alcohol) using a recipe I got from You Tube.    </li>
            <li>When washing off normal eyeliners, it gets all over your face before it finally gets off your skin.</li>
            <li>had about given up on being able to put anything on my eyes other than a little eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>Come to find out, this particular product was discontinued and these were probably long expired.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This liner survives entire days of trying to navigate through 50,000 other con attendees in an extremely hot and humid downtown area.</li>
            <li>this comes with, I&#x27;m really just here for the black.</li>
            <li>I can get a straight neat line as long as I am careful.</li>
            <li>I really wanted another black and brown pot but didn&#x27;t need another blue one yet</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have been using the gel cream liners for Blue Eyes for a long time.</li>
            <li> I only wish Physicians Formula would just sell the colors singly.</li>
            <li> There is no need for taking a trip to the powder room with this product, because it is clearly not going anywhere.</li>
            <li> This is dry and crumbling.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While I have used the deep purple and dark brown</li>
            <li> I bought the one for brown eyes, and I only use the black color.</li>
            <li> Have used pencil liners for years and they would fade within a few hours, especially in warmer humid weather.</li>
            <li> I like that this black has less sparkle to it than the Blue Eyes one does.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t anticipate ever using the other two shades.     </li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s due to a design flaw in the screw-on lids.</li>
            <li> The consistency is different from what I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> Some just don&#x27;t close very tightly, and are prone to loosening from minor vibration / jarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not worth my time or effort at all.</li>
            <li> Basically, the base of each pot is indented and the top of each pot snaps into the indentation.</li>
            <li> Money down the drain.  </li>
            <li> The brush is also softer and less friction than the tip of an eyeliner pencil, which is a plus for me.</li>
            <li> and it always turned out a mess.</li>
            <li> One thing to note is that contrary to what another reviewer wrote, these little pots do come apart and you can carry or store them separately without them drying out.</li>
            <li> I like to apply with the ELF angled eye brush for a little cat-eye look.</li>
            <li> Do you see that one-star review about how all the liners were dried up and unusable?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I got these they were completely dried out and unusable.</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t want it to be too dramatic, I use a pencil in the same makeup line, and then just use the gel over the outer corners of my eyes and it stays put.</li>
            <li> Afterwards, I ended up researching brands from the expensive (e.g. Clinique, Urban Decay, MAC, etc.) to cheaper drugstore ones (e.g. L&#x27;Oreal, Maybelline, Physicians Formula, etc.).</li>
            <li> I can wear this without smearing at least 8 hours.........</li>
            <li> All three of the creams were completely dried out and I was unable to use any of them.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when I received the items they were dried out and very hard.</li>
            <li> For a dramatic look that stays put; this is the eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I prefer a different product over this one. It is okay.</li>
            <li> I like their liquid liner better</li>
            <li> I love these. They will last way longer than you think they will. No smudge ever.</li>
            <li> Have used pencil liners for years and they would fade within a few hours, especially in warmer humid weather. Tried liquid liners but could never control the applicator well and it always turned out a mess. I read about these gel liners and their staying power so I thought I&#x27;d give the Physicians Formula version a try. Found it at my local CVS for sale (about $4 off) so it was a bargain.     I am really impressed with how long this stays on. Basically, after a full day of wear, it&#x27;s almost all still there with just a tiny bit of fading. I find the brush that comes with it really good too. I can get a straight neat line as long as I am careful. They recommend that you wipe the brush with a tissue after every use, but I moisten the tissue first with makeup brush cleaner just to be sure to get it clean every time. I made my own cheaply with just a few common ingredients (such as baby shampoo and rubbing alcohol) using a recipe I got from You Tube.    The gel liners are not as convenient or quick as using pencils, but the tradeoffs are well worth it. I&#x27;m now a convert for life to gel liners, and am so happy with the Physicians Formula version that I don&#x27;t feel the need to try the pricier gel/cream brands from MAC, Bobbi Brown, or Clinique. I only wish Physicians Formula would just sell the colors singly. I bought the one for brown eyes, and I only use the black color. I don&#x27;t anticipate ever using the other two shades.     One thing to note is that contrary to what another reviewer wrote, these little pots do come apart and you can carry or store them separately without them drying out. Basically, the base of each pot is indented and the top of each pot snaps into the indentation. When pulled apart, each pot still has its own cover.</li>
            <li> I was previously having problems with regular eyeliners because they made my eyes either super dry or become watery, so I figured it may be a good idea to try eyeliner with more natural ingredients. This product is wonderful because it&#x27;s gentle on the eyes and mine have not gotten irritated. It stays put all day yet is easy to wash off. It is so easy to apply, and it looks great!   You can connect all the pots or carry them separately, and individually they are about an inch tall so they&#x27;re not annoying to carry in your purse. The gel is so easy to apply and it doesn&#x27;t look like a dotted line across your lids. You can make the line precise or, as long as you&#x27;re quick about it, smudge it to make a smoky eye.   One thing I love about this product is how easy it is to remove. When washing off normal eyeliners, it gets all over your face before it finally gets off your skin. I use coconut oil to wash my face at night, and it removes this eyeliner quickly and without making me look like I&#x27;ve never slept before. This is all despite the fact that it stays in place all day without smudging into the lines under your eyes, or wearing off. I am not yet sure how it holds up to the duress of rubbing your eyes, as I have not had a problem with itchy eyes since switching to this stuff.   All in all, I am totally pleased that I&#x27;ve found this product, and I have already reccomended it to many people.</li>

            <li> I have been using the gel cream liners for Blue Eyes for a long time. I really wanted another black and brown pot but didn&#x27;t need another blue one yet so I ordered this one instead and am very happy. I like that this black has less sparkle to it than the Blue Eyes one does. The color, texture, and consistency of these are great. I like to apply with the ELF angled eye brush for a little cat-eye look.</li>
            <li> The consistency is different from what I have used in the past.  This is dry and crumbling.  Seller does not accept returns.  Money down the drain.  Just purchase at an actual store so that you can return and you will ultimately save money.</li>
            <li> These eyeliners apply very easily and have great staying power. I do use a different brush to apply them - the thinner, tapered kind with the angled neck.</li>
            <li> My favorite eyeliner.  I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore but luckily I found it on Amazon.  It is easy to put on (I use an angled eyeliner brush) and it stays on without streaking throughout the day.  I hope it never gets discontinued.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat this, three colors, nice brush.. If you like Gel liners this pack is great.. All the shades are nice for dark eyes! They also screw apart so if you want to take one color with you you can break them apart without them drying up! Nice!</li>
            <li> For a dramatic look that stays put; this is the eyeliner. I have the product that is recommended for hazel eyes and it came with three different colors. When I don&#x27;t want it to be too dramatic, I use a pencil in the same makeup line, and then just use the gel over the outer corners of my eyes and it stays put. There is no need for taking a trip to the powder room with this product, because it is clearly not going anywhere. Through, tears, rain, or a long night; this stuff is sure to stay put.</li>
            <li> I luv this product, stays on and is reasonably priced....</li>
            <li> This gel eyeliner is definitely not hypoallergenic.  The brand is quite deceptive.  I don&#x27;t think real physicians would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> All three of the creams were completely dried out and I was unable to use any of them.  I had to throw it all away.</li>
            <li> Physicians Formula is absolutely my favorite gel liner, so I bought two. Unfortunately, when I received the items they were dried out and very hard. I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was allergic , never happened before !</li>
            <li> When I got these they were completely dried out and unusable. Come to find out, this particular product was discontinued and these were probably long expired. I was able to save them by re-hydrating them with eyedrops but still. Not worth my time or effort at all. They still don&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> I Looove Physicians Fórmula makeup ♥&lt;br /&gt;The best gel eyeliner ever</li>
            <li> I bought this product did not come with purple ... defective color.</li>
            <li> I will never need to find another eyeliner, ever again. This is the Holy Grail of eyeliners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in Atlanta, and every year, I go to DragonCon. (It&#x27;s a yearly sci-fi/fantasy/geek and pop culture con, like Comic Con, just down here, and with 1/3 of Comic Con&#x27;s attendees.) It&#x27;s held every year over Labor Day weekend, which is hotter and swampier than the devil&#x27;s armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had about given up on being able to put anything on my eyes other than a little eyeshadow. It&#x27;s so very hot, multiplied by the surroundings being downtown and full of concrete and metal, and every single thing I&#x27;d tried over the years would just melt off after 30 minutes and leave me looking like a raccoon..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a friend told me to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I have used the deep purple and dark brown this comes with, I&#x27;m really just here for the black. The set comes with its own little brush that works just fine. The cream liner glides on very easily, and makes doing winged eyeliner a breeze. Makeup remover takes it off easily - but that&#x27;s about all that WILL take it off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This liner survives entire days of trying to navigate through 50,000 other con attendees in an extremely hot and humid downtown area. I put this liner through its paces in the toughest environment I could, and it stayed looking like I&#x27;d just put it on 5 minutes ago all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t give it any higher praise than that!</li>
            <li> I love Physicians Formula eyeliners....... I can wear this without smearing at least 8 hours.........this is great but I prefer the mechanical pencil version.......</li>
            <li> MAN THIS WAS A GREAT BUY... NOT EXPENSIVE AND IS BETTER THAN CLINQUE OR MARY KAY OR EVEN MOMMY MAKE UP...WORKS GREAT AND DOES NOT SMEAR...RIGHT ON!!!</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS EYE LINER FOR MORE THAN A YEAR AND I LOVE IT .I USE IT AS A SHADOW TOO. IT LOOKS GREAT, HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT</li>
            <li> Feels great, comes with its own applicator, lovely colors black, natural brown and purple, the one that i love the most. It is easy to apply once you learn how to make an even line, I only use it on my upper lids.</li>
            <li> This is the first crème eyeliner I have used and I really like it.  Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> As a woman in her mid-twenties, I&#x27;ve refrained from wearing eye make-up for over ten years. Why? It&#x27;s simple... EVERYTHING burned! Hypoallergenic my a... So, yeah, I just recently started doing research on the best eyeliner out there for EXTREMELY sensitive eyes. What&#x27;s better? Kohl pencils? Liquid? Gel? Shadow? Pixie dust? Afterwards, I ended up researching brands from the expensive (e.g. Clinique, Urban Decay, MAC, etc.) to cheaper drugstore ones (e.g. L&#x27;Oreal, Maybelline, Physicians Formula, etc.). After hours upon hours of watching YouTube review videos (perhaps a couple hours dedicated to funny \\&quot;fail\\&quot; videos) and reading online reviews, I finally decided to chance it all and try the PF gel cream liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve struck gold, people... Gold, I say!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all (most importantly), it didn&#x27;t burn my eyes (even when applied to the waterline. YAY!). Second, it was sooooo easy to apply (I don&#x27;t have the steadiest of hands). And third (the cake in my book), it didn&#x27;t smudge! Ah, a triad of greatness. I&#x27;m so happy, I could cry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I&#x27;m completely sold on PF and will definitely buy more of their products. It&#x27;s that awesome.</li>
