            <li>I enjoyed the warmer it looks great and does a great job</li>
            <li>, surprisingly this helps me relax</li>
            <li>my daughter inlaw loved this for Xmas</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my mom and it is GORGEOUS.</li>
            <li>Lemon scent should good to me also.</li>
            <li>I loved it until it burned out on me.</li>
            <li>It is very pretty and works perfectly with  oil or wax.</li>
            <li>I love this!  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>It is an amazing product for the price</li>
            <li>I washed it with warm water and a drop of Dawn,</li>
            <li>Makes my house smell nice.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty &amp; works great</li>
            <li>soon loved that they packed my items securely A+++++</li>
            <li>i absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I am gonna order two more for my friends</li>
            <li>I bought one from Target for about twice the cost, but it is much better quality.</li>
            <li>Then I discovered that the light can be turned up so the light becomes warmer and once the oil starts to warm, the scent begins to fill the room.  </li>
            <li>The burner dish needs to have a more secure installation.</li>
            <li>The burner dish tends to tip easily and the wax runs off.</li>
            <li>The warmer was beautiful, but only turned on twice and quit working.</li>
            <li>Light is so bright, I can turn off the main light in my living room.</li>
            <li>The light is adjustable, so you can easily set the heat to whatever your heart desire.</li>
            <li>but so much color came off that I suspect it is nothing more than a sprayed on water color paint!  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to clean up.  </li>
            <li>A little lower, smell is great, turn off when oil has evaporated!</li>
            <li>(They aren&#x27;t but I must to turn the light up</li>
            <li>Great purchase will definitely buy again</li>
            <li>the light reflects the colors of the product all around the area where i have it positioned.</li>
            <li>The color is fabulous.</li>
            <li>This is my most favorite new toy in 20 years.</li>
            <li>Mostly functional, but I wouldn&#x27;t exactly buy it as a gift for anybody.</li>
            <li>The glow from it is pretty sexy.</li>
            <li>My wife loves these they definetly are unique and warms oils/waxes very well we will buy more from this seller</li>
            <li>I use mine for a nightlight and with a lavender oil to keep my bedroom calm.</li>
            <li>Got a nice big set of oils.</li>
            <li>It works better to infuse a smaller area with a good essential oils smell.</li>
            <li>Nice warmer but the light bulb needed replacing in less than a month.</li>
            <li>I thought perhaps the prongs that hold the bowl/dish with oil were too far from the light to warm the oil enough for the scent to fill my room.</li>
            <li>When I first received this warmer</li>
            <li>Pretty painted oil diffuser that scents your room.  </li>
            <li>I also dimmed it and I can&#x27;t say enough, I love it.</li>
            <li>Bought as a gift for my mother and it&#x27;s just as pretty as it looks in the picture.</li>
            <li>tried lavender for the first one...</li>
            <li>I have seen some complaints about the dish falling off easy, but if it was attached it would be a pain to clean out the oil residue out of the dish for more uses so that complaint is kind of dumb in my opinion.</li>
            <li>waaaaay too fast.</li>
            <li>It is very well made</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Shipping was really fast too.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t turn it on high with oils.  </li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a modern and yet classy burner for oils or tarts.</li>
            <li>If you are buying this specifically for warming oils, you may want to consider a different product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of its looks, it is a pretty piece, and everything arrived in working order.</li>
            <li>I dried it quickly  and gently</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve had it going for a couple hours now, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to manage to completely liquify the one wax cube that I put in</li>
            <li>I had it since the end of December 2014 and used it all the time, even had to change the bulb once because I used it so much and all of a sudden</li>
            <li>I even checked the old bulb to find out it never burned out.</li>
            <li>at least hallf way on the  dimmerr dial to get  oil  warm enough to diffuse through the room.</li>
            <li>Also, the light can be turned down at night very, very low to keep the room dim but the smell of whatever soothing scent I have in it.  </li>

            <li> This is a decent oil warmer for the money, but I have found it very difficult to relegate the temperature in it, sometimes making me go through oil</li>
            <li> but it was poor quality.</li>
            <li> NOT COOL and looks awful !!!  </li>

            <li> Nice warmer but the light bulb needed replacing in less than a month.</li>
            <li> It just does not warm the oil enough to smell around the room!</li>
            <li> When I first received this warmer I thought perhaps the prongs that hold the bowl/dish with oil were too far from the light to warm the oil enough for the scent to fill my room. (They aren&#x27;t but I must to turn the light up at least hallf way on the  dimmerr dial to get  oil  warm enough to diffuse through the room. The prongs are not the  same height which made the bowl tilt until my husband strraightened  the prongs) Then I discovered that the light can be turned up so the light becomes warmer and once the oil starts to warm, the scent begins to fill the room.  Also, the light can be turned down at night very, very low to keep the room dim but the smell of whatever soothing scent I have in it.  I have trouble sleeping and I use the Lavender essential oil, surprisingly this helps me relax and I have been sleeping well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Would not buy a warmer with a colored dish like this one.  I washed it with warm water and a drop of Dawn, while  holding  the bottom with one hand and cleaning the dish, I began  to  realize the  green color on the dish bottom was coming off. I dried it quickly  and gently but so much color came off that I suspect it is nothing more than a sprayed on water color paint!  NOT COOL and looks awful !!!  This is a problem with all the warmers like this one, so take note. Now I&#x27;ll have to find a green glass dish.</li>
            <li> This is a decent oil warmer for the money, but I have found it very difficult to relegate the temperature in it, sometimes making me go through oil waaaaay too fast. If you are buying this specifically for warming oils, you may want to consider a different product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of its looks, it is a pretty piece, and everything arrived in working order.</li>
            <li> Very good lamp for the price</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the warmer it looks great and does a great job</li>
            <li> my daughter inlaw loved this for Xmas</li>
            <li> Nice quality!  Would (will!) buy from seller again different colors for different rooms in my home.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my mom and it is GORGEOUS. Beautiful quality, and the perfect size for oils as well as wax or soy tarts that can be bought in any store. The light is adjustable, so you can easily set the heat to whatever your heart desire. Did I mention it is also beautiful? It is an amazing product for the price and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a modern and yet classy burner for oils or tarts.</li>
            <li> If only the paint on the body were as thick and dark as shown in the picture... There is very little paint on the actual product, and thinly applied, meaning that the little light is actually a lot brighter than I was hoping it would be. Also, I&#x27;ve had it going for a couple hours now, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to manage to completely liquify the one wax cube that I put in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it *did* melt about three quarters of the cube, and the fragrant effect I was hoping for is indeed there. Mostly functional, but I wouldn&#x27;t exactly buy it as a gift for anybody. I think for the quality of the paint job and weakness of the heat this should have gone for under $10, but $14ish isn&#x27;t *too* unreasonable.</li>
            <li> Blew up after 2 weeks</li>
            <li> This is my most favorite new toy in 20 years. Got a nice big set of oils. Having the time of my life.</li>
            <li> Great purchase will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this product. the light reflects the colors of the product all around the area where i have it positioned. simply beautiful.</li>
            <li> I love this!  The color is great!  Don&#x27;t turn it on high with oils.  A little lower, smell is great, turn off when oil has evaporated!</li>
            <li> this warmer is beautiful! And it works great. I am gonna order two more for my friends It is very well made</li>
            <li> Very nice for the price. Everyone that has seen it has asked where I found it..good buy and pretty,too!!</li>
            <li> very nice and good price</li>
            <li> Pretty painted oil diffuser that scents your room.  I use mine for a nightlight and with a lavender oil to keep my bedroom calm.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean up.  It works better to infuse a smaller area with a good essential oils smell.</li>
            <li> The warmer was beautiful, but only turned on twice and quit working. I could have bought another bulb for it but it was poor quality. I bought one from Target for about twice the cost, but it is much better quality.</li>
            <li> The color is fabulous. Light is so bright, I can turn off the main light in my living room. The glow from it is pretty sexy. I also dimmed it and I can&#x27;t say enough, I love it. In this one I used the scented wax melt.</li>
            <li> Not the best tart warmer. The tart just sits and doesnt melt away. I dont even smell the tart i put in. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pretty &amp; works great</li>
            <li> It was received on time. It is very pretty and works perfectly with  oil or wax.</li>
            <li> Will not work once the bulb burn out. I bought the replacement bulbs from amazon. They do not work</li>
            <li> The burner dish tends to tip easily and the wax runs off. Can be a safety hazard. The burner dish needs to have a more secure installation.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and a great gift I gave to a roommate. Heats oil well and fills not only room but half of the house depending on the oil strength. I have seen some complaints about the dish falling off easy, but if it was attached it would be a pain to clean out the oil residue out of the dish for more uses so that complaint is kind of dumb in my opinion. Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> I really like it. Bought as a gift for my mother and it&#x27;s just as pretty as it looks in the picture. Shipping was really fast too.</li>
            <li> Makes my house smell nice.  will experience with other scents... tried lavender for the first one...Lemon scent should good to me also.</li>
            <li> My wife loves these they definetly are unique and warms oils/waxes very well we will buy more from this seller soon loved that they packed my items securely A+++++</li>
            <li> This was a gift and she loves it</li>
            <li> I loved it until it burned out on me. I had it since the end of December 2014 and used it all the time, even had to change the bulb once because I used it so much and all of a sudden and I saw a spark and it went dead. I replaced the bulb and nothing happened. I even checked the old bulb to find out it never burned out.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! my wife uses this every day since she opened it.</li>
