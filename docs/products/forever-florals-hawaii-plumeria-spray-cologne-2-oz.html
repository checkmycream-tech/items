            <li> It is maybe a little pricey but it pays if you like to smell good. This is my favorite. This seller is located on Hawaii and promptly ships.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy here again.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about my perfume.My husband and I went to Maui for our honeymoon and I tried this and fell in love I now order from amazon and I always get it very quickly and  Forever florals has great customer service!</li>
            <li> I love this scent and I get many compliments on it. It makes me feel like I&#x27;m back on the islands, and every day is a vacation!</li>
            <li> Smells Great! Arrived Faaaaast and very well packaged!</li>

            <li> I love the Forever Floral Plumeria cologne.  It is such a nice clean fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance in the warmer weather.  I usually wear OPIUM and this is nice and light.  I always get lots of compliments on it.  I like the body lotion as well.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne.  Found it in Hawaii and so happy to be able to get it online.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get a chance to buy this perfume in Hawaii when I was there, so when I seen it I had to have it.</li>
            <li> This is probably the 4th bottle of the cologne that i have bought from this vendor.  It is always wrapped well and comes very quickly after I purchase it.  I am so pleased - not only with the perfume, which is my absolute favorite - but also with this vendor and will continue doing business with them as long as they are in business.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this cologne.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s been my preferred scent for years. It IS a little strong at first, but it faded quickly into something much more mild.</li>
            <li> The scent has an undertone of plumeria then other woody notes.  I had tried other plumeria perfumes this was my second favorite.  Terra Nova has a plumeria scent that is floral with no woody notes.</li>
            <li> smells great.  Just like I remember in Hawaii.</li>
            <li> An excellent scent that really reminds you of Hawaii.  It&#x27;s subtle and not over powering.  It also adds that psychological advantage of reminding you of the islands.</li>
            <li> Arrived as advertised. The perfume does not last long when applied.</li>
            <li> Smells great and lasts all day. Definitely will buy again</li>
            <li> Used to buy this when I lived on Oahu, and I was sad to not have it at my disposal whenever I wanted to buy it, but now thanks to Amazon, I can have it here any time I want! (love you guys!) it is one of the truest PLUMERIA scents I have found and lasts several hours as well!</li>
            <li> Smells justi like Hawaiian Plumeria&#x27;s. Will be buying more right away.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, reminds me of Hawaii!</li>
            <li> I have a girlfriend who LOVES this scent, and I thought it would make the best Christmas present.  She was absolutley delighted when she opened it.  The product arrived safe and in excellent condition.  I would certainly order from this company again.  I recommend anyone looking for this scent from Hawaii, to use this company.</li>
