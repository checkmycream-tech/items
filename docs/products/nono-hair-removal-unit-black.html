    <ol>
            <li>If you have the time and patients and you fully understand this is a process, you will be very happy with the end results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Awesome product.</li>
            <li>After all the wonderful hype on the \\&quot;NoNo\\&quot; I decided to buy one thinking this would be the answer to all my prayers.  </li>
            <li>And it also did not do a very good job of shaving the hair.</li>
            <li>LOL thank goodness</li>
            <li>lol  </li>
            <li>Loved the idea but not now..</li>
            <li>used 3x a week for about 7 weeks, with amazing results.</li>
            <li>I got this product and really liked it.  </li>
            <li>it was nice to smell burning hair</li>
            <li>It would have been nice if they would let the consumer know before they purchase.</li>
            <li>said she liked it</li>
            <li>really very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>No Pain just a very light warm</li>
            <li>worked great the first time, but fizzled out thereafter.  </li>
            <li>VEET works much, much better.</li>
            <li>Again, VEET works much better.</li>
            <li>It sure makes it easier.</li>
            <li>love the product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just stick with my razor, it does a better job and is a lot faster.</li>
            <li>but she cant love an electerical&lt;</li>
            <li>It has been sometime now since i purchased this product and after use of the product most of the time she still has to go and shave.  </li>
            <li>Glad I read feedback.</li>
            <li>Worked pretty good on arms...not as efficient on legs.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this item after seeing the infomercial thinking wow how great.</li>
            <li>Although the price was reasonable, I can&#x27;t in good conscience recommend it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use</li>
            <li>There is still a chance but not the easy thing it says in the info-commercial.  </li>
            <li>fine?</li>
            <li>I have light brown hair and if you have darker might have to do it a couple of times.</li>
            <li>so its in comfortable for me to use</li>
            <li>Had been using epilady which can only be described in one word: OUCH.&lt;br /&gt;NoNo was a pleasant change.</li>
            <li>I gave it the full 3 months</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>My daughter whose hair falls in the normal ranges, has better success.</li>
            <li>For fine hair, maybe, but for people who really have a hair problem, the people their ads target, it&#x27;s a lie.</li>
            <li>but I guess the product is worth it.</li>
            <li>STAY CLEAR, shaving is a better option.</li>
            <li>It is worth the cash</li>
            <li>The hair is not removed right away</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m super excited I just ordered the NEW one that&#x27;s cordless and can be used on your face and bikini area.    </li>
            <li>I watched the video and followed the instructions exactly.  </li>
            <li>It saves me the trip, money and hassle of going back for more treatments</li>
            <li>I used it 2-3x per week as suggested for the first 6 weeks, now twice a week.  </li>
            <li>Very time consuming!</li>
            <li>It got my skin on my leg too hot.  </li>
            <li>The directions intimidated me at first, but it&lt;br /&gt;is</li>
            <li>I wonder if it works on any, really!?</li>
            <li>it NONO was my first name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;frank</li>
            <li>nothing positive about this product at all.</li>
            <li>I got it for the course hair on my chin, and i still have to pluck them as the no no removes NONE of them, only the fine hairs which i dont need removing..</li>
            <li>It is really just a Gimmick.</li>
            <li>Thanks for posting your reviews</li>
            <li>Skin becomes very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would really like to try this product</li>
            <li>My hair has not gotten much lighter.</li>
            <li>but this one had a cord and when rolling it across skin it was very &amp;#34;uneven&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;bumpy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I ended up selling it on ebay for almost as much.</li>
            <li>straight?</li>
            <li>Does not work and the price is just to high</li>
            <li>It burns the hair off but it grows right back</li>
            <li>Already had to buy new blades.</li>
            <li>I have left at least 5 messages and sent a good 10 e mails</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My first clue should of been when the box came with a blue rubber band around it.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clear the hair as neatly as it seems to on tv.  </li>
            <li>but, when reading instructions, it clearly states NOT to use on face.</li>
            <li>I really thought this was the answer to my facial hair problem.</li>
            <li>do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>but you will spend at least 5x more time using the No</li>
            <li>I do really like for bikini area since relatively no irritation.</li>
            <li>altho doubt if they really give your money back any way.  </li>
            <li>My co-worker got one direct from the company.  </li>
            <li>My usuall coarse dark hair was fine and barely grew</li>
            <li>I tried it on a small area on my legs, and it did not leave the area smooth-</li>
            <li>put in the new one only to find it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t worth $20 much less $300.</li>
            <li>on top of that it is quite scary to use because you can smell the burnt hair and u see the wire that is supposed to remove the hair get red hot.</li>
            <li>Im actually surprised Amazon would sell such a fraud.</li>
            <li>I used it faithfully for 60 days and not a single hair stopped growing.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Each area must be done in the beginning of the first 3 to 4 weeks at least 3 to 4 times in each session.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> they mean exactly that.  </li>
            <li> This item is so so so bad.. it&#x27;s made so cheaply and doesn&#x27;t really work...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make complete shave, just take off few hairs.</li>
            <li> It worked but again takes a long time</li>
            <li> I dry shave once a week</li>
            <li> still stubby, even after repeated tries.</li>
            <li> False advertisement and I do not recommend that anyone who really has a hair problem buy this.</li>
            <li> I watched the advert for the no no for weeks, and my boyfriend got sick of it and bought me 1 for xmas, I have been trying to use it every day to give it a chance, but it does not work at all, the buffer removes more hair than the no</li>
            <li> Realize this is an alternative to shaving, not a means to little or no hair long term.</li>
            <li> Product has shotty power supply, not able to use on face and not labeled properly and does not work well at all.</li>
            <li> but it frusterates me that after spending over 200$ that they don&#x27;t call back.&lt;br /&gt;I have not repaced the tips due to stubbornness</li>
            <li> It took me an hour to get to the place, a half hour of enduring pain</li>
            <li> The blades that they give you are expensive to replace and they do not last long at all.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited when I got my No No and was quickly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> now im stuck paying of a nono and with no results dont waste your time</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it, it doesn&#x27;t work, it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> like we wasted our money now</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if its used or not cd was scratched</li>
            <li> I went past the return date.  </li>
            <li> I am so disappointed that this broke the first time I tried to use it.  </li>
            <li> it hardly removes any hair at all.</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment.</li>
            <li> a complete waste of money I am sad to say:-(</li>
            <li> I do not understand how they get away with  false advertising like this.  </li>

            <li> I am not impressed at all:-</li>
            <li> I am now stuck with something that was expensive and does not work and can not be returned.  </li>

            <li> Sorry....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to use it</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work like they show on TV, so I didn&#x27;t like. It doesn&#x27;t make complete shave, just take off few hairs.</li>
            <li> I really thought this was the answer to my facial hair problem. I watched the video and followed the instructions exactly.  The product left burns on my chin and arms.</li>
            <li> Product has shotty power supply, not able to use on face and not labeled properly and does not work well at all. Very unhappy with the product.</li>
            <li> I kept going and spending all this money on laser hair removal.  It took me an hour to get to the place, a half hour of enduring pain and then I&#x27;d still have to go back for touch up treatments after I was done my series of 8 treatments.    I got this product and really liked it.  It&#x27;s so easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all!!  It saves me the trip, money and hassle of going back for more treatments and I&#x27;m super excited I just ordered the NEW one that&#x27;s cordless and can be used on your face and bikini area.    No more pain for me!!!!</li>
            <li> this is a horrible product...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work quite like advertised.  Just in my 3rd week so things could change.  Leaves a &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; and it is quite pronounced by the end of the day even after buffing that morning.  There is still a chance but not the easy thing it says in the info-commercial.  Also, the instructions say to NOT use on the face!!!!  Then it shows you using it on the upper lip and chin.... isn&#x27;t the upper lip &amp; the chin both on the &amp;#34;face&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li> do not waste your money on this product. it hardly removes any hair at all. on top of that it is quite scary to use because you can smell the burnt hair and u see the wire that is supposed to remove the hair get red hot. nothing positive about this product at all.</li>
            <li> i wont mind if it worked like they raved.but now im stuck paying of a nono and with no results dont waste your time</li>
            <li> NO...NO ...NO...Do not buy it!!! Did not work at all.&lt;br /&gt;ZERO stars!! It is really just a Gimmick.Save your money.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it, it doesn&#x27;t work, it was a waste of money. i wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone for anything.</li>
            <li> It burns the hair off but it grows right back</li>
            <li> I am not impressed at all:-(  if I would have known I would have never bought it!!!  a complete waste of money I am sad to say:-(</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews before purchasing an item...glad I read these...way too expensive to not work.  Thanks for posting your reviews and I hope all of you get your money back.</li>
            <li> According to consumer reports reviews, The downside to the NONO is the following:&lt;br /&gt;1. The smell of burnt hair but that will stop over time.&lt;br /&gt;2. The hair is not removed right away but it takes about 3 to 4 weeks to see results.&lt;br /&gt;3. It takes about 15 to 25 min per leg depending on the amount and coarseness of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;4. Each area must be done in the beginning of the first 3 to 4 weeks at least 3 to 4 times in each session.&lt;br /&gt;5. You must have patients with the process they guarantee it will work.&lt;br /&gt;6. If you are looking for instant results this is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upside to purchasing the NONO&lt;br /&gt;1. 60 day money back Guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;2. The hair grows back 93% slower over time&lt;br /&gt;3. Skin becomes very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;4. If you have the time and patients and you fully understand this is a process, you will be very happy with the end results.&lt;br /&gt;5. No Pain just a very light warm feeling.&lt;br /&gt;6. 3 heat settings you control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would really like to try this product but I am undecided and this is a lot of money to just waist.</li>
            <li> I would not buy no no . people on review help me not to buy this item.Does not work and the price is just to high and it does not work. COME ON!!!!</li>
            <li> Although the television ads display this tool being used on the face, the literature that accompanied the device warned against it.  I now will return it.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed. Upon reaching their site I decided to buy the newer version, for coarser hair. It burned my face, it does not work as they say it does. VEET works much, much better. Also, I have emailed them three times, two of which were to request information on how to return it for a refund.  They will not respond, just charged my debit card today for the second payment. This product isn&#x27;t worth $20 much less $300. For fine hair, maybe, but for people who really have a hair problem, the people their ads target, it&#x27;s a lie. False advertisement and I do not recommend that anyone who really has a hair problem buy this. It&#x27;s a rip off. Again, VEET works much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to use it I&#x27;m not sure if its used or not cd was scratched no no  was scratched probably gonna return it</li>
            <li> Been using for over two months. I used it 2-3x per week as suggested for the first 6 weeks, now twice a week.  Yes, you don&#x27;t have to shave with this product but you will spend at least 5x more time using the No No. My hair has not gotten much lighter. I use on arms, legs, armpit and bikini areas. Already had to buy new blades. I do really like for bikini area since relatively no irritation. Realize this is an alternative to shaving, not a means to little or no hair long term. Very time consuming!</li>
            <li> Wished we would have seen the upgraded one that also works on faces.&lt;br /&gt;Felt like we wasted our money now</li>
            <li> Please do not be taken by this product.  I used it faithfully for 60 days and not a single hair stopped growing.  In fact it may have increased the amount of hair that I was trying to remove.  When they say No!no! they mean exactly that.  It removes no no hair at all.  I do not understand how they get away with  false advertising like this.  If you purchase this know that you will have to keep up using the devise every day to keep your hair away.  The blades that they give you are expensive to replace and they do not last long at all.  I went through all the blades that they sent with the No no in the 60 day trial period.  Since I gave it the maximum trial period to work I went past the return date.  I am now stuck with something that was expensive and does not work and can not be returned.  Do not be fooled like I was.</li>
            <li> stinks when using and takes alot of time and patience.  I gave it away to my son who used it twice for back hair.  It worked but again takes a long time</li>
            <li> My friend bought one and was very disappointed with it.My dermatologist told me that he has all of the ladies in his office as well as  those in the cosmetic section to just shave, and no it won&#x27;t come back thicker, fuller, etc. For about a year I dry shave once a week and it&#x27;s a piece of cake. Takes a couple of minutes. I have light brown hair and if you have darker might have to do it a couple of times. Wish I had known this years ago. It sure makes it easier.</li>
            <li> I purchased a no no in jan 2013 from the as seen on tv store.&lt;br /&gt;I used 3x a week for about 7 weeks, with amazing results. My usuall coarse dark hair was fine and barely grew anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I only used no no for about once every 1 or 2 weeks till July.  In July my 1st tip wore out.&lt;br /&gt;I put in the new one only to find it didn&#x27;t work. I guess I got a defect.&lt;br /&gt;They have HORRIBLE customer service. This is the only reason I give it a 3 vs a 5.&lt;br /&gt; I have left at least 5 messages and sent a good 10 e mails they do not reply.&lt;br /&gt;I love the product but it frusterates me that after spending over 200$ that they don&#x27;t call back.&lt;br /&gt;I have not repaced the tips due to stubbornness but I guess the product is worth it. so I will suck it up.</li>
            <li> I watched the advert for the no no for weeks, and my boyfriend got sick of it and bought me 1 for xmas, I have been trying to use it every day to give it a chance, but it does not work at all, the buffer removes more hair than the no no...it simply burns hair and makes an awful smell(you need to have a shower after using it) I got it for the course hair on my chin, and i still have to pluck them as the no no removes NONE of them, only the fine hairs which i dont need removing..DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, I would like a refund but after reading the reviews it looks like its a lost battle, (i wish my boyfriend had of read the revews 1st) STAY CLEAR, shaving is a better option.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I actually thought it was the one you could use on your face.  I was wrong it wasn&#x27;t and returned it.</li>
            <li> It got my skin on my leg too hot.  And it also did not do a very good job of shaving the hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered and returned this NoNo. in  November.  Now (March) I got a nasty collection letter saying I owe $179.91.  They want me to make monthly payments. HELP  &#x27;.</li>
            <li> it was nice to smell burning hair LOL thank goodness u took it back&lt;br /&gt;I will get it again some day</li>
            <li> COULD NOT FIND A LOWER RATING TO USE .  wOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.  BAD  BAD  BAd  bad  bad</li>
            <li> units on TV show cordless but this one had a cord and when rolling it across skin it was very &amp;#34;uneven&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;bumpy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed that this broke the first time I tried to use it.  What a waste of money. Spend the money and upgrade to the newest unit. It is worth the cash</li>
            <li> they show that you can use it on your face, &amp; then when you get it , it says on book, do not use it on your face. its faults advertising. .</li>
            <li> Not for my skin it works as advertised I have very sensitive skin so its in comfortable for me to use</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clear the hair as neatly as it seems to on tv.  It skips and sort of rattles and misses a lot of the finer hairs.  Although the price was reasonable, I can&#x27;t in good conscience recommend it.</li>
            <li> After all the wonderful hype on the \\&quot;NoNo\\&quot; I decided to buy one thinking this would be the answer to all my prayers.  My first clue should of been when the box came with a blue rubber band around it.  It didn&#x27;t improve after that.  What a waste of money.  I gave it the full 3 months altho doubt if they really give your money back any way.  The \\&quot;NoNo\\&quot; is a big nono in my book.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I got my No No and was quickly disappointed.  In the directions manual it specifically stated to NOT use on your FACE.  This is why I got it.  So I sent it back.  So even if they show people using it on TV on their face....the directions say not to!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item after seeing the infomercial thinking wow how great. After receiving the package I followed the instructions and gave it a try. It takes a few tries to get the right stroke technique. What I discovered is if you have course hair, this product does not work as well. You keep on running over the same areas again and again. At this point it begins to give you a burning sensation which lasts for a hour or so. My daughter whose hair falls in the normal ranges, has better success.</li>
            <li> This item is so so so bad.. it&#x27;s made so cheaply and doesn&#x27;t really work... and I know i&#x27;m using it properly. It takes ages and you can&#x27;t get all the hair so you still have to continue to shave anyway. It burns your bikini line badly. I ended up selling it on ebay for almost as much.</li>
            <li> Had been using epilady which can only be described in one word: OUCH.&lt;br /&gt;NoNo was a pleasant change. The directions intimidated me at first, but it&lt;br /&gt;is really very easy to use.  I like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just stick with my razor, it does a better job and is a lot faster. I don&#x27;t know why therwe is such a hype about No- No, I used it according to the instructions and it is terrible!</li>
            <li> Worked pretty good on arms...not as efficient on legs.  I&#x27;ll keep trying, but I doubt I can eliminate shaving totally.</li>
            <li> No No does nothing for course hair. I wonder if it works on any, really!? fine? straight? or curly??? It would have been nice if they would let the consumer know before they purchase. Regardless of the 60 day M.B.G.</li>
            <li> This product is a fraud/scam.  My co-worker got one direct from the company.  It took 8 months to get it refunded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LED lights do nothing, they are simple LED lights.  All the product does is heats up a wire which slides over your skin almost burning the hair.  I say almost because there isnt enough power in the batteries, to heat the wire enough to burn through hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please dont buy this product.  Youre just getting your money stolen.  Im actually surprised Amazon would sell such a fraud.</li>
            <li> I ordered NoNo for facial hair removal, as seen on their ads/website... but, when reading instructions, it clearly states NOT to use on face. I tried it on a small area on my legs, and it did not leave the area smooth- still stubby, even after repeated tries. I was disappointed, and returned it.</li>
            <li> i got the nono for my wife. said she liked it but she cant love an electerical&lt;br /&gt;device. lol  nono works just as avertised and would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;besides  it NONO was my first name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;frank</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife and she is not happen with it.  It has been sometime now since i purchased this product and after use of the product most of the time she still has to go and shave.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> wanting one. Glad I read feedback. Wld not buy this item nor recommend it. Such a disappointment. Loved the idea but not now.. Sorry....</li>
            <li> worked great the first time, but fizzled out thereafter.  nothing but the smell of burning hair.  also, you are&lt;br /&gt;hooked to the wall.</li>
            <li> It is not like they say.  It does not work well and it has not removed the hair like they advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don</li>
