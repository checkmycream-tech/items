            <li>Since I found this flat iron, she loves it and works great!</li>
            <li>Best flat iron I have ever purchased!</li>
            <li>It is still a pretty good straightener.</li>
            <li>This is my first herstyler product but so far I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super cute too.</li>
            <li>It was so cheap</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best flat iron I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>The salesman flat ironed my hair and it was shiny and worked great with one swipe.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a fun print!</li>
            <li>The inside of the box had minor tears but the product was in great condition.</li>
            <li>This straightener is amazing not only is it stylish</li>
            <li>So much cheaper, and works better than the Chi (I&#x27;ve used a Chi before)</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly, gives my hair a nice shine, gets hot enough to perfectly straighten my thick hair, but not so hot that it burns it,</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing another Herstyler from the colorful seasons collection just to keep in my stash.</li>
            <li>Extremely worth the money.</li>
            <li>If your looking for a nice, sturdy flat iron i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Yes, that&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li>It came right on the first day of estimated delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works well, doesn&#x27;t get too hot, just the right size and weight..  </li>
            <li>I absolutely adore giraffe print!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot and it seems to take me longer to do my hair.  </li>
            <li>Overall satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>and I simply just love the design and</li>
            <li>*gets hot but not as hot as my CHI&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>We loved how the product worked but did NOT love the price tag.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Same iron, same results, much better price!</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see what all the hype is all about.</li>
            <li>It arrived in record time, and it works really well.</li>
            <li>and I HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my Chi for 5 years and it finally gave out and I can say this works far better than my Chi ever did</li>
            <li>It also heats up quickly and I don&#x27;t have to go over my hair several times to get it straight.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t fall for high pressure of these salesman that work at the mall.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical but turned out to be a great product.</li>
            <li>I was shopping for a new straightener and came across this.</li>
            <li>The Chi flat iron I purchased had a gap in the middle that immediately turned me off, it did not seem very sturdy and does not look like it will last more than a year because the top part of the flat iron felt loose.</li>
            <li>Its only one inch and the first time I dropped it (on carpet)</li>
            <li>FIrst because of the giraffe print, 2nd because of how well it works.  </li>
            <li>I can already see the difference it makes on my hair compared to my old one.</li>
            <li>He was high pressure, but I told him I&#x27;d think about it and might be back.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new flat iron took a chance on this one.</li>
            <li>*it is built pretty decently not too cheep (especially if its not a real herstyler)</li>

            <li> This flat iron is a must!!  </li>
            <li> Although it looks the same and came in the same box it just doesn&#x27;t seem to have the quality of the other one.  </li>
            <li> The design is a little lighter than the picture shows, but that wasn&#x27;t a big deal to me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong; it did make my hair shiny, but it still had frizz and was not that straight.</li>

            <li> I can have my nasty wavy/curly hair and with one swipe, it flattens quite nicely.  </li>
            <li> it is not a 1.5 inch iron, its just an inch (i don&#x27;t care though because i have semi short hair and thin, buts its</li>
            <li> got home and got on Amazon.com website and found it for $100 less!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t usually find giraffe print anywhere.</li>
            <li> I purchased a chi flat iron from JC Penny (which is an authorized Chi retailer) and let me tell you I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> Will be sold in malls for at least $120.</li>
            <li> and I have very thick kinky curly hair.</li>
            <li> *has a weird not normal scent to it also when its plugged in but not as bad a my CHI that i bought on amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an expensive one that I purchased at the mall.  </li>

            <li> My gut feeling told me that I would give this flat iron 5 stars as soon as I received it in the mail. The design is a little lighter than the picture shows, but that wasn&#x27;t a big deal to me. I purchased a chi flat iron from JC Penny (which is an authorized Chi retailer) and let me tell you I was not impressed. I really don&#x27;t see what all the hype is all about. The Chi flat iron I purchased had a gap in the middle that immediately turned me off, it did not seem very sturdy and does not look like it will last more than a year because the top part of the flat iron felt loose. Thank god JC penny has a no hassle return policy because even if that thing was on sale for $20 I still wouldn&#x27;t purchase it!! Don&#x27;t get me wrong; it did make my hair shiny, but it still had frizz and was not that straight. When I straighten my hair with my Herstyler it got the job done in 37 minutes and I have very thick kinky curly hair. The Chi flat iron took me about 1 hour and 20 minutes to do my hair. I will be purchasing another Herstyler from the colorful seasons collection just to keep in my stash. Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this. It is inexpensive and definitely salon quality.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  I can have my nasty wavy/curly hair and with one swipe, it flattens quite nicely.  It&#x27;s also a fun print!</li>
            <li> This straightener is amazing not only is it stylish but I don&#x27;t have to sperate my hair in layers to straighten it</li>
            <li> This product is the best straighter I have ever used! The inside of the box had minor tears but the product was in great condition. It arrived in record time, and it works really well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore giraffe print! So whenever I saw this product, I fell in love! I was shopping for a new straightener and came across this. Read the reviews as most people like it better than the Chi! Yes please! So much cheaper, and works better than the Chi (I&#x27;ve used a Chi before) and it came in giraffe print. Perfect.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new flat iron took a chance on this one. All I can say is awesome. I&#x27;ve had my Chi for 5 years and it finally gave out and I can say this works far better than my Chi ever did and IT paid 150.00 when I bought my Chi. I definitely recommend this flat iron</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an expensive one that I purchased at the mall.  Although it looks the same and came in the same box it just doesn&#x27;t seem to have the quality of the other one.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot and it seems to take me longer to do my hair.  It is still a pretty good straightener.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter in law..she loves it. It came in a beautiful box and the iron itself is amazing. It looks much more expensive than it is. Great value for the money.</li>
            <li> I am now the most favorite Auntie in the world for having found this! You can&#x27;t usually find giraffe print anywhere. Since I found this flat iron, she loves it and works great!</li>
            <li> V. Good product worth the mony and good brand. Will be sold in malls for at least $120. Her styler is a good brand all my family have it now because it is a name brand in that field</li>
            <li> Best flat iron I have ever purchased! I saw it online for $250, searched Amazon and got it for $35! WHAT A STEAL! Anywho, it&#x27;s great! Heats up quickly, gives my hair a nice shine, gets hot enough to perfectly straighten my thick hair, but not so hot that it burns it, beautiful design and it was estimated to arrive between 10/19 and 11/5, i got it on 10/18! The only thing I don&#x27;t like is how it SAYS that you can adjust the heat, but you cant. No biggie though it is a lovely flat iron and I HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
            <li> I saw this flat iron in the mall, for $150! (50% off of $300) The salesman flat ironed my hair and it was shiny and worked great with one swipe. He was high pressure, but I told him I&#x27;d think about it and might be back. My husband, who carries his IPad around while I shop, decided to look it up on Amazon, while in another store, and voila, it was $36. Don&#x27;t fall for high pressure of these salesman that work at the mall. Buy it here. Same iron, same results, much better price! You even get a sample of hair product with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I never leave reviews.  However,  I MUST with this one!  This is the absolute best flat iron I have ever used.  Let me tell you,  I&#x27;ve used many.  This one make Chi look more like a $14.99 Conair.  What used to be a dreaded two hour venture with straightening,  took me 30min with this one.  This flat iron is a must!!  Make sure you also purchase their serum.  AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My sister and I were at the mall and a sales person for these straightners suckered us in to being models. We loved how the product worked but did NOT love the price tag.&lt;br /&gt;I got home and got on Amazon.com website and found it for $100 less! Yes, that&#x27;s right. They wanted to charge $149.00 at the mall! Don&#x27;t fall for the scam.</li>
            <li> I like it but its not 1 1/2 inches at all, not even close. Its only one inch and the first time I dropped it (on carpet) it broke. If your looking for a nice, sturdy flat iron i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Glides over hair and makes it shiney! This is my first herstyler product but so far I&#x27;m impressed. It also heats up quickly and I don&#x27;t have to go over my hair several times to get it straight.</li>
            <li> Paid way less than I did for the other one I had! And it works just the same! No problems at all. It&#x27;s super cute too. Even came with a nice box. Overall satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> The best one I have ever bought. Extremely worth the money. It was so cheap I was skeptical but turned out to be a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using herstyler for years now! Mine recently broke from dropping it. I was looking online for another one and I simply just love the design and the fact it only goes up to one temperature doesn&#x27;t bother me. I can already see the difference it makes on my hair compared to my old one.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves giraffes and the print was just perfect.I can&#x27;t wait til she opens it. 10/16/13 My daughter LOVES this iron!! She has waist length hair and uses it every day, it looks healthy, shiny and her friends prefer to use hers over their own irons.</li>
            <li> It came right on the first day of estimated delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My cons: *The print is giraffe, but not the print that they have shown. * it is not a 1.5 inch iron, its just an inch (i don&#x27;t care though because i have semi short hair and thin, buts its not what they said) *has a weird not normal scent to it also when its plugged in but not as bad a my CHI that i bought on amazon. *gets hot but not as hot as my CHI&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Pros: *it is built pretty decently not too cheep (especially if its not a real herstyler) *makes my hair so super soft! *also i dont notice as many fly aways at the top of my hair when using this over all a good iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;with all the cons my pros weigh out the bad so i am gong to keep it because it is a nice straighter!</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron.....Works well, doesn&#x27;t get too hot, just the right size and weight..  Perfect for people with shorter hair,</li>
            <li> Way cheaper than buying in the mall.  My niece loves it.  FIrst because of the giraffe print, 2nd because of how well it works.  :)</li>
            <li> Great product and great price</li>
