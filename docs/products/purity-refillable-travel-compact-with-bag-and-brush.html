            <li>Very happy about this purchase. :)</li>
            <li>Perfect for any powder than you want to be easy to use and take with you.</li>
            <li>It is good.</li>
            <li>good idea, but powder stuck in lid and crevices...</li>
            <li>The ideal is good but powder always filled up through the holes when I lift the lid to get one apply of usage all kind of powder overflows</li>
            <li>though I am not going to use the brush, I still rate it 5 star because with this price, it can&#x27;t be any better!</li>

            <li>love this!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>Love this mirror and brush and cover its all a good value for what you get.</li>
            <li>bought this to make my own makeup.</li>
            <li>Nice container, hasn&#x27;t leaked out or spilled.</li>
            <li>Perfect just what I wanted and very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I love that there is a spot for the brush - that&#x27;s really the best thing about it.</li>
            <li>Pretty, nice size, and very handy.  </li>
            <li>Such a great price, and great quality also.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the bag is perfect but obviously dont expect a top of the line luxury brush for the price.</li>
            <li>I just hope the brush is better quality.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Love this compact for my e.l.f.</li>
            <li>Love the fact it&#x27;s in a zipped travel bag.</li>
            <li>the price is much better.</li>
            <li>I like the seperate brush compartment at the top too.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok.  </li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>love the brush that came with it.  </li>
            <li>I also made sure that before I inserted the plastic shifter/brush holder the</li>
            <li>Love the style, etc.</li>
            <li>Nice quality and very useful case to help contain powder.</li>
            <li>Perfect for loose powder love it</li>
            <li>My powder is loose which means it&#x27;s gets everywhere, but because this comes in an outter case, it is perfect!</li>
            <li>for the price I can&#x27;t complain much!&lt;br /&gt;Still works fine and sweet!</li>
            <li>But this was cheap.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and appears in picture. :)</li>
            <li>The included brush is adequate.</li>
            <li>Although I totally love the case for the compact, I would gladly pay the same price for just the compact alone.</li>
            <li>but the hinge broke the very first time I opened it.  </li>
            <li>Convenient, easy to use, and a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It seems to hold up better than the one I recieved with my Bare Minerals package.</li>
            <li>I bought a brush at first that you can press the button to make powder come out</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Still looking for a pretty compact to keep in my purse.</li>
            <li>I bought a higher end one</li>
            <li>It worked as good as the round one with my brand.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My mom and I have very pale complexions, and she always just used baby powder to powder her face but never had a good container to keep it in on the go.</li>
            <li>This is a handy little compact for DIY makeup.</li>
            <li>However, you do have to be a bit careful with the powder spilling out of the sifter (hence 4 stars instead of 5), but all in all, this is still a better solution than the brush dispensers.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>I use L&#x27;Or√©al brand and never took it with me in my purse, but thanks to this product I can.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually surprised to find this little gem at such a good price!</li>
            <li>Handy little essential.</li>
            <li>Just be sure buy one with a diamater slightly small than the compacts diamater.</li>
            <li>It actually looks cheap, but worked for me to transport my loose powder without it getting untidy in use.</li>
            <li>tried just removing the inner liner, but in order to have that liner be able to snap tightly into place, there are holes cut completely through the compact, which means that the powder would just come pouring out, even if the lid makes</li>
            <li>I have had no issues so far with leakage.</li>
            <li>The brush is thin, but is good enough for dusting.  </li>
            <li>It never fails that I purchase one of those dry sunscreens in the tubular brush containers, and the brush clogs before I&#x27;ve even used a quarter of the product.</li>
            <li>It really is making the most out of the pressed powder I used to waste or just throw out because of the mess.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use with the case and will fit small purses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You have to jam your finger under the tab, try to get a tight grip on smooth plastic, and yank on it repeatedly to open the compartment.  </li>
            <li>top also hard to close and not that compact--  was hoping smaller.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although both come with a kabuki brush that I will not use, the Purity refillable compact is sooooooo much better--it can be closed properly and has no leakage of powder, it does not look as cheap as the Bare Escentuals one, although it does cost half of the latter.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy and bulkier than I expected.</li>
            <li>This worked just as well as the one from Bare Minerals and</li>
            <li>I did not fill mine a whole lot as I was filling from a nearly empty regular jar.</li>
            <li>It stays in this little compact pretty well but the additional zippered case prevents any chance of powder spillage through her things.</li>
            <li>Not convenient or pretty for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I could live with that if it was remotely usable.</li>
            <li>Yes this is a bit messy, but if mineral power it is messy...just be careful and clean off compact before putting back in purse.  </li>
            <li>Nice little case for my hd powder that gets everywhere, the brush is a little week with slight shedding</li>

            <li> a tight seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I checked out that more expensive brand&#x27;s compact, and it has the exact same liner with the little tab.</li>
            <li> The brush is wider than it appears in the picture and is very soft, so that your powder doesn&#x27;t go everywhere and make a mess.</li>
            <li> This inner plastic liner is a tad loose and leaks powder.</li>
            <li> And I do mean PRY; in order to keep the powder sealed up, it&#x27;s a VERY tight fit.  </li>
            <li> If I buy a product already in a sifter jar, I only remove the label covering the holes only a little.</li>
            <li> Now I dump the dry sunscreen into this compact instead.</li>
            <li> Now I just dump the remaining pressed powder into this container and use it as loose powder.</li>
            <li> This helps, by only letting a little product out a time.  </li>
            <li> I had such a hard time finding something like this until I finally stumbled across this little gem.</li>
            <li> spf 45 powder and other mineral powders.  </li>
            <li> And how long do you suppose that thin little plastic tab is going to last before it breaks off, leaving me no way to open the compartment?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> See that little tab that sticks out?  </li>
            <li> The compact has a built in mirror and it conveniently comes with a little applicator brush that fits inside.</li>
            <li> I usually use pressed powder, but once it cracks it usually makes a mess.</li>
            <li> I ordered this one because I am so disappointed with the Bare Escentuals Refillable Mirror Compact which is a total</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell from the picture, but this compact is very thick and bulky.  </li>
            <li> I use a base of arrowroot powder and a tiny bit of bentonite clay and add cocoa powder, cinnamon, tumeric, etc.</li>
            <li> I think it is unnecessary.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately This did not work..</li>
            <li> No more smearing random crap</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great! Perfect for any powder than you want to be easy to use and take with you. I bought a brush at first that you can press the button to make powder come out and it didn&#x27;t work at all. I then bought this and I am happy with it. Nice quality and very useful case to help contain powder.</li>
            <li> Sturdy carrying case, sturdy compact. It gets the job done. The only thing I would change besides making both cases prettier, would be to have a powder puff instead of the brush. I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. I wanted a portable container to put my homemade setting power (cornstarch) in . Wasnt looking for something extravagent the container is perfect the bag is perfect but obviously dont expect a top of the line luxury brush for the price. I plan to just buy a powder puff to put in the case in pplace of the brush that came with it. Just be sure buy one with a diamater slightly small than the compacts diamater.</li>
            <li> It is good. I just hope the brush is better quality.&lt;br /&gt;But for the price I can&#x27;t complain much!&lt;br /&gt;Still works fine and sweet!</li>
            <li> Love this compact for my e.l.f. spf 45 powder and other mineral powders.  It is very sturdy and bulkier than I expected. The brush is thin, but is good enough for dusting.  Yes this is a bit messy, but if mineral power it is messy...just be careful and clean off compact before putting back in purse.  I don&#x27;t use with the case and will fit small purses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never had the BM version.  But this was cheap. Nice.</li>
            <li> I find this very handy for my powder sunscreens. It never fails that I purchase one of those dry sunscreens in the tubular brush containers, and the brush clogs before I&#x27;ve even used a quarter of the product. Now I dump the dry sunscreen into this compact instead. I love that there is a spot for the brush - that&#x27;s really the best thing about it. However, you do have to be a bit careful with the powder spilling out of the sifter (hence 4 stars instead of 5), but all in all, this is still a better solution than the brush dispensers.</li>
            <li> Real nice makeup case for my homemade mineral makeup. Love the fact it&#x27;s in a zipped travel bag. The case itself comes with a makeup brush and a mirror. Great setup.</li>
            <li> Love this mirror and brush and cover its all a good value for what you get. The nylon zip case further prevents any potential spillover.</li>
            <li> The ideal is good but powder always filled up through the holes when I lift the lid to get one apply of usage all kind of powder overflows</li>
            <li> I ordered this one because I am so disappointed with the Bare Escentuals Refillable Mirror Compact which is a total mess.&lt;br /&gt;Although both come with a kabuki brush that I will not use, the Purity refillable compact is sooooooo much better--it can be closed properly and has no leakage of powder, it does not look as cheap as the Bare Escentuals one, although it does cost half of the latter.&lt;br /&gt;Even though I am not going to use the brush, I still rate it 5 star because with this price, it can&#x27;t be any better!</li>
            <li> Perfect for loose powder love it</li>
            <li> Nice little case for my hd powder that gets everywhere, the brush is a little week with slight shedding but I use a different one as it is!</li>
            <li> I tape over some of the holes of any sifter compact I buy. If I buy a product already in a sifter jar, I only remove the label covering the holes only a little. This helps, by only letting a little product out a time.  To reduce bulk in my makeup bag, I don&#x27;t use the include zippered case.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for! Such a great price, and great quality also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to make my own makeup. Not even kidding... I use a base of arrowroot powder and a tiny bit of bentonite clay and add cocoa powder, cinnamon, tumeric, etc. to get the desired shade. I will never buy makeup again. No more smearing random crap I can&#x27;t pronounce (let alone know what the heck it is) all over my face. Very happy about this purchase. :)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately This did not work..good idea, but powder stuck in lid and crevices...top also hard to close and not that compact--  was hoping smaller.</li>
            <li> So cute! love this! been looking in stores for one! great transaction! thanks</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and appears in picture. :)</li>
            <li> I love it! I usually use pressed powder, but once it cracks it usually makes a mess. Now I just dump the remaining pressed powder into this container and use it as loose powder. It really is making the most out of the pressed powder I used to waste or just throw out because of the mess.</li>
            <li> Really like it. Been looking for 1 for years.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and serviceable, especially for travel. It actually looks cheap, but worked for me to transport my loose powder without it getting untidy in use. The plastic separator keeps the powder in place. The included brush is adequate. Not convenient or pretty for everyday use. Still looking for a pretty compact to keep in my purse.</li>
            <li> Perfect powder compact. I put my e.l.f. HD powder in it. The case keeps it from getting damaged or leaking any powder in the disaster that is my purse lol. Be careful pulling the inner lid up though - almost ripped it completely off. I&#x27;m actually surprised to find this little gem at such a good price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell from the picture, but this compact is very thick and bulky.  I could live with that if it was remotely usable. You can see in the seller&#x27;s photo that there is a lining of translucent plastic. See that little tab that sticks out?  That is what you have to hold onto to try to pry the inner container open to get to the powder. And I do mean PRY; in order to keep the powder sealed up, it&#x27;s a VERY tight fit.  You have to jam your finger under the tab, try to get a tight grip on smooth plastic, and yank on it repeatedly to open the compartment.  I already wrecked a nail struggling with it.  And how long do you suppose that thin little plastic tab is going to last before it breaks off, leaving me no way to open the compartment?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried just removing the inner liner, but in order to have that liner be able to snap tightly into place, there are holes cut completely through the compact, which means that the powder would just come pouring out, even if the lid makes a tight seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I checked out that more expensive brand&#x27;s compact, and it has the exact same liner with the little tab. If anyone can point me to a better-designed compact, please leave me a comment and let me know.</li>
            <li> This product worked perfectly with my powder! My powder is loose which means it&#x27;s gets everywhere, but because this comes in an outter case, it is perfect!</li>
            <li> Great and will come in handy !</li>
            <li> This worked just as well as the one from Bare Minerals and the price is much better. It seems to hold up better than the one I recieved with my Bare Minerals package.</li>
            <li> This is a handy little compact for DIY makeup. The brush is wider than it appears in the picture and is very soft, so that your powder doesn&#x27;t go everywhere and make a mess. I like the seperate brush compartment at the top too. Handy little essential.</li>
            <li> PERFECT accessory for mineral makeup users.  I LOVE this</li>
            <li> Nice container, hasn&#x27;t leaked out or spilled. This one will be for travel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok.  I bought a higher end one and it actually stays put.  This inner plastic liner is a tad loose and leaks powder.</li>
            <li> If you use mineral powder foundation, I recommend buying this compact for on the go. I love this. I use L&#x27;Or√©al brand and never took it with me in my purse, but thanks to this product I can.&lt;br /&gt;I love the brush that came with it.  It worked as good as the round one with my brand.&lt;br /&gt;I am not using the fabric case to reduce space. I think it is unnecessary. I have had no issues so far with leakage. I did not fill mine a whole lot as I was filling from a nearly empty regular jar. I also made sure that before I inserted the plastic shifter/brush holder the I wiped the edges where it would go.</li>
            <li> Perfect just what I wanted and very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Love the style, etc. but the hinge broke the very first time I opened it.  I sent feedback to the seller but heard nothing in return.  I&#x27;m still using it because the plastic inner part still keeps the powder contained but it&#x27;s not a quality item by any means.</li>
            <li> Pretty, nice size, and very handy.  Although I totally love the case for the compact, I would gladly pay the same price for just the compact alone.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase. Convenient, easy to use, and a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I had such a hard time finding something like this until I finally stumbled across this little gem. My mom and I have very pale complexions, and she always just used baby powder to powder her face but never had a good container to keep it in on the go. Now she does! It stays in this little compact pretty well but the additional zippered case prevents any chance of powder spillage through her things. The compact has a built in mirror and it conveniently comes with a little applicator brush that fits inside. I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
