            <li> I looked at other reviews before buying. I wanted to try something new.  The scent is a little to much for me, but my daughter liked it. I like softer and cleaner smells. If you like a sandalwood/musk in your cologne/lotion, this is a nice choice.</li>

            <li> About twenty years ago, I sampled ten or twelve fragrances in order to find one I didn&#x27;t have a negative reaction to.  RED by Giorgio was the winner.  Now I put some on my arms when I go to bed and enjoy that immensely while I&#x27;m reading myself to sleep.</li>

            <li> I have used this body lotion for about 15 years until about a year ago when I could not find it any more.&lt;br /&gt;Then about a month ago I thought I might could find it on Amazon.Com. And I did find it &amp; ordered four&lt;br /&gt;containers of it at a very good price. Now I have to order more for my sister who has also used it for years. SO THRILLED I found it. Thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> Nice scent and hard to find other than here</li>
