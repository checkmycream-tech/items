            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>and I fell in Love.</li>
            <li>But I love anything with vanilla : )</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t mind spritzing on some more</li>
            <li>This product is okay.</li>
            <li>I love this scent.  </li>
            <li>The sugar scent is matched with a light floral and &#x27;clean&#x27; smell, which makes for a nicely rounded, warm and inviting smell on the skin.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Warm &amp; Cozy&amp;#34; is the perfect name because that is just how it smells: warm and cozy.</li>
            <li>:) Overall great product for way cheaper than buying from the legit store.</li>
            <li>luv it not over strong smelling</li>
            <li>It is not too strong at all</li>
            <li>Now that she wears this new stuff, and I am always in a good mood when I am around her when she is wearing this stuff.</li>
            <li>It has a rich scent with an umph but without being too overpowering or strong.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>it was cheap</li>
            <li>Originally I smelled this on another lady when passing by, I asked her what that fragrance was that puts a man in the mood.</li>
            <li>The product shipped super fast and is a large amount of mist for a good price.</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t live near a mall and loved being able to purchase on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Just right!</li>
            <li>i recommened it too people who like sweet smells</li>
            <li>It is her absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>Shipping was free during Cyber Monday and it came fast and shipped with no problems!</li>
            <li>Good for young and old alike.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more from the PINK with a splash line soon, and I will surely buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li>I bought two in the store when they were available, and another online recently because it really has become my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic~ kind of like vanilla and brown sugar, but it&#x27;s not sickeningly sweet.</li>
            <li>I bought this from a third party on Amazaon and my 13 year old daughter loved it for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Would have scored it higher, but it reminds me of the whore I bought it for...</li>
            <li>It was shipped so FAST, too!</li>
            <li>but this is EXACTLY the one I wanted.</li>
            <li>Very soft, warm and lasting scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft without being overpowering and too sweet.  </li>
            <li>Well, I found it on Amazon, ordered three large bottles, and gave them to her for Christmas.</li>
            <li>It also lasts much longer than</li>
            <li>Warm &amp; Cozy is probably my favorite scent by Pink.</li>
            <li>I got this really fast too.</li>
            <li>its not in a square shape, its circular, its lasted me for a long time and it smells fantastic</li>
            <li>The scent tends to wear off, which I expected of a body mist, but I love this scent all the same.</li>
            <li>The bottle is very cute and is small enough to put in your purse or school bag.</li>
            <li>Wanted this for a very long time and finally got it love it would totally recommend this to everyone</li>
            <li>Even her 27 year old cousin said she was going to order some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The one I received does not smell nearly as strong or last as long as the one I had from the actual store.</li>
            <li>Its sweet and smells like cotton candy, but not overwhelmingly sweet.</li>
            <li>The bottle itself is all over sheer pink with a light pink lid.</li>
            <li>I was worried this would not be the same spray as in the store, but I was pleasantly surprised it was the same.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is not overpowering in scent like many of Victoria&#x27;s Secret sprays are.    </li>

            <li> This is not overpowering in scent like many of Victoria&#x27;s Secret sprays are.    </li>
            <li> She said that it was Victoria Secret&#x27;s Warm and Cozy.</li>
            <li> I bought this after running out of the one I previously purchased from a VS store, but I no longer live there and the drive to the closest one is an hour</li>
            <li> It came quickly and is the same quality  of those I&#x27;ve purchased in Victoria&#x27;s Secret stores.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time too!</li>
            <li> Larger than I expected!</li>
            <li> It doesnt smell wadm and cozy like it says,and doesnt smell as fantastic as the yellow one called \\&quot;vanilla dream on\\&quot; but Ill keep the product anyways.</li>
            <li> My daughter was devastated when she found out that Pink no longer sells this body mist.</li>
            <li> , I was a little scared it wouldn&#x27;t be the same because I&#x27;ve been jipped on products (from other sellers)</li>
            <li> IT DOESNT SMELL BAD, BUT IT IS NOT AS FANTASTIC</li>
            <li> I have gone through half of it like nothing.  </li>
            <li> The smell does wear off a little</li>
            <li> /&gt;Of course Amazon always stands behind their products from third party</li>
            <li> My cousin had a cookout a few weeks ago and she was wearing this perfume.</li>
            <li> Well, when she tried it, it made her smell like a big ball Cotton Candy, I was not impressed and not put in the mood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I usually buy the spun sugar vanilla one</li>
            <li> This one has a weird smell.  </li>

            <li> ITS PERFECT I LIKE SMELLING SO GOOD AND WHILE IM AT THE OFFICE MY COWORKERS ENVY ME.. LOL  TRY IT YOU WONT REGRET IT.</li>
            <li> This product was delivered in great condition and shipped very fast. I would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume very good and fast service thank you</li>
            <li> This is a great product and a great scent for anyone looking for a toasted sugar (cotton candy) scent that isn&#x27;t overpowered by alcohol like many mid-priced body sprays.    The sugar scent is matched with a light floral and &#x27;clean&#x27; smell, which makes for a nicely rounded, warm and inviting smell on the skin. This is not overpowering in scent like many of Victoria&#x27;s Secret sprays are.    I bought two in the store when they were available, and another online recently because it really has become my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> This smells so good.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> i always wear this during school and everyone loves how i smell and its cheap! also smells like roses :)</li>
            <li> I bought the item for a female friend.She said it is just what she wanted. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I was worried this would not be the same spray as in the store, but I was pleasantly surprised it was the same.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for over a year now and I get many compliments on it.  It also lasts much longer than a&lt;br /&gt;regular perfume would.  Very happy with my purchase and how quick I received it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Originally I smelled this on another lady when passing by, I asked her what that fragrance was that puts a man in the mood. She said that it was Victoria Secret&#x27;s Warm and Cozy. I had to get my GF this stuff for Christmas. Well, when she tried it, it made her smell like a big ball Cotton Candy, I was not impressed and not put in the mood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well her son, got her some [[ASIN:B009O0IJ4Q Charm]] and that was a better fragrance. Now that she wears this new stuff, and I am always in a good mood when I am around her when she is wearing this stuff.</li>
            <li> I bought this from a third party on Amazaon and my 13 year old daughter loved it for Christmas. There hasn&#x27;t been one person who didn&#x27;t say they liked the smell. Even her 27 year old cousin said she was going to order some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course Amazon always stands behind their products from third party so there is always no hesitation on my part to order anything. Shipping was free during Cyber Monday and it came fast and shipped with no problems!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this spray!!! I have been looking for the perfect body spray/perfume that smells like vanilla. It lasts a long time too!</li>
            <li> i think that this is good. its smells really good and flirty. i really love it. i recommened it too people who like sweet smells</li>

            <li> I just got this and OMG , I&#x27;m in love. I know I&#x27;ll be using this every day this winter. Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> This is a gorgeous scent!! The product shipped super fast and is a large amount of mist for a good price. The bottle itself is all over sheer pink with a light pink lid. The scent itself smells like brown sugar and fig but lighter. It has a rich scent with an umph but without being too overpowering or strong.</li>
            <li> Very soft, warm and lasting scent. Good for young and old alike. Not overpowering like perfumes can be. Just right!</li>
            <li> I purchases two of these for my granddaughters who were thrilled with the fragrance.  For the price this was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this scent.  It&#x27;s soft without being overpowering and too sweet.  We don&#x27;t live near a mall and loved being able to purchase on Amazon.</li>

            <li> luv it not over strong smelling</li>
            <li> Good price and smells great!  Its sweet and smells like cotton candy, but not overwhelmingly sweet.</li>
            <li> The scent tends to wear off, which I expected of a body mist, but I love this scent all the same. A very appropriate fall/winter smell.</li>
            <li> The fragrance of this body mist is quite lovely for a teenager. &amp;#34;Warm &amp; Cozy&amp;#34; is the perfect name because that is just how it smells: warm and cozy. My daughter was devastated when she found out that Pink no longer sells this body mist. It is her absolute favorite. Well, I found it on Amazon, ordered three large bottles, and gave them to her for Christmas. She was so ecstatic I thought she was going to cry! Thank you, Amazon, for helping to make my daughter so happy.</li>
            <li> Warm &amp; Cozy is probably my favorite scent by Pink. It came quickly and is the same quality  of those I&#x27;ve purchased in Victoria&#x27;s Secret stores.</li>
            <li> I love this body fragrance. It smells amazing even my husband and co workers say I smell good all the time. It last me at work all day (8hr. Shift) and it&#x27;s in a plastic bottle so u can carry it in ur purse without worrying about it breaking. Plus it&#x27;s cheap. Would totally recommend</li>
            <li> Good product, smells great. Would have scored it higher, but it reminds me of the whore I bought it for...</li>
            <li> Great!! Larger than I expected! It was shipped so FAST, too!</li>
            <li> IT DOESNT SMELL BAD, BUT IT IS NOT AS FANTASTIC AS EVERYONE MADE IT SEEMS, IT SMELLS LIKE YOUR REGULAR WALMART BODY SPRAYS. I&#x27;LL STICK TO BATH AND BODY WORKS.</li>
            <li> Chad bought the lotion from VS ,spray same fragrance,love it.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas present for my daughter.  She loved it.</li>
            <li> smells good get alot my gf likes it it was cheap and you get alot for the price you pay</li>
            <li> It does not smell that good.  I usually buy the spun sugar vanilla one and I LOVE that.  This one has a weird smell.  I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Got for my girlfriend for Christmas going to get another because she finished it already. Def get if looking for a gift.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend wears this stuff and it literally gives me the biggest hardon. Its myfavorite smell in the world now</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It smells fantastic~ kind of like vanilla and brown sugar, but it&#x27;s not sickeningly sweet. I think that this scent is perfect for the winter. The bottle is very cute and is small enough to put in your purse or school bag. The product came in the mail a couple days early (yay!) and was in perfect condition. I will be buying more from the PINK with a splash line soon, and I will surely buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> A friend let me try this and I fell in Love. Had to come here and buy my own!  \\&quot;Warm and cozy\\&quot; is the perfect name for it. Toasted vanilla/cotton candy trype sent. But I love anything with vanilla : ) I got this really fast too. Thank you!</li>
            <li> My cousin had a cookout a few weeks ago and she was wearing this perfume. I couldn&#x27;t resist ordering it, I was a little scared it wouldn&#x27;t be the same because I&#x27;ve been jipped on products (from other sellers) before but this is EXACTLY the one I wanted. It shipped the day I ordered (April 8th), and I just got it in today (April 12th). The smell does wear off a little but I don&#x27;t mind spritzing on some more, it smells delicious and my hubby loves it :)</li>
            <li> I bought this after running out of the one I previously purchased from a VS store, but I no longer live there and the drive to the closest one is an hour so I decided to find it online. The one I received does not smell nearly as strong or last as long as the one I had from the actual store.</li>
            <li> This product is okay. It doesnt smell wadm and cozy like it says,and doesnt smell as fantastic as the yellow one called \\&quot;vanilla dream on\\&quot; but Ill keep the product anyways.</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  I have gone through half of it like nothing.  I wish they made larger bottles of this!  I even bought the body cream ( that is almost gone...).  It smells like vanilla and cotton candy.  It is not too strong at all and I need to buy more to keep some in my car and purse!!!</li>
