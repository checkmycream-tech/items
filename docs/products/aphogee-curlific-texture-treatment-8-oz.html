            <li>Awesome product!!</li>
            <li>The best treatment I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>Great product... check it out</li>
            <li>wonderful love the way my hair feels after using this product</li>
            <li>Also, yeah, it works super great for my wash and gos and is the best detangler (I use my fingers to help preserve the curl definition and to minimize breakage) I&#x27;ve used in a while.</li>
            <li>Good.</li>
            <li>oh so good.</li>
            <li>Best light protein treatment I have tried, brings my 3c curls to life and has bonus slip.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been rainy here, which should be a good time to try it out.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It smells amazing.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t give and honest review..</li>
            <li>I actually liked this hair treatment.</li>
            <li>hair is soft, which is great!</li>
            <li>Truly wonderful product for my natural hair.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>The jar itself appears to hold more product that it does.</li>
            <li>Cholesterol might actually be better.</li>
            <li>Love this brand.</li>
            <li>This is great for natural hair!</li>
            <li>So far this is the best I&#x27;ve used for my curly damaged hair ;)</li>
            <li>Curlific seems to be more suitable for different hair types.</li>
            <li>Compared to Queen Helene&#x27;s Cholesterol, which is super cheap and still effective, this is probably about the same level of effectiveness.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad conditioner, but the results aren&#x27;t worth the mark up.</li>
            <li>Get your money&#x27;s worth by using a shower cap with some heat.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>Smell lovely, haven&#x27;t solely dedicated my hair to only using this product..</li>
            <li>I most definitely will continue to use.</li>
            <li>My first thought of this product is that it worked well on my hair.  </li>
            <li>This product did absolutely nothing for my hair except make it drier but that was easily remedied with a deep conditioner that does not contain protein.</li>
            <li>I purchased the whole curlific line and it&#x27;s worked wonders on my hair.</li>
            <li>So I gather you must use the whole line from shampoo, to this texture treatment, to the curl conditioner, to the leave in curl definer.</li>
            <li>curls are a little more defined</li>
            <li>when I try to skip steps, my hair doesn&#x27;t get the whole curl action.</li>
            <li>and my coils came right back.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not enough product, nor is it effective enough, to account for the high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to Shea Moisture, this is only 8oz where as Shea Moisture Deep Treatment Masque is 12 oz.</li>
            <li>The scent is a little strong but it smells</li>
            <li>This left my hair SO soft and my curls were very defined.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly 4a hair and this</li>
            <li>I am a natural about a 4a.....</li>
            <li>Gentle enough to use once a month.</li>
            <li>In terms of softness, it&#x27;s a step below Hydratherapie and far below it when it comes to fighting frizz.</li>
            <li>I give this product 3 out of 5 stars because it doesn&#x27;t really do what it claims to do (at least not on the first use).</li>
            <li>after hair dried, my hair felt strong and slightly moisturized.  </li>

            <li> When you use those products back to back, its totally curly and it doesn&#x27;t loose the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well -Left my dry brittle hair feeling silky with bouncy Curls</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once (last week) and it is as other reviewers state.  </li>
            <li> The major different between the two is that Shea Moisture may be a little heavy for people with thinner hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the price online is considerably higher than it is locally ($7.99).</li>
            <li> I didnt use it until it was empty</li>
            <li> Usually protein conditioners leave my hair brittle and dry...</li>
            <li> They need to heavy advertise these products.&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper at Sally&#x27;s Hair Supply Store.</li>
            <li> My usually tangled hair was a breeze to untangle.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for the past 2 months.</li>
            <li> It is a very thick and creamy conditioner, which I do like.</li>
            <li> Alas, my hair came out just as frizzy as it would with a run of the mill conditioner on a rainy day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shocking that after one minute my curls were transformed.</li>

            <li> After any type of color service or heat styling, this will bring your hair back to life. Get your money&#x27;s worth by using a shower cap with some heat. Add some coconut oil for extra moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After lightening then coloring my hair, I thought I lost my 4a curl pattern, until I used this and my coils came right back. I&#x27;d buy this in bulk if I could.</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing for my hair except make it drier but that was easily remedied with a deep conditioner that does not contain protein. I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> So far this is the best I&#x27;ve used for my curly damaged hair ;)</li>
            <li> Awesome product!! Put the treatment in my hair after shampooing and it melted away any tangles that I had. I have naturally curly 4a hair and this made detangling a cinch. I left it on for about 25 minutes with a plastic cap and then rinsed it out. This left my hair SO soft and my curls were very defined. I wish I would have known about this product sooner. Will definitely be adding this to my staple products!</li>
            <li> I love it! It is helping to bring back my curl pattern</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. It is now a holy grail also with their Leave in and Shampoo along with Jane Carter Nourish and Shine. Do not sleep on this my hair loves it..I am a natural about a 4a.....&lt;br /&gt;How come I did not know about this? They need to heavy advertise these products.&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper at Sally&#x27;s Hair Supply Store.</li>
            <li> Smell lovely, haven&#x27;t solely dedicated my hair to only using this product..so I can&#x27;t give and honest review..but when I finish washing my hair and use this product. .my curls are a little more defined</li>
            <li> This is great for natural hair!</li>
            <li> I actually liked this hair treatment. I didnt use it until it was empty but overall I did like it</li>
            <li> The best treatment I&#x27;ve ever used! So moisturizing and does wonders for my texture!</li>
            <li> I purchased the whole curlific line and it&#x27;s worked wonders on my hair. I feel as though when I try to skip steps, my hair doesn&#x27;t get the whole curl action. So I gather you must use the whole line from shampoo, to this texture treatment, to the curl conditioner, to the leave in curl definer. When you use those products back to back, its totally curly and it doesn&#x27;t loose the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!! Great product... check it out</li>
            <li> This. Smells. So. Good. I&#x27;ll open the jar just to smell it when I&#x27;m in the bathroom. I wish it was a perfume or cologne. Also, yeah, it works super great for my wash and gos and is the best detangler (I use my fingers to help preserve the curl definition and to minimize breakage) I&#x27;ve used in a while. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once (last week) and it is as other reviewers state.  My usually tangled hair was a breeze to untangle.  I most definitely will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at my local BSS for my 4c colored hair.  My first thought of this product is that it worked well on my hair.  The scent is a little strong but it smells oh so good. My hair felt stronger after rinsing this out after 10 min. I&#x27;ve noticed no shedding after rinsing out my colored hair. End result after hair dried, my hair felt strong and slightly moisturized.  I give this a 4 star rating because this was my initial review and once I continue to use it I would do another review!</li>
            <li> wonderful love the way my hair feels after using this product</li>
            <li> Best light protein treatment I have tried, brings my 3c curls to life and has bonus slip. Shocking that after one minute my curls were transformed. Usually protein conditioners leave my hair brittle and dry...not this one. Gentle enough to use once a month. Smells like cologne but I can tolerate that. Definitely a staple for me.</li>
            <li> Works Well -Left my dry brittle hair feeling silky with bouncy Curls</li>
            <li> I give this product 3 out of 5 stars because it doesn&#x27;t really do what it claims to do (at least not on the first use). I will amend my review after continued use. If there&#x27;s no difference after awhile, I would put this product at a 2 out 5. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my curls nor in the amount of frizz in my hair. It&#x27;s been rainy here, which should be a good time to try it out. Alas, my hair came out just as frizzy as it would with a run of the mill conditioner on a rainy day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is soft, which is great! Unfortunately, the price online is considerably higher than it is locally ($7.99). As such, it&#x27;s not something that I would try at $14.99. In terms of softness, it&#x27;s a step below Hydratherapie and far below it when it comes to fighting frizz. It&#x27;s not a bad conditioner, but the results aren&#x27;t worth the mark up. As well, I have a lot of hair. The jar itself appears to hold more product that it does. It&#x27;s just not enough product, nor is it effective enough, to account for the high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to Shea Moisture, this is only 8oz where as Shea Moisture Deep Treatment Masque is 12 oz. The major different between the two is that Shea Moisture may be a little heavy for people with thinner hair. Curlific seems to be more suitable for different hair types. It is a very thick and creamy conditioner, which I do like. I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price. Compared to Queen Helene&#x27;s Cholesterol, which is super cheap and still effective, this is probably about the same level of effectiveness. Cholesterol might actually be better.</li>
            <li> Truly wonderful product for my natural hair.  It smells amazing.  I never let it run out.</li>
            <li> Love this brand. Bought all the products</li>
            <li> Did not work for my hair</li>
            <li> Like all the Aphogee products.  This lived up to my expectations</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the past 2 months. I LOVEEE it. I see a difference in my curls and I will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
