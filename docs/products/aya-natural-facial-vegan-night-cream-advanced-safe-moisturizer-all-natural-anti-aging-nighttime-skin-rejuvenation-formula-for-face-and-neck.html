            <li>My skins on the dry side so its perfect!</li>
            <li>This goes on easily and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>Live love love!</li>
            <li>But I also wanted a night cram that helped my fine lines and redness that lupus causes my skin.</li>
            <li>The cream has a soft minty scent that is pleasant to inhale as you are dozing off into a restful sleep.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and has a glow to it.  </li>

            <li>I highly recommend this product and give it 5 stars all the way!!!!</li>
            <li>Your cream is light but rich in feel on the face.</li>
            <li>As a person with allergies, I usually cannot tolerate scented products, but the light scent of this cream is very pleasant.</li>
            <li>I generally like to give a product several weeks before I review, but I am so impressed that I wanted to leave feedback</li>
            <li>But I think that doesn&#x27;t really matter, because it makes my skin FEEL better.</li>
            <li>When I put it on it gives my skin a cool feeling.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li>I used it right before bed, make sure to wash your face first.  </li>
            <li>Seems to absorb quickly into my skin.</li>
            <li>I love how it is vegan natural and environmental friendly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the second Aya product I have tried and I have fallen in love with the brand!  </li>
            <li>The scent is a bit strong at first, however by the time you are ready for bed</li>
            <li>i use it right before bed and wake up to my skin feeling so fresh and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>I have noticed how smooth even my hands have gotten, my face is so soft now.  </li>
            <li>The rest of my skin is soft, smooth, and supple.</li>
            <li>This is one of the first I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and leaves my older skin softer and smoother.</li>
            <li>Really made a difference in just a week!</li>
            <li>it have your face clean soft  </li>
            <li>It was also fairly easy to open.</li>
            <li>Also, it has a really calming smell of lavender that is quite pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really like it and</li>
            <li>fast delivery 5 stars all the wayâ€¦</li>
            <li>I have allergies and have to really pay attention to the ingredients of what I put on my skin.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell.</li>
            <li>I really like this night cream.  </li>
            <li>I also have to say it came very well packaged and</li>
            <li>I was really wondering if this would make a difference</li>
            <li>Really moisturizing but not greasy.</li>
            <li>I really like the product...</li>
            <li>maybe not the smell so much</li>
            <li>love the fact that there are no parabens or alcohol in this, as my skin does tend to be sensitive, especially when I change brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it really leaves your skin really soft and unlike a lot of other products like this the smell is light and clean smelling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting older and really need to work a night cream into my routine.</li>
            <li>, Remember what you put on your face seeps into your skin and body so it is very important to use products that you know are safe and free of bad chemicals.</li>
            <li>Personally I find that this cream is easily absorbed into my skin, and does not go on greasy like many other moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>You will soon see results of better looking skin with less wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Just by reading the ingredients you can tell that this product is a high end product.  </li>
            <li>I am so relieved to have found something that not only heals, but has such a beautifying influence on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus is that you don&#x27;t need a huge glob of this product to cover your face.</li>
            <li>as someone with sensitive skin its important for me to be careful about what i put on it.</li>
            <li>I have lupus so my skin is very sensitive to the sun and chemicals.</li>
            <li>that is natural and has Jojoba Oil and Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li>Nothing I&#x27;ve used, externally or internally, has had much of an effect on it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made from all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>There are no harsh chemicals in it.  </li>
            <li>It smells natural and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I apply this every night before bed, and wake up to a soft face.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels baby soft in the morning.</li>
            <li>I like that its all natural and vegan</li>
            <li>This product has all natural ingredients that I can read and know what they are./</li>
            <li>Today, the flakes are almost entirely gone and the redness has abated considerably.</li>
            <li>Works great to combat how dry my skin tends to get during the cold fall</li>
            <li>I love the softness it has left me with ..not a heavy greasy feeling that other cream before have left.</li>
            <li>I am very picky about night creams due to the fact that I have dry skin and live in a very dry climate.  </li>
            <li>I used Weleda Skin Food, olive oil, castor oil, moisturizers, triple antibiotic cream, Desitin, and a host of other things in an attempt to get my skin back to normal.</li>
            <li>I do find that when you put too much, it becomes a little too oily.</li>

            <li> I do find that when you put too much, it becomes a little too oily.</li>
            <li> this has soothed and reduced my dry red patches almost completely in a very short amount of time.</li>
            <li> My face is so soft, with less wrinkles and the same for my neck!  </li>
            <li> theres no greasy residue left behind and it starts absorbing instantly.</li>
            <li> A little really does go a long way so rub little at a time.</li>
            <li> dry skin in a dry climate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference when it comes to dark spot reduction.</li>
            <li> I only gave it four stars because sometimes I have to use it in the morning as well because my skin is still just a little dry and tight, but again...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping as other reviews have stated that the brown spots on my face will fade.</li>
            <li> I use it every night and already noticed the reduction of dark spots!</li>
            <li> It feels a little heavy, which I like, but absorbs well.  </li>
            <li> It is a quality cream that does not include any of those harsh ingredients you can&#x27;t pronounce to save your life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use a lot, you just dab a little around your face and neck and then rub it in!  </li>
            <li> even the gentlest cleansers and creams have irritated and broken out my face and skin.</li>
            <li> and I was so desperate for an anti-aging product that would work on my eyes, face, and neck...</li>
            <li> so i am not worried of any bad chemicals from plastics soaking in the lotion.</li>

            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now.  Every evening I wash my face and apply the AYA night cream.  I have noticed how smooth even my hands have gotten, my face is so soft now.  Even my partner has noticed the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love that my face does not feel greasy. Seems to absorb quickly into my skin. My pillow doesn&#x27;t get the greasy feeling either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love that is natural and has Jojoba Oil and Shea Butter.  It has a pleasant lavender smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second Aya product I have tried and I have fallen in love with the brand!  Would recommend!</li>
            <li> Packaging came nice and wrapped. It was also fairly easy to open. The bottle of the cream is glass so i am not worried of any bad chemicals from plastics soaking in the lotion. Moisturizes face, good night cream. My skins on the dry side so its perfect! I do find that when you put too much, it becomes a little too oily. A little really does go a long way so rub little at a time. When i wake up in the mornings, my skin feels hydrated and moist. I give it a 8/10~ and yes i would recommend this product to family and friends (not oily skin though).</li>
            <li> I just received this night cream the day before yesterday. I generally like to give a product several weeks before I review, but I am so impressed that I wanted to leave feedback now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been suffering from a mysterious rash under my mouth for over two months now. It&#x27;s been red and flakey. Nothing I&#x27;ve used, externally or internally, has had much of an effect on it. I used Weleda Skin Food, olive oil, castor oil, moisturizers, triple antibiotic cream, Desitin, and a host of other things in an attempt to get my skin back to normal. Nothing helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to yesterday. I opened this up and lavishly applied it to my entire face, taking care to cover my rash area in hopes of alleviating the flakes. Today, the flakes are almost entirely gone and the redness has abated considerably. The rest of my skin is soft, smooth, and supple. I am so relieved to have found something that not only heals, but has such a beautifying influence on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus is that you don&#x27;t need a huge glob of this product to cover your face. Just a moderate dollop should do. Also, it has a really calming smell of lavender that is quite pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is wonderful stuff. I am so pleased that I took a chance on it.</li>
            <li> really like it and fast delivery 5 stars all the wayâ€¦great product  I ail continue to be a customer and tell my friends</li>
            <li> I have allergies and have to really pay attention to the ingredients of what I put on my skin. I&#x27;m getting older and really need to work a night cream into my routine. This is one of the first I&#x27;ve tried. The scent is a bit strong at first, however by the time you are ready for bed it&#x27;s not noticeable. I really like the smell. My husband isn&#x27;t a fan. However putting it on about 20 min before bed seems to keep us both happy.</li>
            <li> Your cream is light but rich in feel on the face. The scent is nice and clean. Absorbs quickly and leaves my older skin softer and smoother. Will definitely reorder!</li>
            <li> This stuff just feels wonderful going on, and it isn&#x27;t oily or sticky at all. As a person with allergies, I usually cannot tolerate scented products, but the light scent of this cream is very pleasant. I&#x27;ve been using it only a couple of weeks, so cannot say whether it is actually anti-aging. But I think that doesn&#x27;t really matter, because it makes my skin FEEL better. And it makes my mood better somehow, so maybe then I will look better. When I put it on, I feel like I am luxuriating.</li>
            <li> I tried this over night cream last night. You would not believe how smooth my skin is this morning! It also has a more healthy glow. It smells great and has a silky texture. I would recommend this product.I used it right before bed, make sure to wash your face first.  I can&#x27;t wait to see how good my long term results will be  :) Happy customer!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best night creme&#x27;s I have used.  It&#x27;s made from all natural ingredients.  There are no harsh chemicals in it.  I love the smell.  It smells natural and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for several days now and I can see a difference in my skin already.  It&#x27;s smooth and has a glow to it.  When I put it on it gives my skin a cool feeling.  Then you can feel it tighten just a bit.  You can tell it starts to work as soon as you put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has so many good essential oils in it.  Just by reading the ingredients you can tell that this product is a high end product.  The results from using it you can tell and you aren&#x27;t spending hundreds of dollars to get the results you want.</li>
            <li> I am delighted with the AYA products that I have purchased - will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about night creams due to the fact that I have dry skin and live in a very dry climate.  I really like this night cream.  It feels a little heavy, which I like, but absorbs well.  I like the smell.  I only gave it four stars because sometimes I have to use it in the morning as well because my skin is still just a little dry and tight, but again... dry skin in a dry climate.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this night cream! I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference when it comes to dark spot reduction. I love the soothing scent and the softness I feel every morning when I wake up! Simply amazing!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the way it smells.</li>
            <li> I love it. It smells so good. No greasy at all. It softs my skin. Great product! :)</li>
            <li> What I love about this product is that it is made of all natural ingredients, it has a light scent of lavender but its not overpowering and we all know that lavender is great for relaxation which is perfect for a night cream. It leaves your skin feeling fresh and smooth. I also have to say it came very well packaged and its in a nice luxurious looking jar. I recieved this free product for review purposes but these are my honest and true opinions.</li>
            <li> Really made a difference in just a week! I was really wondering if this would make a difference and it did! I was so happy to see it make a difference!</li>
            <li> as someone with sensitive skin its important for me to be careful about what i put on it. even the gentlest cleansers and creams have irritated and broken out my face and skin. ive been searching for something to help keep my skin nourished and also fights and prevents signs of again and this has been an amazing cream. i use it right before bed and wake up to my skin feeling so fresh and rejuvenated. it really leaves your skin really soft and unlike a lot of other products like this the smell is light and clean smelling. theres no greasy residue left behind and it starts absorbing instantly. this has soothed and reduced my dry red patches almost completely in a very short amount of time. i am so pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I just turn 50 and lost a lot of weight and I was so desperate for an anti-aging product that would work on my eyes, face, and neck...Well I found it!  My face is so soft, with less wrinkles and the same for my neck!  You don&#x27;t have to use a lot, you just dab a little around your face and neck and then rub it in!  You will soon see results of better looking skin with less wrinkles. You face will glow and you will not look your age!  I so love this product and I HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE AT ANY AGE!!!!!</li>
            <li> Really moisturizing but not greasy. And I have heard that it reduces aging spots for which I would be grateful.</li>
            <li> This product is a scam.  Money making</li>
            <li> this night cream is very good  it have your face clean soft  i will have to buy some more .</li>
            <li> This product feels and smells wonderful, like the way I look in the morning!</li>
            <li> Aya Night Cream is an essential in my skin regimen.  It is a quality cream that does not include any of those harsh ingredients you can&#x27;t pronounce to save your life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this facial moisturizer there are essential oils and nutrients that make your skin thrive and glow.  The cream has a soft minty scent that is pleasant to inhale as you are dozing off into a restful sleep.  Personally I find that this cream is easily absorbed into my skin, and does not go on greasy like many other moisturizers.  It does not cause my face to break out, or leave my skin feeling oily.  I apply this every night before bed, and wake up to a soft face.  I have noticed that my pores are beginning to shrink.  Works great to combat how dry my skin tends to get during the cold fall months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that there are no parabens or alcohol in this, as my skin does tend to be sensitive, especially when I change brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Received sample for testing.</li>
            <li> Great product. My skin feels baby soft in the morning. This goes on easily and non-greasy. Live love love!</li>
            <li> I really like the product...maybe not the smell so much but it works really great.  I like that its all natural and vegan so I know what I&#x27;m putting on my face.  I&#x27;m hoping as other reviews have stated that the brown spots on my face will fade. Will give an update soon!  I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I have lupus so my skin is very sensitive to the sun and chemicals. I was advised to use products that are vegan and all natural...not filled with chemicals. But I also wanted a night cram that helped my fine lines and redness that lupus causes my skin. I researched and heard great things about this night cream so I was happy with my purchase. I love the softness it has left me with ..not a heavy greasy feeling that other cream before have left. I love the light scent and the best part is I love that I know what  I am putting on my face, Remember what you put on your face seeps into your skin and body so it is very important to use products that you know are safe and free of bad chemicals. This product has all natural ingredients that I can read and know what they are./ So that make me very happy with using this great product.</li>
