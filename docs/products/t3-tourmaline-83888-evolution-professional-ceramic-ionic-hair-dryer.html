            <li>But the best thing is that it does not cause frizz  </li>
            <li>I bought this dryer in 2007 and I still have it and it works beautifully!</li>
            <li>- \\&quot;i did the best i could...</li>
            <li>i want to touch it\\&quot; that i do believe that i found my perfect combination.</li>
            <li>either which is awesome.</li>
            <li>We bought the T3 after seeing a morning news program in which a guest boasted of the wonderful performance.  </li>
            <li>This seems like a lot of money for a hair dryer, but my daughter is very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>this blow dryer is awesome . .</li>
            <li>My hair feels healthier and has a beautiful shine.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>and I would always go home with the great salon feeling hair.  </li>
            <li>I would LOVe to drop this step, so I am going to see if I can perfect my drying methods...</li>
            <li>My inexpensive ionic blow-dryer seemed to work well at the beginning but stopped looking good after a while.  </li>
            <li>I wouldnt say that its the 8th wonder of the world, but its a good dryer...</li>
            <li>good purchase, good seller.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer!  </li>
            <li>If you battle with your hair the way I did, you&#x27;re gonna love it!</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I purchased from places with good return policy.</li>
            <li>but it is a nice product with some nice features.</li>
            <li>but this T3 is by far the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The t3 feels well made, a strong blower and nice heat controls, but to be honest, no one has the sense that the Tourmaline leads to significant time savings or more managable hair.  </li>
            <li>the product is not purchased from an authorized dealer, they cannot guarantee that the product is authentic or warrant the product against defects, inadequate build quality and/or improper performance.\\</li>
            <li>Put velcro curlers on the top part of my hair to add volume.</li>
            <li>NOW it is so much better.</li>
            <li>most hair dryers.  </li>
            <li>I love my T3-</li>
            <li>and i still love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard so many compliments about the hair that looks like \\&quot;</li>
            <li>This dryer dries my quicker than others, and I felt that my hair is in better condition since using this dryer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m OK for 10 minutes use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not 60% faster - more like 20-30%,</li>
            <li>and the best unique feature to extend life is a panel that lifts off the back, allowing for easy cleaning of dust that accumulates in any dryer.  </li>
            <li>He told me the best money spent would be on the T3 Evolution</li>
            <li>Order was easy, delivery was on time, and product is as advertised..</li>
            <li>No pull ups; just easy tangling.</li>
            <li>She has fine hair and loves that it helps add volume to her hair without damaging it.</li>
            <li>And my hair feels silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>I filled out the registration paperwork and submitted it.  </li>
            <li>Your hair dries smooth.  </li>
            <li>It is light weight but has plenty of power.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light  3.</li>
            <li>Hair is silky and smooth</li>
            <li>brushes, I like vent brush as it is very useful while drying.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a small investment for great hair!</li>
            <li>And the comments about the on/off swtith are true</li>
            <li>They look perfect now for at least 3 days ( then i wash them).    </li>
            <li>Revlon is too loud, Conair is fine (much better than Revlon), and BaByliss is just for travel (no cold shot).</li>
            <li>Revlon is too loud, Conair is fine (much better than Revlon), and BaByliss is just for travel (no cold shot).</li>
            <li>may be good for the long run.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>You can get scratches easily if you&#x27;re pressing too much.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>liked that the hairdryer was quiet.  </li>
            <li>I dont think its worth what is being charged.</li>
            <li>I guess the right  combination of hair care and hair dryer will do the trick.</li>
            <li>Right now, I am using Redken</li>
            <li>I received this product for a Christmas gift and used it right away...</li>
            <li>All my previous dryers definately dont do as good of a job as this one.  </li>
            <li>More then 3 times what I last paid for a hair dryer, I was skeptical at best.</li>
            <li>This blow dryer is so light weight, it surprised me when I pulled it out of the box.  </li>
            <li>Well, I have to say that so far I am in like with this product, but I am hoping that as soon as I learn how to use it a little better, I will be in love.  </li>
            <li>Just be sure to use leave-in conditioner (mixed a few drops of jojoba/olive/tea tree/whatever oil available) or serums without alcohol to prevent the heat.with extended warranty if available.    </li>
            <li>One thing I would change : The T3 hair straightener came with a nice black velvet case.</li>
            <li>My hair does feel noticeably healthier/softer/fuller than when I use a regular hair dryer, which is huge.     </li>
            <li>I do really have control over styling my layers.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care about the worranty as i wouldn&#x27;t buy a hair dryer for $300 thinking \\&quot;warranty\\&quot; either.</li>
            <li>It surely is noisy in high speed but not as loud as regular dryers or dryers from gyms and hotels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The 1st time i used the hairdryer and the next minute i called my friend all excited with WOWs.</li>
            <li>Some pros from fashion magazines suggest that using low speed with medium heat is good for less frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>Some pros from fashion magazines suggest that using low speed with medium heat is good for less frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>Then why do we have such beautiful hair after salon and after the 1st wash and dry we loose</li>
            <li>Just be sure to use leave-in conditioner (mixed a few drops of jojoba/olive/tea tree/whatever oil available) or serums without alcohol to prevent the heat.</li>
            <li>The hair dryer does indeed dry my hair a lot faster, but it gets VERY HOT!</li>
            <li>So far, no other tourmaline dryers can beat T3 so maybe worth the price.</li>
            <li>So far, no other tourmaline dryers can beat T3 so maybe worth the price.</li>
            <li>whatever it is, it doesn&#x27;t carry the 4-year warranty you would normally get.</li>
            <li>diffuser, I don&#x27;t use it as I have shoulder length normal</li>
            <li>Since its on the handle right where I hold it while blow drying, I tend to inadvertantly shut it off on a fairly regular basis.  </li>
            <li>A new result for me anyway.  </li>
            <li>, so i bet this one will live longer than it&#x27;s warranty time.</li>
            <li>I can afford it and it does make my hair feel better, so I BARELY say yes, but if I was tight on money, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying it.  </li>
            <li>For the money, I&#x27;d buy a good, but less expensive model - I&#x27;m confident that the difference in the quality of the blowout would be barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>No more frizzed out hair that never really looked that good.</li>
            <li>I have very wavy/spiral curly hair and like to dry it straight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much lighter than my last dryer too.  </li>
            <li>I was quite surprised that this product lived up to its hype.  </li>
            <li>My advise - don&#x27;t even bother, if you are not going to use it in a busy salon.    </li>
            <li>*natural* wavy</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: I have frizzy hair after drying with this dryer and it is still loud at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>but I&#x27;m a busy girl</li>
            <li>I am typically a frugal shopper; unless it&#x27;s a need I don&#x27;t typically spend this kind of money on these kinds of things.</li>
            <li>result).&lt;br /&gt;2) Not too hot as I use low or medium heat only.</li>
            <li>For me, just 5 minutes with high speed and low heat (frizzy) or 10 min.</li>
            <li>Feel lucky that i haven&#x27;t spent extra money on buying it for $300 but with warranty.</li>
            <li>I really think it makes a difference in time to dry my hair as well as making it look shinier.</li>
            <li>i use mid heat and high setting to dry my hair</li>

            <li> i use mid heat and high setting to dry my hair</li>
            <li> It takes only about 20 minutes (max) to blow dry my hair using round ceramic/ionic hair brush, no breaks necessary because I don&#x27;t get nearly as hot</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only slightly less noisy than normal hair dryers.    </li>
            <li> untill it&#x27;s little wet, then i use the hot and low setting to style.  </li>
            <li> With my old Revlon dryer i didn&#x27;t have the results i have as well as i don&#x27;t have with other hair care products and this dryer.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it get TOO hot</li>
            <li> Flat iron hair 4.</li>
            <li> in fact if you hold it too long next to your scalp - you can prob burn yourself.  </li>
            <li> There is a slight learning curve to figure out what temp/speed/amount of hair products work for your hair but after that it looks like a professional hairdo.</li>
            <li> The T3 straightens my hair and leaves it incredibly soft and silky and in less time that it used to take.</li>
            <li> I wouldnt say there was an enormous difference in the time it takes to blow dry my hair, but I will admit it did improve the timing.  </li>
            <li> BUT if you have short, straight, thin hair I don&#x27;t know if you necessarily need this blow-dryer.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, if you are like me--thick, long hair this is a MUST.</li>
            <li> I chose Evolution over regular T3 dryer due to more heat settings; this dryer has 3 heat settings and 2 speeds as well as a cold shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Great product. I really think it makes a difference in time to dry my hair as well as making it look shinier. One thing I would change : The T3 hair straightener came with a nice black velvet case. I expected that this very expensive dryer would also have a case</li>
            <li> I love this dryer!  I have long, thick, wavy hair and have always dreaded drying it.  But not anymore.  This hairdryer has cut the dry time in half.  And my hair feels silky and smooth. It&#x27;s much lighter than my last dryer too.  Well worth the price.  If you battle with your hair the way I did, you&#x27;re gonna love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this hairdryer December 21 from amazon.  I filled out the registration paperwork and submitted it.  I got an e-mail from T3 telling me that Amazon.com is not an authorized dealer and that I should return the item immediately and refute the charge with my credit card company.  \\&quot;If the product is not purchased from an authorized dealer, they cannot guarantee that the product is authentic or warrant the product against defects, inadequate build quality and/or improper performance.\\&quot;  So for $160, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m getting a knock-off or what I&#x27;m getting--but whatever it is, it doesn&#x27;t carry the 4-year warranty you would normally get. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Amazon never allowed me to give seller feedback on this product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I liked that the hairdryer was quiet.  Maybe it dried my hair a little faster?  Maybe my hair was a little smoother??  I definitely didn&#x27;t like the location of the switches on the handle. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bottom line--buyer beware!</li>
            <li> I am typically a frugal shopper; unless it&#x27;s a need I don&#x27;t typically spend this kind of money on these kinds of things. But I got to the point where I was desperate!! I have thick, wavy/semi curly medium length hair. My inexpensive ionic blow-dryer seemed to work well at the beginning but stopped looking good after a while.  &lt;br /&gt;My usual process is 1. Apply liberal amount of several hair products 2. Blow dry hair (with an inexpensive ionic blow-dryer) using a round ceramic/ionic hair brush--this process usually takes about 35-40 minutes. I often have to take breaks during this process because I get really hot and my arm gets tired. 3. Flat iron hair 4. Put velcro curlers on the top part of my hair to add volume. It got to the point where I dreaded maintaining my hair.  &lt;br /&gt;BUT NOW it is so much better. It takes only about 20 minutes (max) to blow dry my hair using round ceramic/ionic hair brush, no breaks necessary because I don&#x27;t get nearly as hot and my arm doesn&#x27;t get tired! I only need to apply a very very small amount of product, NO more flat ironing or velcro rollers are needed! There is a slight learning curve to figure out what temp/speed/amount of hair products work for your hair but after that it looks like a professional hairdo. No more frizzed out hair that never really looked that good. BUT if you have short, straight, thin hair I don&#x27;t know if you necessarily need this blow-dryer. HOWEVER, if you are like me--thick, long hair this is a MUST. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised that this product lived up to its hype.  More then 3 times what I last paid for a hair dryer, I was skeptical at best. &lt;br /&gt;While still expensive in my opinion, it does dry hair faster, amount will depend on your hair.  But the best thing is that it does not cause frizz  &lt;br /&gt;like most hair dryers.  Your hair dries smooth.  A new result for me anyway.  So I am a believer.</li>
            <li> I purchased my hair dryer on amazon - so the warranty registration part can go out the window.  #2) The hair dryer does indeed dry my hair a lot faster, but it gets VERY HOT! in fact if you hold it too long next to your scalp - you can prob burn yourself.  The motor inside makes a weird noise after you turn it off - not sure if thats the way its supposed to be or its a malfunction.  Is my hair still frizzy? - a little bit....does my hair get dryed a lot faster?  - definately!!! I wouldnt say that its the 8th wonder of the world, but its a good dryer...All my previous dryers definately dont do as good of a job as this one.  And the comments about the on/off swtith are true - i do have a tendancy to press the button when I&#x27;m straightaning my hair - although i dont know if thats a reason not to try it.  My only complaint is that it get TOO hot &amp; you can burn yourself SERIOUSLY!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer in 2007 and I still have it and it works beautifully! I can straighten my hair with it with no issues.</li>
            <li> I love my T3- my stylist at my salon uses it and I would always go home with the great salon feeling hair.  He told me the best money spent would be on the T3 Evolution and I could have that same feel at home.  It seems like a lot of money, but if you invest in monthly hair color- this hair dryer closes the hair cuticle and gives you less fade.  It&#x27;s a small investment for great hair!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter. She has fine hair and loves that it helps add volume to her hair without damaging it. It is light weight but has plenty of power.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this hair dryer for about a month and i can&#x27;t tell you about reliablity, but i defenetly can tell you about it&#x27;s perfomance.    I used to hate to wash my hair just because that meant that i had to spend unpredictable amount of time and come up with unpredictable results - \\&quot;i did the best i could...so... it&#x27;s not my fouhlt, it&#x27;s my hair\\&quot;. Then why do we have such beautiful hair after salon and after the 1st wash and dry we loose all that beauty?     i use salon hair care products only and i just couldn&#x27;t fifure it out. The 1st time i used the hairdryer and the next minute i called my friend all excited with WOWs. I do really have control over styling my layers. They look perfect now for at least 3 days ( then i wash them).    Here what i like about it:    1. it&#x27;s quiet.  2. It&#x27;s light  3. it doesn&#x27;t blow your hair away though give your hair volume and shape you want, as i mentioned - total control.  4.Drying time is defenetly shorter - i use mid heat and high setting to dry my hair untill it&#x27;s little wet, then i use the hot and low setting to style.  5. Hair is silky and smooth ( i usually get similar result with my ionic flat iron)  6. Though it retailed $300 i got it for $160. I don&#x27;t really care about the worranty as i wouldn&#x27;t buy a hair dryer for $300 thinking \\&quot;warranty\\&quot; either. My $20 dryer warked for 4 years and still works, so i bet this one will live longer than it&#x27;s warranty time. My advise - don&#x27;t even bother, if you are not going to use it in a busy salon.    What i don&#x27;t like:    The placement of buttons - they are on the handle and while using it i turn it off sometimes or change the setting by accident.    Bottom line: Though there is a little detail i don&#x27;t like i&#x27;d still rate it 5 stars, because if not the buttons, i would give it 5+. go for it, if you don&#x27;t care about the warranty.      Update: It&#x27;s been almost a year since i have and i still love it. Never had a single problem with it. I got used to the buttons and it&#x27;s not an issue to meat all. Feel lucky that i haven&#x27;t spent extra money on buying it for $300 but with warranty. Still think that i would buy  it again if i had to.     I&#x27;ve just read that it not \\&quot;frizz free\\&quot; as advertised. I use Matrix Sleek Look. With my old Revlon dryer i didn&#x27;t have the results i have as well as i don&#x27;t have with other hair care products and this dryer. I guess the right  combination of hair care and hair dryer will do the trick. I&#x27;ve heard so many compliments about the hair that looks like \\&quot; i want to touch it\\&quot; that i do believe that i found my perfect combination. Treat yourselves ,ladies, and get it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered as expected, although box in which product was located had already been opened.  So far, product is functioning as expected.  Order was easy, delivery was on time, and product is as advertised..good purchase, good seller.</li>
            <li> This dryer dries my quicker than others, and I felt that my hair is in better condition since using this dryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a number of different brand blowdryers over the years but this T3 is by far the best I have ever used. I have very wavy/spiral curly hair and like to dry it straight. The T3 straightens my hair and leaves it incredibly soft and silky and in less time that it used to take. My hair feels healthier and has a beautiful shine. I don&#x27;t have dry ends anymore either which is awesome.</li>
            <li> I have used this dryer since Jan. &#x27;06 except I skipped dryer sometimes. I chose Evolution over regular T3 dryer due to more heat settings; this dryer has 3 heat settings and 2 speeds as well as a cold shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what I find out:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) A little faster drying time. I don&#x27;t think 60% as advertised. Just around 10 to 25%, depend on amount of hair you have and how long you keep your hair dry before blow drying. For me, just 5 minutes with high speed and low heat (frizzy) or 10 min. with low speed and medium heat (less frizzy &amp; smoother result).&lt;br /&gt;2) Not too hot as I use low or medium heat only. I don&#x27;t like hot.&lt;br /&gt;3) Has tourmaline.... may be good for the long run.&lt;br /&gt;4) 4 years warranty (My seller honors their own 48 months warranty).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) Way too much EXPENSIVE, of course, you know this.&lt;br /&gt;2) Not \\&quot;frizzy free\\&quot; as advertised. I still have frizzy, at least for the half day in Washington, DC.&lt;br /&gt;3) Not \\&quot;shiny\\&quot; by this dryer alone. You&#x27;ll need to use leave-in conditioner. Right now, I am using Redken smooth down heat glide (expensive and greasy the next day) and VO5 Miracle mist (cheaper alternative and non-greasy, alcohol free).&lt;br /&gt;4) It has average weight (13.5 oz). I&#x27;m OK for 10 minutes use.&lt;br /&gt;5) It is not quiet as advertised. It surely is noisy in high speed but not as loud as regular dryers or dryers from gyms and hotels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For diffuser, I don&#x27;t use it as I have shoulder length normal *natural* wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For brushes, I like vent brush as it is very useful while drying. No pull ups; just easy tangling. Note: I already apply leave in conditioner and/or serum. The medium and small round brushes are too sharp for my scalp but they don&#x27;t pull hair. You can get scratches easily if you&#x27;re pressing too much. I like boar brittle ceramic brushes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For combs: I purchased a set (6 different sizes and styles in a case). They&#x27;re fragile; I have to keep them in its case all the time. If you have very thick curly hair or Afro, don&#x27;t buy these. Or purchase with extended warranty if available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I have frizzy hair after drying with this dryer and it is still loud at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: Check serial number (from the actual dryer) before your purchase for warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/6/06: I also tried Revlon Tourmaline and Conair Tourmaline (Red 174T), and BaByliss Pro Tourmaline travel size (Red) dryers. Revlon is too loud, Conair is fine (much better than Revlon), and BaByliss is just for travel (no cold shot). Both Revlon and Conair make my hair very dry and dull. I&#x27;m glad that I purchased from places with good return policy. So far, no other tourmaline dryers can beat T3 so maybe worth the price. I never get dry or dull hair with this Evolution. Some pros from fashion magazines suggest that using low speed with medium heat is good for less frizzy hair. Just be sure to use leave-in conditioner (mixed a few drops of jojoba/olive/tea tree/whatever oil available) or serums without alcohol to prevent the heat.with extended warranty if available.

            <li> This blow dryer is so light weight, it surprised me when I pulled it out of the box.  I wouldnt say there was an enormous difference in the time it takes to blow dry my hair, but I will admit it did improve the timing.  The only complaint I have is the location of the on/off switch.  Since its on the handle right where I hold it while blow drying, I tend to inadvertantly shut it off on a fairly regular basis.  Oh yeah, the other complaint is the cost.  I dont think its worth what is being charged.</li>
            <li> Overall, I do like this hair dryer, but there is definitely a down side to this product. To break it down, the positives are:  1) It does dry my hair faster.  Not 60% faster - more like 20-30%, but I&#x27;m a busy girl and I&#x27;ll take every minute I can get.   2) My hair does feel noticeably healthier/softer/fuller than when I use a regular hair dryer, which is huge.     The negatives are:  1) It&#x27;s really expensive.  2) It doesn&#x27;t come with a diffuser, which for this price, is really annoying. (and the T3 tourmaline diffuser is $30!)  3) It&#x27;s only slightly less noisy than normal hair dryers.    Would I buy this again?  I can afford it and it does make my hair feel better, so I BARELY say yes, but if I was tight on money, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying it.  For the money, I&#x27;d buy a good, but less expensive model - I&#x27;m confident that the difference in the quality of the blowout would be barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> We bought the T3 after seeing a morning news program in which a guest boasted of the wonderful performance.  My wife has lots of thick hair and we were hoping to cut a few minutes off the daily drying ritual.  The t3 feels well made, a strong blower and nice heat controls, but to be honest, no one has the sense that the Tourmaline leads to significant time savings or more managable hair.  I expect the dryer will be around for years- at its price- and the best unique feature to extend life is a panel that lifts off the back, allowing for easy cleaning of dust that accumulates in any dryer.  Would we buy it again at this price, probably not...but it is a nice product with some nice features.</li>
            <li> This seems like a lot of money for a hair dryer, but my daughter is very happy with it.  The ceramic ions make all the difference in the world.</li>
            <li> Well, I have to say that so far I am in like with this product, but I am hoping that as soon as I learn how to use it a little better, I will be in love.  I received this product for a Christmas gift and used it right away...I immediately noticed how fast it dried my hair and called my husband in to check it out.  I definately need to use a round broush to style, but I didn&#x27;t get and hot and as tired as I usually do when blow drying.  Usually after blowdrying I use a straightening iron....I would LOVe to drop this step, so I am going to see if I can perfect my drying methods...I agree with the others, however that the on/off switch is in a bad spot and I kept turning the dryer on and off while styling...that is why I am only giving it 4 stars..</li>
            <li> this blow dryer is awesome . . . makes my hair look like it does when I leave the salon!</li>
